But reading up on mental disorders like ADD, anxiety disorders, depression, aspergers, mood disorders, social phobia, and etc i feel like i can relate to a lot of things.

1,"It doesn't make sense. When I lived at home, it was quite rough. My family is broken and completely messed up, I won't go into details but trust me they're fucked.

Every day, I forced myself to get through it and I did. I was so strong thinking back, I went into work on days I got thrown out of my house with a smile on my face. My motto was ""if you don't laugh, you'll cry"". I could honestly face anything. I knew I'd be away from it all soon.

Now I am. I finally moved in with my boyfriend 3 years ago. We have good jobs, make decent money and our relationship is perfect. So why can't I stop thinking about killing myself? How tf did I get so close to doing it too? 

I've lost myself. I hate myself so much. I seriously struggle to even  talk to people I've known for years. Wtf happened to me? Why now, when I should be the happiest? What's the point of living when I can't enjoy the best point of my life?

Sorry for the long post, I'm just really wanting to understand what's going on. Ik I should see a professional, I've tried but I keep backing out last minute. I want to just try understand myself a little better first.

2,I tried therapy like a yr ago or so and only went one time. Did not click with the therapist and just gave up. I want to try therapy for real this time.

3,I have no idea what to do. All I remember from my father during my childhood was watching the 1982 version of The Thing. I do not have any loving memories of either of my parents. I just sat and waited for attention throughout the years. but it was never given. All I can do now in sulk in my own miserable existence that I am currently living until I can buy a condo in the bronx. I have no friends. And no loving encouragement from either of my parents. I have no memories that I can look back on besides when we went to water parks. I have nobody who loves me. Nobody to hold me close. I was abused as a child and I still feel the pain as an adult. My mother lies to people about what she does for me and hides it from me and I can't take it anymore. ,17Nov2018,1

I want to sit him down with him (just me and him) and ask if everythings okay, but I'm not sure if that's the right way of doing things. Is it right to ask like that? How can I help him out? What kind of things should I say/avoid? How can I show him that I'm really listening and do really care?

My brother has been briefly committed to a mental health hospital and is due to be released this upcoming Monday. The problem is I'm not quite sure where he can go.

He recently turned 18, but he is still in high school. He was staying with his biological father, who is no longer willing to house him. Staying with our mother is a non option, as she seems to be the root for a lot of his mental issues. And as much as I would like to take care of him, I don't really have the money to do so and after learning about some of his violent tendencies, I'm scared to keep him around my fiance and pet. 

We don't have any other family for him to stay with, so I really don't know what his options are. If anyone has any advice, please comment here or feel free to DM me.

I'm on the brink of insanity, I'm just giving up at this point I'm nearly about to let them do whatever they want me to. but I can't bring myself to kill another person. Right now one is telling me to stop this another is telling me to continue, I can't deal with it, it's hurting me, it's killing me. I'm thinking about just killing myself right before I truly let go of reality, which I'm already losing, I'm not sure if I said it before, but I'm seeing things, faces, people, objects, all of which aren't there.

13,"this is a crosspost from r/jobs but figured i’d find more valuable guidance here 

idk if anyone else has this problem (and it certainly doesn’t just apply to job interviews lmao) but whenever i’m interviewing for a job my personality switches to being more of a suck up, being more enthusiastic, extroverted, outgoing, talkative, saying things i don’t mean, pretending to be something i’m not, laughing at things that aren’t funny, etc etc

essentially pretty normal nervous “i need this job” behavior, but it completely fucks me over when i actually have the job and my true colors start showing and my real personality comes out. I wish i was able to just present myself as i actually am during job interviews because it would save me a lot of pain down the road.

i just fucking hate how i completely become something i’m not and it fucks with my psyche. the thing is i’m really good at interviews lmao and i get jobs really easily, but it’s unfortunate for my growth as person. i sound so fucking whiny but 

i’m obviously a sensitive person so a small change in environment/my life and i have a hard time sticking to my guns and just remembering i’m a valid person with the personality i have. i’m also aware that my real personality isn’t exactly “job interview” material, but at the same time i don’t give a fuck and just want people to accept not everyone has the enthusiastic type a personality they want (even if as an employer i understand why those personality types are valued)

After a 2-week holiday I've spent the whole week in the office and doing house work, but I've been feeling increasingly irritated by everything and every social interaction was bloody awkward (always my fault).  
I think I nearly had a meltdown today as I started feeling I didn't want to be at work, or anywhere, I just felt I couldn't deal with the world, with people, with my life. Not suicidal, but irritatingly existential and I wanted to lock myself in the toilets and cry. My irritation was such, I felt I was about to snap and just yell at people. And then felt deeply sorry for being so blunt to a cashier; I was frustrated with my choice of meal, I almost cried cause my kiwi was not ripe!  
And my head felt heavy, and my forehead felt like falling over my eyes. And I sat at the office canteen and felt physical vertigo of the thought of getting up and going back to my desk.

I can’t take it anymore. 

During the day I make conscious decisions to do them then or put them off, and I’m okay with them. Everything seems okay, I’m highly aware of what needs to be sorted and that’s it. 

But I can’t handle the nights. I just can’t. I wake up in panic thinking about everything that I did wrong and everything I still need to do or catch up to, battering myself with stupid questions like 

“Why haven’t you called to check up on the thing?”
“Why haven’t you paid that and the other?”
“Why are you not sorting this and that out yet?”

And it’s always on days I can’t do anything on because they’re shut or out of work hours or a Sunday or god knows why they’re not working but sometimes they just DON’T

All the while I scream at myself “You idiot what am I supposed to do about that at 2am on a Saturday?!”

I make lists and I have too many notebooks and everything is organized neatly and sorted and for my head it’s not enough. It’s still not enough. I don’t know what to do to calm that panic. I don’t know anymore. I’m so tired.

17,"I was always the type of person to avoid the health benefits offered by the VA because despite what happened to me in combat I never felt traumatized. I knew there were plenty of other people out there who needed it more than I did. I've always been emotionally strong and logically minded, so I always worked through the tough times with ease.

Last night my girlfriend broke up with me. I won't go into all the details about our relationship because they're actually not relevant. The point is that she did it in a way that she knew would hurt me, and she said things she knew would hurt me, and she did it to make me angry. She wanted me to be angry because that makes it easier on her. But she didn't know how deep she was cutting and for the first time in my life I don't think I'm going to be okay.

She suffers from a lot of anxiety because she lost her mother when she was young. She avoids attachments with people because she worries about losing them. Which leads to her being 21 years old and never having a boyfriend. Never even dating once. She made an exception for me because there was something special. There's a lot of things between us that make it seem like we're not compatible, and that worries her. But despite all of that we were doing so well. Every time she got worried about something we'd talk about it and she's realize how trivial those concerns were.

But she warned me that every so often her anxiety gets the best of her and she begins a scorched earth campaign to remove attachments that she feels are overwhelming. She hit that low point and she didn't tell me because she knew I'd cheer her up. She kept it inside and it festered, and then she broke up with me. She did it without warning and over text message because she knew it would make me mad. She wants me to be mad so she can just say it's over and walk away. She talked to her friends ahead of telling me so they'd pat her on the back and say it was okay. That's what friends usually do, they don't offer unbiased advice you need to hear, they tell you whatever you want is okay and they'll support you. Even when what you want is wrong.

She knew just what to say and how to say it. She cut me deeper than anyone ever has before. I have never been in this much pain and I feel really lost. I talked to my grandpa today because he's always been a mentor for me. He and I both agreed that contacting the VA mental health office was a good idea. I talked to a counselor today and it felt good, but it was weird to go into the office and not need to talk about combat. I needed to talk about a girl. I'm not used to feeling like this and I'm not sure when I'll feel okay again. I've got so much resting on my shoulders right now and I'm scared that I won't be okay for a long time.

I'm not sure why I'm even writing this. Maybe I just need to get some things off my chest. I'll be totally honest, I hope this isn't the end. I hope she wants to make this work. But right now she is in a dark place, and she hurt me enough to put me in a dark place for the first time in my life. I can't trust her not to hurt me again, even though I know she only did it because she needed me to lash out at her. She lied about why just to anger me and it didn't work. It broke me. The thought that someone who cares that much about you and knows everything about you, and then weaponizes that against you to make it easier on them. That hurt me so much.

It feels very silly, and defeatist, but the idea of going back to a place where people know when I’ve made a mistake terrifies me. I’d rather run away from everyone than be seen as someone who makes basic mistakes.

It revolves around work and my desire to not go. I've lost 3 jobs in the past two Years. Two of them in past 6 months.

I'll try to explain the feelings without making the post too long. Basically my brain will use ANY excuse to try and convince me to not go to work. If there are no excuses I'll lie. The lies are more like half-truths modified to my needs. Like my ex wife had cancer last year so I'll spin that so it's happening now and I need to take care of our kids. Stuff like that.

I also have BPPV so even the slightest vertigo is enough for my brain to say ""don't go to work."" It's a daily struggle to get up and go to work. It doesn't matter if I like my job or not. I actually really like my current job (I just got it after being out of work for almost 6 months) but I have already missed 1.5 days. Only been there 3 weeks.

I lied about something that happened several months ago and just twisted it to make it so it's happening now. I even cried when talking to my boss. They gave me excused absences so my performance must have been good.

I feel like some kind of sociopath. But that doesn't stop my brain from trying again. Telling me I should squeeze one more day out of this lie. I can't explain how HARD it is for me to force myself out of the door and into my vehicle.

I don't know how to make it stop. I have tried. I can't talk to my family or friends about it because it's embarrassing. Something must be wrong with me is what my brain says. Your family won't understand. Your friends will leave.

This is just kinda a vent about how I feel so sorry if things sound a little dramatic because I’m probably just overplaying this in my head. I’d say the biggest things I’ve been feeling for the better part of a year is this overwhelming loneliness, feeling like I don’t know who I am, I feel like I have no emotions like a robot. I have no friends, I used to have a lot and I would generally be considered the life of the party. I used to really have fun sometimes and be considered cool but whenever Im not doing that it doesn’t feel real at all, it feels like some sort of act I do. That doesn’t matter so much now as I can’t seem to connect with anyone, I used to have no problems making friends but now I can’t even talk to a person, it just feel like I’m faking my personality and nothing I ever do feels genuine to me. These days Im either at home, school, or at work and I just can’t bring myself to talk to anyone. All my friends are gone and I’ve got no one but my family now. I care about them but I’ve never felt close or super emotionally connected to any of them (I’m sort of emotionally walled off from my mom and dad but I don’t know why, I just don’t understand them at all), for that reason I’ve never really shared any of my feelings with anyone in my family and when I have told them some things it feels like an act or like I’m trying to get them to pity me. I also feel this really weird sense of claustrophobia, like I’m trapped wherever I am and I can’t escape that feeling. I just feel so alone. I have these dark thoughts of killing myself in horrible gruesome ways but I don’t think I’m depressed because they never seem appealing to me they just pop into my head and I try to forget them. This is mainly a vent but I’d take some advice, should I be worried or does this kind of thing happen when you make big transitions in life?",17Nov2018,1

37," This is going to be my first time going to a therapist, and I'm wondering what is usually the general etiquette for what you can and can't talk about with them. I'm mainly asking about love life because for some reason I just feel like that might come up at come point lol. For example, theres this guy that I have a crush on whose been my friend for a while and has been invading my thoughts a lot recently, and I was just thinking about what would happen if that came up. Idk, it just seems like one of those things you don't really talk about, kind of like talking to your parents about your love life. I could just be totally wrong, like I said, I've never gone to a therapist. It actually seems like it would be nice to have a therapist's perspective on this kind of thing, but I don't want to bring it up or mention it if it would be weird. ",17Nov2018,1

39,"Hi all.  25 yr old female here.  I am experiencing some mental health issues that are starting to get out of control.  I am currently waiting on my student medical insurance to come through, at which point I plan on seeing a doctor for a legitimate diagnosis.  In the meantime, I'm hoping someone on this sub can give me some insight into what is going on in my head.

A little background:  I was diagnosed with anxiety / depression as a young teen and prescribed Lexapro (I rarely, if ever, took the drug so I'm not sure if it would have helped).  From a very young age I have had an awareness of a darkness that seemed to ""live"" with me.  I have always been quite morbid, cynical, and strange - but otherwise have enjoyed my life and have been able to maintain relationships.  This has changed in the past year and is getting worse by the day...

My sensitivity is profound.  I ricochet back and forth between deep despair, self doubt, and sadness to furious anger, then back to ""fine""... sometimes within a matter of minutes.  I have read about bipolar disorder and it mentions frequently a ""euphoria"" - I don't ever feel that.  I do however get excited and obsessive over random things - ex: a political happening will consume my day and I spend hours on twitter or reading articles, interrupting my job or studies to  OBSESS over something that I have no effect on.  It makes me feel important and connected to life because lately, I cannot connect with people...

Everyone is strange.  I am detached.  I feel like an alien on a different planet, I know they don't think the way I do.  I have cut off most friends and my romantic interest is sick of me.  My anger is uncontrollable.  I have intense rage blackouts where I say horrible things, hit things, hit myself.  Over nothing!  Its like I'm having an out of body experience, watching someone else take control of my body.  When I ""come back"" down to normal I am exhausted (emotionally) and I'm not necessarily always sorry for the way I acted because it doesn't feel like me who did it.

Lastly, and perhaps the most important, are the intrusive thoughts.  Loud, aggressive thoughts (not voices) reminding me of all my failures, planting ideas in my head, telling me my boyfriends cheating, people are laughing at me, I'm embarrassing, I'm a deadbeat, etc.  Its got so bad I've begun to talk back to myself.  I find myself telling myself to ""Shh"" or ""Shut up"" OUT LOUD (my mother asked me who I was ""shushing"" the other day, I had not even realized I was doing it).  I've also started to hit myself in the head to stop the thoughts.  They are the worst / loudest when I am about to go to sleep.  I think, ""you should kill myself""... but these don't feel like my thoughts, I would never kill myself!  

Why is this happening?  Why do I feel like someone else has control over my thoughts, emotions, etc?  Is there medication for this?  Is it just anxiety induced?  Is it a disorder?  Any tips or ideas will be greatly appreciated. ",17Nov2018,1
40,"Just started as a little pet peeve but it’s gone to the point it made my boyfriend who has actual mental illness, feel worse than before. Its some page full of depressing posts like “Nobody cares about me. I’m always the first to say hi” or “if I killed myself  everyone would be better off” “I wish someone out there cared about me” (One of the pages are named Depression Quotes) 

My boyfriend is ACTUALLY diagnosed and he’s got a lot of vices. Hes seeing a therapist but none of his habits are completely gone yet. He said it’s unfair but he doesn’t give a shit. I have some people on my list that post “lol just had a panic attack wanna die” PUBLICLY, they get so many positive responses from their friends yet they still continue sharing the depressing shit and guilting their friends?? 
I confronted one of them and they dared to tell me my boyfriend does not have depression or ptsd if he’s never posting about it. HELLO HES TRYING TO GET HIS SHIT TOGETHER NOT SITTING IN UR MOMS BASEMENT SHARING THESE FAKE POSTS?? He’s very reclusive about it and has never shared any edgy shit about his drug addiction or overdoses or anything related to his illness. He has overdosed  once in the past but he never posts “lol im in the hospital for od” 
I just don’t understand, there are young people like him who actually need help and attention, don’t sit around whining on social media, yet the ones getting help and attention are the whiny little bitches? ",17Nov2018,1

42,"The amount of self advocacy needed to even get the right treatment is fucking ridiculous. Even just getting a proper diagnosis is an uphill battle. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety for years, but I had so many other symptoms that weren't explained by my depression or anxiety, and it was making my life fucking miserable because I wasn't getting any treatment for anything other than depression and anxiety. I felt completely hopeless because I was seeing a therapist who I was being completely honest with and taking my medication, but I still felt fucking horrible. I felt like I was doing everything I was supposed to do to get better but none of it was working. This made me extremely suicidal and my therapist ended up having me committed. I honestly though that I'd finally get a proper diagnosis there, but instead I got discharged the next day. Then my therapist referred me to an intensive outpatient program. At first I hated being there because it brought up a bunch of past trauma and that made me feel even more suicidal. It was at this point that I finally confronted my therapist during our next appointment and told her that I'm pretty sure I have something other than just depression and anxiety. I told her that I thought I had PTSD, and I told her about the flashbacks and the intense nightmares that I've been having for years, and I finally got an official diagnosis. It felt like a relief to finally have what I had been going through validated, but at the same time I felt angry because I had talked about these things in the past and nothing came of it. But whatever relief I felt was pretty short lived once I realized that I still had other symptoms that couldn't be explained by my diagnosis, and this realization made me feel hopeless again, because just when I thought that I had finally found the missing pice to my puzzle, I find out that I was missing more than just one pice. I don't even know why, but I decided to talk to the therapist at my uni and tell him about having been diagnosed with PTSD, and he asked me some questions and I said that I had been going to an intensive outpatient program 10 hours a week. He said that it was strange that I had been referred to one at the time when I had been diagnosed with only depression and anxiety. He mentioned that they're usually for people with personality disorders, and at that point I was just very confused. Since I was seeing my psychiatrist the next day I decided to bring this up, and she ended up testing me for borderline personality disorder and it turned out I had it. She then sent out an application for me for a DBT group to go to once I finished the intensive outpatient program. I sobbed because of how scared I was of this diagnosis, but the more she described it, the more sense it made that I actually had it. Getting properly diagnosed felt like I finally had a full explanation for all the horrible things I'd been feeling for years, and I could finally get the proper treatment I needed to actually get better. I just hate that I had to go through all of this just to get diagnosed correctly so that I could finally get treatment that would actually help me. ",17Nov2018,1

Most hoarders simply claim the issue ‘isn’t that bad’ or negate reality entirely claiming the issue isn’t there. Obviously this is a lack of accountability.

I understand they have an extreme emotional attachment to objects, but are either doing one of the following:
* Either they’re negating reality willingly by claiming the issue isn’t that bad to avoid facing it.
* They’re unwillingly negating reality as they do not know their actions affect others so negatively or they do not know their mental illness affects them.

Either they’re aware of the issue, or they aren’t.

Regardless of whether they’re aware, they need to be accountable for their actions, anyone does for that matter.",17Nov2018,1

51,"My good friend and I hang out most Fridays and Saturday nights but last Halloween something was bothering him.  I just thought he didn't want to drink and party, not a big deal.  However, I couldn't get it out of him what was wrong, except that he mentioned a co-worker at his office/manufacturing technician job had committed suicide.  

&amp;#x200B;

The next night we went out and he was still a little off.  I was hoping he'd open up after a couple beers (we had plenty) and although he was upset and I tried to listen, he tossed out vague statements implicating his job and pretty much every single person he knows.  He definitely implied that his company could have been responsible for the co-worker's death.  But he also implied that for some reason I might be in cahoots with this company, which has no basis in reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I know he's not just upset with me because he hung out with a mutual friend and was saying a lot of the same stuff to her, including that he was concerned that his company was tracking his car's speed through his company laptop.  Again, there is no reason to suspect this from a company that manufactures arcade games.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that most concerns me is how fast the onset was.  He was fine his entire life up to the weekend before, then literally on Halloween everyone is out to get him.  He's also sent me numerous backhanded and cryptic messages such as, ""We can hang out Saturday...if you're not complicit.""  

&amp;#x200B;

On Sunday after Halloween we had the following exchange:

Him:  We need to talk.

Me:  Wanna come over tonight?

Him:  No. You should come over.

Me:  What's it about?

Him:  If you can't don't worry about it.

Me:  ...I was up all night, just woke up...I don't mind talking man but you gotta stop being so evasive.  I've been trying to figure out what's bothering you for three days and still have no idea.  

Him:  Then don't worry about it, have a nice day.

Me:  Well I am worried about it, but since you were evasive on Friday, evasive on Saturday, and are being evasive now, it makes me think you're still not ready to actually talk about this.  

Him:  How many times did you set me up?  I count 3

Me:  Set you up for what?

Him:  Listen.  Enjoy your day.

Me:  \*\*called, no answer\*\*  Your mailbox is full.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided not to do much for the week as I thought stress coulda triggered it.  He also lives with his mom and brother so I figured anything else alarming they'd pick up on too.  As best I can tell he's going to the gym, going to work, working on the truck, and playing XBox like he normally does.  We also had a normal-ish exchange last weekend, but this weekend he texted:

Me:  Doing anything?

Him:  Playing Space Invaders

\*\*two hours later, no other texts\*\*

Him:  Sellout

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the questions:

1.  What's your opinion?
2. Could this be stress related / trauma due to the co-worker's death?
3. Could he have been exposed to something while working on his truck?  He keeps a lot of auto parts in his room.
4. What should I do?
5. I'm worried that talking to his mom and brother would give credence to the idea that everyone is working against him.  Should I do that?  Should I tell him I'm doing that?",17Nov2018,1
52," I am kind of weird. I understand that. I don't talk much and my looks don't help. People in general, I feel treat me differently. I will walk by on a side walk and I can see people look at me with discomfort. And I was walking home from my bus stop, and this girl switched to the other side of the road on to the other sidewalk, which she normally doesn't do just because I was behind her walking on the same sidewalk. This already makes me feel terrible. Hell, my friends treat me differently. They talk to me like they don't want to hurt my feelings. I feel pretty socially isolated sometimes. The only sentient things I feel can understand me are my family including my pets and some of my friends who understand I am just akward.

After that, she seemed to talk to me weird. She would talk to me like I am five or something. She says stuff like ""Yay! You are trying!"" and it makes me feel stupid. She also tried to ""stand up for me"" when my friends were joking about a word I messed up on. I laughed along with them. She felt the need to say something like ""At least he was trying! It was so cool!"" infront of the whole class. Again, made me feel terrible even though her intentions were good.  

 I don't where this whole praising me for trying thing came from. Maybe it was from me last year not turning in my work because I messed up my sleep schedual and feeling tired, and my social akwardness making it hard to make friends, which in turn might be a cause of my depression which my doctor has diagnosed me with.

From time to time (weeks or months, considering how anxious I feel), I'll have this feeling that I've just done something awful. I don't know what it is but I just know that I've ruined it. I try to be rational and try to see were I could have potentially failed and try to follow the ''it's okay to make mistakes'' logic. 

I'm either nor successful at find a cause or it causes too much pain because anything can be the cause and I feel overwhelmed.

I go considerable length to satisfy the expectations put on me, from pushing myself out of the comfort zone to causing myself significant suffering or putting myself in danger just to avoid being a disappointment to others. Yet sometimes I'm weak and I feel like I'm at my limits, so I need a break before... I break? My brain feels like it's going to catch fire from all the contradicting opinions and feelings.

I’ve been known to struggle in the past aswell and have seen multiple therapists. So, a few months ago aswell I met this girl. She meant the world to me, and it turns out she thought the same of me. We starting dating and it was absolutely amazing. I may have been struggling with my mental health but she really helped with this void within me. She was one of the few things keeping me happy and from having a breakdown. Well, a couple weeks ago I received a text from her. She said she couldn’t handle a relationship right now and was so sorry. I lost it. I had the worst panic attack of my life, there was so many tears. I ended up sitting with my dad and crying. That one thing that kept me happy is now gone and I’m still devastated. I fell into an even deeper depression and missed two weeks of school. I was able to see a psychiatrist and get diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and have been prescribed Lexapro. I’m seeing my therapist again as well.  But it hurts so much because I still see my ex at school, I had to change some of my classes so I would see her less. I’m in such a rough spot in my life and this hasn’t helped at all. Luckily I have incredibly supportive friends and family but I’m still in so much pain. I’m looking for some advice or maybe even words of encouragement, please.

63,"So like the title says: I forgot to take my pill yesterday.

I’ve been on Prozac for about 5 weeks now and if there was any doubt about how much it’s helped me - that’s gone now. I was in a rush in the morning because I had to get to campus to do the 6:30am physical on my assigned horse and must have thought I took it in all of my hustling. Anyway, most of the day was fine until I started to notice my mood was a bit more off than usual. I could feel myself overthinking things more and I was feeling a bit irritable. That’s when I thought back and realized I forgot to take my pill.

After that I don’t know if it was a placebo type effect but I just really felt like I wasn’t my normal self. I went out to a bar/restaurant with a bunch of friends where I had soda while they all drank and it was fun at first. That was until they were all talking loudly, the people around us were talking loudly, there was music playing, and there were TV screens everywhere. I started getting super uncomfortable and absolutely overwhelmed by all of it. I ended up going outside to reorient myself but ended up deciding to leave with my friend. When we got back to my apartment, all I wanted to do was to curl up into a ball and shut the whole world out, which I did for a little bit while my friend tried to comfort me. Luckily she eventually got me out of my mood and the rest of the night was fine.

I can see now how much progress I’ve made between therapy, taking Prozac, and not drinking. The feeling of regressing emotionally to who I was before was absolutely awful. I never want to experience that again and if that means staying on Prozac for the rest of my life then that’s absolutely fine. Even if it was partly placebo effect, which it didn’t feel that way to me in the moment, it taught me a valuable lesson.",17Nov2018,1

67,"This is mainly to vent, there isn't much advice I could get that I don't know already. This is about UK healthcare. My main issues are Generalised Anxiety, Social Phobia, Agoraphobia, OCD.



I've been dealing with issues my whole life but only just reached out for help this year. My doctors (I have 2) have been great. I lied a bit when they asked me about self harm and self medication with alcohol. but it's because I didn't want them to focuse on those things. I've tried several medications. Citalopram, Sertraline, Mirtazapine. They did nothing to help, or if they did I didn't notice. I've been at my lowest for a while, and thought I couldn't get worse, but the side effects of the medication made me much worse. Putting on weight fast (Mirtazapine), insane lethargy (Citalopram). They were crazy, so I came off the medication. But I get ahead of myself.



January 2018 when i first started seeing my doctor, he told me I should self refer to a charity organisation called Healthy Minds. I couldn't do it, I really struggle with that stuff. He was understanding. But come May 2018 I'd finally reached the right time and I did it. I had an assessment at my doctors surgery (Across the road from me, which I do not take for granted, it makes it much easier to get out to the doctor) with a woman from the Healthy Minds organisation. It lasted about 90 minutes in a 30 minute appointment, so I can't fault her for spending time to try and understand me. But I felt i couldn't voice my problems properly, for example she asked why I don't like going outside and I kept saying because I hate people. But it wasn't that, it's that I can't be around them because it sets off all these triggers, I feel uncomfortable, I'm hyper aware of everyone. Even typing it here I can't communicate it well, but I just kept telling her I hate people, and I know she didn't understand me. She said something that really closed me off to her. ""You can make eye contact so it can't be that bad, I have people in here that can't even look at me"". This really really annoyed me, but I'm the type of person where when I'm in a social interaction, I'm doing anything to get out of it. I'm not paying much attention to what I'm saying or being told, I just want my end goal of it being over and I can go home. So it wasn't until after I left that I started going over the conversation in my head and really getting annoyed at what she said.



Anyway fast forward to August 2018, I get a letter for an appointment with them at 9am in September. Well I suffer from insomnia, have done for a long time, and it's impossible for me to be up early unless I stay up the entire night. I'll be tossing and turning in bed from 1am until 6am, fall asleep, wake up an hour later, fall asleep, and repeat until 11am/midday. So I ask my doctor what to do, he said email them (I really struggle to do phone calls because of my anxiety). 



At this time I was also taking medication which gave me the most horrible side effects, worsening my insomnia, lethargy. Honestly they were just awful and those around me said they noticed how bad it got once I started taking meds. And I really would not advocate taking meds from my own experience. Worst decision I made, most horrible 4 months I'd had.



So I emailed them, and I explained my situation (bear in mind, I had waited 4 months to get this appointment for a further month away, 5 months total) and asked if I could have an afternoon appointment, and also if we could reschedule for October because of the meds I don't feel I could get to their office, I couldn't even do it on the best of days. I said if this results in closing my record, please let me know so we can work something out. Well a week later I get a letter. ""Since you no longer require our services, we have closed your record"". i was furious, upset, it sent me over the edge and I actually cut myself for the first time in a while. I just remember bawling until 6am while my cat comforted me. 



I complained to my doctor and she (My second doctor, she's wonderful and I've since taken her full time cause my first one let me down, I'll explain more at the bottom) asked if I wanted to be referred to the Mental Health Community Team. She offered me this before, but I'd just started the medication and she said I should wait until I see what effect it has. I accepted her help, and she referred me.



Less than a week after she referred me, I received a phone call. It was one of my better days, so I was able to answer. (I find it easier to answer calls, than make them) It was a guy who said he was between my doctors surgery and the MHCT and he just needed to get some information to know exactly where to refer me to. So he asks me questions, and I'm giving him answers. Two times in the conversation I tell him I have really bad insomnia, can you request an afternoon appointment for me. He assures me he can. September I get a letter for an appointment November (6th I think). They have given me an appointment at 8:30am and their office is an hour and a half walk from my house. I should probably explain here that I've never been able to go out without someone with me. I've been very fortunate to have my best friend since school go everywhere with me. I've been claiming welfare since I left school, so mainly it was just him walking me to the job centre every 2 weeks. I wish I could have sought help earlier, but my family are poor, we're crippled by debt and the only reason I dragged myself to that hell hole every fortnight was to be able to give all my money to my mom. I was scared of seeking help earlier because my mindset was ""This is horrible, but it's once a fortnight and I don't want to end up losing my money"". My wake up call was my friend being diagnosed with IBS and having his own issues meaning he could no longer always be there for me. So that's when I knew it was time to seek help. So I'm now juggling the fact I can't sleep, and my friend isn't always available for me. Makes it hard to do stuff outside.



My doctor had advised me that if I had issues, don't contact them myself, wait to see him so I don't end up rocking the boat. So I made an appointment to see him, waited, went in and he said ""Phone them up and tell them you can't do it"" I reminded him I can't do phone calls. ""Ok email them, if they don't reply then get my assistant to phone them on your behalf"". That was nice of him. but he also told me he wanted to put it all on them now (The MHCT) and that the ball was in their court and he didn't want to be involved. So that's why I stopped seeing him. I should also say, this doctor put me on medication and then made an appointment to see me a month later. No one kept an eye on me, no one did a test or anything to see how I was before taking the meds so they could see any progress made. He gave me meds, sent me home and a month later said ""Has anything changed"".



Anyway, I email the MHCT and they reply saying they forwarded it to the team working on my case. Wonderful. That was like 2 weeks before my appointment. It gets to the day before my appointment, November 5th, and I get a phone call, I can't answer it. No one was here to answer it. They leave a message ""Its about your appointment tomorrow, call me back on ____"". This was at 5pm. An hour before their offices close, the day before my appointment that I'd already cancelled. So I send an email saying what happened, and reminding them I couldn't do the appointment and cancelled it weeks ago. I get a reply the next day ""Be assured, I forwarded your last email, and I will forward this one"". I stated in both emails I sent, that I need an afternoon appointment.



Well I get a letter today, which prompted me to make this post to vent. I have a new appointment with them, January 6th, AT 8:30 IN THE MORNING. What the hell??? Why are they not listening to me. I feel so ignored and it's fucking killing me. These are mental health professionals, that seem to not care what they're doing to me. 10 years I kept it all inside because of the stigma when it comes to mental health. Always saying ""i'm just a worrier. It will pass"". And then when I finally reach out for help, I just regret it. I keep getting messed around these are people I then have to trust to help me, I have to be vulnerable with them. I can't cope. And it's absolutely killing me that someone who is meant to listen, is refusing to listen before I even get to their office.",17Nov2018,1
68,"I enjoy the good things in life quite a bit, (food, video games, cars, girls, friends, etc) but honestly when I way the pros and cons of living I don’t find it worth it.

They are thinking about laying people off at my work soon and I may very well be one of those people who get laid off (I’m one of the newest people). If I do get laid off I just don’t feel like going out and finding a new job and learning a new job.

69,"Sorry if this post is jumbled, I haven’t been awake long. I’m in North Carolina. My brother is 25 and lives with my parents. He’s never had a girlfriend and has dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I’ve remembered. He’s very prone to lashing out in anger and accusing people of turning against him (even me and we don’t speak). 
Not long ago he asked my dad to lock his guns in his closet because he was scared of hurting himself.  He says he’s constantly fighting voices in his head. I’m scared to ask him if he needs help because I don’t want him to lash out or hurt me, but he tells my mom he’s fine.

Today he told my mom that he needs his guns. He says that there is a bear and that he needs them for protection. Only this bear, he says, is in his DREAM.  He swears there is a bear trying to attack him. 

My mom is at a total loss on how to help him. He’s getting worse. He saw a psychiatrist a couple of years ago but that didn’t help.

70,"I blocked her about 4 months ago. Moved out from her about 9 months ago. All of our business is settled, and I figured she'd be out of my life by now. 

A friend showed me a few text messages. Apparently this friend has a friend who started talking with this ex of mine. She said some pretty bad things about me. Something about me being manipulative, and having a habbit of ""Stealing other men's girlfriends"". 

I ain't gonna contact her and scold her for it. She's not worth the effort. For all intents and purposes, she's just a memory by now, and I prefer to keep her that way, or forgetting she ever existed. 

Our relationship was strained. Mental health issues from both sides, both of us having a history of strained family relations and destructive relationships, I figured we'd have enough understanding for each other to work out. Sadly, we got into each others way all the time, and eventually it got too much, and I left a complete wreck. 

A breakup is never easy, and it gets all the more difficult when I had nowhere to go except back to my parents place. We were both short on money, which was a constant stress in our lives, and all things combined, I don't blame her for the problems that erupted. 

But it turns out, she blames me. Not only that, she goes around telling people that I'm pathologically, irredeemably malicious. We're talking about the woman who kept me awake until 4 in the morning, scolding me for not being able to get a boner and pleasure her, just because I was having flashbacks to when I was sexually abused in my teenage years. I had reached a state of mind where when I thought of her, I could honestly look at our relationship and see it as nobody's fault, and just a set of poorly made choices that were regrettable, but not made out of malice.

I'm not sure I can see it that way anymore. I was fine with thinking she had moved on just the way I had. When people have mentioned her, I haven't talked ill of her, but when people mentions me, she apparently tells them I'm the devil incarnate. 

I just don't know how to handle this. I don't want to be consumed by hate for this person I haven't even interacted with or even thought of in months. That'd be a waste of time. But short of breaking a window and reopening the wounds on the outside of my forearms, I really have no idea how to handle this storm of negative emotions. 

Any tips? 

I might add that I am diagnosed with Borderline, so in medical terms, strong emotional reactions are amplified to extreme levels in my psyche, rendering impulsive behaviors and self-harm tendencies common methods of ""Hotfix"" solutions to blunt the peak of emotional outburst. I've been sober for almost a year, my physical self harm tendencies have gradually become much easier to handle in the past 9 months, and I have a more stable social life now than before, but this... This might be more than I can handle without colapsing back into the more destructive tendencies that I thought I'd left behind. ",17Nov2018,1
71,"I've(19,f) struggled with anxiety since I was a little girl.

Something I always found crazy, is that I remember every single panic attack I've ever had. I remember being maybe 5 or 6, and the thought of my mom dying would send me into a spiral. Another episode, I was trying to get ready for school, and I couldn't fit my shirt on right and it was really right, and I remember the agony I felt over it. 

I've also always struggled with school. Or, commitment in general. I dropped out when I was 15, went back to an alternative school at 16, and dropped out again at 18. My attendance was always spotty when I did go. 

I believe my upbringing wasnt terrible, but I know I was exposed to a lot of stuff that a young girl shouldn't be exposed to. I used to go to my cousins house house often, there I would be exposed to crude shows, there were young girls there who would play ""house"" with me, and they'd force me to kiss them and cuddle/touch each other. I was 7 at the time. 

My mom gave me mostly everything I needed, but she wasnt really there for the support. The first time I clearly remember her betraying my trust, I confided in her about my first boyfriend at 12yrs old. I made her promise not to tell anyone because I wasnt comfortable, but she ended up telling her friends and my family. I know it's silly, but I never forgot that and I hadn't confided in her for years after that. Fast forward to 18yrs old, I got pregnant and decided to terminate. I told her, hoping to get some advice because I felt so lost. Again, told her not to tell anybody, and again, she told my entire family. It hurt. 

4 years ago she got married and suddenly became an alcoholic. I have 3 other siblings, and she started neglecting us. She would party all night with her husband, I would go to the washroom and she would be sitting on the floor totally ditzed. I walked in on her giving her husband a blowjob in the living room. I ended up moving out at 16 because of this. 

She died a week ago. Complications with her Gastric Bypass Surgery and the binge drinking for 4 years straight. 

My mom and I weren't close for a long time, but still. I dont have a dad. My siblings all had other dads and families they went to. And now there's just me.

I'm just not sure what to do at this point. I've never been able to fully commit to anything, I'm wildly irresponsible, I'm incredibly shy, I feel like I can't form meaningful relationships. I feel like I've been repeating the same bad behaviour since I was young, and I'm starting to feel like I'm damaged beyond repair. I'm failing to see any future for myself, and I cant find a reason to live anymore.

Recently we had a serious conversation where she basically said that she'd fallen out of love with me completely out of nowhere, as I thought we were in our best phase for a while and it's hit me really hard. I don't have the best relationship with my parents (I still live at home) and my Dad says he doesn't want me to see my college counsellor because he thinks the authorities might be called because he's hit me quite a few times and I've threatened to call the police before and he has quite a high ranking job. I don't have any money so I can't pay for another counsellor. I've also tried getting help before and it's never really helped and I just feel like I'm trapped, now more than ever.

I just don't have a clue why someone beautiful &amp; smart would want to be with an absolute mental trash compactor.

I could be totally wrong because my anxiety is very very bad and could make me believe there’s something worse wrong with me. I can’t tell up from down anymore.

He thinks he is even better than great achievers, only reason he hasn't achieved such things is because he doesn't want to]. He kinda cannot take insults.

Now having this aside, when our highschool ended and our college started, he went to a different city, and we didn't meet each other much. For 1 semester he was okay.... We would talk on phone, he seemed to be normal. But somewhere during the second semester, he started to lose his shit. I cannot even understand what is wrong with him and pinpoint specifics. But in general, he started to believe that everyone he meets is secretly planning together to control his life.ie. nothing is coincidental, everything to the minor detail has been planned, and he is so obsessed with this idea. This has become his reality. He dropped out of college due to this and has been at home for 1 year without doing anything. 

Initially I tried my best to be supportive, and thought he was just depressed and would get back on track again. But no. He went so deep into this idea. I try to explain to him how absurd his ideas are, but he now believes that someone has been brainwashing me (and even my dad for some reason). Also I got a girlfriend in college, I was single before that. He thinks I'm lying to him about that. 

It started to mentally affect me, so I stopped all communications with him. His ideas started to mess me up a lil bit. So I haven't spoken with him for 6 months. Today he called me. I thought there would have been some change but no. He is still deep in that shit.

80,"Hi everyone, I don't think this will be triggering but just in case

I was diagnosed with GAD about two years ago, and my new counselor and I have been on the fence whether I actually do have GAD (also depression, but that's irrelevant right now) or if I'm just in a shitty situation, and not actually struggling with a mental illness.

anyways, I'm having trouble breathing right now, so I guess I should breath. 

I just realized that I don't have to pursue a stem degree. I mean, I kind of really want to, because I enjoy math, and it'd make my parents happy, but I can't really handle the workload of college. My religion school didn't teach science, and I am having a really hard time with chem and bio. I started with 14 hours, but had to drop chem, which I need anyways for my degree plan. 

I really love art. I always get told my ideas are creative. people come up to me in class or in the hallways or even at the public library to say that they like my art (god knows why, I think it's total crap, but whatever). I'd love to pursue art and photography, and be less stressed. I'm not a good teacher. I try to be, and some of my friends say I am, but I'm not happy teaching.  I'm taking an art class this semester, and I'm really going to miss my art friends. 

  
I'm procrastinating on my stats homework, because my professor stresses me out. he's not a bad teacher, I'm just trans and he keeps dead naming me, so I have to go outside of his class sometimes and recollect, which makes me feel bad because now if my classmates didn't know I was trans, they do now. Im afraid on of them is going to harass me about it, but they haven't yet, so I think it'll be fine.  My stats professor was once my high school professor and we were good friends until I came out, and now he doesn't want to speak speak to me really.

I was initially going to describe why I'm feeling anxious RIGHT NOW but it seems all this other stuff is coming to mind.

When my mom got home yesterday, she was in a panic. Not about me this time, but a few years ago, she'd yell at me almost every day, and tell me about how id go to hell. Yesterday she came home rushing and slamming doors, and I nearly lost my shit in front of some of my friends. This happens all the time. One time in class there was a loud noise and I jumped out of my seat and couldn't breath.  Thankfully, I'm good at putting my feelings aside to comfort her, because if not I think things would have been more emotion-y and god, am I bad with those.

It’s been 5 years and between then and now voices in my head have gotten progressively worse. I do still use drugs from time to time as I study chemical engineering (stressful) and feel that they help me relax sometimes. I know this is not the best as it is advised not to do them but I’m not here for a lecture.
The voice is usually a girl’s but can sometimes be a group and is most clear when another noise is happening in the background. When I’m in the shower is when I can hear them the most but sometimes I can’t tell if I’m just interpreting the sound as a voice or if it’s actually there. The voices are there all the time and it feels very real, sometimes I feel like I’ve been possessed or something.
Even when I’ve not used drugs for months they are still there and they say mixed things about me. Sometimes they’re so horrible and other times very oddly sexual, I feel like I’m loosing my mind as the years go on. Plus university makes me 10x worse anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's fair to say that I have treatment resistant depression. See previous posts to get an idea of what I mean- [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/k1w38/iwtl_to_rid_myself_of_this_cocktail_of_mild/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ifq2y/book_recommendations_for_someone_feeling_very/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/qmmfm/i_need_advice_regarding_college_and_pursuing_a/) . Over the last 10 years I have been to 3 different psychiatrists, tried 5 different antidepressants, been to more therapists than I can remember and tried meditation too many times. Between these and my fruitless efforts to change who I am, my habits and my lifestyle bringing me back to square one every single time, I have well and truly lost hope and my heart can't take investing myself in another empty endeavour to change what I have accepted is not going anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think my brain is broken beyond all repair and as past efforts to change have been useless, I have lost all confidence in my ability to do anything. I guess what I am saying is that despite all the help that I have sought, the only person who is capable of improving this situation is me and I do not possess the capability to incorporate lasting and meaningful change in my life. This has been proven time and time again. In all endeavours to try and improve my career prospects, my social anxiety, my depression and feeling sad every day, I haven't made much headway in 10 years so it's time to start something.

&amp;#x200B;

I could go into a little bit more detail about why I feel the way that I do but I'm not really looking for help with those sorts of things. I've been ineffective in trying to alleviate the extent to which these make me feel sad to the point of wanting to kill myself. Shortly, no confidence in myself and problematic social anxiety; everywhere I work I end up getting treated poorly like a self-fulfilling prophesy. College, jobs, etc.... everything I have tried to accomplish I end up failing because I cannot summon an ounce of belief in myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want not to be alive anymore as my waking experience of the world is 85% psychological pain and shame sourcing from the way that my broken brain experiences the world- the input is my sensory experience and thought, the function is the way my brain is working and the output is me feeling miserable about myself, my life and prospects to the point of not wanting to be alive anymore. I think about and idealise this all the time.  The psychological pain is deep and agonising. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm asking what the alternatives are to stopping my brain experiencing the world that are not suicide. Ideally, I would be able to kill myself but there are too many people whose lives my suicide would absolutely ruin and that's not something I could bring myself to do. So my thinking is: if suicide would be 'selfish' on my part but these people don't have to deal with my waking experience that makes me want to die, then in the same way that I am compromising by not killing myself, they should agree that I can take some other drastic measure that would be a medium between being alive and hopelessly depressed and suicidal to being in some sort of catatonic state in which my brain doesn't cause the same problems. Does something like this exist? Some sort of procedure that would silence by brain experiencing the world so as to stop me feeling sad all the time?

&amp;#x200B;

I would say that there maybe have been times in the last 10 years where I haven't wanted to die - a 1.5 year stretch was probably the longest. But the problem is is that life was not particularly 'good' or wholesome. I was not happy with my life and direction even though I was not idealising suicide every waking hour. All it made me was complacent. My bad habits were still there and attempts to improve were met half-heartedly. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the only times I enjoy my experience is when I go out drinking with friends. It is realistically the only time I do not feel boring and self-conscious; pure escapism and not a meaningful source of happiness. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: I have given effectively given up and want to die because of the way that my brain makes me feel. Cannot bring my suicide upon my friends and family. What alternatives do I have to turn off my brain?**

84,"She had asked me the same thing about my grandmother on three different ocassions.

This is my story: My grandma moved to my house when her husband died. There she lived with us until she died two years ago. My mother inherited her old house that is in a ""dangerous neighborhood"". Becouse the place isn't safe, my mother and aunt sleep there every other day. 

The thing is none of that bothers me. My mother, even when she is home barely pays atention to me so i dont care that she sleeps half of the days in another house. 

I guess my question is, is it normal for a theraphyist to ask multiple times about a specific theme or memory? In my opinion she seemed to have forgotten about our previous session, but maybe its a specific subject that she thinks i have repressed smth?

Also she sometimes laughs at some of the things i say. Last thusday i told her that when i was a child i used to be very volatile and impatient (which is the opposite of what i am now) and she laughed. Are these normal actions from a theraphyst?",17Nov2018,1
85,"I am a bit at a loss in what to do with my mental health, and I am not the best to make a decicion on that lol, so while I am not going to let the internet decide what to do, I want some input.

As of now I am on a waiting list to see a therapist/psyc, I was in treatment weekly after I had a suicide attempt 18ish months ago. So i have been weekly for that long, but stopped going in sept due to moving, and the new place put me on a waiting list that essentially just said ""by january31st"" they need to offer me a spot somewhere. That is almost 5 months without treatment and I am already feeling it pretty badly.

They know I have moderate depression, but I did not tell my prev psyc that I have audible hallucinations (voices, doorbells and footsteps). Lately I have also started having visible hallucinations as well, but I am aware that it's fake so I don't worry too much.  Last night however I self harmed for the first time. It's nothing big, but I scratched off a decent chunk of the top layer skin of my neck so that is raw - and kinda really visible. I have an appointment with my GP next week for something unrelated, but I can tell him it's getting worse and if he can do a status check om the queve if I can sneak ahead a bit. But I don't want to sound impatient or whiny, but don't want to tell too much either and make them think it's a big deal.  I dunno what I am looking for,  just needed to write this down, and if anyone know how to be taken serious - without being taken hospitalisation serious that'd be neat to hear!

86,"My ex and I broke up about 3 months ago, but I'm unable to move on. I still feel as heartbroken now as I did then and it's suffocating me. I'm starting to feel quite depressed.  


She messaged me about a month ago saying that she wanted to try again. I offered to meet her at a cafe to talk, but the night before she bailed. I rescheduled for a few days later and then she bailed ten minutes before. At that point I was tired of her games, but I was still curious as to what she wanted to say. We agreed to meet at hers for a chat (her idea) and when I got there we talked, fell in love again, kissed, and agreed to meet the next day to talk some more and start rebuilding our trust. The next day she just ghosted me and then broke up again. I felt like such an idiot and my heartbreak returned again. I told her to delete my number so that she couldn't text me any more and then blocked her.  


My heartbreak still isn't gone though. I feel myself getting more and more depressed every day. After I haven't seen her for a while I start to feel great, but then I have to share a lesson with her at college and it hits me again like a ton of bricks. This week she tried starting a conversation when the room was empty and I didn't know what to say so I didn't. Just her talking to me was painful enough.  


It's reaching the point now where I feel myself slipping further and further. I'm losing my ambition, I don't find enjoyment in the things I used to. I'm not as chatty, and I'm feeling fatigued. I know that if I didn't see her anymore I would be much happier, but there is no negotiating my lessons with my teachers. I don't know how I can do another 8 months of this. It is agonizing, and I'm starting to become very bitter. My birthday is coming up in a few weeks and I really just want to be happy then.  


Our relationship was such a massive part of my life for the last year that I still can't quite accept that it is over in my head. I just want to get away but I can't. Why is this so bad? What can I do to try and get through this until I leave for University? ",17Nov2018,1

88,"hi. to start with, ive been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. i was on medication for a while but it just made me feel awful, so i stopped taking it months ago. however, i think i have have Intermittent explosive disorder? i fit most of the criteria for it, and i don’t know if i’ve been having meltdowns/tantrums because of it? 
today is a good example. this morning, i’ve been weepy. i woke up at 4 am, couldn’t fall asleep, and i’ve been crying most of today. i exploded on my mom, full meltdown, because we were talking about my current therapist, my mental state, etc. eventually, i don’t remember what even triggered it, i snapped. i was screaming and yelling, i threw my phone, i cried, i threatened physical harm on my mom and even said i never want to talk to her again. of course i don’t mean any of that. even as i was saying all this kind of stuff to her, i felt wrong, because i didn’t want to upset or anything, and i still feel rotten.
i was supposed to show up to work 2 hours ago, but i just said fuck it and didn’t. i don’t care to graduate high school, i don’t care about loosing my job, i don’t care about anything.
i’ve been doing impulsive stuff (like not going to work today) for a while. i don’t know what’s wrong with me. sometimes i feel like i have literally no emotion or feeling left in me, but other days i feel fucking hopeless. 
honestly, at this point in the post i don’t even know what i’m going on about. i haven’t eaten in over 24 hours, and i’m exhausted, so thank you very much if you managed to make it through that wall of text. 
tl;dr- i continue making bad choices that affect my loved ones and myself, but i don’t feel anything as i’m doing them, like i have no control over what i’m saying or doing.

89,"33/200 lbs, no medication (was on Lexapro for several years, tapered off slowly under the supervision of a doctor. Got off Lexapro earlier this year)
To preface this, I've had two ongoing problems over the past several years - panic disorder, health anxiety, GAD, and OCD.
Additionally, I've had problems with binge drinking over several years. The frequency of my drinking has gone down significantly over the years. I want to be sober.
13 days ago I drank 15 beers between 1:00 PM and 10:30 PM. I ordered food, watched a movie, chatted with a friend, and went to bed. My chat log with my friend, even though I was blacked out, was coherent.
The next morning I woke up with a hangover, obviously, but also mental anguish - even though I had committed myself to sobriety earlier this year, and after all I've been through with alcohol, I couldn't stop myself from buying that beer at the store. I felt an incredible amount of anguish and stress at this time. I kept asking myself, after everything I've been through, how could I do this?
Ever since then I've had a variety of negative and disturbing symptoms. Over the weeks, it started with intense depressive symptoms, to panic (which brought me to an ER), to intense brain fog, to feeling disconnected.
Throughout, I've had physical anxiety symptoms (knot in my stomach, no appetite).
I'm really scared, guys.
I feel like the ""life"" has been sucked out of me. I feel like I don't care about anything anymore, whereas before I cared immensely about my career and desire to move up in the world. Before this happened to me, I had drive.
I know you might say ""woah, too much information..."" but I'm adding this because it may be relevant in figuring out what is happening to me - I have zero sex drive. I just don't feel that rush feeling anymore when watching porn. I did just a couple weeks ago before this happened.
My head feels ""tired"", but I can't relax. I feel like I blew a fuse. I feel dull, like I've been hit in the head with a bat. The brain fog was so intense days ago that I couldn't concentrate at work. I had trouble conversing with people, with finding words. This is absolutely terrifying me.
In your guys opinion, what happened to me? I've already been to a doctor and have been told by numerous commenters in other threads that 15 beers over that span of time could not cause brain damage. I do have intense health anxiety, and I've been to a neurologist earlier this year who performed numerous tests and said I don't have brain damage.
Could 15 beers have caused brain damage this time?
Or was it the mental anguish of not being able to prevent an alcohol binge that caused a nervous breakdown that I haven't recovered from? Are my neurotransmitters, hormones, etc., just all messed up right now, and will they correct themselves?
I think it goes without saying that I'm not drinking, and hoping my brain is healing day by day.
I can't stand feeling this way, and was wondering if anybody would offer any insight into what happened to my brain, why I'm feeling this way, and how I can get back to the way I was before November 3rd.",17Nov2018,1

93,"I am. I go to ""therapy"" (read fkn psychiatric NURSE) where I never seem to be able to get anything done or say anything because I without fail go into this mode where I am extremely ""normal"", even though 99% of the time I feel like there's just something fucking going on in my head that just doesn't feel normal but I also just constantly feel like I'm faking shit up so I can delude myself into thinking that my life hasn't been the best and that people should somehow take the time out of their mind to feel ""sorry"" for me. Not to mention I couldn't even mention most of the stuff that goes on with me because it'd fuck me over with respect to other stuff that's going on in my life. The moment I walk into the nurse's room and start talking, everything just disappears and the only things that come out of me are the things that I've always been doing. Just talking with my friends and doing normal things. My mind just goes on autopilot whenever I go there.

I just don't know, seriously. 2 weeks ago I went into this weird ass mode after a long while of not going into it. I got into making amateur porn (again) and a lot of people loved it and I did weird ass shit and got a pretty big following in a short amount of time but I deleted all that because I didn't want to be a rolemodel for some freaks and there were people who were honest to god trying to groom me despite me being fucking 20 so it just got too creepy. I occasionally slept like every 2 days during that period for like 5-6 hours at a time. Now I'm back to barely taking care of myself and sleeping a huge amount and being repulsed by my body and I hate it so much. Now I just.. want to feel ""normal"" I want to be able to be loved I just want to have someone love me and just be normal with them. I want to have a normal everything. I don't want my body to be a fucking horrible disgusting mess I want to be able to just be normal and have a normal romantic/sex life.

And then there's this weird sexual thing I have. Like, right now, like many many times before, I just hate the idea of sex. I fucking hate the fact humans are a sexual species and I just hate the fact sex exists and how it evolved. Like how SEX evolved and how fucking SEXUAL DIMORPHISM evolved, it just feels so wrong and disgusting. I just can't explain it and it's driving me insane. It's so weird too because of that hypersexual period that ended just a few days ago. And like, if I'm not in the mode where I just despise sexuality and at (maybe) worst honest to god BLAME (what the FUCK is wrong with me) one of my friends for being attracted to women I'm just crazy sexually. I mean, crazy in the way that I want my sexual life to just be... wrong (me being kinda ""victim"". consensually ofc but you know, ""CNC"") in some way. As in I want my sexual life to be just... idk, weird. I don't even know how to explain it.

And then there's my interpersonal relationships. I start off so normal and ""nice"" and a lot of times ""really interesting"" and all but I just inevitably start getting pissy and yelly and I just text in all caps about how I despise someone/something at like 2 AM. I always expect people to give me answers as to who I am. ""What is wrong with me?"" ""WHO AM I?"" Just like I'm doing here. I'm actually doing this because my friend told me it'd be a good idea to do this and get shit off my chest and just have this shit out there. I just don't know... I expect so much from people too. I expect them to be like gods in terms of knowing who I am, and when they can't tell me who I am I get irrationally angry. It's unfair to them.

Also, I have been assessed by a psychiatric team with a psychologist and all that read in my patient files was shit like ""impulsiveness"" which idk if it even fits me even though last night I was really close to start using drugs again, ""mood swings"" which might be true, ""fear of abandonment"" which I think is true because I always keep checking if people have unfriended me on apps and stuff and some cryptic stuff about ""attachments provoke emotional response"" I have no idea how to translate and I'm not even sure what that means. Also ""passive-dependent"" features, dunno what that means. Oh yeah and stuff about ""low sense of responsibility"" like what the FUCK DOES THAT MEAN? But yeah, like, no formal mental health diagnosis. Just ""take this olanzapine to prevent psychosis"" which I've since stopped taking like half a year ago because it did literally nothing for me (Except I gained weight and it was disgusting, I'm glad I'm back to my good weight again) and I have 0 psychotic symptoms anyway. Nothing. Essentially I'm normal. Am I actually normal? Admittedly it was a bad fucking time to do the psychiatric assessment because I was literally just starting to recover from the mental ordeal I had just went through before that. I'm meant to have a second assessment around the the start of next year anyway to measure my ""recovery"".

Also, why did I get a multi-disciplinary team assessing my head? (trigger warning just in case regarding CSA (even though it wasnt real)) Well I had a pretty intense psychotic episode after I moved out to live on my own which is entirely its own topic but to put it shortly there was a lot of fucked up false memory stuff about my dad molesting me repeatedly when I was really little. I think that's the key part. I spent 3 months in psych wards over that experience. But yeah all those false memories were instantly labeled as me literally being insane by my family and my dad's side of ""family"" etc. And it's not like it could have ever happened anyway imo, even less so in the really fucked crazy way my mind played some of it out lol.

This false memory stuff also fucks me up too because every once a while, like once a month or so I just keep going into this fucking ""mode"" where I ruminate over that shit and just keep thinking about it how it relates to how my dad was actually like and what he did and all (He died when I was 8). And it just SUCKS because since my mind is tainted by my psychosis induced false memories, the memories I have which I feel like are real have zero value. It's not like the real memories have any abuse stuff related to them, just weird at most. And there's also the thing how those false memories I have and how they relate to my ""abnormal"" or aversive or delayed/stunted behaviour/development as a kid. As if those false memories explain all that and it pisses me off so bad because the only thing I have that explains that are those false memories I have. It's just so tiring to think that I was just really weird as a little kid and I had these weird aversions and certain delays/regressions and stuff. Hell, it would even somewhat explain the fact that I never cried for a single bit when he died really nicely. But that's probably explained better by the fact that I was just 8 at the time and I never *really* got to spend too much time with him, I think. But yeah it all just feels like a mystery that's actually plain in sight and I'm just overanalysing the fuck out of everything like I've always done.

Maybe this is the wrong place for this. Maybe I'm just pissing everyone off with this but I just needed a place to just get this out there. I'm so tired of annoying the shit out of my friends with all the SHIT that I ""think"" I'm ""dealing"" with when I'm probably just a big ass fucking case of malignant Munchausen's.",17Nov2018,1

Her panic comes (and is associated) with darkness and nighttime so it's impossible to avoid it. She does take lorazepam at night for this, which she hates to do and feels like she's addicted (but the panic is overwhelming without it). The self-harm is really strange because we are in our late 40's and she has never done this her entire life. She has had all of her hormones checked and other than some low vitamin D and iron (which she has under control now), everything is normal.

I/we are a little bit desperate and hopeless at this point that things aren't going to improve. Please can anyone suggest, books, podcasts, YouTube videos or channels that might help especially with panic.  We have the DARE book which I think is great, but it hasn't helped her.

102,"I have 2 kids and am married to the complete love of my life. But I’ve struggled with anxiety since I was 16. My mother was quite emotionally abusive. Ever since I’ve had my kids and the husband has went on several deployments/detachments (he’s now back for a pretty long time) we’re mil to mil, I’ve felt like I’ve been turning down a destructive path just like my mother. I would never treat my kids how she treated my sister and I. But I wake up in the middle of the night screaming crying, I have a constant fear that when I leave for work my house will catch on fire, I always have a fear of my husband leaving me, I break down crying if 2 people are trying to talk to me at once because i feel like I’m not talking to one long enough, Etc. I’ve tried medicine, I’ve tried doctors, therapists, etc. Nothing seems to be working. I feel as if I’m a downer to be around now. Nobody really knows what my next mood will be. I’ll just zone out. My moods can change in the split of an eye. If anybody has any tips to help, please give them. ",17Nov2018,1

105,"I feel as though I have a very unusual connection to my deceased great grandpa that was only around for the first 5 years of my life and I’m not to sure why.... I think I might have an idea why but it seems weird that I don’t have a bigger connection to my “parents” or someone else. When I was young, I was taken in by my grandparents because my parents were unable to take care of me. Because of this and because my grandparents both had busy jobs, they were never home and I would spend the day at my great grandparents house where my uncle and aunt lived with them to take care of them. A lot of my very early life consisted of me and my great grandpa bonding up until the age of 5 when he passed away. We would always be with each other, we would watch tv, he would play with me, and push me around on his walker when he went for a walk outside. To this day I feel that even though he’s gone, I somewhat idolize him and have an urge to make him of all people proud of me, I feel the need to be as he was and do the things he did (specifically join the military to make him proud because he was a WW2 soldier and took great pride in it and wanted his kids and grandkids to be tough as he was). I just don’t know why I feel soooo attached to my great grandpa, i mean I only was with him for 5 years of my life before he passed away, does thing kind of attachment affect the brain at a young age or is this normal? I would be interested to hear your guys’ opinions and I don’t know if this is even the right place to post this but I just do know where would be. I posted it in here because I don’t know if maybe this could be a symptom of a mental illness or something?",17Nov2018,1
106,"Hey everyone, I'm really depressed in college right now because of some mental stuff I have going on, and I'm really worried about seeing the college's therapist because I'm worried my issues are really weird and crazy, and they won't be able to help me / will just think I'm a psycho. I've been wanting to go for so long, and I just haven't been able to build up the courage, plus I'm really worried about opening up about that side of me to another person.

With all of this said, though, these mental issues are pushing me further and further into depression, and I just feel stuck. Can anyone on here that is willing please comment so I could message them basically what's going on with me and if they could let me know whether my worries of opening up about it to a therapist are dumb? Please, I'm in a really bad place right now and being able to go to someone through an anonymous reddit message could possibly be what I need to get through this.

107,"Okay I'm bad at explaining here so I have a real hard time getting medicine handled microphone is extremely handy for explaining this because promising if I typed it this wouldn't have worked but. So I am disabled and schizophrenic. Diagnosed multiple times over the years since I was 20

J have a really hard time with antipsychotics and side effects as a whole multiple antipsychotics I have been on have given me seizures or other reasons to go into the ER.
-
Either the side effects give me seizures or it's always something on the severe Spectrum I have always been this way since I was a kid even over-the-counter stuff with super iffy the medicines that don't give me seizures just aren't even as efficient I might as well not be taking anything honestly.
-
I've been told by my GP and my current psychiatrist that people have issues with medicine that they can't handle medicines due to the side effects or they can't handle the medicines because the medicine itself  just stops working after a while.
I got a lot of horror stories under my belt and a lot of stories but basically I'm always under the impression that people think I'm lying about medicines and stuff but I also have a lot of stories under my belt that I vouch and like the idea of it it's just greatly upsetting that nothing helps to.

110,"I was diagnosed and treated with anorexia by the time I was 13. When I was 17 I stopped the treatment. When I was 19 I had my son and my body image since then has been a constant nagging pain for me after becoming overweight. This year has been one hell of a ride for me with anxiety and whatnot too. 

Since May I have lost close to 55 lbs. I haven’t changed my lifestyle or anything though and didn’t intentionally diet or workout to lose the weight. I didn’t even think about how I lost the weight I was just too happy about losing those numbers on the scale. I’m now just under the weight I was before I had my son which is supposed to be my healthy size. 

Yesterday was my sons 2nd birthday and I made a ton of food for the party. After the party was over, people started complimenting me on how good the food was and that’s when I realized I didn’t even know what it tasted like since I didn’t eat anything and then I started thinking when was the last time I did eat and realized it was going on 4 days ago. 

The thing I’m confused about is when I was diagnosed with an eating disorder I was obsessing about food and counting calories non stop. I haven’t done any of those. I just don’t eat, it’s like I tell myself I’m not hungry and my body just agrees and goes with it. I don’t experience hunger pains that should remind me to eat, it’s like I have lost intuitive eating. Now I’m thinking about it though and I do recognize that it’s like I naturally reward myself when I don’t eat, like oh cool I look extra thin today so now I can wear that cute crop top and go drink a couple beers with some friends and somehow I naturally have an excuse to not eat when I go visit family or friends even though I hadn’t eaten prior to the visit. 
I’m sorry this post is confusing even for me but I just don’t know if this is a relapse because it’s not me obsessing about food. It’s just me telling myself I don’t need to eat and it just works. It’s almost too easy to just not eat and me being a single mom makes it even easier since I’m constantly busy. Also I don’t know if this is the same for anyone else but my mind tells me I don’t have a problem because I’m not scarily underweight like when I was initially treated for anorexia. 

Any opinions on what the hell this could be? Or maybe this is just another health issue I’m unaware of. ",17Nov2018,1

113,"There are more days where I wish I was dead than alive. And I can't stress enough how much I just want to end this boredom &amp; unnecessary pain. Sadly I know what happens if I kill myself. And it's what happens that keeps me from ending myself. I must keep dying on the inside until death takes me fully. I must suffer this agony, I have no choice. I was born unwillingly and will die unwillingly, but gladly. 

""Just take another pill"" I tell myself. ""It will help you"" Yeah sure taking that pill will make me feel something, but that's because I'm just a whole different person when im on it. I'm 16, I turn 17 in 18 days. ""How come a young teen should go through this"" I ask myself. 

""Just kill them"" I tell myself. ""Choke them to death. Strangle them and watch the light fade from their eyes"" Sure that means I dont have to listen to my 6 year old brother whine, and my 14 year old brother ever talk with his stupid voice again, but at what cost. I lose my freedom, the satisfaction wont last long enough. ""How come a young teen should think like this"" I ask myself. 

""The funniest people are most often the saddest"" I personally think this is false. Everyone is sad, even when you are having the best time of your life, somewhere in the back of your mind you're sad because you know the fun you're having will come to an end. The saddest, more often then not, are the ones that end up failing in life and becoming nothing. 

""The funniest people are often the most empty &amp; hollow"" Is what I believe in. Nothing but a mere void they try to fill with the easiest and most rewarding things they can achieve, a sense of welcome and a sense of being wanted by other people, to which they use humor to gain. Humor becomes natural to them, it becomes their language, their everyday life. They look at the world through humor. They are the ones who aren't suicidal but would rather be dead. The ones that see the world for what it really is but learn soon enough that there isn't much they can do to help. Sadly enough, they are ones that grow up too fast. ""But why must a young teen live like this"" I ask myself.",17Nov2018,1

115,"For example, I just had a full blow “I need to go sit in the shower for an hour” breakdown because my boss changed my hours for the week without asking first. For most people I feel like this would just irk them a bit and they would be able to move on, but for me, i know I’m going to be crying over this for days. And this happens with every minor inconvenience, and it’s out of my control. My roommates don’t wipe down the stove after they cook? I have a meltdown and deep clean the whole apartment for hours. Spilled water all over my bed? Scream and cry and skip class for the day. 

It’s like this for every mildly bad thing that happens to me. I’m awful at coping with anything. My anxiety and depression make me an awful person to deal with, live with, and have a relationship with.

117,"Trying to help out those who need whenever an opportunity arrises feels like it takes a lot out of me at times. I have been struggling with mental illness for a bit over 15 years now, at a rather big personal cost. I feel behind in life, uneasy and undeserving of life at times. While I am not dealing with such a phase at the moment, I know that when I do I just shut off and deprive myself of chances to get better. 

It is during these phases like now, when I can be constructive that I try to help people I come across whenever I can. Perhaps out of a faint disillusion that if I would've accepted help before a lot of depressive episodes would have been avoided. Maybe out of belief that by helping others I could help myself in the long run... Or there is a chance that it is just in my nature.

118,"The last few months has been a huge punch in the face and I just want it to go away.

My bottled up mental health problems have sucked for around 3-4 years, but I started getting these panic/anxiety(?) attacks back in May. Since they they have been on and off. They started of only being before or during social situations, now they are random and during times when I’m experiencing sensory overload (I’ve got autism). I’m even getting scared of feeling the physical symptoms even if it isn’t linked to a panic attack. I accidentally blurted this stuff out to a college friend (previous post) and I’m still overthinking about that, despite nothing bad happening involving the situation.

I also have a younger sister who has bullied/abused me for years. Recently something happened and she was in a way evicted from our house and is living with a relative. I feel bad for her and feel like I could have done something to stop the situation. Why do I feel sorry for the person who constantly reminded me about everything I hate about myself? I act natural and keep more stuff secret because I want to make home life as normal as possible for my parents and brother. They are all processing the situation differently and my problems would make things worse.

I’m 21, and I feel like when I smoke weed I feel mentally different, and in a good way, I appreciate my family, I appreciate all the hard work my mom puts into me and my brother, As a big brother I want to educate my younger brother and teach him things, play with him, be a good brother to him, I work really hard and try invest in myself, I’m motivated to get in shape, learn, be a good son, appreciate what my family had given me. 
I become someone who I want to be, I feel like me on weed is the real me, I can think straight and I’m just clear headed.

I feel sleepy a lot too, I sleep 8 hours and tired as hell, on weekends I sleep 12-14 hours...

Idk why I sometimes get this feeling but it makes me feel like breaking and killing, even though I know I don't want to hurt anybody, the feeling will come on suddenly and takes a while to go away because no matter what I do I dont feel satisfied or relaxed, like I just need to burn myself out or get tired and at some point it stops but its never like a relieved or relaxed break from the tension. This will happen even when Im just relaxing at home, like I just want someone to give me a reason to beat them to death even though normally I dont feel that way. Its not even graphic or complex thoughtwise its just an impulse to swing, pound, or stomp on someone or something, I dont even feel like its the thoughts its like the same feeling after getting punched in the head its just blind anger and aggression. I feel like I need to be away from people when I feel like this, Im able to talk about it, its just that even if Im aware of it it still happens and I dont know what causes it. My therapist says its alot of repressed anger but I dont even know what to do about that, normally if I exercise vigorously until Im exhausted it goes away, or if I punch the shit out of something, but sometimes it just makes me feel even more angry and frustrated that my body is slowing down and weakening.

I just want to remove myself from everything, but my family would murder me. They'd be so disappointed in me. I feel so weak. I can't do this anymore.

Oh, getting a good job will make me happy. Oh, getting an amazing boyfriend will make me happy. Nothing helps, and I know that it's because I have to make myself happy, not wait for anything else.
