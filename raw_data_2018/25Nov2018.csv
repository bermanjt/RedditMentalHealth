0,"Hi. Im 17 years old and Im a senior in high school. This is a bit of a rant because Im just trying to organize my own thoughts, so sorry if its messy.

There will be days, sometimes weeks, where I will feel miserable, have no energy to get out of bed or even brush my hair. I have never felt suicidal, but have had desires to “just not exist” for awhile, and come back like nothing happened almost. I lose desire to talk to people, do anything I enjoy, etc. Sometimes its so bad I cant even turn on the TV. Ill cry for no reason or the smallest thing will set me off. Other times Ill just lay in bed, not really feeling anything. I dont feel sad, happy, anything. Its like Im just there. I have no energy to do anything. Most times Ill come home from school and go straight to bed. 

Besides the sad spells I get, the rest of my emotions are pretty tame. I feel happy, angry, etc. but rarely to a greater extent than being content or a little frustrated. Its very rare that Im shaking with excitement or I feel so unbelievably pissed off at someone or something that I cant even think straight (which I guess is a good thing?) but it still makes me feel almost robotic in a way. This is with every emotion, excluding sadness. 

I just got accepted into my first choice college with a scholarship thatll cover ~half of my total costs. Youd think someone who just got this news would be ecstatic, but I felt pretty good for an hour or so then just felt normal.

A few weeks ago, my grandma was brought by ambulance to the hospital for a suspected heart attack. (Shes okay) She lives far away, and since my mom was a mess and doesnt like to drive, she asked me to drive her to the hospital. I was eerily calm. Like, I knew there was the possibility that she could not make it and for some reason, I felt almost entirely fine. I have a pretty close relationship with my grandma too. I dont know if it was an adrenaline rush or what, but I find it concerning.

I have so much going for me. I have an awesome boyfriend, good grades, a bright future ahead of me, loving parents, and a few close friends that I know care about me. I feel like I am generally well liked by my peers, and avoid drama and “beef” at all costs. 

I have some negatives too, of course. I have a decent amount of physical health problems, which Im sure to some degree could be aiding in the way I feel mentally. I suffer from chronic migraines, and have issues with my knees and back that cause me a lot of pain and limit my ability to do certain things. I also have a lack of female friends, as just about every friend I have is male. A lot of it is due to my interests, like technology, video games, etc. but my best girl friend and I got in a massive fight about a year ago and havent talked since. Having guy friends as a girl is great most of the time, but I do miss having girls to talk to. 

There are rare occasions when good emotions break through my “numbness” barrier. Ill reach out to a few friends and catch up, make plans with friends, etc. Ill feel genuine joy and all of that good stuff. Often, within hours, that fades. Sometimes its actually almost overwhelming, since Im so used to not feeling like that. 

Im sorry if that was hard to comprehend or anything, but I feel a little better getting it off my chest. Does anyone have advice for me? Ive been considering asking my parents to talk to a therapist (they have asked me if I wanted to go since theyve noticed my down-ness recently), but the thought of talking to a physical person about all of this and the possibility of being put on medicine is overwhelming. Im also just a super indecisive person in general so I havent been able to come to a conclusion on asking to see someone in months. 

Im not asking for a diagnosis, but does anyone have an idea what could be causing this? Depression does run in my family and I have a feeling that could at least be part of it, but does anyone have any other ideas? If I do decide to go to a therapist, I just dont want to be blindsided and told I have some rare disorder with absolutely no cure or treatment.

2,"So I have a friend that I knew back in high school who is kind of worrying me. We aren't very close anymore, I feel like she needs some help that she clearly is not getting. 

Long story short a few years ago she told me about how she is involved some sort of secret celebrity affair/working with certain celebrities. Now, a couple years later, she has become distant from all of her friends, posts online a lot about being stalked by said group of celebrities and that her every  move is constantly being watched. After a few times of me asking if everything is ok or if she wants to talk I get nothing. 

My question is....the whole distorted reality, and the constant talking about being watched or people stalking her (she even tapes up all of her old phone's and device's cameras because they are live streaming her) is this schizophrenia?

I feel like she  needs some help, but I don't even know where to start when a) I don't know exactly what  is going on, and b) she doesn't want to talk

4,"Hi folks,

I've decided already that I wanted to talk to you about understanding mental health from the position of someone almost killed it.  Knife, strangled, hostage. Dead.  Oh and photographed while it happened.

This is a story that starts negative in it's first few posts, but ends positively; not just for me but for anyone concerned.  We all got better!  Crazy is not automatically bad.  Mental Health is not bad.  Suicidal thoughts are not bad.  Understanding conditions is great!   

My message will take a few weeks though before we hit the good things.  Spoiler - both parties get on well these days.

&amp;#x200B;

I have scars on the right side of my body from lighters.  I also have doors in my flat with gashes down each one of them from a knife.  I've gone through two TV's, rebuilt my kitchen twice, various stains across floors in all rooms.  I've carpet burns on my floor and, before I threw them away, an assortment of crockery and other things.  Sexually I don't like to play any acts that are dominent for fear of being called a rapist the day after.  My eye twitches with anxiety if my girlfriend says she will come by 'at some point'.  I used to cry uncontrollably after a few drinks - Damn that was embarrassing lol!

The ambulance stand by the door these days (or did) and I have been invited by the police for interview, before being given paperwork on being the recipient of domestic abuse.  My neighbours used to hate me as a man, the police once stopped me from entering my house for fear of what I might do to my partner, and I, personally hated myself and tried to fend off my friends very well-meaning help about what to do.   For four years.  I'm 33 now.

&amp;#x200B;

Note that I said earlier, 'before I threw them away'.  She asked me to leave her property one day many months ago after I said, without mentally thinking about, it, ""I hate you.  I hate everything about you and I hate everything you have done to me"".

That was actually the 5th or 6th time i'd said something like that, but the earlier ones were met with from her 'I'm going to destroy everything you ever knew'. Ouch!  Anyway, let's crack on because i'm in a great relationship now! :D

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a relationship for 4 years, 2-3 of which I was trying to get out of.  I think this reddit has a fairly good idea of the sort of problems people have when trying to remove themselves from a relationship, so I'm going to skip that.

I asked my partner to go to the doctors.  I asked my partner to go on meds.  Think about that for a moment - it's already at a combat stage, if a man/woman is asking someone not just to go to the doctor but saying what they want them to go on medication.  That is not acceptable, and to be frank, it is not acceptable for one part of the relationship to insist on another to go on medication.  The setting is beginning to come clear.  We were both in the red.

I'm a well educated adult with a low income job.  I love my job.  I grew up in the country and had a fairly normal life before heading to university/college and getting a great degree at the end.  All good.  Standard stuff.  

I met this girl at a bar.  I saw her on her own and decided to have chat, because I can lean towards extrovert after only one drink!  I'm pretty chatty otherwise but this lady had tattoos down her shoulder and front, wherea I had none.  In fact on paper we were polar opposite.  Anyhow, she seemed nice enough which is what counts, and so eventually we got into a relationship.  I thought nothing of being partner to someone without a job and whome I thought would get a job one day, maybe this year, the next or so on.  It didn't really matter as long as there was a continual improvement.  I didn't stress this, I knew she knew.  In fact, this person had attended some of the most prestigious places in the world.  London school of ballet for one...she knew her stuff on an intellectual and emotional level.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\[KEY POINT\]\*

She had been abused fairly consistantly since the day she came into this earth.  Sexual abuse, an awful system whereby her natural mother had 51% decision on her hospitality i.e. if she was with a family she could be pulled out at any point - and she was.  She was sexually abused and never developed parts of her brain we take as granted, resulting in attachment issues.  Poor lady.  Sound terrible doesn't it, lets face it!

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2 after this paragraph:

After 4 years of emotional and physical abuse, including me jumping out of a first story window more than once to escape knives, to weekly suicide attempts, I didn't know what to do with both my mind and body any more.

In my country, if someone refuses treatment, then they can go.  If there is blood all over the wall and that person refuses treatment, then that is their decision until it is found that they can be detained under the mental health act.

&amp;#x200B;

The key think is that the mental health act does not include the possibility that the person they are dealing with is under a heightened sense of alert because of previous abuse, and that their DEFAULT is CALM.

11,"**I know there's an almost identical question on the FAQ, but please don't delete this post. The answer on the FAQ isn't enough for me to convince myself, and I also really need to vent.**

I'm not depressed, I don't suffer from PTSD, panic attacks or anything severe like that. I don't have trouble sleeping, I have a job with nice colleagues and I get along well with my family. 

At this very moment, I feel fine. I feel fine most of the time. But I know my life is far from perfect.

Basically, I'm somewhat socially awkward and some social situations make a bit anxious, though I'm not completely socially inept. This makes my self-esteem pretty low, and sometimes I have unpleasant thoughts like ""I hate myself"" or ""I want to die"", even though I'm not depressed or suicidal. I could explain my issues in more detail, but that would make this post very long.

The thing is, it's nothing severe, though it does causes me some distress. I'm okay most of the time. Most of the people who seek psychotherapy have more serious conditions, so I think it might not be necessary or maybe a psychologist won't even be able to help me. On the other hand, I think my problems, even if they aren't extreme, are out of my control, and I don't have anyone to talk to that could help me. 

Is psychotherapy needed in my case? How could it help me? What approaches to psychotherapy would work best for me?

I really appreciate anyone's comments, but I'm particularly interested on the answers of actual psychologists.

Of course when i found out i was surprised and upset she didn’t come to me with her problems bc we even though we hooked up i told her we were still friends and to let me know if she ever needed anything well her excuse was she didn’t know anyone cared. This is where i decided to put life and the mechanics of it in to perspective for her because i feel many of you who are dealing with depression or feel like you’re alone don’t give this simple concept much attention. Cause And Effect. You are not alone you are on a planet of billions of people that will all interact with you differently. Millions will adore you, millions wont care you just unfortunately are probably surrounded by those that seem to not care so think about how much you effect others lives without realizing and without them realizing. You alone belong here. You keep the world spinning you alone are the sole keeper of the world future and events that include you being alive if you deprive the world of your life it must now learn to function and rewrite the future without you in it. That means you, a very fucking large butterfly, are a very crucial part of everyones live and i cant stress that enough every person you pass in the street, meet at a bar, honk at on a highway, all of these people are effected by your existence and they’re future relies on said interactions. If you are a car in traffic you may be that one extra car that causes a person to be one minute late to work on their last strike. This person must now find a new path for they’re future which could easily lead to meeting the love of their life at a bar on the night they would be working or asleep preparing for work. Two years later, they’re married with a baby said baby grows up and makes his own tiny imprints on life which in turn effects every single person on earth today. Already in your years of being alive you’ve changed peoples paths in the past that have come back to effect you in its own little way some how you may have cause a conversation, an idea, a breakup any of these things. The point is you are important and everyone here whether they know of you or not needs you to keep pushing for better days they you to continue living to help lead their lives on its predetermined path and unkowningly they will unconditionally love you bc for bright future days to happen the bad past things you wish you could have avoided needed to happen it’s necessary and you will bounce back you will be okay. And if you end up in a funk again go to a grocery store make tiny interactions with strangers, but while you do that think of how you are actively changing their entire life and how it would be completely different if you had never read this post and followed those directions.

17,"(Sorry this is so long, I'm just really in a state, here.)

Most of the time when this happens it's just a one-off, a bad day, but as wintertime approaches this has become a near-nightly issue for me &amp; I was hoping someone else might have some tips or tricks or any kind of advice, really, because I am at the end of my rope.

I oftentimes have an issue where I will become ""stuck"" and unable to do anything. If, for example, I know before I go to bed I need to work on my writing, clean the litterbox, make dinner, and wash dishes (I usually have more than that but for simplicity's sake), what I wind up doing is sitting at my computer, endlessly refreshing the same 2-3 sites, and doing absolutely none of it.

Sometimes I'll take a good 30 minutes or even an hour to order them in the most efficient and strategic way possible. Makes the most sense to do dishes after dinner so I don't have to do them twice, clean the litterbox before dinner so my bedroom isn't stinky when I take food in there to eat, work on writing last thing before bed because it's the least important, etc. It helps a little, especially if I stop and break them down into steps - like, ""Go put the frozen stuff on the counter to thaw a bit. Come back and get the empty bag for the litter. Scoop the litter. Throw the bag away. Wash hands. Throw the grossest dishes in the sink to soak ahead of time. Get out the pans and cooking utensils...""

But sometimes even that's not enough, especially when I can't seem to prioritize tasks by importance (something I'm usually very good at) or by what I actually feel up to (none of them). So I'll say, ""Fuck responsibilities, I need a break!"" and then...do the same thing. I could play any of the games I'm partway through, I could watch a movie I've been meaning to see, I could read...and then I sit at the computer and do none of it because I can't decide what I'm in the mood for. I even tried that trick where you flip a coin, and if you're disappointed in the results you know what you wanted all along? I'm disappointed in every result.

I feel absolutely paralyzed. I'm sitting here screaming at myself to do something, anything, because you don't get enough time in this world to waste it like this, and yet...even though I'm normally a hell of a night owl I wind up going to bed early because I'm bored and exhausted. There's only so many times you can refresh a website, see nothing's changed, open a new tab, and open the same website again. It drives me insane. Then I wake up early but spend 4 extra hours in bed refreshing shit on my phone because nothing seems important enough to get veritcal for.

I'm normally pretty good at getting in touch with myself - asking myself why I feel the way I do and working my way to the root of a problem as sure as any therapist. But with this, I'm stumped. How do I make myself engage even when my brain chemistry isn't cooperating with me? Is there an app that prioritizes your bullshit for you? A browser extension that smacks your hand away from the mouse after you've refreshed Reddit for the 40th time? What's an actual non-internet activity that costs the lowest amount of energy for when I can barely even be bothered to drag myself off the computer long enough to change clothes and go to bed?? 

Like I said, I could take this happening every so often, but this is becoming a constant with me right now. My productivity, normally really high, is at a standstill. It's awful.

Additional context if it's needed: I'm a lady in my 20s who definitely has officially depression, general anxiety, and seasonal trouble, and MAY also have (fun) ADHD and CPTSD, but I'm not taking medication for anything because I'm American and we can't afford healthcare.",25Nov2018,1

I can craft reasonably structured arguments without hassle and when it comes to subjects I love, those which I tend to post about on Reddit and in Twitter threads, ranging in length from maybe 50-1000 words. Still, when it comes to essay writing and similar assignments, I completely lose focus and am unable to function for the rest of the day. A feeling I can only describe as ""raw"" overcomes me and all my thoughts seem to go out of focus.

22,"I’m a 28 year old male. Married with a young child. I had a good upbringing, good family, good life. I wasn’t abused as a child, no serious injuries, but I have a problem... 

I feel nothing. I don’t mean that I’m numb; I don’t have feelings. I don’t feel close or attached to anyone, I don’t feel good/bad, happy/sad. I don’t feel close to people including my family, friends, and co-workers. None of these things register any kind of emotion from me. 

For a large part of my life I was a violent person. I’ve hurt people (never my family, friends, etc). Since my childhood violent thoughts were obsessive. When I was younger it would feel almost like a pressure on my chest where I couldn’t breathe well — violence was like a pressure relief valve and removed this pressure. I never felt bad, I never felt guilty, I never felt anything from my actions positive or negative. I feel dead inside. 

I want to be a different person. I wear this mask and I feel like no one knows me. I can play the roles, I can play the game, I can manipulate people into believing I’m a good person. I have a good job but my family needs better. I may be broken but my family deserves better than someone dead inside. 

I was sent to a psychiatrist once because of something I did in my youth but instead of seeking help I spent my time lying and manipulating them into believing whatever it is they needed to hear. I’ve never taken my mask off to anyone. What’s wrong with me? What options are even available? ",25Nov2018,1

25,"Hey guys, recently I've been having episodes my doctor suggests are related to panic attacks. What happens is my heart starts to pound and I start to feel faint ( feint? ), to the point where I'm debating asking people I don't know to call for medical assistance mid episode. The episodes don't occur at stressful times necessarily, only the first was during a stressful situation (first time getting high and I smoked WAY too much, bad trip).  The other two occurred once as I was shopping and again when I was trying to fall asleep.  The thing that bothers me is that heart issues run in the family as do many other diseases, and pains in that part of my chest persist after the episodes and appear periodically throughout days. Either way I'm getting more checks done on my heart shortly just to be safe.  


Extra details about myself are I'm a 23 year old man about 5'7"" within a safe weight (I'm ballpark 160 pounds) and I do what I can to eat lean, primarily chicken I avoid red meat when I can. I drank a fair amount of coffee but after the third episode I've limited myself to 1 or 2 a day If I have it at all.

26,"I have a family member whom I believe has a serious mental illness. She is not someone I can easily speak to about the issues I’m seeing and i have approached her husband (my brother) about my concerns. I don’t have to see her often but when I do, I’m scared to be around her. She believes that gender-less beings and god gave her the gift of ultimate truth and knowledge. She’s angry that i don’t share her world view (extreme right wing cult-like views), constantly insinuates everyone around her is brain washed, and down right mean to everyone. She will espouse her beliefs to anyone —- whether they want to believe it or not. 

Neither she nor my brother trust in the mental health system. Therapy or drugs are out of the question. 

My question is - how do I handle being around her? When she told me the story about the gender less beings, all i could say was OK. I didn’t act shocked or interested and even said “i don’t know what you want me to do with this information.” She verbally attacked me for being blind and a sheep. She believes in huge government run pedophila rings, celebrity cannibal clubs, and the existence of a second sun. 

Because I am unable to affect change or help facilitate change, I would appreciate any help in how to interact with someone like this. While I feel sad and worried for her, she’s also unbearable. Rude, insistent, mean, and annoying.

28,"Can i tell my psychiatrist this story without getting anyone else involved ?

Before I start this post, I just want to say that I have had no professional help as of writing this. I've just been struggling with this on my own for a while and just recently (past week) it has gotten un bearable.

 I'm aware that people commenting on a Reddit post can in no way replace a medical diagnosis. But I've been dealing with this for a bit and I want to know if there are similar situations or if anyone can help me find out what to do.  I apologize for the long post but I feel like there's a lot to explain.

last year I was boasting with confidence. I was hilarious, easy to talk to, you name it.  I was more social than I had ever been in my life and I was really enjoying school.

And then it seemed like sometime last october (when i started smoking weed) during school year(college) I just became less happy-go-lucky. I stopped fucking with everyone and became very depressed.  I hit a low point in my emotions, and was very depressed for about two months all i would do is sleep and often not eat, but I felt like I relatively had bounced back and was better than ever. 

fast forward to a year i have been great but then it all went bad:  I quit smoking weed after smoking 24/7 for the past two months(straight). two weeks ago i went cold turkey and immediately after that The past two weeks and I have began experiencing constant brain fog, literally all the time. And to make it worse what I experienced (and still do) is what feels like I'm constantly baked, like when you watch something moving and it kind of has a ghostly outline to it and feels like it's almost in slow motion, but for everything I see in motion. I lost a lot awareness, my reaction time is slower. 

Here is where the real issue is however. 

**after that i began having vivd dreams that felt real. im not sure if this particular thing  was a dream or just a thought. but i now constantly have the thought or memory that when i was 10 and my brother was 5 or 6 i told my brother to lick my penis. i have never had this thought in my life up until this point and i cant tell if its real or not  and for a week i kept it inside and drove myself insane with feelings of giult and shame. i looked up and found out this is common among kids(sexual exploration) but i still feel horrible and this morning i broke down crying and told my parents about this whole situation.  they then asked my brother who is now 14 i am 19 if it was true or if he remembered anything( i heard everything). then they all came into my room while i was crying and comforted me telling me that it was not true and that it was a bad dream. i felt better but now toward the night my crippling anxiety and feelings of giult have over taken my body and its hard to breathe. it feels really real despite my best friend who i told and even family and brother telling me that im tripping. my brother has been hugging me and letting me cry but i continue to feel the anxiety and giult come in waves.**

**my brother is my best friend and the person i love the most on this earth and this thought makes me feel disgusting and dirty it feels real and i feel giulty even though he keeps telling me he doesent remmember that happening.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**can i talk to my therapist about my feelings without people coming to investigate because the last thing i would want is for CPS to take my brother away for something that maybe isn't even real. Also i have many ocd symptoms and i am somone who is very paranoid all the time but i have not seeked professional help. please guys any comments would help.**

29,"I tried to kill myself three years ago, it's been a regret I didn't follow through.

I have tried to be the best I can everyday. I went out, dated, taken chances, and nothing has gone my way. I lost the handful of friends I had, if they'd even call me their friend to start with. I try to read to get smarter, I smoked pot to relax my anxiousness, I took the nasty family members out of my life, and nothings made a damn difference. I tried to turn to anything supernatural to guide me, I've cried myself to sleep more times than I thought possible. Despite all of that I'm  now an unemployed loser. 

I make people uncomfortable. I myself don't like anything about me, I wouldn't be my friend either. I have swallowed that fact and tried to push past it, but I can only fool myself for so long. I can see it in peoples faces and in their tones that they don't like me, I don't blame them. Despite this I have tried since high school to be likeable, agreeable, and generally not an asshole. Now I'm 20 and still don't have any friends.

I had a few people be nice to me at my old job. Either they were nice old women or people that have ceased to talk to me, even when I message them first. I now can't even hold conversations anymore, when I think before I speak I understand I don't have anything intelligent to say.

Since I don't believe in heaven or hell I think death would be a release from this world I can't bear. I'm too chicken to just slice my wrist, and Canada can't help me die because I don't have a terminal illness. I can't just give up because my family would step in and that's really not worth their time. So I'm stuck hating myself and waking up knowing I have to be myself. I'm tired I can't hold down a friend, I'm tired of everything about myself, no matter what I do nothing seems to be working. Every time I try my hardest it seems life just pulls the rug out. It's just one thing after another and I can't fix it, how much longer do I have to try? Because so far nothing has made me glad to be alive.",25Nov2018,1

31,"Today I had a relapse in self harm. I'm just hoping that writing out what happened will help me process the whole incident. Commentary is welcome. 

The day before the relapse I felt depressed for the whole day. I had a three hour nap in the afternoon and a 12 hour sleep at night. In the evening I felt both exhausted and agitated. I recently upped my snri (with doctor approval) in hopes that it would help with symptoms enough to control the self harm. So far they seem to be making me incredibly drowsy.  

This morning I woke up with a list of things to do. I ate breakfast, took care of my dog, and then went for a short bike ride because I need to see if exercising helps stabilize my moods and improve my energy. I managed, with difficulty to finish my exercise, shower (lights off, sitting down in a standing shower) and make a quick trip out to refill my meds. When I got home I was so tired and demotivated I couldn't eat and ended up not eating because I couldn't comprehend making food. 

A few weeks ago I threw away all of my cutting supplies. That doesn't mean I wasn't cutting, but I was only cutting at work, not at home. Today I rifled through my garbage can to find an exact-o knife blade and cut myself. 

(To anyone who's getting worried, my self-harm habits are best described as medically safe as possible, but still life-interfering. I don't cut past the surface or into the tendon but I do leave significant marks. I keep the wounds clean and rinse off blades before hand). 

I cut because it felt like I had this significant anger building up and I couldn't do anything else to deescalate it. I was actually as much a danger to others as to myself at that moment and I just needed some form of release. 

The good news is that in two days I get to do intake through my mental health services and see if they offer anything for DBT. I do have a counsellor now and we have done work on the anger in the past as well as slowly chipping away at the urges behind the self harm. I'm really hoping I can get into a more comprehensive DBT group though, because I can't stop self harming and my moods are worse than puberty. ",25Nov2018,1
32,"Before we begin, a rape trigger warning is in order. I really don’t know where else to post this.

I (f) will be 17 next month. A lot of great stuff has happened in the past several months; I’m in my junior year of high school, I’m in a stable relationship with someone who I had been crushing on since forever, and I’m starting to go out a lot more with friends. But, something has been bothering me for the past several month as well. My great-grandfather was sitting and pulled me by my wrist and placed me on his lap and talked to me while he rubbed my thighs. There were other family members around, and apparently none of them saw how uncomfortable I was. He’s a very affectionate person, so I kind of brushed it off as grandfatherly affection.

Fast forward to a few nights ago- my cousin and I were sitting in my living room on the couch. I was on my phone, and I’m not really sure what he was doing. But then he reached over and began stroking my hair. He stopped when my brother came into the room.

I decided to tell my boyfriend about what my cousin did, which led to me telling him about the encounter with my great-grandpa I had a few month prior. He asked me if anyone had ever touched me “down there”. I thought really hard about it, and I told him that I really wasn’t sure. I didn’t remember anyone doing anything, but I did have a few relatives and family friends that I wasn’t allowed to be around alone. I was a very naive kid, and trusted everyone because I was a kid and I figured that no one could hurt a kid.

Is there any chance that I forgot about being molested or raped? I matured sexually very quickly and began masturbating around 1st or 2nd grade I think, but I remember having sexual thoughts much earlier than that. I also had very dark sexual thoughts and self-harmed at a very young age. These are the most compelling things that make me thing that maybe something did happen when I was younger.

33," 

I need some advice. I'm a 15 year old guy and I like to think that I have a pretty good life. My parents are great, I'm both scared and yet excited about what's to come in the future, and I personally would think it inconsiderate to think that I don't currently have enough. I have enough. But despite all of this, the one thing that doesn't seem right of all of this is my emotional state. For the past three or so months (or maybe even more and I just haven't noticed it) my emotional state has gone up and down. One week I feel good and fine. The next week I feel anxious, distressed, and sad for seemingly no reason. It's gotten to the point where sometimes I feel like I'm coming close to a panic attack only to settle back down. I know it's an issue when I come close to tears and I don't know why I feel the way I do. 

About a year ago I went to a counselor I used to go to again because I didn't feel happy. I had originally normally gone to him because of something that happened to me long ago that I thankfully was able to recover from. When I went back to him again, he chalked up what I felt to ""teenage angst"". I haven't gone back since. The issue is that I don't feel like it's bad enough. I am personally close to someone who has Anxiety and Depression and I wouldn't think it fair to assume that I have it just as bad as she does. What also bothers me is that it isn't consistent. It just seems to come and go when it pleases. I worry a lot and I like to consider myself a worrier and I'm not sure if it has to do with anything. I worry maybe my counselor was right. Maybe it is just teenage angst? 

I just need someone to help me understand. I don't want to take this to my parents because as great as they are, they really don't seem to understand these sort of things as much as I would like them to. My close that friend that has Anxiety and Depression thinks that I could maybe benefit from seeking help, and I don't want to keep talking to her about how I feel or anyone of my other friends because I don't want to burden or worry them. 

So this is why I'm here. I've got no one else to turn to now but anonymous users on the internet. I'm confused. Does anyone have a clue what's going on with me?",25Nov2018,1

35,"***""The only difference between a good day and a bad day is your attitude."" - Dennis S. Brown*** 

I've seen this quote (and a couple of other similar ones) floating around on the internet lately - Facebook newsfeeds, Instagram stories, whatever, and they've always given me this horrible, visceral anxiety, especially when I see everyone agreeing with the statement. I sort of understand the sentiment behind it but seeing quotes like that have always made me feel worse. 

Some people simply can't change their day, their emotions, their outlook as easily as this quote suggests - I think many people do not realize how much of our personality and emotions are just chemicals, and to have a chemical imbalance (or something like trauma) in that arena makes you lose some degree of control. And you don't need to be mentally ill to experience this - if you've ever had alcohol or done drugs, you can understand how much of your perspective, mindset, and feelings change based solely on the input of chemicals. 

I wasn't able to even change my own perspective on life until I began medications - when I was in a depressed state, my mind couldn't even conjure up what the ""positive outcome"" could be - it just wasn't an option that was available to me. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it. I just feel that a lot of the content created and perpetuated by neurotypicals is inadvertently exclusive to those who struggle with mental health or chronic illness, and if anything, makes me feel more alone (and at fault for my setbacks) in the fight towards stability, happiness, and peace.

I do get a sense of accomplishment when I solve a problem but the feeling is very fleeting because my mind operates in a silo and all I can do is just worry about the next problem in my life. I think some of my accomplishments are huge milestones but even then I don't feel like I have a break. I have this constant pressure from myself to achieve and I fear failure even though I know its normal. I don't think my work environment is pressuring me more than I am myself. I don't think my friends care more than I do. Even though I understand this, I still feel immensely stressed.

I think one might say this is a good trait to have because it causes ourselves to constantly improve, however, I think my attitude is too extreme and may be impacting my mental health. My coworkers and friends don't really view me as a happy person; sometimes I get very casual remarks about how I seem stressed, unhappy, or too serious. I don't really like to emanate this image of myself either.

I want to solve them all but at the same time I think I might have to live with some of these problems because the sheer amount of problems is too great.

Maybe I just answered my problem in this paragraph but I wish the solution is easier than to just live with the problems. How does one train themselves to be content with how things are?

just looking for a little bit of input (perhaps based on personal experience) on something. this past semester has felt like one thing after another for me -- my parents threatened to cut me off financially, my work study essentially replaced me, i've been fighting with my school administration over issues related to me being trans, my grandmother passed away, i got turned away for therapy, my abusive father has been in and out of the hospital; it's really just been a very difficult few months.

luckily, i have a really wonderful and supportive group of friends that include my roommate and my boyfriend, and they're always understanding whenever my mental health isn't faring too well. however, i feel increasingly guilty about burdening them with my issues so often when they have their own problems. i'm thinking of isolating myself a little in order to give them a break and maybe focus on dealing with things on my own for a while.

39,"Hi, everyone. I've struggled with my mental health for the better part of ten years. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was eight, anxiety a few years later, and depression and PTSD about two years ago. While I have made strides with my anxiety, PTSD, and OCD my depression seems to be rapidly declining. According to my therapist, the last few weeks I've been in a depressive episode. 

This feels incredibly foreign to me; normally I will feel incredibly depressed for a day but I'll wake up and be able to rationalize with myself and get myself out of whatever I'm feeling. But for the past months I've felt nothing but tired, weak, exhausted, emotionally drained, and I'm beginning to feel completely numb. I've turned to minor self harm (using scissors, rarely drawing blood but leaving scratches that last around a weak) just so I can feel something. 

I feel so incredibly miserable. Even at my worst I was still able to rationalize and keep my spirits up. I'm a high school senior and incredibly involved; I get good grades, I have five leadership positions in my school, I am clean-cut, put together, and normal. My mental health is not something that I can talk about. But right now I feel as though I have no quality of life; I cannot imagine living like this any longer. 

So my question is, would inpatient treatment be a possible step to recovery? I want to get better SO badly, especially before I leave home and go to college. I know that my life isn't supposed to feel like this and I am more than willing to do whatever it takes to love existing again. I don't want to feel miserable anymore.

42,"So I'm in this situation that is fairly complicated with my husband. 
We met in 2016 on tinder, clicked immediately, but we couldn't  meet because he was Ill, then about 2 months later he had to move back home because his mother was in the hospital. Fast forward an entire year and then he moved to my state. After about 3 months of finally seeing each other and living close, he tells me that he isnt American, but Pakistani and has been trying to get citizenship for about 5 years now. He told me he would just marry one of his distant cousins and then we could be together after they divorce. I didn't really want to wait 3 more years to be together, so I said I would marry him. 
Since he has lied about where he was from, saying he was from the US and only lived for a short time in Egypt, my parents are under the impression that he is a US citizen. I have had to get married behind their backs, because he doesnt want anyone to know that he lied. So I agreed to keep it a secret until his citizenship was established, then we would have a ""real"" wedding with our whole family. We could only afford a legal marriage, so that's what we had, and told only his family. That was in feburary 2018, it is now November and we still cant be together because I have no car, no license because my parents never taught me how to drive, and they wont allow anyone else to teach me. My parents are very possessive even though im an adult. My siblings live across the country so I cant ask them either. I had to get rid of my best friend last year, so I have no friends either. My husband is struggling with ADHD, PTSD from his childhood, and anxiety. I myself have depression, and really dont have anyone to talk to right now. I can no longer afford therapy, because I have to have surgery. I love my husband dearly, but i feel horribly lied to, and yet i still feel obligated to care for his needs. He is living with his abusive family at the moment since he is still an immigrant and not a citizen. We have filed for it, and are waiting for the interview in a year. 
When we met he told me he was able to drive, his parents had a lot of money and that all would be taken care of. That was all true, but has quickly become untrue because of some bad business decisions his father made, and his lack of citizenship making his license useless. I am in my early twenties and still live at home. This entire situation makes me feel manipulated and lied to. Since he has PTSD, he has episodes of mentally shutting down, and he never told me about this until I saw it myself. Same goes for his anxiety and ADHD. He has strong boughts of depression, to the point where he curls up on the floor and wont respond. What the hell do I do? I love him dearly, but i am genuinely miserable because i love the person, but am stuck in an unfair situation with no one to lean on or talk to. He cant handle talking about it because it triggers those episodes, so I have to keep it to myself. A few days before Halloween, he wanted to have a joined suicide because of how bad things are. He doesnt want to live without me, and says that if we break up or divorce that he will kill himself. He has tried already without telling me. He wanted us to lay on the train tracks, so while he closed his eyes, I texted the police to help. This may sound horribly calloused, but I did no sign up for this... I told him right away that I had depression when we first talked, and so he knew what he was prepared for. I know that love means being together no matter what, but I have seriously considered just walking away and finding someone else. I know that there is no one like him. We can talk for hours about almost anything, do everything together, wear matching outfits, dance together, all of the corny couple stuff.

43,"The closer it gets the more anxious I become, and the more anxious I become the less clearly I'm able to think and the less clearly I can connect with being able to know what I am feeling and what I believe on a given subject. Conversation is kind of pointless when I can't see the full picture of what happened, what I want to talk about, or who I am. Anxiety doesn't let me actually think. If my brain was a library that contained all the movies ever made across every single genre, anxiety chooses 1 genre and plays those movies on repeat and tells me those are all the movies in the library. It shines a light on the section that houses that genre and leaves everything else in the dark. I wish I knew how to stop this from happening.

This hasn't been happening for too long but I've dropped 8lbs in a little over a week and I'm not sure if I should bring it up with my therapist. I'm a little hesitant because she tends to overreact (or maybe I underreact) 

I'm trying to get a trans-related surgery (top surgery) and I'm not sure how telling her will affect it. I had to stop self harming and I don't think I can handle eating normally as well. 

I'm not worried about being too thin for the surgery because my bmi is just barely ""overweight"" and I should be getting surgery by march.

53," 

I was abused by my brother growing up and found out recently that I have PTSD. It's not the usual brotherly fights, he's 8 years older than me and I remember getting beaten down, smashed against tables and choked against the walls for doing pretty much nothing. The abuse started when I was in first grade and he was in high school. He even beat me with a textbook once when I was in 5th grade (imagine a 10-year-old getting beaten by an adult) , perhaps he thought he could literally beat the knowledge into me. I recall planning to kill him with poison and keeping a knife under my pillow when I was 9 YEARS OLD. Looking back at it, it's fucking crazy that a child that young has to think of murdering someone and keeping a knife under his pillow in fear. This man gave me hell, I was trapped, stressed and helpless for my entire childhood. No child should live under those circumstances.

My parents knew what was going on but they refused to do anything. My mom had school and my father was just a pussy that just stood there when my brother got in one of his fits. For example, whenever he would beat me, nothing was done, not even a slap on the wrist. He would always play victim and if I made it to my dad I would just use him as a barrier while my father just stood there. In 7th grade, my brother started bashing on one of my friends and then I told him, ""at least I have friends"". This set him off and he wouldn't let me in the house. When my dad made him move out the way he punched a hole in our wall. Believing that he broke his arm, my dad then decided that everything was my fault and punched me in the face. I'm not even exaggerating, this fool actually decked me in the face.

Childhood trauma has given me PTSD, sleep issues, and many other issues that are fucking with my mental and physical heath. I even have urinating issues that doctors believe was caused by my abuse. I'm 18 now and all these health issues are finally getting to me and I can barely focus on my studies. I honestly feel like how I was as a child except that even when this guy can't beat the shit out of me anymore, he still is. I feel like I'm in a hole and that if these sicknesses don't go away then I'm fucked for life. I haven't had a decent sleep in forever (6 years), my mental cognition is deteriorating as I'm starting to forget everything and it's difficult for me to learn. My head burns all the time and I've been thinking about suicide a lot recently.

Nobody in my family has taken fault or apologized for what's happened. My mom has but I really don't blame her, she's the breadwinner of our family and she didn't have the time for our family when I was a kid. Whenever, I bring it up with my dad, he just stays silent and I honestly doubt that he believes its his fault. I love my parents but honestly my dad's a piece of shit. My brother's still the same fuck, he even had the audacity to say a few months ago, ""that I have forgiven myself for what I did to you even if you haven't forgiven me."" That triggered to me and I started beating his ass. And guess what, my dad got in between that being the good father he's always been. My sister told me he cried and apologized to my parents after I left the house but a few weeks later he threatened my sister with dead threats so I doubt he's changed that much. I remember only about 2 years ago, he told my sister that he would cut her head into a bunch of pieces. My sister has PTSD as well but he still fucks with her knowing he's bigger and stronger. Most of my relatives know what's happened but nobody except myself holds responsibility to him and actually acknowledges it. My mom even tries to make us get along even knowing what he's done to me and how I feel about him.

My family's failure to acknowledge that history while it still remains my burden pisses me the fuck off. My aunt whos a doctor told me that she diagnosed my brother with bipolar disorder but my parents just ignored her and didn't make him take any medication. My dad is ignorant and doesn't give a shit while my mom just wants to live this fantasy where my brother and I get along so shes constantly trying to make us do things together. I don't blame her, it sucks that her two sons don't get along but my situation is definitely worse than hers. Plus, I hate that prick. Other than that, my parents are loving and provide me with everything I need. They want me to forget about everything in the past, but it's hard when those things are still affecting me today.I have severe anxiety and it gets worse whenever I see my brother. I'm not afraid of him anymore, but my stomach just flips when I see him. I don't know how to fix this and this is one of the first times I've shared this with anyone other than my therapist.

I want to just pick up everything and abandon my family, but at the same time I can't know it's going to hurt them. I love them, but there's that grudge inside that just makes me despise everybody. What should I do? I've openly talked my issues with my parents except wanting to leave but the general response is ""what do you want us to do? It already happened"" or just silence. I don't doubt the justification for abandoning them but I don't know how to feel. Any advice on dealing with my shit?",25Nov2018,1
54,"idk how to describe this but its bothering me for years, it's also ruining my Social Life.

for example, when im buying some food and go home my brain imagines that I didn't had enough money to pay and in this anxious situation people are watching me, or another one, I imagine  a friend is with me and he thought I will buy him something too and when I didn't, I fell in this shameful situation, or imagine that im going to mcdonalds with friends and suddenly I don't have much money. 

when im imagining this, im cringing, someties in the middle of the street I look like I felt some deep pain. I cover my eyes. 

this kind of things really ruin my social life, im even afraid to go to the store with a friend, im afraid with this anxiety I might really fall in this kind of situation. [few times, I almost did]

the reason might be that, I was raised in a poor family, and I always felt shamed of it, I always lacked money when me and the whole class were going somewhere.

55,"Hey, I'm 24, male, on no medication, but have aspergers syndrome, fighting depression and anxiety.

I'm about to break down completely (mainly just cry my eyes out...). Depression has taken its toll over my life and the last few weeks have been a particularly bad time, anxiety has been through the roof, I've been contemplating killing myself, been in a particularly bad depressive slump, and been stressed to the point of not being able to think straight. To make matters worse, my sister is kicking me out of her house because I've been, and I quote ""lazy and useless"", and not done enough to stay in the house (mainly just cleaning, and tidying up after myself, even though I've been doing that...), while I'm fighting depression which is why I've not done enough. Sister has said that having anxiety, depression, and having a disability are excuses for me not doing anything...
Both sister and mum have said that ""it's all in your head"", get over it, and sister saying that it's easy to control depression and anxiety, like there's an on and off switch... even though she was on anti depressants, and thinks that they work for everyone...
To make it better mum says no one is going to help, as ""I'm an adult, got myself into this mess, and you can deal with it""... (I know that some people can/will help, if I ask them)
Sister and mum both expect me to use initiative to help, even though they say nothing about needing help, and always expect me ask to ask them for help, to be aware of surroundings 24/7 and know what to ask, without them mentioning a word, to know the future 24/7. They also get frustrated when I ask for help, with a ""you should know how to do this without asking"", and get frustrated when I don't (get yelled at if I know how to do something, as well as not knowing how to do something...). Oh, and my family are a bunch of narcissists, and believe I'm making all this up... (somewhat similar to the story ""the boy who cried wolf""...).

58,"I didn't realize it wasn't normal that I would get nervous before making a phone call, having to rehearse what I was going to say at least 10 times before making the call with a heart beating rapidly. I didn't realize that it wasn't normal to be so anxious and shy around girls to the point I wouldn't even speak to them. I didn't realize that it wasn't normal to avoid finding a job in my teenage years because I was anxious about having to go out of the comfort of my house and go out there and work in the real world. I didn't realize it wasn't normal to be hesitant to send a message to a friend group chat or speaking in Discord in fear of being judged by everyone in there because I was afraid of being seen as 'below them' in terms of social status within the group. 

I didn't realize it wasn't normal to be so hesitant to change my display profile picture on Facebook because I was so afraid of being judged on my face by others to the point where I would have the same profile picture for years.  A profile picture where I look like a kid and I didn't even realize it. I had no idea that my Facebook profile was giving the impression that I was a loser.

Now I'm someone with a terrible GPA because I've crammed for every single test, exam and assignment I've ever had in university instead of working diligently and studying hard ahead of planned deadlines. I'm someone who has never been in a relationship or had sexual/romantic experiences, despite multiple girls having asked me out in the past, clearly shown interest in me or some girl saying I was attractive to her friends (who were flatmates with a friend who told me) even though I had spoken to her for a total of 1 minute during a party I was invited to.

Now I'm someone who has wasted time, opportunities and experiences that I'll never get back. People will say that it's never too late to change, and I agree for the most part, but where I do disagree is how I've wasted the opportunities that come with school. You'll never have the same opportunity again once you graduate. Being close to so many people your age during high school and university. During a time where it's completely fine to have no sexual experience. Missing out on experiences such as living in the dorms because I chose to stay and live with my parents in my home city and then transfer to another school in another city after freshman year, socially isolating myself even more.

Excessive computer used fucked me up so much I didn't even realize it because it started so early in my life (middle school) that it seems like the life I've lived is normal. But once I look at other people and the lives they have lived, reading people's biographies on Wikipedia, I realize that anything is possible and that there are no rules in life. There are no rules stating that I have to be a lazy fuck with zero sexual experience nearing graduation. It's just that I've lived this sort of life with these mental issues for so long that this is considered normal for me so it's never something I noticed was odd.

I've taken steps to alleviate the situation, such as sleeping early and waking early consistently, saying yes to every social situation, talking to as many people as possible, fixing my undisciplined nature and avoiding instant gratification, asking myself what I want in life and what makes me happy, setting out my goals/hobbies/interests and making progress towards them. 

Now I'm on the verge of entering the 9-5 life which would be even worse. Knowing that I've wasted so much time, opportunity and experiences without even realizing it, I'm riddled with regret, a shell of who I could have been. I've lead such a pathetic life.",25Nov2018,1

They proceed to be  abusive, ignorant, pieces of shits saying things like ""You aren't good at anything, what are you even useful for"". The city person who was fairly aware of mental illness kept quite, but time passed and he noticed I was meditating and he was like ""oh, so you meditate, why can't you be calm like I am"" and he repeatedly kept saying from time to time this in a very condescending voice. I returned home and away from the hostel. The fucked up part is I started to believe them for awhile, like for 3 months straight I couldn't get my head out of the water and defend this opinion that I am not good at anything. Luckily I took my pracitce seriously and it kind of freed me, then I joined a coding course and it blew my mind how good I was at it. The rest of the class couldn't really keep up. And I started realizing I could make friends very easily, I could hold people's attention,  alot of skills that I thought I didn't have suddenly showed up.

First of all, he has a reputation of harassing people, not just love interests. Most of his targets have different political views than his, he’s very active on social media platforms and he stalks people that he feels are involved with certain groups that he dislikes. 

Anyway, I cut him off right after I noticed he has anger issues and I thought that would be the end of it. It wasn’t. Two years ago someone I’m close to and also happens to be a journalist wrote a piece about this Bob. Again, Bob is very well informed when it comes to social circles and he figured out that I was the one leaking information about him to my friend. Of course, that wasn’t the case, but since then he managed to contact all of my friends and told them to pass his threats to me.

He has multiple accounts. He goes through hot and cold phases - he can hate you for months and then he’ll send apology letters to you (mostly in the form of ‘sorry, but you made me do it’). I also noticed that he takes great pleasure in knowing or even thinking that he’s intimidating. 

I could go on and on, but I’m just trying to figure out what kind of mental illness he suffers from so I can do my research. I can absolutely not involve the police because, where I live, cops are known to give away your name to the aggressor when you press charges and offer 0 protection in return, so I’d very much rather not.

Some traits of his include - paranoia, verbal abuse, anger issues, misogyny, a very powerful urge to dominate, he has hit people on the street for imaginary reasons in the past. Feel free to ask me any questions if you need something cleared up. ",25Nov2018,1

Besides that the medication made me feel super drained and exhausted. Because of this I stopped taking the medication (I told my doctor) about 5 days ago. My appetite has still not gone anywhere. 

None of my clothes fit, I feel too tired and full to work out and I´m terrified this won´t stop. Please tell me about your experiences with quitting medication and how quickly these side-effects go away. Im so desperate. ",25Nov2018,1
72,"I know the title sounds generic and it's what you would expect someone to say but here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

Well two years ago, this woman at my school stalked me... as in she'd follow me around or wait for me in places, sometimes really late at night, start talking in a really fast and disorganized manner, and then when I'd get close to her, she'd panic and run off. At first, I was worried she thought I was a stalker because I saw her so often, so I did my best to change paths and within a few days, she'd find out my new routes and schedule. I told my friends about this issue and they just laughed and joked about it. I went to counseling afterwards and they told me I was hallucinating this mess.

&amp;#x200B;

I was stressed out by this, a few issues at home, and I stupidly binge drank several times a week to deal with this. My stupid behavior resulted in a decline in academic performance as I have this huge fear of going mad, one of my biggest for that matter... I ended up getting put on antipsychotics that made me so shaky that I was no longer able to play musical instruments and the akathisia made walking 10-15 miles a day the norm. Then came the antidepressants that just brought out anger and suicidal thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, even though I knew her name, I never told anyone. I didn't want to incriminate her or anything (and still don't), just find a way to confront her and avoid her; and at this point, get closure. With that said, the stupid meds made me unable to focus and I had this constant lingering fear of losing sanity. Needless to say, it led to a freakout and I'm not on the antidepressants anymore (although I'm fairly sure that night can be attributed to caffeine and constant sleep deprivation from walking around fucking constantly).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm probably a self-conscious narcissist for thinking this but the whole situation has taken a toll on my self esteem. I legitimately should have just shut up and let everything take its course because I have these fucking obsessive thoughts about getting this diagnosis removed. It's not right and it's an insult to people that actually have it. I try going on walks now to get some clear headspace but the only thing I can think about is this... the stalking, the diagnosis, the constant family badgering, and the fact that my life is only 2 weeks away from being ruined because I'm about to let everyone down... at least academically, all thanks to my stupidity.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever a psychiatrist brings up the stalker, a student at my university, and talks as though she's a hallucination, it just enrages me. They think I'm psychotic because I act weird... but I'm not, I'm just autistic and I get that we can appear similar so it's easy to see the confusion. But I'm living a false fucking life that I've lost control of. I want two years of my life back and I wish I had a rest button, because I can't stop thinking about this issue, even though it's not a big deal. It has consumed my life and I've used it as an excuse for acting out like an utter moron. So what can I do to fix these ruminations? If it's possible... sorry for the rant.",25Nov2018,1

74,"I struggle with generalized anxiety with a little dabble in depression here in there, mostly seasonally.

Lately I’ve caught myself in this strange mental state, that I realized was super self destructive. I give myself these specific parameters and if I don’t meet them, I really beat myself up about it mentally.

Suppose I wake up at 8am. Then it’s 10am, and I really want an iced coffee. I won’t get one because for some reason in my head, it’s too late to get iced coffee and I’ll tell myself I can’t get it. I can afford it, it won’t hurt me, and it’s something that will make me a little happy. So why do I force myself to be miserable by not getting it? It’s stupid. I’m beginning to be more aware of things like that and I’m trying to fix it. 

Hope this all makes sense!!",25Nov2018,1
75,"so, just looking for anyone who might know what actually happened to me, because right now I'm calling it an anxiety attack but I thought I'd had those before and this seemed far more serious... worried I might be developing some actual mental problems.

so, it started as something that happens quite a lot. I was at college and just started getting more and more frustrated with everything. it got to the point where I was just so angry at literally anything anyone said, that I up and left, getting the bus home. now that's normal for me, I think maybe I just sometimes can't cope with stuff, idk, but on the way home things got really weird... 

so, for me to get home I take 2 busses. one short bus ride into town and then another one from the bus station to where I live. when I was on the first bus, it was really crowded so i had to stand packed close to other people. the girl I was right next to I recognized as someone I used to be friends with when I was like 11, and I thought she like, looked at me and laughed? so it was a really terrible bus ride, I spent it mentally panicking, trying not to make it obvious that I knew who she was. but, when the bus stopped and everyone got off, as she was walking away, I saw her and it wasn't the person I used to be friends with. it didn't look anything like her, I didn't know this random girl. 

walking across the bus station I kept seeing the faces of people I know or knew. like, every other person was someone I used to be friends with, or someone who used to bully me, or someone who lives near me. just, people I knew. I knew they couldn't be, but that's what I saw. and they were all looking at me, talking to each other about me. I was really freaked out, and just got to my bus as fast as I could, scanned my pass so quick I had to do it a few times, and ran to the upstairs seating and sat right at the back. when the bus was leaving, I watched the bus station go by. no one I knew was there. I could see the same groups of people stood around. the same people who I'd just been sure were my old schoolmates and friends, but they weren't. they were just... random people..

this scared me so much. I've never seen things that weren't there before, I thought I was going crazy. I can't stop thinking about it. what happened? can I trust myself anymore? I don't understand why I kept seeing people who couldn't be there in the faces of strangers. and I'm still not sure if they were really looking at me or not. I mean, that could've just been my eyes lying to me like how I saw their faces differently, or I could have been freaking out really obviously and people were staring...   

has anyone had something similar happen to them? or does anyone know if I should be worried?",25Nov2018,1

77,"It's been a year since I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder I and I'm struggling to accept it.  

In hindsight, I'm pretty sure I had my first manic episode around the age of 18. I didn't know what was wrong with me. In my mind, everything was fine for a few months at a time then everything was awful and I wanted to kill myself. 

It makes sense on some level. The description fits my symptoms. But I still struggle to accept it because (outside of my doctor and psych) there wasn't a *SINGLE* person that tried to talk to me about my mental health.

In hindsight, my pre-diagnosis manic periods were out of control. I fucked up two relationships and most of my friendships. I crashed my car. I didn't save a single cent and I rarely paid bills on time. I let a drug dealer live with me for two months. I got heavily into conspiracy theories and ranted about them to anyone who'd listen. Manic me would barely sleep or eat. I ended up underweight. I went out and talked to strangers and fucked most of them. I came up with ideas for novels and the secret to life (it's aliens, don't ask) and talked and talked. Snorting coke at work. Driving unlicensed in an unregistered car to buy drugs. There are so many more downright dangerous things I can barely remember.  

Sometimes I think about what happened and wonder if I should've been hospitalized. Is the only reason it didn't happen because no one really cared? 

It was completely out of character. Anyone that knew me should've known something was wrong. I'm so angry with my parents for going along with it and thinking ""ok, this is how you are now"". There were many occasions I could've permanently ruined my life or the lives of other people. 

My boyfriend has BP I and I listen to his stories. Sometimes he talks about his family stepping in during manic episodes. And he talks about hospital. And I read other people's experiences on the internet and it seems like most people have some sort of support system and/or intervention when their manic episodes are bad. And I'm glad other people have support, I just wish I had it too. ",25Nov2018,1
78,"&amp;#x200B;

My family is trying to get my older brother to go see a therapist or counselor of some kind.

My brother is a great guy. A good person, a hard worker, devoted to his wife and daughter. However, he also has some mental health issues. One of those is anger. A couple times now he has lost his temper (actually LOST IT), once in my presence a few years ago because his dog got out (I was so upset I had to go stay in a hotel) and then recently over something more major, which was something my mother said (can't get into; it was upsetting to me to, but the way he handled it was scary).

When he loses his temper and starts yelling, it is a 0-to-100 kind of thing. He really is frightening when he does this. There is such a look of hatred in his eyes, and I don't even recognize him. There is something about it that is almost somewhat psychotic, like he doesn't see the other people in the room with him. He doesn't break things or hit people, but I am under the impression that he has broken things before in his home. Either way, it is a really frightening thing. I am worried for him and about him, and now I'm worried for his wife and daughter, who I do not believe should have to put up with that. 

Over the years there has been evidence of some other issues he had. I believe the main one is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (routines, repetitions, idiosyncracies, facial ticks and things that just don't add up).

What makes me sad and what makes me feel bad is that we have all known that he has had mental health issues for years, with OCD or whatever it is he had been struggling about, but that it is only now that he lashes out at people that we are all taking it seriously. My family has never been very good at seeking therapy for things. (And if you're wondering how the dude could reach the place he's at, or where that anger comes from, it probably has to do with growing up with my mother, an alcoholic with abusive tendencies.) 

Anyway. Here is my QUESTION, and here is where I need your help. My brother is afraid of going to see a Psychologist or Psychiatrist because he is afraid of being ""diagnosed with something."" He and his wife want to adopt another child, and he is afraid that a diagnosis will preclude him from being able to do that. (Now, it is my opinion--and I'm sure that many of you will agree, that a man with OCD and anger issues probably shouldn't be adopting more kids right now. Yep, I am on the same page with you on that.) 

He is willing to go see a Therapist or a Counsellor. He told me just yesterday that he has heard me and the rest of our family and he is willing to do this. He is a man of his word (please take my word for it, this guy has got so many great qualities; he is so much more than what you see here) and I know he will do it. 

But what I am afraid of is that he is going to see someone at his Church. My brother's wife made him convert to Mormonism a few years back. My brother doesn't even believe in Mormonism, and has said many times to me in private that he did it to ""save his marriage."" I think that actually the religion has been a real source of stress to him, because it is a demanding religion and he has to give in to a lot of what they require of people. So, that and for other reasons, I am not thrilled about the idea of him going to a Mormon Counsellor or Mormon Discussion Group. I want my brother to get real help from a trained professional who has a lot of education in helping people with anger, OCD, and whatever else he might be struggling with. 

What can I recommend to him? What kind of Counsellor--who has some sort of real education, but isn't a Psychologist/Psychiatrist (because apparently he is afraid of this)--can I encourage him to go to? 

My brother and I have always had a special relationship. I know that he will listen to me. And I think he is in a window here where he is starting to accept he needs to get some help. So it is so important I give him the right advice. Please help me help him. 

NOTE: some might say that he should absolutely go straight to a Psychologist or Psychiatrist and that a Counsellor or Therapist would just be wasting his time. I need everyone to understand that getting him to talk to ANYONE would be a huge improvement, and I believe it would help him. He might not sound like the world's best person in this post, but he really is a very good and solid human being, and I believe if he could get in touch with his emotions and handling them it could really help him.

I thought I was going to marry him and have a family one day, but it ended completely out of the blue. I took both dogs because I didn't want to loose them as well, and moved back home. Moving home meant living in a 3 bedroom apartment with my mom, brother and his gf and my 2 dogs. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has not been an easy year at all. I make less money at this job - which is also very stressful, but I love the people I work with, and I actually feel like I'm good at this job. My dogs are expensive, but they are probably the only reason I wake up in the morning. I've tried to meet new people, but I just couldn't find a connection with them... until I met someone through work. Things seemed like they were getting better, but now I'm noticing that I just feel numb. I don't feel that pure joy people feel when they first find someone they really connect with.. I enjoy spending lots of time with him, he's kind and caring, and we have a lot in common. I can see myself living with him, but that's all. I'm having a hard time seeing a future with marriage and children.. which are things I want in life, and I'm feeling more and more like I just want to be alone. I want to live alone, and isolate myself from the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

With my job, I cannot afford to live on my own.. so I feel like I'm stuck in a place that I can't get out of. I literally have 1 friend who is just as messed up financially as me, so we couldn't even live together.. and I just don't know what to do, or how I am going to get through this. I feel like I am running out of time to get my life together and could really use some advice..  ",25Nov2018,1

84,"I just got the strongest pang of sadness right in my heart. It has been a LONG time since I have felt this upset/sad/??? because I wouldn't say the relationship between our eldest child is strained or anything like that. It isn't even BAD, but she tends to be very judgemental and I've had to hide my true self (y'all know to what I am referring and if you don't then just go search my history) and that has been super hard and super upsetting for me. I don't like keeping things from her, but she has enough stress in her life with school to have to worry about a crazy mother too. She is still aseep in her old room with her sister, her girlfriend (who is going to a different college but is also in for the holiday) and our cat, Salem, but I suspect she will be getting up shortly to get all packed back up and ready to leave. :(  


You should have seen me last year (August 2017) when we dropped her off for her Freshman year of college. It is 4 hours from home (so close enough if she should have to rush home for any reason, but far enough away that we don't see her much except for holidays and breaks) and I was a hot mess as we left her at her dorm and drove back home. Each time she has had to go back to school after each break has gotten easier for me, but now I am just a hot mess again. I am close to tears and wishing I had that 13 year old pretty little girl back--that little girl that my Memories on Facebook had just shown me yesterday. :( I just got over my period, so maybe the hormones are still running a bit high...but I don't think that is it. It doesn't feel like a hormonal kind of thing--it is a bone-deep sadness that I can't shake. Even doing my thing up in the woods hadn't made me as happy as it usually does.  


Thanks for listening to my rambles. I think I will be okay...it's just going to hurt for the next few hours as I adjust to her not being here anymore.   


However--there is some good news: she comes back in 3 weeks for Christmas break, and that lasts for approximately a month this time instead of a few days. That makes it harder to say goodbye again, but I alwaays have you guys to lean on when I need to vent, right?",25Nov2018,1

87,"I was on Lexapro for about 8 years, 10 mg, until tapering off and stopping earlier this year. I was put on Lexapro originally because I used to have very physical panic attacks, and those stopped a year or so after being on the Lexapro. At this point in my life, they are a distant memory.
During the taper, my side effects were minimal, to the point where I don't really remember any nasty side effects. No brain zaps. Maybe just feeling kind of funny, or a couple episodes of depression that passed very quickly.
It's also important to note I've had alcohol use disorder for around the same time as well. Things started off fun enough when I first started drinking, but I'm a blackout drinker and I'm tired of the social repercussions of blackout drinking and so I've made a decision to remove alcohol from my life. Which is tough! Alcohol is addictive. It's everywhere. I've relapsed quite a few times since committing to sobriety. But deep down in my heart I want to be 100% alcohol free.
So, everything was going well this year, I got this great new job, and then all of a sudden on the 3rd of this month I bought a six pack at the grocery store which led to a day-long 15 beer binge. I woke up in the middle of the night in mental anguish. How the fuck could this happen despite everything I've been through with alcohol, how much I've learned. I also have severe health anxiety and so I thought, because I didn't feel well, that I might have given myself brain damage from the binge.
I don't really know what caused the condition I'm in right now, but basically I haven't been the same since that night. I went through the worst of my symptoms the week after the binge. Crushing depression, panic, tense physical anxiety. The brain fog was awful. I had difficulty concentrating and coming up with the right words in conversations, which only fed into my brain damage anxiety.
I currently alternate between days of anxiety, not the panic kind where I'm frantically driving to the ER, but the kind where your stomach is tense all day and you have no appetite, and depression, although not the crushing kind, just feelings of emptiness and hopelessness, like I'm never going to recover from this awful state. I just don't care about anything anymore, but I used to a mere couple weeks ago.
I'm starting to feel desperate. Something happened to me, either the binge broke my brain somehow, which medical professionals are saying didn't happen, or the mental anguish of my relapse put me into a major depressive state and my brain is not fixing itself. It's just leaving me like this.
Once I seek professional help, I know they'll discuss medications with me. However, I have read that re-instating antidepressants not only might not work, but could actually make my condition worse. Because I'm already in a terrible state, I wouldn't want to worsen my situation.
I'm reaching out to this community to ask what you guys think I should do. I'm so depressed right now that it's really affecting my functioning. I'm not eating regularly. I'm sleeping or trying to all the time. I'm going to work, but not enjoying it like I did a couple weeks ago. I'm of course scared that this feeling will be permanent, which sticks me into this endless anxious loop.
I'm doing everything I can to feel better, exercising daily, hydrating, of course not drinking alcohol. But I'm beginning to grow impatient with my brain and it's not playing ball. So I feel like I might need medication. I'm just not sure what my options are in this case.",25Nov2018,1
88,"I am on an intensive training course with a new job I am starting and it has brought home a complex that has been bothering me my whole adult life. I am from the UK by the way.

I am 29 now but when I was a teenager in school I was always praised as a bright student and I got good results in my GCSE’s despite teachers always telling my parents that I always looked like I was miles away in class and then would put my hand up and say something smart. I was even a member of Mensa, loved learning and was confidently clever. 

I found the hormones and coming of age in my teenage years really difficult and got diagnosed with depression at 16/17. I was on Prozac for a short time and also started smoking weed at 18 and completely fucked up sixth form, didn’t even leave with any grades despite A’s in Maths, Science and English at GCSE level. I suffered really badly with depersonalisation disorder and tried to convey this to the counsellors but they always just told me it was in my head. 

Ever since “coming off the rails” as people say I wasted time trying to do a course in college, started an apprenticeship in joinery, completed a fairly useless degree in university, travelled Asia for a year and I am now married. Most of my life has felt as though I have been meandering through it if that makes sense.

Depression has followed me most of the way but I feel as though I am good at fighting it. However what I want help with is my excessive daydreaming. When I am in the classes on this course I am struggling to concentrate sometimes and miss a lot of what people are saying. I can’t make decisions quickly like some others and my self-confidence is still lower than I would have hoped at this age. My memory is also appalling, when I was younger it was really good and I barely revised for exams.

In a nutshell the problem is I just feel a lot dumber than that kid with all those dreams and aspirations, ever since I came off those tracks, I can’t help but imagine what I could have made of my life. Is there a way to retrieve the mental sharpness you once had? Should I try nootropics? I haven’t smoked cannabis since I was 21 but it is the biggest regret of my life and I feel as though it has irrevocably damaged my mind. Please help. Thanks.",25Nov2018,1

92,"On 1st November My beloved uncle who was a firefighter passed away suddenly while trying to save his co-worker's life. My already depressed life took the worst possible turn. I was closest person to him after his family. We live together as a joint family. He was the kindest and bravest person I have ever known. He truly loved his job. Infact due to life threatening risks my father convinced him leave the job but he still went back to job as firefighter. I can't accept he is dead. Last talk I ever had with was him asking me how was I since had fever. Next day he just goes never to return. It's even worse after I had to pick up his ashes which also had his bones. That image of me picking up his bones is became nightmare to me. The only thing that is going in my mind is his voice ringing in my ears. Every single happy memory of him is now trying kill me and honestly I wouldn't mind If I die.
My uncle was struggling for his training which was required for his promotion to next post. But some shitheads who were jealous of him cancelled his promotion by bribing the person who was in-charge of his promotion. If they hadn't done it, My uncle would have been alive and well in the training camp. I just want to hear his voice and see him again.
I might be suffering from PTSD. I might fail my upcoming exams in February due to current events. We were already doing bad before his death due to both my sister, father and grandfather hospitalized back to back. Everyone had just recovered when this tragedy happen. Even during this time he tried staying happy and was genuinely happy on his birthday on 20th October. I wish I could meet him again.",25Nov2018,1

I can't concentrate on anything and memory is getting worse I cant remember anything past age 11 and now my  early teenage years are getting foggy. I closed out most people due to my depression. I can no longer keep living like this. There's this train near my house where I know I can jump in front of but I haven't yet, I have very little hope left for myself but I feel that there's a chance I can get out of this. I went to two different counselors in my college but neither of them helped. They didn't seem to care about their work and one of them didn't even gave me a referral or let me make another appointment. I can't afford therapy and my parent wont help me pay for it( I have asked) . After going to my school for help I sort of lost faith in the therapy treatment. Idk if I can cure it naturally but I don't know what to do. I feel that in any moment now enough will be enough. I don't enjoy being alive . I feel like I'm crying out for help but no body is there. I went to my doctor a few months ago (when i was in my parents insurance now im not) and expressed how I felt but he said not to worry about it ill be fine.

I don't know if Ill be ready by than but I don't have a choice. No one really knows about my problems not even my parents.

94,"During the day time I am a generally happy person. I am empathetic and I know the world is a bad place, but I am pretty chipper and I like to use humor to get through the day. At night time when it is time to go to sleep, I feel a crushing anxiety, because every night is an existential crisis.

I know that everyone fears losing their loved ones, but the thought of losing mine keeps me up at night and the fear is just paralyzing. There are certain people that if I lost (mostly my mom) I feel like my world is gonna end. It makes my heart race and it used to give me insomnia (not so much anymore). Now I do fall asleep but I have nightmares, lately I will wake up after maybe an hour or two of sleeping and whatever my dream was about will make me wake up and think that there is about to be an explosion and that I have to stop it. So I will rush out of my bed and sometimes run out of the door before I realize its not real. I really never feel at ease at night time. 

I just really can't cope with the fact that we are all going to die, for me it is shocking. Any time my mom or my brothers drive somewhere (long or short distance) I worry and sometimes I cry. I also get really caught up in the butterfly effect, like when I am working sometimes my mom or brother will ask me to bring home food, but I usually don't ask the same from them because I get so worried that if they go a different route to get me food that they will end up in a car accident. If I do ask them to do that for me the anxiety I feel just isn't worth it and I pace around until they get home.

I don't want to live like this anymore, I live in the US and I am a student with a low paying job, I do not have access to health care or therapy. No health insurance and every therapy session would cost about 1/3 of my paycheck, and I know that it would probably take quite a few sessions to fix me. 

I also internalize other people's pain, I cry when they cry. And when I think about all the bad things that happen to other people in the world it makes me feel so helpless and sad. I just want to know if there are other people that feel this way, and if they were able to fix this problem or at least subdue it a little. If it matters, I am a 30 year old female. I am a little immature for my age and I live at home with my family for financial reasons, but I also live at home because I am afraid if I move out, something could happen to my family and I wouldn't be there to help them.",25Nov2018,1

99,"So, backstory, I'm female, my whole childhood I was chubby, and I really got picked on for it, especially in gym class. looking back I really wasn't half as bad as I thought I was weight-wise, but when you have mean kids, doctors, family, and sometimes random adults making subtle jabs at you about your weight constantly, you tend to feel 2x your actual size.

One time in elementary school I specifically remember we were playing soccer and I had the ball and there were people surrounding me, and I didn't know where to kick it, so the other team took it from me, and one nasty boy yelled ""why didn't you kick the ball, fat bitch?""

In middle school, they would make us dress out in front of everyone, you weren't even allowed to change in the bathroom stall, so I would always go to a shower that had three walls and one open end and change facing the wall, and I would still constantly get looks and kids whispering how gross I looked when they thought I couldn't hear them. I would see nasty kids pestering the fat kids just because they thought angry fat people are funny. I also often would have people make fun of me while we were playing whatever sports activity we had for they day in gym.

High school I never got messed with about my size, although the damage had been done, I feel like some days I am never not thinking about my body and how gross I am and how gross I feel, even if I'm just at home alone. Any time somebody is insulting a fat person or talking about obesity, my brain automatically assimilates it to them talking about me and how much they hate me because I am fat and how that's the reason I don't have many friends in real life.

I have had anxiety issues most of my life because of certain living situations I grew up in and the constant bullying I always dealt with. Some days every time I get hungry, I think about how I'm fat and how only fat people get hungry (even though I know it's an irrational thought) I can't even eat in front of people without being self-consious. It's like these things are deep rooted, I've tried the healthy positive self talk stuff, and I'm not even as bad as I have been in the past weight wise, but no matter what I try and no matter how much I remember it's irrational, I still can't get out of my mind how fat I am and how embarassing it is, and how the people who love me probably pity me and are secretly grossed out by me.  I feel like I am constantly worrying about a double chin or my pudgy belly and I'm always trying to hide it with my hands, or covering my mouth with my shirt when I'm lying down, or wearing baggy shirts so that I feel a little thinner. 

The idea of ever exercising in front of people or people knowing I'm exercising utterly terrifies me, I'll think about exercising and feel good thinking about running or something, but then my mind thinks about how gross I am and how everyone is gonna look and make fun of me and I just start crying and shaking and decide stay put and draw instead. However, if I am doing something that is exercise, but it is actually practical other than exercise (going up the stairs fast instead of taking the elevator, speedwalking places, etc.) I am fine and actually feel good about it, it's helped me keep my weight at least consistent. I think my weight fluctuates between the same numbers every year, I gain as soon as Halloween and the holidays hit, and I lose when spring comes around.

I don't really know the point of this, I was just really upset about myself today I guess and needed to vent, all I ever get when I vent to the people around me is ""you're not fat, stop thinking that"" or I get simple answers like ""well exercise,"" but I really think that this mind issue is gonna be here whether I am the size I am now or have the same body as a supermodel, so I just keep it to myself now. My self image is not really something I see changing, I do feel really good and sexy about myself sometimes, but these low hate myself moments really bother me and I feel like I can't be loved properly. Thanks for reading if you got through this jumbled mess.",25Nov2018,1
100,"Hi guys, first time posting here. I just really need to vent/ask for some advice here.

&amp;#x200B;

I have struggled with depression and anxiety before, but I have never experienced this kind of thing. It all started November last year; I was five months out of a shitty marriage, I lost my job, a month after my dog died of cancer, and I had to cut my toxic father out of my life. It was a lot to handle, to put it very mildly.

&amp;#x200B;

Well September of last year I started a new well paying job, I went on my first solo trip which was amazing, and everything was finally starting to look up. I was content in life. In November was when it set in; suddenly I felt like I was seeing life through a tunnet, or through a curtain. It felt like I was 20% concious, like being drunk without the fun parts. I got very worried and went to my GP; he ran some blood tests and asked me to take vitamin D. I did (still am), no change. I went back to my psychiatrist to treat it, he just told me to stop daydreaming, so I did. I read about it online, at it said that the more you think about it, the worse it gets (which is awesome...).

&amp;#x200B;

Well reddit, I am now officially a year out with this shit; I have a great job, I excel in my hobbies, have a good circle of friends, and I just entered into a relationship with the best person I have ever met. And the derealization is worse than ever. When I drink alkcohol I don't even know when I am drunk, I cannot discern it anymore, due to this constant feeling of being in a haze. No emotions truly pierce me, I feel maybe things at 10% intensity, and I feel like I am wasting my life.

&amp;#x200B;

How can this be mental? A part of me is scared that it is something physiological, but my doctor said nothing showed up in the bloodwork. Could it be something wrong with my brain? I've even started struggling a bit with my memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Whew, that turned into a garbled mess. I just really need to hear from other people who have delt with this. How do you make it easier?

I have dreams where I'm either in hospital or prison and I always seem to be fighting or doing something else violent. I seem to struggle with my breathing a bit more nowadays due to stress I assume (""but shit boi, you're only nineteen"" I hear you say). And my chest sometimes hurts.

Now I don't wanna seem like I'm just giving myself the answer, but if this sounds common for PTSD (I only mention this as a Doctor questioned it a couple years ago) then someone clarify please amigos.

I'm 20 and have had a difficult past 10 years, school bullying, depression, anxiety, and recently came out as transgender

I'm on meds for my depression and anxiety.


So I first noticed this happen when watching house MD, after watching the show through I started picking up houses traits, I'd act like him, talk, shout, and even started limping and rubbing my leg as if I was in pain, but of course I wasn't, my legs are fine

That was a couple years ago and now every time I watch a show or movie, for weeks after I'll act like the main character, think like them, etc etc

Even so far as to wish I was in their setting and story, to be them,

Last night I watched hacksaw ridge, after watching it I kept thinking about being in that war and do everything that happened I started to get really down bc I wasn't in that war bc I didn't have that life of Donald doss.

110,"It's winter and things suck. Things suck a bit more because I took on a lot of work, and now I'm currently drowning in it all, ON TOP of all the personal things I'm dealing with too. So I'm just gonna write, and maybe some of you lovelies can help shed some light on what's going on and or offer some advice. It's at a point where I'm struggling to get through day to day without having a good old cry. So... yeah.

* I'm at 24 year old student in the UK. I've been diagnosed with endogenous depression, generalised anxiety disorder, and the panic attacks that come along with that.
* I do a lot of student union things. I'm not doing it again next year, or at least, try not to. I ended up running a lot of fresher events by myself without any other help and I was physically exhausted by the first week of my university course (Chemistry). Lesson learned.
* I think due to that physical exhaustion, I put myself prone to my depression and anxiety flareups. Which happened. I had to take two weeks off, or rather, I spent two weeks in bed crying my eyes out because of exhaustion and not sure whether or not what I was doing was what I wanted to be doing.
* I still don't know to be honest. I wanted to apply to medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon. I can't because of my mental health difficulties. Trying to be a second rate version of yourself when you know you can be better is absolute shit (this has been my main crying session of today).
* I'm not sure what area of Chemistry I want to head into, but it's most likely organic synthesis or drug design so I can make better antidepressants, or I'll just end up working for the military. If I get through this degree.
* A guy I've been talking to since late August decided to cut things off. And then restart things. And now we're on a no talking thing, but I'm very confused emotionally because I'm absolutely head over heels for him. But I'm not in the right place to be thinking of a relationship, even if he would consider it.
* Throughout all of this, I'm getting maybe 1-3 hours of sleep a night. That does wonders for my mental space. 
* About a month ago, I had a severe self harming episode (29 Oct). Flatmate known as H came along after putting a lot of zinc oxide over a severely bleeding wound, and I probably would have yelled at her if I wasn’t disassociating the entire time. I ended up having to rip the tape off, wrap a towel around my arm and then make my way down to the hospital, and then H joined me. Her mother basically told her not to come to the hospital with me because it would set off her own anxiety. She did anyway.
* Flatmate H then decided to break up with her now ex-boyfriend J after this incident. I tell H that I feel she could have communicated it better, but I leave it at that (she does communicate it a week later, after some prompting from both myself and ex-boyfriend). Apparently this greatly offended her so she spent a week absolutely blanking me without telling me or at least trying to tell me and I was very confused, as she knows that I am always a very honest and blunt person no matter who I'm dealing with. But I'll admit, maybe shouldn't have said what I did.
* The ex-boyfriend J is a close friend of mine. I was upset because J basically has no other support network than myself and H, so I gave him a lot of therapy over Mario Kart about the breakup (because with my experience, they’re a bit shit, and I get on more with J than I do with H at this point). 
* My other flatmate, B, got a bit annoyed at me because he wasn't invited to the hospital (both H and J accompanied me, should have made that clearer...)
* ???
* It's not an event you RSVP to??
* A week later, B, who's on the same society as me questions my ability to act as a vice president because I've been in a depression relapse and mentally ill. Upset and angry because of this. 
* J and myself are playing Mario Kart one time, H bursts in, without acknowledging me and basically chats to him like I wasn't there (in my room???) so something feels a bit off. I sent a text over saying to H we could chat over tea etc to clear the air, because at this point, I have no clue what she's angry at me with, because with her, it can be anything.
* At the weekend, I was doing all my lab report work (I have noise cancelling headphones, my entire flat knows this) and apparently H was knocking for 30 minutes on my door, and then she just opened the door herself to tell me she’s frankly upset I didn’t stay neutral in her breakup, and that she’s found another place to live next year, and hopes we can remain ‘civil’. I could have been naked in my room after just having a shower and she just decides to burst in. I'm loving the boundaries in this flat.
* Pointed out in a text to her that she could have sent me a text to check I was in etc, or she could have talked to me before all of this. But that I'm happy to remain civil. That evening, everyone bar a couple of flatmates are in the kitchen. H is bitching about me, didn't realise my door was open at this point and I could hear. They all start joking about putting stuff in my food. Which is funny and banter until you realise it was about putting allergens into my food which can cause anaphylaxis. I get it's a joke. But it's fucking not. So I'm very very paranoid about feeding myself right now.
* Before all of this, I was very good friends with H, and when she had a wobbly last year, I ran down to her flat which was a 30 minute walk, to make sure she was okay after panic attacks and self harm episodes. I did exercise with her. I said we were going to have a plan to keep each other in check this year. And now... it's just ???
* I'm trying to get things sorted re my studying. I have meetings every two weeks with my GP and my tutor at uni, to make sure I'm okay and on track. Essentially, I'm not. I need to cover all of the material in the next three weeks because I then have a wisdom teeth surgery, then it's Christmas, and then the semester 1 exams.
* Throughout all of this, there have been a few occasions where I have gotten incredibly drunk and at risk, and I'm not happy with that. I need to stop drinking alcohol, but I also can't get to sleep without a drink or two now, and it's not good. My GP gave me sleeping meds at the beginning of the term, but doesn't want me on them long term.
* My dad is very supportive. In the last ten years, I've had to deal with mixes of depression/anxiety/self harm episodes along with minors in other things. So occasionally I have a two hour Facetime call to him, but each time I do, I'm starting to see the effect it's having on him because seeing your child suffer continuously is also a bit shit.
* Sometimes I'll have days where I'm studying through lecture material for a good 7-8 hours and then there's days like today where I'm so tired and physically exhausted I can't really move. But then I can't sleep for no apparent reason and it makes the cycle so much worse.
* Don't even get me started on how far up my overdraft I am (partly because of freshers, because things were a mess and I needed people to turn up and that was a way to do it, H told me the wrong type of printer we have so I ordered ink, the ink doesn't fit and now I can't get it reimbursed through DSA {disabled students allowance}, I did not own a winter coat until last week and that was expensive, I ended up purging my cupboard/fridge shelf because I don't trust anyone in my flat anymore, going on a trip to see family hometown in Europe and that cost money, gym membership because I was going to be doing a lot of swimming until my self harm episode).
* I need desperately a form of income to help me stabilise my bank account but also keep me afloat whilst at university. I'm thinking my photography (portrait/floral macros) but not sure how to go about this, or selling my knitting products.
* My GP is recommending I see a private psych team because let's be honest, mental health in the NHS is not the best whatsoever. But that also costs money. A lot of money. Which I don't have.
* So I'm just stuck in limbo trying to juggle everything with a lot of crying and blankets and hot chocolate and exhaustion involved.
* I don't know how to keep going. I don't think I've ever been in remission from my depression and that's really sad to realise, looking at my medical records. Knowing that I most likely have this for life. 
* I just don't know what I'm really doing with my life right now and I'm just doing what others expect of me. Which I don't want to be doing, because I want to do something that I am motivated for and excited about. I do love Chemistry, and I love the scientific processes I'm going through, but when I'm going through a relapse like this, it's difficult.

So I'm just... a bit clueless on how to approach and handle all of this. I do mediation. I do yoga (when my wrist isn't screwed up from self harming). I take my meds. I use a SAD lamp. I socialise. All those typical things people tell you to do when we're depressed. And yet... we're still here. If anyone has any advice, I love you and think you're a wonderful human being.

113,"Background:  I have advanced degrees, held professional jobs and have traveled around the world for business.  Due to a protracted career transition and resulting GAD/depression, I attended a group therapy offered by a hospital early this year.  I asked a CBT question the way I would have in any classroom setting, but was repeatedly put down in the next couple of months by counselor S (RSW) when she was not able to answer my question.  She berated other patients as well.  My family doctor learnt about my experience and requested the hospital assign another counselor to me for 1:1 sessions.

So I went to see counselor Y (RSW) for the first time this past Oct.  There are a number of things that make me dread of seeing her again.

1. At the beginning of the session, she asked about the incident with counselor S and responded ""She (Y) is the team lead.  Thanks for the feedback.""  During the session, I talked about traumatic life experience and my vulnerability.  At the end of the session, she made a comment in high pitch voice ""regarding S, I was not there.  I don't know what took place.  Counseling is not about knowledge, it is about relationship.""  I felt betrayed, angry, and fearful that I was speechless.
2. When I talked about traumatic life experience, I mentioned that I had come to realization about human nature that made me stronger.  She said ""I am not being judgmental.  I am several years older than you.""  and then she went on preaching her personal worldview and values.  I found her condescending and controlling, and myself feeling more inadequate.

I will have another appointment at the beginning of Jan, with her and the psychotherapist at the clinics to finalize the assessment and treatment plan.  Then I will be supposed to see her 1:1 for 12 sessions.

115,"I've tried to hide from myself with video games and pot. I've never liked myself in any capacity, but I've tried to push through it. Everyday I wake up tired and don't have anything to look forward too. Even the things I've enjoyed doing leave me more empty everytime.
I don't have any close friends. I've tried going out and meeting new people, trying new things, and nothing makes me feel content anymore.
I've failed at the things I've tried to do. I don't even want to leave my room because I can't deal with embarrassing myself over simple conversations; just being thoughtful doesn't help because I can never think of anything remotely intelligent to say.
I haven't had pot or video games in a few days. Now that I can see my antisocial reality, I can't help but want it all to stop. But I don't know how to be content I've tried bettering myself, but I'm honestly getting tired of this uphill battle.

116,"I've been sitting on a critical submission for work for a week. I've never been more on top of my self-care, cleaning, errands, backburner chores, and the moldier items on my to-do list. Without that critical submission stressing me, I would look like I'm suffering clinical depression wallowing in problems I could solve in a day.

This always happens. Urgent tasks trump Important tasks regardless of the importance of the urgent task. Low importance tasks trump Urgent tasks regardless of their importance. Nothing gets done without something higher on my to-do list plugging that top spot. Knowing of a more urgent/important task pumps me full of motivation to do the less urgent/important tasks. A lot of important tasks never get done until a more urgent or important task ""dislodges"" them from the invisible barrier.

I've been sober for a few years, but I drank because it lowers the invisible barrier. So does sleep deprivation, nicotine, and the presence of others (I will work until I drop of exhaustion if other people are also there working).

123,"I have a heightened sensibility, which can trigger a strong anxiety in me. There is a woman I find attractive and who can make me feel very relaxed. But the problem is, she enjoys manipulating others.

She plays with words in a way that can create a deep fear in me. I think her intention is actually to make me aroused, but in reality, it just freaks me out and makes me more distant from her.

I have a special kind of medication that I take when she triggers me. It makes me feel calm and makes me leave her dark mind world and enter my own normal life.

The mind games take place mostly at work, so it’s highly invasive. They reduce my capacity to cope with stress and if it wasn’t for the medication...

They just make me lethargic and create feelings of hopelessness.

It’s horrible to see her in such a dark light. But I know what is real. She would probably deny all of it. But I know what is real. I have studied reality through the last four years of therapy.

Is she even aware that she is harming me?

She doesn’t seem to understand the concept of consent either. No, you don’t get to call me “toy” or compare me to any other inanimate object. That’s why I told her to stay out of my life. But now she is back somehow. She summoned me.

To what extent this woman’s symptoms is a product of emotional abuse (from her family I presume) or if she is borderline and dissociating, which then transfers to me, I am not sure. There is either a tendency toward sociopathy or schizophrenia in her.

It’s quite possible that my fear is exaggerating toward the worst case, that she has no empathy. It could also be due to a schizoid personality that she cannot read social situations very accurately, or why she says the excact opposite of what she is thinking (to her self) and feeling. A classic example of depersonalization.

A mental health specialist thinks she has greater problems than I ever did and that she lacks awareness of her mental illness.

I have seen her embarrased and I have seen her scared. This would speak against sociopathy. But manipulation could still be a borderline personality element. Alternatively, she is schizophrenic or otherwise experiences depersonalization and dissociation.

I think she needs treatment. She seems better in some ways, but worse in others.

I really care about her and I wish to help her. She sometimes suffers from depressions. She doesn’t know that I know. But I have felt some of them. Even when she wasn’t at work. So many times I have been tempted to comfort her. But I was too scared, because I did not yet understand her.

I have decided that I want to help her, but I have a gut feeling that she doesn’t want to talk about it. She also has very strong positive sides, but whenever I tell her, she doesn’t believe me. (I rarely give praise to others!)

She means a lot to me. But I also have to stand my ground.

Still, she means a lot to me....

For background, I'm 21+ and live in the US. I have a puppy and a mother. 

But my mom today decided she'd take my puppy for a walk and not tell me... I went looking for my puppy because she was being awfully quiet and with her that means she's into something she shouldn't be in.  So I stepped out and asked my dad if he'd seen them, and looked around a little for myself. Didn't see them so I went in and searched around the house to see if my mom was hiding with her to be a jerk. Couldn't find them and it had been several minutes at that point, so I checked a couple more rooms. Grabbed my kitty for comfort and started wondering if I actually had a puppy and a mother, or if I was delusional and my dad was just playing along with everything I was saying/doing. I started walking to see if I could find them and my sister called and I told her what was happening, she reassured me that I did indeed have a puppy and that I wasn't delusional. My mom texts to say she's home and I get back in a grab my puppy. 

But for a good 10 minutes I thought I was delusional about having a mother, a puppy, and just about life in general. My first reaction to my friend responding to a text was ""thank goodness you're real!"" Because what if they weren't and was all a part of this grand delusion?",25Nov2018,1

Or, I will have thoughts about ""the mark of the beast"" right before I do something and I will have to tell myself I am not taking it. I also heavy compulse about past experiences that were small and I have to tell myself it isn't that big of a deal. 

   I have tried telling my mom about it and she seems to think I am probably schizophrenic, although she hasn't said it. I told her that I feel like my intrusive thoughts are driving me insane and I don't want to end up with Schizophrenia.

First, I've been unable to deal with my phone lately. I have over 50 unread texts, I haven't saved any of the numbers of the people I'm texting...my phone is a hot, unorganized mess. This last Weds, two different managers at two different jobs text me to ask if I could work. Keep in mind, neither of their #'s are saved. I just assumed it was the same guy for some reason and basically told both jobs that I would work on that day. So I'm at job A, unaware of my mistake, and manager at job B text me and asked if I was okay. I go back through my texts and realize oh shit! Now it's Sunday, 4 days later, and I still haven't responded after basically no-call/no-showing because I'm super anxious about it. What do I say to him? How do I fix this??

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Next, I just moved to a new town 2 months ago. Right away I met this girl and we just clicked. She helped me unpack, gave me stuff for my apt, and started inviting me to her home church every sun. She told me on several occasions that she was super happy that we were friends and I felt like she genuinely enjoyed being around me. Here's where my anxiety kicks in-- she's a church friend, and I love God, but I also have kind of an inappropriate sense of humor. I struggle with wondering if I should stop making jokes like that in general or if I should accept that that's me and my personality. Anywho, I made a couple of jokes on separate occasions that I think maybe rubbed this girl the wrong way. About a month into us hanging out, one of our mutual friends kissed me. I called her and told her about it thinking sharing this would make us even closer. That's when I felt her totally start to distance herself from me. She didn't text me a ton before, but now she isn't texting me at all. This could all totally be in my head but should I text her and ask her if I'm crazy and if she's been distant? I've lost a lot of friends over the last few years and I don't want to lose another one over something that could potentially be talked out. On the other hand, I'm really afraid her response will be something along the lines of her not wanting to be friends anymore. I guess knowing the truth would be best but I have serious rejection issues and this would really hurt me. :( So do I text her or not?",25Nov2018,1

We do nothing but fight because half of what she says is irrational and makes no sense. I know your supposed to stand by people with mental illness and things like “your illness is hurting me and affecting me” blah blah is wrong, but I can’t help but feel that way. I do not think I am able to handle her at this point. She has said “I need constant affirmation I need people to agree with me so i know I’m not crazy” and “all you ever do is disagree with me you’re always on his side” but I just think his side is more rational and makes more sense. This post might not even make any sense but I just don’t know what I’m doing anymore. ",25Nov2018,1
136,"I'm a thinker, as are many other people here, im sure. I'm always analysing things and overthinking. I started a new job at the beginning of this year, my first actual full time job. I was overwhelmed and struggled to settle in, I didnt, and still dont really feel like i deserve to be there, and always overthink even the smallest things that happen in work. Anyway, last week I had a good week (work-wise), I got a lot of stuff done and actually felt like i was 'worthy?' (idk if thats the right word) of being there. But because work was going well, my mind wasn't doing what its been used to doing - worrying about work, so i was looking for other things to worry about instead, not by choice. I've convinced myself that I'm going to die alone. I've kind of pissed myself off, because I know I should be happy at having a good week in work, but this weekend all I did was lay in bed, drink too much and watch shit on youtube thinking about how disgusting I am and how shit everything is going to be in my future when i won't have a family of my own. I feel like my mind is my own enemy, I wish for things to go well in work because thats my priority at the moment, I'm focusing on doing the best I can at everything I do, and when things do go well, I cant accept it, and I just beat myself up for something else instead.

Sometimes when my anxiety or depression gets really bad, the logical part of my brain just stops functioning. It’s like I go into a trance and the only part of me that works is my body. Occasionally when I switch into this brain fog I get in my car and don’t stop driving until I hit the ocean. When I finally park and get out, I realize I’m three hours from home. It’s almost like I’m sleepwalking. I just got back from one of these brain fog trips to the ocean, and I’m wondering if I should be worried. Sometimes when it happens I’ll just sit in bed for an hour or so, but lately all I’ve wanted to do is drive when I get into that state. 
Does this happen to anyone else? How do you deal with it? Is there something really wrong with me? ",25Nov2018,1
138,"This is my first post on r/mentalhealth and I'm not very good with people even though some of you may have seen my posts.  I've been extremely stressed out lately and I need to figure out WTF is going on in my head.

So, I'll give you as brief a summary as I can do I don't waste anyone's time.  I'm a veteran who goes to therapy but has no benefits, memory loss out the ass, two diagnoses with 10 sub-classes each, I'm irritable most of the time, I'm aggressive and my wife is currently saying she's gonna leave me because she can't deal with my issues (even though that's not even the real reason for that).  I do have a second personality that doesn't normally emerge but has taken control forcibly in the past.  I'm fairly certain that's not the issue here as I've been keeping my guard up.  Not an impossibility.  Stress eats me alive and there has been a lot of it lately. 

I try to be the best person I can be but how do I deal with the fact that, in my eyes, my wife, who is 24, is acting like a fucking kid and she's assuming things that aren't true, she doesn't listen to anyone because she's too damn smart for her own good and I'm almost to the point where I don't want to even be around her.  I love this woman.  We just celebrated our first anniversary.  Why now are my mental health issues too much?  I get that things grind on you but how do you think I feel about having to live with my mental health!?  Ugh...  Sorry.  

Look, I'm confused and stressed and upset but...  I don't feel like I think I should.  Should I be crying and begging her to stay or am I alright?  I guess my request to you, Reddit, is this: Can someone tell me if I'm the monster here?

139,"Ever since I was 12 years old, I've been medicated with antidepressants. I have anxiety and depression. I'm now 24 and have been medicated for a very long time.

At age 18 I put on Risperidone 2mg, which I really hate. The drug is impossible to get off of. Last time I tried it was so painful I only lasted a little over a week. My psychiatrist said it wasn't withdrawal but rather the depression coming back

Currently on Risperidone 2mg, Mirtazapine 15mg.

I dropped Cymbalta about 7 months ago, I was trying to get off of all the medications. Guess that was a mistake..

And Jesus, I've been in a living hell. Last week I went to New Orleans with my mother and I was just so miserable and depressed. During our drive I cried and cried. I cried during dinner, during a hotel room. When we got back home the next day I cried and cried. I felt horrible pains and vibrations through out my chest.

I remember seeing a magician with my mother, and I was in so much pain that I just felt like crying.

Am I just so used to medications that I will NEVER be able to get off of them?

Also, I've been feeling a big heavy pain in my chest. And just waves upon waves of sadness and despair. Waking up in the morning is very painful. Everything is painful and I'm just in a lot of pain.

My therapist said it was anxiety in my chest.

I was and still am, feeling intense desires for suicide.

Right now, NOTHING makes me happy or feels good. Even getting a beer and drinking with friends doesn't feel good. NOTHING feels good. Not even petting my cute chihuahua or cat. I just feel so fucking miserable. I feel like I'm not alive.

Two nights ago, I kept waking up in the middle of night in complete distress and despair. I just felt massive amounts of sadness that would not go away. It was horribly painful psychologically. Even physically it was painful, it just felt so uncomfortable.

I can't even focus or do anything. Even going to the movies isn't fun anymore. Nothing is fun anymore. Not even drawing in my sketchbook.

Am I just going to be medicated for the rest of my life or something? Do I NEED medication just to live my life?

So I decided to start taking Zoloft. I started with 50mg and this is my second day on it. I just take it in the morning. I don't know if it's possible but I've been sleeping better already.

I'm scared of weight gain.

Also, I'm a virgin. I watched way too much fucked up fetish porn growing up. I then joined NoFap and stopped watching porn. On day 60 without masturbating. I'm just worried about meeting a nice girl someday and not being able to please her or something.

Right now, I'm still in a lot of pain. Things are just really hard right now. I can't really do anything. I feel defeated and weak.

Am I going to be on this medication forever? That's what I'm worried about, is just being on this medication forever.

Also, is it okay to go have a beer with friends and have a good time while on all these medications? It's not like I drink until I black out or anything or even drink every week. Is having a beer once a week still...not okay? Am I just going to have to stop drinking completely?

Also, is it okay to just smoke a little weed sometimes out with friends? I pretty much stopped smoking because it wasn't doing me any good. But if I hang out with friends, can I hit their vape pen? Would that just be okay?

Also, what about kratom? I sometimes take kratom, but I'm wondering if that is dangerous being on all these medications? It just sucks really.

I tried to become med free, but yet hear I am...in complete agony.

Both my family and friends want me to get off of this stuff. My sister says I don't need it.

Yet my therapist says I do need to be on risperidone and that it helps me focus.

I really didn't want to take Zoloft, but I'm in so much pain that I think I just need to in order just to live my life.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

141,"I am struggling heavily in choosing a new insurance plan for 2019. I am using the open marketplace (through the government website) to try and find a plan, but it's so difficult to find plans for the issues I need covered.

&amp;#x200B;

A few details:

I am under 26, but my parents are retired and are on Medicaid, so I have had to find my own insurance for the last few years, as I'm not a student.

I live in Michigan.

I make less than $30,000 a year, but too much to qualify for additional government help, other than the tax credits.

I almost never need to see a primary care physician (I don't even have a regular doctor I've seen in years). If I've gotten sick to the point of needing prescription medicine/antibiotics, I go to an urgent care clinic because their prices are cheaper.

I'm leaning toward a silver plan, although more expensive, because it seems I'd have to pay less in order to see a mental health service provider on a regular basis (as opposed to choosing a bronze plan, where it seems I'd be paying my premium+all fees associated with the doctor/prescriptions until I'd reach the deductible \[generally $6000-$8000 in the bronze plans I've come across\])

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest issue:

I have never seen a doctor regarding mental health issues before. I am not officially diagnosed with anything, by anyone, ever. This was mostly due to my parents not recognizing that I needed help as a child/not recognizing that mental illnesses are actually problems people suffer from (they still don't know how deep this goes for me, but I'm not here to dwell on this). The last two years I just chose cheap plans because it was all I could afford, which made specialists/mental health care extremely expensive. 

&amp;#x200B;

2018 has been the worst year I have had in terms of my illnesses (obviously I'm self-diagnosing, but I am %99.99 percent sure that I suffer from major anxiety and depression issues). I need to get help. I don't know if I'll make it through 2019 without starting the process of finding care for myself, seeing a therapist/doctor, taking medication, etc. I don't know WHAT I need, but I know I need help.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice on how to go about choosing a plan, specifically for mental health coverage? I don't know where to start, because I don't have a specific doctor or prescriptions I need covered; I just need help, and help that's not going to bankrupt me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I've never had mental health care coverage, but know that I will need it in 2019, and I need help finding an insurance plan that will meet this need.",25Nov2018,1
142,"so i moved to an actually good ""family home"" or foster family or whatever, it's just that i'm completely fucked...

i just don't give a fuck anymore, i don't feel depressed anymore, i don't feel any emotions or give a fuck about anything. i sit in front of the mirror and train how to smile or look angry,sad etc... \*i don't do it as often cuz i'm very good at it now\*

ye i'm pretty fucked up, i've pretty much been traumatized my entire life and never got help \*still to this day\* i'm gonna go to a trauma specialist soon, but i just don't feel the need to... i honestly think that emotions make you weak/vulnerable.

in a way, i actually prefer being like this.

i do have some kind of ptsd but it doesn't really affect me.

all i do now is make people teach me what they know \*how to do stuff or info about other things\*, i've pretty much mastered how to make people trust me and tell me fking everything.

i want to keep learning stuff, i do help those people mentally cuz they become very open to me and i've got some experience. i've been abused physically and emotionally and i've had too many mental problems as far as my memory could go, i've had to deal with all kinds of people and their lives.  i don't care much about how their life is going but they've got knowledge that i want. i guess not feeling shit is a good thing in a way, cuz i've pretty much answered all the questions i've had about life. i'm pretty sure i'm not a sociopath btw. should i go to that appointment? idk if it'll help with anything... i'm gonna be 17yo on 1st of January so idk if it's too late.

143," Man I have had ocd and anxiety problems for years,portioning to many different [things.one](https://things.one)  of the things that stumps me is this fear of the sleep.When I was  younger I used to get panic attacks at night,I would be ok during the day,then they would start at night time. it actually was fucking scary. then once it passed I was still scared of going to bed when   
 I was ten for a few years.  I used to be scared to go to bed in general,It always would bother me,I developed a fear of dying in my sleep.OR many times I WOULD be scared to shut my eyes. In the winter of 2015,I read up on something where it was a condition where people died in there sleep or something.I was terrified to sleep,although it didnt really interrupt my sleep,that much it still fucked me up alot. then fast forward to the summer Of 2016,the same fear of dying in my sleep bothered [me .](https://me.IT)  finally it took alot,but by the end of august I got rid of it.Then I somehow I read up on some urban legends where Somehow you can summon demons in your dreams.They still bother me I dont get it,I get paranoid that a demon is gonna attack me in my dreams or come in my dreams.I feel more worried that I will get a dream like that and i will go nuts after that. I feel like I CANT open up to anybody about this.but IT always goes and comes back.I will also look up on these rituals and get paranoid about [it.it](https://it.it) actually led to big problems in my life. I Have so many problems mentally man  I feel like shit.I think this started one time when I was younger I had a panic attack and And thought I was dying so They took me to the hospital via ambulance.I like mentioned was scared to go to bed alone for a while.Maybe thats why.",25Nov2018,1
144,"I know I'll probably be hated for saying this, but here's the truth:

I have an impulse control issue that will manifest with me stealing small items I don't need from stores, or doing other compulsive habits like pulling my hair out (trichotillomania). I've struggled with both since childhood.

I HATE myself for these behaviors, especially stealing. I find it morally reprehensible. I'm deeply ashamed of myself. I desperately want to stop.

I'm seeing a therapist, I'm on meds that are supposed to reduce the urge (I don't think they help), but it's still something I struggle with.

I'm not a bad person. I've spent my whole career working with special needs kids. I'm a loving partner and mother. I end up donating all of the stuff I steal because I'm overcome with guilt. (Not justifying it at all, just saying I don't even personally benefit.) So I'm am overall good person, but I do this thing that's absolutely horrendous! Why? Am I a terrible person? I sure feel like it.

Perhaps I'm asking the wrong sub. I didn't know where to talk about this. Part of me wants y'all to know that some of us are decent people who desperately want to stop what they're doing.

""Just stop!"". If anyone's struggled with any addiction or bad habit, you know that's easier said than done.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Please be gentle if you can. I'm in a very deep depression about this already; I'm fully aware that I'm a POS.",25Nov2018,1
