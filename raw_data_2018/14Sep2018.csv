0,"I recently discovered that I gained another 10 pounds. I was absolutely devastated. My weight has been literally a life-long struggle (19 yrs old). The day I found out, my head filled up with self-hatred. My mind would call me things like ‚Äúmentally ill scum,‚Äù or ‚Äúcandy whore.‚Äù I wrote some graphic things in my journal about how I just felt like I wanted to make cuts on my belly, or carve up my body and throw bloody, fatty chunks of flesh into the trash can. I‚Äôve cut and scratched myself before, but not out of self-loathing, and nothing as extreme as what I wrote. Frankly, I scared myself a little with how graphic my journal entry was.

I‚Äôm not at risk of actually doing those things right now, but when I get anxious or worked up, the impulses become very strong. I‚Äôm concerned that one day I may actually start cutting myself on my tummy, or worse.

I just feel like I want to punish myself out of self-hatred. What should I do?",14Sep2018,2,
1,"Hello everyone, 
I dont know if this fits in here, but I hope someone knows what's up with me and can help me. I don't know if it's just psychological, but I actually had some medicinical checks already.

Before I begin my story, let me first tell you, that I smoked weed for a couple of years and had never problems with it, or alcohol, or both at the same time.

Alright. The issues began in December 2016. I was having a nice evening with a friend, smoked some weed and drank a little bit alcohol. We were at a bar, and just went out to have another smoke. Then it begun. Everything was turning and was feeling pretty bad. But I thought nothing of it. I sat down and after they finished, we went inside again. But everything was still turning and I was feeling sick. I sat down on a chair and the next thing I remember was me, lying on the ground and everyone was standing around me looking worried. My whole body was weak and my muscels went lose, so I pissed myself. Great.
I went to the hospital a few days later and they said everything was alright. So thought nothing of it.

Fast forward to September 2017. The last months after the incident, I wasn't drinking anymore and smoked weed about two times, without problems. It was my birthday, and I thought, yeah looks like everything is alright, so why don't you smoke a bit. Well that wasn't a good idea, the same thing happened again, but this time outside already. I was prepared, layed down when I felt sick and... Woke up again with wet pants. 

If I need to explain how I felt when waking up... Everything was blurry, I felt like I had a bad dream and wanted to wake up, stand up, but couldn't. It was really noisy, but I couldn't understand a thing. This went on for a couple of seconds until I got clear vision.

Since this second incident, I randomly get the feeling that I will blackout again. I really need to concentrate that this won't happen. I found out that it helps to drink some cold water.
This won't happen when I'm alone at home, it most of the times happens when I'm with other people. Eating at a busy or loud place. It also happens when I go work out, mostly at the end of it, when I'm close to be done. But because of this I need to quit earlier, because I don't want to pass out again.
I haven't drank alcohol and smoked weed since. It's healthy that way, but I would like to have a beer with my friends again. But the moment I sip on alcohol, i get circulation problems again.  
Back to the problems I get when I'm with other people. I observed myself to try to find out what's the trigger. I think I enter a state of dreaming sometimes. I can't explain it well. Everything gets blurry and I barely understand a word they say because it sounds like a different language. When the problems start, I try to ignore them, but this includes that I think about them, so it gets worse. And this leads to the feeling of my eyes turning back into my head, like falling over backwards. 

I had some medical checks the last few months. I got a long term ECG, got my blood checked but both was positive. The only thing mentionable is that my iron value was low. Now below the recommendated, but close to it. This was two months ago and I'm taking iron tablets every evening, without feeling better.

I want my old life back. Since the incident two years ago nothing is like it was before. I'm never going out anymore, am afraid of going to noisy, full places and I can't workout without being afraid of passing out. The fear is always there that this will happen again.

Does anyone knows what's up with me? I have no clue, and the doctors can't help me either. I thought about this being completely psychological, and that's why I'm posting this in here.

Thanks to everyone in advance, who reads this and tries to help me!!

Ah and some physical stats about me, if relevant. I'm 26 years old, pretty tall and normal weighted, healthy relationship, studying.",14Sep2018,2,

3,"My brother was Schizophrenic. He would self medicate with drugs and alcohol. He passed away 4 years ago and unfortunately we don‚Äôt know for sure what the cause was (long story).

He passed away years ago and my dad held a funeral because the family didn‚Äôt have money for one. Anyway, he also added in about his 2 cousins (his Aunt and Uncle‚Äôs kids).

4,"So now that I‚Äôm thinking about it writing this post I may have a lot more mental issues than I thought, but maybe they‚Äôre all stemming just from stress and are easily curable or maybe they‚Äôre something I need to seek guidance with. My symptoms/issues/whatever are:     
  
**Occasional sleep psychosis.**.   
I‚Äôll occasionally see or hear shit when I‚Äôm in a dark room trying to sleep. I‚Äôll see shapes of people that are just a sweater hanging weird, my chair, a reflection etc. This happens pretty infrequently but when it does I can‚Äôt sleep until I basically paaaasss out. I know this is typically linked with exhaustion but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been only sleep deprived on all of the occasions where this has happened.    
  
**OCD/Anxiety?**.  
  
A good example of this is at my previous job we had to have our phones in a locker in a separate room. I‚Äôd take several very quick breaks each day to go check my locker and make sure it was there/locked. I‚Äôll even tug on it pretty hard after locking it to make sure it clicked. Even after doing this though I‚Äôll go back to my desk and 30 seconds later have an overwhelming urge to go check it.   
I also occasionally go and double check my door to make sure it‚Äôs locked after leaving the house in case I forgot and I usually check the lock to make sure it‚Äôs locked before I go to sleep as well.    
When I have my phone in my bag (whether I‚Äôm hiking/mountain biking etc) I‚Äôll reach back and feel for it to make sure it‚Äôs still there occasionally. I‚Äôll do this with keys, wallet etc as well. Side note: the main reason I care so much about my keys is that before my girlfriend and I started dating I forgot my keys with her and she returned it with this little anime girl on it. I‚Äôd be devastated if I lost it. I also dislike losing anything she gives me even if it‚Äôs something simple like hair ties. Idk if this is just love but things she gives me are exceptionally special. I have an abnormal attachment to them. (Though I won‚Äôt cry if I lose an elastic or something, I‚Äôd be quite upset if I lost the key pendant though).     
  
**Depression.**.  
  
I have occasional spouts of what I believe to be depression. I‚Äôve had a somewhat normal life I believe but idk...   
I‚Äôm 21 and haven‚Äôt started post secondary which fucking terrifies me. I know I won‚Äôt be like that forever but the possibility scares me...I just don‚Äôt know what I want to do. I can‚Äôt find a passion.    
I was pretty depressed through high school and then through graduation. It was pretty dormant from the age of 17 to 20 but around 20 years old I started working a factory job for around 6 months. At this point my close friend since childhood and coworker became quite depressed as well. We then had the funds to drink a whole lot and commence in other illegal activities. I‚Äôm very fortunate to not have a particularly addictive personality (ADHD may have saved me here)    
After 6 months him and I left this job and had more or less no money to show for it despite making like $13000 through the span of working there.    
My girlfriend really fucking saved me here. She has extreme anxiety and depression but she makes me feel so safe.    
   

  
**General paranoia**.  
  Overall I dislike dark rooms (other than my bedroom which is usually pretty dark with the blinds closed most of the way.)     
It‚Äôs mostly stuff like basements or dark doorways/hallways that kinda make me uneasy (even my own kitchen at night. I don‚Äôt particularly like walking past my bathroom when the light is off either. I also dislike opening doors to rooms that have the light off)   
Despite this every single time I walk past a dark room I have to look into it.    
  
I‚Äôm also in a somewhat unfamiliar house for the next 4 days. I have a dog with me (dog/housesitting) but it‚Äôs still kind of eerie and I have the basement light on at all times because I can see the basement from the living room and there‚Äôs no door on it. I‚Äôm slightly uneasy when walking into a dark part or to go see the dog. I have the place where the dog sleeps dimly lit as well.    
  
I also might have a slight separation anxiety or again, this could just be something that comes with being in love. I get (probably) unreasonably worried when she doesn‚Äôt text me when she gets home each night or gets busy when arriving at home and takes an extra hour or two when messaging me. I would just like to know in general where she is so I know she‚Äôs safe so if I know she should be home at 1030 if she doesn‚Äôt text me until midnight (or even the morning if she passes out) I get pretty worried. Though if I know she‚Äôs extremely tired and she doesn‚Äôt message me I usually assume she‚Äôs asleep. I know that 99.9% of the time she‚Äôs okay but I just can‚Äôt fully convince myself.      
This doesn‚Äôt happen with any other person, just my girlfriend.     
     
I also have an occasional anxiety attack. I don‚Äôt start hyperventilating or anything but I‚Äôll just feel sick and nothing can fix it. Usually this is caused by my girlfriend not texting me for hours when I don‚Äôt know where she is. It also happens occasionally when I think about school or money, though I just turned 21.     
   
I think that‚Äôs mostly it though there might be a little more that I‚Äôm just not thinking of.    
Any possible explanations:    
I took concerta for ADHD as a child for a few years.    
I had a pretty traumatic experience as a child where I was locked in a basement (I don‚Äôt remember how long. Could‚Äôve been 30‚Äôseconds or an hour. I was very young) because I was fucking around and my mom wanted me to come upstairs and I kept refusing so she just shut the door and I immediately went ballistic, I hated it. I borderline refused to go in any basement alone for a long time after that and very rarely can I convince myself to go in my basement alone at night. (It‚Äôs unfinished with a lot of dark corners, it‚Äôs actually kinda spooky)    
I was scared of the dark for a very long time after this.    
  
As a kid (like 8y/o-13y/o, maybe slightly different) I used to sleep in the living room on the couch because A) I didn‚Äôt find the couch particularly uncomfortable B) it was centralized in my house and I didn‚Äôt want to sleep upstairs alone.   
One night I woke up with a pretty vivid dream where I was sitting next to my dog and he was staring at a corner. I stood up and directed my attention to the corner and there was an elderly man with an older looking dog just standing at the bottom of the stairs looking back at us. Nothing happened but I could swear it was real.   
  
My mom also loved watching horror movies when I was younger. I was probably between the age of 6 and 13. My little sister, mom and step dad loved them despite me being absolutely terrified and continued to watch them anyways. Not sure if this was selfishness or tough love but it‚Äôs safe to say it probably fucked me up a little bit (note: my mother is a very good person to me and would never intentionally harm me. I‚Äôm the clear favourite of her 3 kids and the oldest.).    
   
As I mentioned, I had a step dad. My biological father was a criminal and honestly, just a dumbass.   
He worked very hard to take care of my mom and I until I turned about 3 and his alcoholism kinda took over. He started getting caught for petty theft, disorderly conduct, public intoxication etc and abused my mother once I believe. He was jailed for most of my childhood and I more or less disowned him and cut off his side of the family. He‚Äôs been homeless a few times and got into much more serious crime.

8,"First time ever writing something like this so I'm very unsure how exactly this will be structured.

For sometime I have been playing with the notion of possibly seeing someone about what I believe are a bundle of problems I have been having, however due to my job I have never done so as having my mental health questioned would basically result in my losing my job, which I certainly cannot risk.

&amp;#x200B;

I will list what I believe my current issues are and a brief outline around them.

\-Compulsive lying. My entire persona is based around whatever lies I can tell to make myself sound more interesting, I will willingly lie to get what I want no matter the emotional damage this may cause, I've never felt guilty over this, even when my actions lead to someone else suffering. I just view everything in terms of 'how can I get what I want'. I know rationally that I SHOULD feel bad and I try to embed a feeling of guilt within myself but at the end of it all I just don't really care. My life at this point is a series of lies that I've told those around me in order to function. (Pretended I went to Uni for 3 years to my family, lied about jobs I've had, lied about my finances, lied about my daily life, lied in order to get vast sums of money (Thousands of pounds).

&amp;#x200B;

\-Bouts of happiness and depression. I swing between serious feelings of elation, feelings where I go out and spend vast sums of money on trivial things and feeling like I can rule the world given the time. Endless streams of motivation and a deep desire to make those around me happy and to like me. Then I swing right back to hating those around me, not wanting to talk to them and actively attempting to ruin things for them, hating when they succeed and trying to claw anyone to my level. Feelings of intense worthlessness directed both inward and outward. I fail to see any reason or point (One main slump causing me to flunk out of my GCSE's many years back) I'll sleep for 16-18 hours a day other times I'll exist on 2-4 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Confusing sexual urges. I initially never found normal 'vanilla' porn arousing to any real degree. However recently I find that I can really only masturbate to images of dead women. I fantasise about eating / killing / raping one. I know that I;d never actually act on this as it is illegal however I suppose a persons sexual inclinations are like that? I have had opportunities to have sex however I have never overly enjoyed it and seldom find myself able to get erect without thinking about the situation as her not wanting it (Just to be clear, any partner I have been with has been consensual). 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Relationships. I have only had a single 'real' relationship and I know that I only remain with her because he hardly see each other and even then I flit between outward hate of her and a more childish glee when she's around. I always exist in a state of hot or cold with her. I don't have any friends due to many of them not being able to get what I want. People tend to find me funny and somewhat charming to a degree however I never have any intention of getting to know them and generally consider people with disdain. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Self. I fail to fully understand myself in the respect that I don't really 'get' being real. I suppose its rather hard to explain but it's sort of like looking in a foggy mirror, there's an idea of what you're looking at but the details feel blurred and open for interpretation. I exist but my capacity for existence confuses me, I fail to view people I see as being alive. They come and go but their purpose beyond their interactions with me elude me, they don't seem to be 'alive'. I'm fully aware of sensation but at times I feel like i'm walking in mud or looking through fog.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a student at OSU studying depression and the process of getting help for my senior thesis. A lot of my friends and loved ones are struggling with this mental illness, and having never personally experienced this, I would greatly appreciate hearing from you if you are willing to share. Your story is immensely important. Together we can identify patters and issues within the current system of seeking treatment, to build a better solution. 

Please feel free to comment on what you have found to be the biggest pain points during your process of getting help. What, if anything, has helped you during a particularly low point in your life? Any feedback is GREAT. I understand it is not an easy thing to talk about so the effort and bravery that goes into telling your story is not lost on me.

Also, If you could take a couple minutes out of your day to take this short, anonymous survey it would be a huge help!

11,"I‚Äôve suffered from depression in the past, I‚Äôm well aware of it and how it affects me...

But recently I realized that I mainly/consistently feel depressed around certain people, after interacting with certain people, and certain scenarios (all interrelated), and that got me thinking... maybe I‚Äôm not as depressed as I thought... and maybe I‚Äôm just surrounded by negative people?? 

I mean I will be by myself during most of the day, and I‚Äôll feel okay, like I know I‚Äôm working on myself, I feel like I‚Äôm progressing and improving, and like I‚Äôm getting a grip on my life...or at least taking the right steps to do so (therapy, healthy lifestyle, exercise, etc)

Then these certain people, scenarios and interactions occur and I feel completely hopeless, sad and exhausted.... even if I was feeling different prior. 

I know we can‚Äôt blame others for our moods and how we feel, that ultimately we are in control of our emotions and I get that... but having anxiety and feeling depressed when around specific people and in specific places... how do I fix that?

Anyway before I start, I am seeing a psychiatrist at a government-run hospital for bipolar II and anxiety.

I might bring this up to her when we next meet but I just want to know if anyone can relate to this.

I feel I have a very unstable sense of how I view myself.

17,"Sorry if this is a little muddled, I've not been sleeping well. OK, so last Saturday I started a break from weed and alcohol and then on the Monday I gave up smoking and now today I started my period.  It's safe to say I've been struggling mentally.

 I have only been smoking on and off for roughly 2 years and only started smoking because I was having the worst time of my life and it became an aid as well as a form of self destruction.  Giving up smoking is why I've cut out weed and alcohol as the 3 were are all interlinked.

I've had moments of positivity but it's mostly been unrest.  My boyfriend has tried to be supportive but he has also quit smoking and has depression and anxiety like me, so he has moments of just finding my emotional state frustrating. Which means I haven't really talked about how I'm feeling as he has said I'm being silly if I do say something.  My sleep has been awful and I've been waking up periodically or it's been disturbed by a night terror (I just woke up and instantly started crying on one of the nights)

I've wanted to self harm, the only reason I haven't is because I'm cat sitting and whilst my brain is riddled with all sorts. Caring for the cat outweighs all that.  

&amp;#x200B;

18,"I've been dating this guy for three years. We immediately became best friends and romantic feelings developed soon after. We both have a history of mental illness, which I knew was dangerous going into it, but he understood me. He trusted me. And I trusted him.

In February of this year (yes I can pinpoint it), our dynamic completely changed. He got a restaurant job where we ended up with schedules that never gave us time for our relationship. This is where the problems started. He began hanging out with his coworkers after work until late in the night, usually drinking, and when I would complain about it, he'd accuse me of being controlling, hating that he had other friends, etc. 

The first panic attack came when I had explicitly asked him to come home one night because I needed his support with some family issues and he ""forgot"" because he went to the usual bar. When I confronted him, it immediately turned into verbal abuse. He yelled at me, accused me of terrible things, told me how I felt, how I thought, and how my actions made me a terrible person to the point where I was crawling under the bed to hide from him and banging my head on the floor trying to make it all stop. He yelled at me more for this.

Since that instance, numerous other nearly identical scenarios arose. They would be separated by ""honeymoon"" phases that I bought. I always believed he felt bad and that he wouldn't do it again, and that he would get help for his own issues. The most recent incident is what really opened my eyes. I was so depressed that I didn't feel safe alone, and that I was afraid I'd hurt myself. He told me I was using my ""suicidal tendencies"" to manipulate him. In that moment I almost killed myself. He got mad and threatened to kill himself instead. The next day he started throwing some of the same old arguements at me because I asked him to brush his teeth before bed: ""stop throwing yourself a pity party; you always make everything my fault; you're so fucking controlling; you're trying to manipulate me with your mental illness."" When I asked him to move out, stay with a co-worker for a little bit, he lost it. He screamed at me about how his name is on the lease too, so if I hate him so much I should leave because he won't. I told him that he's abusing me. He made a point of how he's never once hit me, how I'm the only one who hurts myself, and how my counselor who says he abuses alcohol and verbally abuses me is biased and bs because she only hears my side of the story, where I ""play the victim.""

He kept yelling at me every time I tried to speak, and even when I sobbed, and backed me into a corner. I got scared and pushed him away. He said he would call the cops on me because that's domestic abuse, that I'm a danger to myself, to him, and to our cats. Then he went to the bathroom to take a shit.

While he was in there I realized he was right. My panic attacks leave me unable to control myself. I throw anything in my hand, and I instinctively find ways to hurt myself. My cats could become collateral. So I called the police on myself. I told them I didn't feel safe in my home, and that I didn't have anywhere else to go, and I didn't feel safe with myself. They took me to the ER and the on-call psychiatrist sent me to an in-patient facility because he was afraid that sending me back home would actually lead to my death.

My boyfriend felt terrible. The entire week I was in the hospital he worked more shifts than normal so he could take me to a concert I'd been wanting to see. He stayed away from alcohol. He called me everyday before work and during his breaks. He swore he'd get help, take the resources the hospital was providing and actually take initiative because he didn't want to lose me.

Shocker, he refuses to go to AA, he won't find a psychiatrist or counselor, he started yelled at me in public, and today he finally snapped again. I had a good day and wanted to go out and hang with him after his shift got out. He wasn't responding to me at all, but he said which bar he'd be going to earlier so I just swung by. Just like every time before, the minute he saw me he was furious.

Now here we are, me unable to move out of our apartment, and him unwilling to. It is seriously affecting my schoolwork, work work, and social life. I need him to leave. Please, does anyone have advice?",14Sep2018,12,

I will isolate myself in the garage and for hours on end be speaking as if I‚Äôm in a Ted Talk or an interview, or in front of classmates/coworkers id like to impress. A little daydreaming isn‚Äôt bad, but this is an addiction. Many nights I‚Äôll be up at night with racing thoughts and suddenly at 4 am without even realizing it I‚Äôll be in the garage just practically shouting out my ideas. 

My daydreams are all very narcissistic and often complex arguments with others in my head where at the end of these 2-3 hour sessions I will feel as if I have gone insane and I am speaking about how incredible and brilliant I am essentially. I will be analyzing myself too and these alone sessions always lead to me being very proud of myself and talking shit about the entire world. It‚Äôs ruining my life. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bipolar disorder as I am mainly a very depressed person, and am almost always very low energy and lethargic.

I said yes.

He said ‚Äúduly noted. Do you have to use the bathroom?‚Äù 
 
Yes

I've not had an official diagnosis that I'm aware. I took Pristiq about 5 years ago from my primary care doctor then, did quite well for a while but stopped taking it due to side effect my anger issues turning up to 11.

Other than that I mostly just saw a social worker/therapist to try to talk on things - which was nice to be able to do and certainly helped some. The last one I was seeing hit me out of the blue with additional bills after telling me she wasn't in my network any more, so I settled up $530. She called and left a message again a few days ago seeming to indicate suddenly there''s more I owe?

That aside, I've not been doing well at all lately and was thinking about trying to find someone actually covered under my insurance to see again. I don't even know if I want to pursue medication or what, but I so tired of feeling this way.

I was coping in the past via self-medication with alcohol, which of course is not really a viable option. So I've been sober now for a bit over 5 months, but largely feeling worse than ever mentally.

I feel trapped at my job, hate everything about it in fact but haven't been able to find a way out. I have barely enough mental energy and will power to make it through the days/nights with it before I just zone out trying to recover from the stress and anxiety of it (it's long/crazy hours a lot of times).

Exercise helps some, but I've also been having some physical issues lately so haven't been able to do it as much. That aside, I just feel like it's all pointless. 

I've been trying to work on myself and improve myself but nothing is changing, all the underlying mental issues/thoughts/whatever are the same. I'm stuck in a never ending loop of suck. While I wouldn't necessarily say I'm suicidal, I find myself wishing daily that I didn't exist.

There's so much about my life that I've tried to ""grin and bear"" and ""fake it until I make it"", but time just keeps rolling on and now I'm mid-thirties and it's just fucking awful.

Since then, I have been seeing a psychologist and therapist and have not had any other problems. In fact, my doctor was in the process of weening me off medication. His stance is that I have been doing good, he doesn't want me to take medication if i may not need it, and the low dose I'm taking now is not even theraputic (not enough to actually work). I just changed doctors and my new doctor has the exact opposite opinion. She thinks I need to continue taking a low dose (40mg, geodon) because ""once you have had one breakdown, you are at an increased risk of having another.""  Who do I believe? Geodon is expensive, you have to be weened off of it slowly because of withdrawl symtoms, and it's not something I want to continue taking, i was happy being told i may not need it anymore but now my new doctor has basically scared me out of trying. Any advice?

# 21 POSITIVE COPING STRATEGIES FOR STRESS

Stress affects us all. It‚Äôs part of modern life but there are ways to manage stress and to embrace it rather than resist it. Here‚Äôs how:

1. Abdominal (deep) breathing and relaxation
2. Regular exercise
3. Downtime ‚Äì take time out
4. Mini breaks
5. Time management ‚Äì know your priorities
6. Sleep ‚Äì regular and at least six hours per night
7. Material security
8. Social support ‚Äì friends and family
9. Self nurturing ‚Äì look after yourself
10. Good communication, be assertive and ask for what you want
11. Recreational activities ‚Äì playtime
12. Emotional release ‚Äì laugh, have fun.
13. Sense of humour ‚Äì takes the edge off the seriousness of life
14. Constructive thinking ‚Äì dismiss negative thoughts and problem solving
15. Distraction ‚Äì ability to focus on other things rather than your worries
16. Acceptance
17. Tolerance of uncertainty ‚Äì life has no guarantees, work with it. Stop resisting what you can‚Äôt change
18. Task oriented ‚Äì problem solving. Do something rather than overthink it
19. Goals to work towards
20. Positive philosophy in life
21. Mindfulness ‚Äì try to live more in the moment than live in the past/future

Stress is vital as it helps us to prepare for challenges. Not all stress is bad but when we feel overwhelmed, the above list can help to ease the worries.

31,"Last night I got angry to the point where I grabbed my 10 year old daughter, threw her around, even picked her up off the ground by just her head.  This morning I'm greatful that she  is not physically hurt (no bruises, no soreness) but I'm terrified for what might have been...I'm afraid I could have killed her.  I've never gone that far before.  Spanking a handful of times, once or twice I slapped her, but each time I told myself and my wife never again.  Clearly I'm out of control, but if I go get help everything I read online says they will report me to CPS.  I don't want to lose my family, but I never want to hurt them again.

My wife is traumatized and can't talk to me about it.  She goes back and forth between being compassionate, hating me, and sobbing uncontrollably.  Also it is unfair for me to expect  her to do anything to help me change my behavior.  My parents are the reason I have anger issues so I can't talk to them.  I have read the self help books and know  what I'm supposed to do when I get angry, but there is always a point where I just snap and it's like a I'm a different person.  I seriously can't think of what to do.  Am I too far gone?  Will I lose my family no matter what I do?",14Sep2018,2,
32,"Hey guys first time posting here but I really need a rant.

I recently started a new job, very exciting and fun, we are still in training. 

Today I got pulled aside by my manager. Apparently someone overheard me speaking privately to another colleague about my mental health and complained to my manager that I may make people feel uncomfortable. I have therefore been asked not to talk about it.

Aside from the fact they shouldn't be eavesdropping anyway I feel very conflicted about this. On the one hand I wouldn't ever want to make anyone feel uncomfortable about anything. On the other hand I know I've not discussed anything like suicide or self harm or any of the other more sensitive parts of mental health issues because I don't feel comfortable talking about that side of myself with anyone who isn't close to me anyway. 

I'm in the UK and we've got such big campaigns about how it's ""time to talk"" about mental health and time to end the discrimination. Is this an example of discrimination? My manager wanted me to know that I'm not in trouble and I should be mindful of others and as said before they feel it's not the right environment to discuss this.

The worst part is I have generally well controlled BPD but this is triggering so many of my issues...paranoia, strong emotionally, the desire to cut myself...I just don't know how to handle this, or if I'm completely overreacting...

Any words of comfort advice validation or encourgement would be much welcomed. ",14Sep2018,3,

37,"In November of 2013 I left school early. I got home, petted the dogs, went in the house, changed clothes, put on my pack and started walking south down the rural country road where I live. There is an old church and cemetery, dating from the early 19th century, about 4 miles from my house. This church was my destination. When I got there. I took my phone and a bottle of water from my pack. I dialed 911 and told the dispatcher that they needed to send a deputy to my location. I gave them very explicit directions. When the nice lady with the syrupy drawl asked why, I hung up.

I reached into my pack again and took out my Smith and Wesson 686, a gift from my sister who died in 2002. I placed one 158 grain Remington semi-jacked hollow point in the cylinder, spun it hard and closed it. I placed the barrel in my mouth and pulled the trigger. When it went click, I started sweating and shaking. Until that click I had felt nothing. I wanted for at least a minute, and by this time I was drooling all over the stainless- steel barrel. I pulled again, another click. For some reason I couldn‚Äôt do it again. I took the cartridge out of the cylinder. It would have been next. I put the revolver back in the bag, called 911 again, and told the syrup lady to call the deputy back. I walked back home. When Mandi, my wife, got home I told her the story. I began treatment the next day. I was in the hospital for 9 weeks. It was almost 2 years before I started to feel like myself again, and I‚Äôve had to work on it every day since.

I have been a part of numerous debates on nature v. nurture, both as a student and as a teacher. I once wrote a long paper on Lev Vygotsky in a graduate level education course. I am sure that my particular case resulted from a pretty balanced dialectic.

My maternal grandfather and two uncles committed suicide. My father‚Äôs mercurial moods were legendary and were only ended by cancer. Alcohol, and now meth, are the treatments of choice for many if not most of my relatives.

I have also had my share of losses. I have walked past the coffins of almost a dozen students or former students. My favorite student ever, smart, athletic, beautiful, stuck his head in my door the year after he graduated and said, ‚ÄúLove you Mr. G, thanks for everything.‚Äù

He went home and blew the top of his head off. I always felt I should have presaged his death. I should have seen it coming. I knew he struggled with his sexuality and depression. Maybe, I could have saved him.

Another of my top ten, a most gifted musician, died in his sleep of an undetected heart valve dysfunction.

I almost collapsed when my sister who was only 36 passed away unexpectedly. We survived years of abuse together, but she couldn‚Äôt survive her Lupus which left her immune system so compromised that she couldn‚Äôt fight off a common infection. She drowned in her own fluid. She was my only real friend growing up. I carried all these things pretty well, more or less, for decades. I think the fact that I lifted, exercised and fucked daily helped me cope, but when I blew my knee up during wrestling practice, I started to let my health go. I‚Äôve also suffered from insomnia since I first wrote my age in two digits.

I could evince more losses in greater detail, but there is only so much time.

I will abridge the early stages of my treatment, a parade of therapists and baskets of various selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. Some helped; some did nothing and some actually made shit worse.

I have always had a great family support system with my wife and son, and I love them for all their support, but it simply wasn‚Äôt enough.

Jesus and I parted ways in the late 80s so there was no help there. I phoned him so many times and he didn‚Äôt answer that I assumed he was screening his calls.

I didn‚Äôt start to recover till I started to work out again, slowly at first. I remember when I dusted off my bench press, and lifted the 225lbs that had been resting on it for 4 years. I did 2 reps. I couldn‚Äôt do a third. I once did 43 and won the competition at my gym. I discovered that meditation and regulated breathing techniques did more to assuage my overwhelming anxiety that any Benzo ever did. Soon I started to get better ‚Ä¶ stronger. I went to a new General practitioner 2015. When he did blood work, he discovered that my Testosterone was 350, the low end of normal. He prescribed regular testosterone injections anyway. He said they really helped him. My strength exploded and my layer of fat melted away. I did 6 reps with 405lbs on the bench Sunday afternoon, not bad for a 50yo with shoulder issues.

When you suffer depression it‚Äôs like doing perpetual weighted walks with all the weight you can carry. You can chose to let some the weight go, or get stronger. Meditation and lifting will help you do both.",14Sep2018,3,

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a pretty trying week. I've suffered with OCD, anxiety, and acute periods of depression for most of my life. However, my overall mental health has been in steep decline since May by me going through the transition of college to full time job. I got to work early this morning, sat down in my office, and just started crying. It's just been one of those weeks, ya know, and I'm overwhelmed.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss (60s male) knocks on my door and barges in as I'm sitting in my chair crying, which then induces a conversation where I open up (a little) to let him know of my mental health struggles. And, guess what, he had some of the most ignorant responses and comments, which, sadly, I wasn't too shocked at coming from a more conservative baby boomer. As I tell him that I struggle with OCD, he actually tries to twist the conversation by saying ""yes, but you have to spin that into a positive thing in order to do well around here, you know, you can use OCD to your advantage at this job by being very organized."" He also goes on to tell me about his wife's ""obsessive"" actions, like checking a doorknob twice, which he followed by saying ""I think my wife's CRAZY because of it, but I just have to go along with it."" Are you actually kidding me? And then he concluded the conversation by saying that ""it's sad that you have to deal with these things all day."" Yeah, who would've thought? I don't know, man, I'm just flabbergasted at the complete lack of awareness over mental health basics. I just wanted to scream and shake my boss and make damn sure that he knew that these are real, actual, DEBILITATING mental diseases I deal with every damn day that make many of my days extremely hard to get through sometimes. They are NOT something I can use to ""my advantage,"" nor are they something that you can brush off as a ""crazy tick."" Anyone else deal with this in their workplace? I'd love to know.

To start off, I'm in the process of a green card application to stay with my wife in the US, so I do not currently have any kind of access to mental health facilities unless I pay exorbitant fees that I simply cannot afford. 

Long story short, over the last few months I've stopped having the motivation to do... well... anything. I'm a writer and when I was back home, a freelance academic researcher. I used to keep a pretty good schedule - I'd pick up freelance gigs for side-cash, occasionally work manual labour, go to the gym once every few days, jujitsu class once a week, cook every day, keep my place clean, whittle away on my projects, hang out with friends at least once a week. For the last month though, I just haven't cared, about anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going broke, because I have no motivation to look for freelance gigs (which I can still technically do as my work is web-based and is still registered in my home country, to clarify).

I haven't worked on any of my projects, because I have no motivation.

My diet has gone to shit, because I just can't get myself to care.

My fitness has gone to shit, I haven't even been able to get myself to jog in weeks.

My social life is abysmal, because I can't be bothered to leave the house.

I've gone from being a fairly attractive guy (at least, as far as I was told by others) to a slob - I only build up the motivation to shower and brush my teeth once every 2-3 days, sometimes 4, and rarely groom myself outside of maybe brushing my hair.

I don't read.

I have no hobbies.

I don't go out to do anything.

I don't know what has happened, but every day I just wake up, a barrage of things I want to get done appear before me, and then the day goes on and I just sit and do mindless stuff, watching youtube videos, browsing reddit.

My wife has mostly been the one to do chores like dishes and tidying around, and indicates it doesn't bother here, but I don't like being this person. 

If anyone has advice, please, please post it here.

Thanks.

42,"I have never been diagnosed with schizophrenia or any form of psychosis. When I was young, until about 12 years old, I would see dark shadow figures and shapes around the corners of my eyes or sometimes clearly in front of me. I would also always hear people talking to me when it was very quiet, or other people having a conversation I could never make out but it was loud enough to bother me, or go check if I left the TV on or something.  


I haven't had those hallucinations since I was 12. The past two weeks they've been back and getting worse. The only thing I noticed that has changed has been my anger. Here is where my situation gets weird. This isn't something new, but I can only ever feel anger. Feeling any other emotion, even for a second, causes anger and it overpowers everything else. Any interaction or experience, positive, or negative, causes anger.  


It's never been a problem since I handle anger very well and it doesn't impact my judgment and decision making in a negative way. I've been this way for as long as I can remember. It's never been a bad thing. Lately there's so much of it, I feel like it just *has* to effect my mental state in some way right? Nothing else has changed, and I haven't had these hallucinations for 11 years.  


I have antisocial personality disorder, so that may explain the anger, but not the hallucinations. I no longer see a psychiatrist for it so there is no one I can bring this up to without getting another referral. I'm just looking to see if anyone else has had similar experiences. ",14Sep2018,2,

Let's take the example which gave me incentive to type this post, I have an iPhone 8 (which I regret buying, it was a bad purchase on my part and I don't want to talk about it since it makes me cringe), but I am constantly anxious because I keep dedicating myself to being a pure Apple user or a pure Google user, I lean more toward the Google side but I have an iPhone so I can't use all Google apps and that's driving me crazy, I can understand if I just prefer Google but I've literally wasted an entire month doing this and this is making me stressed out. I just want to throw this phone in the gutter and not have it at all.

I know it's not a problem with my preference but rather my psychology, I find it hard to get a balance and get the perfect mix of things. I feel that the iPhone 8 anxiety is just a symptom of the illness but not the illness itself so I wanted to end the illness.

I've been going through a pretty horrific bout of bipolar depression, and my psychiatrist referred me to an ECT specialist.

I tried adding out of network benefits, but the insurance company said they're not available for plans through the Healthcare Marketplace. There is another place in SC that does ECT, but that doctor isn't covered by my insurance either.

47,"Hello everyone. Please guide me if there‚Äôs somewhere else I can post this, or if there‚Äôs any information online somewhere that would be useful. This is going to be long, I‚Äôm sorry: it‚Äôs ultimately a story about both of our mental states.

Some information you might need: we‚Äôre both 14, female, and we live in the UK. That‚Äôs Year 10, or what I think is 9th grade.



I learned today that my old friend, who I knew for nearly 3 years up until a few months ago, was hospitalised from low blood pressure after refusing to eat. 

I feel terrible, because in part it was almost certainly made worse by me.



We met in Year 7 (6th grade), at the start of secondary school. ‚ÄòJess‚Äô (not her real name) was one of my first friends.

During Year 8, she was still one of my best friends. My ‚Äòbest‚Äô friend at the time, however, was a girl called ‚ÄòMolly‚Äô. I was confused, and had quite deep feelings for Molly without realising I was gay. 

The feelings peaked around the first term (semester) of Year 9. I confessed to Molly, and promptly cut myself off from the entire friend group: I realise now that I hated myself for being gay. I began to wake up earlier and earlier, developed what I think is dermatillomania (undiagnosed), and started having panic attacks. I have no idea what Jess was going through back then, as I had minimal contact with her.

By the final term of Year 9, I‚Äôd had enough. I confided in a teacher and spent a month in absolutely terrible therapy. I convinced my Head of Year to get me to switch forms: ultimately changing my classes and cutting me off from Molly altogether but also severely limiting my contact with Jess. She said it would be done by the end of the half term break (small break in the middle of the semester). Over half term, I cut off my hair and came out to all my other friends. Neither Jess nor any of that group had any idea I was changing class or that anything had happened.

After that half term, I can only say
everything changed for the better quite suddenly. I got a girlfriend, ‚ÄòAlice‚Äô, now of three months: she introduced me to so many new people and I‚Äôm so grateful. I gained multiple stable friendship groups, and in the final week I made up with Molly. I think I still have quite severe dermatillomania. I still get panic attacks from time to time, and occasionally I relapse on my otherwise strict sleep schedule. Today was a 4am day - not too bad but still not right - so maybe that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt think properly. I don‚Äôt know. But everything has gotten better, and I‚Äôm very glad for that.

What I didn‚Äôt see was that Jess was suffering. I had Music class with Jess and Alice, and I‚Äôm sure she noticed I would sometimes speak more to Alice than her. Looking back, back then Jess and I didn‚Äôt speak much at all. Molly later told me that Jess was telling them her medication meant she couldn‚Äôt eat. I don‚Äôt know why she was on medication: she was physically healthy when I knew her. But that was a lie: she said that so she wouldn‚Äôt eat.

That brings me to this year. I went back to school, and Jess just wasn‚Äôt there. At first I thought she just skipped the first day like many people did (it began on a Friday). Then I thought she was ill. It‚Äôs been two weeks since school started, and I haven‚Äôt seen her. Today, I asked Molly, and she told me about her being hospitalised. I feel so, so very guilty for leaving her like that: from her point of view I cut myself off from her group, then her classes, then excluded her.

Thank you so much for reading. This was part vent, part story, but ultimately I want to know: should I contact Jess? I want to, so badly, but I might just end up messing everything up. Thank you in advance, you are wonderful people.

53,"First thing, I've been tired all the time for seemingly no reason and it's only gotten worse because my insomnia is back. I have no idea why. I'm being tested for any physical reasons but so far: nothing. 

Secondly I've been having constant nihilistic thoughts. I don't feel like anything I do could ever mean anything. Anything I do is pointless. If I make money my goal, what does it matter? I die in the end anyway. What good will it do me when I'm dead? Same thing with happiness, love, helping others etc. Instead I've made my goal to get through school so I can get life over with as quickly as possible.

Lastly, I don't really know what I'm feeling anymore. It is like all my emotions are muffled almost to the point of non-existence. I don't feel when I'm doing better. I have to objectively analyse my actions to know what I'm feeling. For example: yesterday I was crying but didn't really feel upset. I knew why I was crying and obviously I was upset but I didn't *feel* it.

Since 2015, I've been on medication, SSRI(S?) for depression and anxiety.
I keep running into the same side effect, which causes me - of course with psychiatric help - to quit the meds, because it ruins my life.
&lt;b&gt;Blurry vision.&lt;/b&gt;

I'm a student and I have glasses (always had them) which means that it really really doesn't work for me, when my eyes don't function properly. I reach a point in the day where it's impossible for me to focus on anything, visually. It's like my eyes can't make text or other things sharp.

I've had my eyes checked numerous times and they've told me that the medication is temporarily damaging the nerves (or something) in my eyes that are responsible for the muscle that contracts and retracts in order to gain focus. I have also been checked in the periods where I haven't been on medication and they show improvement in those periods.

These are the ones that I have tried: Citalopram, Sertraline, Fluoxetin and Venlafaxine.

He repeated that several times even though no accident had taken place. Did the same thing to his boss. He visited us, asked the landlord several times if he is allowed to park on the street. 

I tried talking to him, his facial expressions are of a chronic alcoholic, or someone undergoing mental degeneration. Turned out that at home he has sudden anger outbursts. He crashed all the TV Remotes, answered the phone to his boss (on call) when he was asked to come in. Smashed the phone. Threw the keys to his wife on several occasions. He opened 5 facebook accounts, and he claimed that the police will take him in and lock him up for months. (He has a clear record). He claimed he'd seen facebook posts saying he'll go to jail.

I was wheezy. Choking. Coughed every night and morning. Washing powders and chemicals triggered me into a breathing issue. I also have vomited a few times. I had anxiety. I didn't sleep well. I felt like crap. I asked the doctor for an allergy test to see what I was allergic to just to see what to avoid. They said 'no, only if my lips turned blue and I was dying'. That's what was actually said. NHS for you. My GF sent my hair off for an allergy. These tests are actually BS. Least she tried. I decided to cut out dairy (including eggs) just to see what happened. I honestly expected nothing. Almost after day one I actually slept without coughing, and this was with the window shut (I usually have it open for a breeze). I even slept for 11 hours. I usually get 5. In fact I couldn't get enough sleep. I haven't been anxious yet (it's been 4 days) and I feel better. I'm used to be very angry and depressed (time will tell on this). I did notice one night my throat was a little dry and I woke up extremely bloated. I had been eating snacks full of wheat (gluten) so now I'm quitting that. Some other things I've noticed is my pee is way clearer. My sore finger from playing guitar isn't as sore at the joint (well it isn't at all at the moment). My focus and energy are slightly better. MY POINT IS to all you feeling bad somehow, allergy or not, try cutting dairy! I'm totally convinced this will help some of you. I got rid of choking every days for 10 years plus just in a few days.

 i could say that i have now only 1 friend and sometimes when we hang out i pretend to be happy/act normally like before
i even fake laugh at his jokes. before if somebody called me for example a cunt or something else i would have gone mad or felt sad but now i just can't get angry or feel sad i just  ignore them.

 i don't think i hate myself or want to harm myself but i sometimes think it would be better if i never existed, it would be some much easier.

  nowdays i just be quiet most of the time and don't want to do anything+bad social skills don't really give me another choice.  there are some moments when i laugh for no reason even for not funny things i don't really know where's this laugh is coming from but if i had to guess i would guess that i get extremily bored and my mind just creates something to laugh at that it will no longer will be bored.(but idk)

 nowdays i just lay in my bed studying or with my phone or computer watching yt or reading reddit posts. i find studying also intresting and kinda like studying it's also funny to see how much better my grades have went because my ""new lifestyle"" because i have time to study and i got nothing else to do, but when i study or  do something i always think whats the point of doing anything your life doesnt matter in the end and everything what you do is useless. i don't get those people who are always so happy and be like everything is fine don't worry. i would say in my case life is not hard but people will make it hard.

Over the years I've been diagnosed (and misdiagnosed) by various professionals with over seven different conditions. I'm still not 100% sure what's wrong with me but I am certain of at least one thing: I am highly emotional. 

I get random mood swings where I become incredibly sad and am unable to function for several hours, which makes it hard for me to hold a job with any sort of stress level. When I get slightly upset, it quickly escalates into a full blown rage that usually lasts over four hours, which is how I've lost every friend I had in the last year. When I'm happy I'll overestimate how much work I can reasonably do and take on projects that are too big because ""it feels like it will last a long time."" (It often dissipates within minutes) And when I'm scared I feel like it's the end of the world and that there's no longer any hope for me to get better.

I'm supposed to be an artist, or a writer, or a musician - being in a creative dry spell exacerbates my depression. But I can't help notice that I'm behind a lot of my peers. There are high-schoolers that can draw rings around me just from being self-taught - I'm twenty-seven and have spent over $50,000 on art school.

Something I've noticed recently is that a lot of mega-talented artists end up being horrible people. For example: my sister commissioned a beautiful plush about half a year ago. When I asked her today why she never shared it, she told me that she found out that the person she commissioned it from is the girlfriend of an open, practicing pedophile who approaches minors for sexual roleplay and refuses to take ""no"" for an answer. 

This kind of pattern is scarily common: John Lennon was a known physical abuser to both of his wives, Renard ""LapFox"" is a self confessed rapist (trapped their partner in a bathroom and after forcing intercourse said ""I knew you enjoyed it this time because you didn't struggle as much"" among other things), Dr. Seuss had a long affair with a woman eighteen years his junior while his wife was dying (after his wife's suicide married the younger woman in under nine months), Leonardo Da Vinci had regular sex with twelve year old boys, etc.

Is it possible that these kind of people succeed in their creative field because their emotions are not strong enough to cause them to realize the harm they cause others, thus they do not get as frustrated/tired/sad and can work longer, VS me being behind because I'm afraid to deal with my intense emotions?

This is the first year I am on my University's meal plan to make more time on campus.
