2,"Im an 18 year old male graduated HS but since then my life has been spiraling downwards into depression, I'll leave some more detail. Thank You to everyone that takes the time to read❤️

•Since I was 11, I've had suicidal thoughts on and off. I used to cut myself at 14 but stopped.

•  I am very anxious around people i dont know, when friends want to see me and other people are involved, I tend to reject plans

• I am very scared of being in cars, never been in an accident or near an accident, I get very paranoid thinking about going behind the wheel 

• I dropped out of college 4 weeks in and I'm constantly stressing because idk what i'm gonna do with my life

• I do not have many close friends left I can speak to about my problems BUT I also choose not too because they can never relate so they give me advice that makes me mad.

• I been jobless since 12/30/17 and I have been unable to find a job

• For the last note, It's difficult for me to find a job because of my extreme difficulty being taught things, plus I'm scared of messing up. Lastly, I cannot be on a cash register ever because i get major anxiety and i tend to hyperventilate and since that's most jobs require, it limits me more.

• In 2017 that's when I began becoming aware something was wrong with me mentally.

• I get told by my past girlfriends that i'm very bipolar and cannot make up my mind.

• My parents don't believe in mental illnesses, so they feel like nothing is wrong with me and that it's ""all in my head""

• I tried to get physiatrics help but my mom is unable to afford it.

• I research a lot on this sub and google and I'm very confident I suffer from Bipolar disorder and Social Anxiety (that I'm aware of) but I don't want to misdiagnose myself since I won't have anyone to do it for me.

• So now I feel hopeless, I have many suicidal thoughts, I can't support my family because i'm jobless, I'm scared of driving and basically having adult responsibilities, I dropped out of college and I have to pay them back. I stress so much and all I get is ""you're 18 you're young."" I tell my sister and dad that I want to kill myself and it just gets ignored pretty much.

anyone want to give me advice? Or lead me to see if my problems are worth seeking more research on a specific mental/emotion disorder? Any feedback is appreciated ",05Dec2018,1

Hello, my name is Austin and I have multiple mental disorders. I spend most of my time in my room alone which is not healthy but is what I enjoy doing. I like to write down my thoughts and feelings but I have no one to read and assess my thoughts which is why I am turning to Reddit for guidance. Please feel free to comment on my writings and critique when needed. I am not and do not claim to be a professional writer, mistakes will be made.

Day 1:

I get asked by my thoughts, “Why are you doing this?”, about anything I do. It is hard to live with someone in your head that you have never met or seen. You cannot put a face on them. I find myself torn between am I just making this up or is someone else really inside this flesh covered sack of atoms? What do I do if it is not just me? I cannot make it leave or at least I have not figured out how. I never used to here a voice it just came to me in a day dream. At first it was civilized conversations not this yelling and nonsense I am hearing now. Even right now it speaks to me, asking why I am typing and not just doing what it wants. When I close my eyes, everything is so vivid. Too many colors and shapes to identify if it is something I have seen before or just a creation of my mind. I am scared of blank stares, that is what I see the most, is that 1000-yard stare of pure fear. I feel this constantly, that I am just being stared at and I cannot do anything about it or even see where it is coming from. I dream constantly, mostly when I am awake now, but when I was younger, more innocent, I dreamt of things that were indescribable. Those same indescribable visions are just white noise to me now. My sensitivity for things has passed. I do not know what to do with these thoughts. I have pushed them aside for too long now. Suicide used to be an option. Suicide, never fully talked about, only mentioned here and there. Nobody talks about what to do when it is in front of you, only how to prevent it. Prevention does not work. It never has. “Maybe putting your thoughts down on paper will help.”, said friend who has never dealt with any problem in their life. They have no idea what my thoughts are like or why confronting them is a bad idea. I know. They are called panic attacks. More like having the fourth wall broken and all the creatures that control your life are put out in front of you to finally see and talk to. Never talk to them, that is how you get in an institution. At least in movies that is how it goes. I saw A Beautiful Mind today. John Nash was brilliant, but it wasn’t portrayed well. Not enough death or fear or second guessing if that thing you saw was real or just another fourth wall leak. Basically, it was a waste of my time to sit and give my full attention to it. It did not stop the thoughts from rolling on through my mind. “Is this what you are like? Have you no sense of what is real? Are you just locked away somewhere, unbeknownst to yourself?”. How did he not consider suicide once? There it is again, that word. Pops up everywhere. Such a crude word for something so selfishly selfless. You give your life to your problems but rip a life from the rest of the world. Not leaving an explanation for your actions. That is why I do not want to do it. My father. I must die after him or he would die too I think. To live without thy father is to live in a damned world. One without reason. One without happiness. Maybe I am just rambling on and no one cares what I think. It would not surprise me if it were that way. Is this what being at your lowest feels like? Like something is choking you and hiding your body? I am not at my lowest. I can feel it. But I am close to it. Maybe skimming the surface of the bottom. I picture the ocean floor when I think of the bottom. Where you cannot see light but only know that it is somewhere within a couple miles of you. I presume those miles take years to travel. The bottom is easier to maintain. I do not remember what the surface is like or if I have ever seen it. My best times so far were high school. My peak. I had friends but none of them know what I am really like. How dark I really think. How nonstop I think of death and its plans for me. How close they came to having their number punched. Not in the sense of school shootings no, that would have been to simple. Maybe knife one and bury them. Who cares, I never did it. I simply fantasized about it. Is that so harmful? Just a passing thought through the epicenter of horrendous thoughts. Murderous thoughts do not even register to me anymore. They are not creative enough. Creativity. Something I lack. Since I do not draw or make movies, creativity is useless. It would be nice to have, but too much of a hassle. My second conscience is creative, more creative than I ever was, Marijuana or not, I cannot beat it. The ways it tortures me is endless. Loud noises, simple talking that never ends, or playing white noise in a small handheld radio. Screaming is the most annoying currently. It messes with my day to day life. My mother says I am too agitated. Sorry mother, it has been three days since I heard a simple thought ring out. More thoughts come through my head then I can count. What is the point of this nonsensical writing? That’s one. Is it for my pleasure, or to document my downfall? I have been sleeping well I think. I never remember waking up or going to sleep. The first memory I have every morning is putting clothes on. Maybe it is just an autopilot the creatures put in me. Like the cameras in my house, neighborhood, work, school, and the trees outside. My dad picked me up from a panic attack, took me to my parent’s house, and told me nothing was there. He did this while something was walking up and down their hallway. Like right now, something is behind me and I just ignore it. My heart races a little faster waiting to be attacked by it. Only once have I felt something grab me, it is usually just small movements all over my body. Maybe it is the bugs under my skin. I never peek under my skin, just look at them moving. Squirming. Living. Breathing in my body. I do not let anyone know what is going on or they would lock me away in a room full of mirrors. Leaving me to watch myself go crazy while my reflections move in opposite way then I do. Shaking in front of me. Wanting to be free from the glass. I don’t like mirrors. Too unpredictable. Oh well just white noise to me now, basic everyday life. Everyone knows what is going on, through the cameras or through the see-through mirrors. One-way windows. The main point of this garbage writing is me wanting to know if this is normal for people or have I been chosen like the ant that is burned alive by a bully with a magnifying glass. Why me. Please stop. Just stop.

Thank you for reading,

5,"(I don’t know if this would belong here, but I think it would? To be honest, I don’t know.)

    My dad loved Christmas, he’d play Christmas music in the kitchen while making cookies or a festive dish, we’d watch the Disney Christmas parade after opening up presents, and watch movies like Home Alone and Frosty the Snowman (two of his favorites). But, after his passing, my mom became more selfish and now our presents aren’t even wrapped or thoughtful gifts. She always saids (,in an annoying, selfish-showing way,) “I hate Christmas now! Ever since your dad passed…” I hate her bringing up my dad in front of me and being so selfish. And no, don’t type “you two are just grieving,” because I know it’s not grief, at least anymore. She started dating a month after his death and now (, a year later,) still saids stuff like “I miss your father.” I want to bring that joy he brought to everyone back for the holidays, but I can’t to others. I hate speaking and just stating how I feel, especially about his passing, it’s not in my personality to show pain, so I hide it deep inside me where, if I’m lucky, I won’t find it. One of the last things I can remember my dad saying was in around April. He had a video of snow falling on Facebook and said sadly enough for me to feel the pain, “It’s sad. I won’t be able to watch the snow fall again.” That broke my heart, so I force myself to enjoy this season, though I dislike it. When I was little, I had frostbite a couple of time and almost got it a few more. I guess my skin is sensitive to the cold? I digress, one time, I couldn’t stop crying, so my dad, in a panic, made me hot chocolate. It helped a lot.

    I don’t know if I made this too long, I didn’t list everything that I have to offer, but this is enough, right?",05Dec2018,1
6,"A few weeks ago I ended up in the hospital after an overdose. The doctors were really helpful and after this I really felt like I was getting my life back on track. I caught up on a lot of missed work from school and started getting my good marks coming back. I reconnected with friends and I have truly felt happy and like I was doing something right. I had a follow up appointment with a psychiatrist at the hospital and it did not go well. He made me feel like complete shit, he called me lazy for sleeping a lot and said that he found it hard to believe I was getting caught up in school. He does not live my life how would he know, he can not just come to assumptions like that. He said that from his impression I was just lazy and throwing my life a way and did not even care about it. This was so untrue I was really making an effort but im a sensitive person and he pretty much ruined my self esteem.",05Dec2018,1
7,"It's quite simple, i'm just asking for devices, methods, ideologies or anything else to help me/people from spiralling out of control/going under.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice, reading, help or pointers is greatly appreciated. ",05Dec2018,1
8,"I'm never made a suicide attempt but have been suicidal, people (including doctors) only advice to me has been to call the crisis team or go to the ER which to me doesn't seem helpful. For example if I'm feeling suicidal at 3am I'm not going to get dressed and walk for 45 minutes in the dark to get to hospital, when suicidal I look/act no different so it's not like I'm crying or distressed, I imagine staff at hospital would have me wait for hours to assess me then send me home - unless I'm a distressed mess with a knife to my wrists I don't see them doing much. I've no idea what the crisis team do. 

Also in any situation, is there a risk of them sectioning you if suicidal? How bad do you have to be to get help?",05Dec2018,1
9,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but honestly I’m too much in a bad state to figure it out.

I’ve just realised that even though I’ve known my boyfriend’s friends for 4 years, his friends and their girlfriends who have them together for max a year are very close together... while they’re merely acquaintances to me...

Is it because of my anxiety ? Is it because of something else?
Last time I was with them I was basically standing there feeling like every single person in the room hates me.

I’m crying over it right now because realising this made me realise how badly this feeling of ‘everyone in this room hates me’ has prevented me from making friends and make me look like an unsociable and shy person.

It’s so annoying because I hate being alone and if you ask my close friends they would think I’m a sociable person who likes to have fun.
But when I’m in an environment where I don’t feel safe, I’m the most awkward person and I don’t know what to say or how to interact.",05Dec2018,1

11,"I'm 23 years old. I've been dealing with bad symptoms of depression for years and have never gotten help or talked about it really. I grew up in a grin and bear it household. I've abused  drugs as self medication, mostly alcohol. My girlfriend, who was the most understanding and supportive person I had, just broke up with me because she couldn't deal with my depressive episodes and the shitty way I treated her during them. I'm kind of spiraling because of this and other stresses in my life and I've realized I need help. I called my doctor to get an appointment and a referral for a psychiatrist but i cant get in for a month. I really really really dont want to wait that long. Is there any way I can see someone without getting a referral? Thanks for listening.",05Dec2018,1
12,"Hello,

Recently in the past month, I have constantly felt like I've been an outsider, like I dont belong. I will watch how my friends and groups interact and I feel like I don't belong. That I am not important and that no one would miss me. I don't belong anywhere and I don't want to pretend to fit in but I am so awkward and shy, there is no other way I could make friends.

Any suggestions on what I should do?",05Dec2018,1
13,"I keep almost going. About a month ago I went through a really bad bout of depression and for like a week felt really suicidal. I’m not sure if I’d ever do anything, I don’t even really WANT to die, but I’ve been getting more and more impulsive lately so it scares me. I almost had my fiancé drive me to the ER but decided against it the second I started feeling a bit better.

Yesterday I had my first therapy appointment in a long time. It went well, but it kind of triggered me into another depressive episode. I have intrusive thoughts all the time, but they’re never been this intense. I keep picturing myself killing myself and how I’d do it and it’s just getting to me a lot. I had a breakdown in the bathroom of my work today because of all the thoughts and texted my fiancé while she was at work, panicking her too. She offered to leave work to come get me and take me to the ER, and I decided against it again after calming down for a while. I can’t help but think I’m making things hard for her too with all of this.

I’m still having the thoughts but I’m trying to distract myself in hopes they go away soon. I’m too scared. I’ve heard all the horror stories, and I’m not even sure if they’d be able to help me. I might not be “suicidal enough.” I just don’t want to risk being turned away with no help, expensive hospital bills, and my family all knowing I think about killing myself a lot. I feel like I’m just being dramatic.

Has anyone else gone through something similar? I’m just not really sure what to do. I could just try to wait it out and talk to my therapist about it in a week. I do have insurance but I know hospital visits/stays are still very expensive even after insurance. ",05Dec2018,1
14,"Sorry for bringing up such a potentially triggering subject but I'm genuinely confused here.

To explain without giving you my life's story, I was extremely angry the other night and it got to the point I was having violent thoughts towards the person I was angry with. I imagined myself getting into a fight with this person and clawing them and ended up clawing at my own face in a moment of thoughtlessness. I meant this as kind of a miming gesture but it actually really hurt (I'm ok physically. I didn't break the skin or anything, it just hurt something good).

After that, I started to calm down because I realized my feelings were disproportionate to the situation and that me just being angry wasn't going to solve anything, so I took a long shower to refresh myself and moved on. It actually took me a while to realize that me scratching at myself may have been a form of self-harm, and I'm honestly shocked with myself that I did that. I have have a history of anxiety and the like but I have *no* history of self-harm (or violence for that matter. I might have been mad but I've never actually acted upon a violent thought, never will) so this a first for me. I'm so embarrassed and ashamed. Why did I do that?

Anyway, the crux of my confusion here is, was this self-harm or did I just do something really weird in a moment of directionless rage?",05Dec2018,1
15,"Today I went to see a crisis counselor and she told me I may have PTSD from watching the videos of active shooters in the FL high schoo and the Las Vegas shooting. I can't go in movie theaters anymore and get panic attacks in large crowds. I have nightmares about active shooters regularly but I feel like watching a video couldn't be that traumatic, right?",05Dec2018,1

19,"My only experience with it is through friends who have issues, the news, and online places like youtube and tumblr (I know its a hell site don't come for me lol). 

I don't know if this is appropriate to ask, but I'm not asking for about specific diagnoses. More like how does the process work? 
Do you get diagnosed for everything (if you have multiple disorders) at once or do you have to take it one step at a time? 
How long can it take to get diagnosed for a disorder? I know some disorders need to show symptoms for a few months, but I've seen people say it's taken years to get properly diagnosed. 
What about treatment? Do you only get treated for one illness before getting help for another one? 
And why is talking therapy always the top recommended method for treatment? What happens if you can't talk to a stranger or are only comfortable talking to friends?
Are there other ways to get help that don't involve talking to someone? 
Also how does family play into mental health treatment? What if/will they make getting better worse or more difficult to achieve?

20,"Hey guys! I am currently organizing a Mental Health Awareness panel at Christopher Newport University. I am fortunate enough to already have two amazing panelists one an alumni from CNU who works in the mental health field, and the Senator Creigh Deeds of Virginia who some may call the Kanye West of Mental health legislation! My dream however is to get one of my idols Scott Merscudi aka Kid Cudi to speak at this event. Our small school was struck with tragedy after our fall break a student my own year took his own life. This deeply hurt our community and I feel panel discussing mental health on our campus is needed now more than ever. Cudi has often spoken about his own history of mental illness including a stint in Rehab for depression and suicidal urges.

21,"OK, so this is all assuming that I get better over the next couple years, which seems likely at this point (new meds are working well)

My dream has always been to be a politician. I don't know where it came from when I was younger, but I just wanted to be President. As I have gotten older and learned more about various issues my desire to enter government has gotten even stronger.

But as a politician, you have to release your medical records. And I have 9 psychiatric diagnoses in those records, as of now. How can you possibly be elected with that? It's such an easy attack, regardless of if I'm experiencing symptoms. I simply don't see the American public changing that drastically in the next decade to the point where they will be willing to vote for someone with all my problems.

Obviously, I'm thinking very far into the future here, but I have to make relevant decisions relatively soon. College major, for instance. If I'm never going to succeed in politics I don't see the point in getting an education in political science. I can do more with a different degree. And I have gender dysphoria. I identify as a female. But thinking about that in terms of political viability, it just makes me question what to do even more than I already am (for completely unrelated issues).

So if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing or has any advice, I'd appreciate it a lot.",05Dec2018,1
22,"Lets say I have some personality disorder, either avpd or paranoid disorder, I dont know which.

And let's say I had gone to therapy in the past and the therapists made me feel even more screwed uo and anyways I dont have a reason to trust them in the first place. I really think theyre there to make money first and prescribe drugs and most of them dont actually know what they're doing, because thats been my experience and I see the experience of a lot of others whove been bamboozled.

How do you get help?

Is there someone who could actually prove to me why all the reasons I have to distrust people are wrong when people keep doing the same shit things over and over and proving that Im right.",05Dec2018,1
23,"Sober.

At home with roommate.

He leaves.

As soon as I hear the garage door close and know I have the whole house to myself, I hear a voice in my head: I'm about to commence some military training.

I put the faucet on as hot as it goes and take turns holding each hand under for 15 seconds at a time.  I do this multiple times.  Surprisingly (to me), no burns.

I arch my back back as far as possible, and punch repeatedly as hard as I can in my lumbar spine.

I keep looking at the mirror, sticking my tongue out as far as it goes and then dryheaving.  In the moment I think this is a cleanse process.

I keep repeating these with no rest between while hearing orders barked at me.

Eventually I run upstairs for aquatics training.  I fill a bath with ice cold water.

I submerge my face with my eyes open and remain that way as long as I can.  Right before I pull my face out, I suck in some water through my nose, and when my face is out immediately blow it all out.  I repeat this eye/nose process several times.

Eventually I get in and submerge myself as much as possible (nose and mouth above water to breathe though) and remain still.

Again a voice in my head, but there are more piping in.  They're arguing about how awesome I am.

I go downstairs, remove a medical file, run upstairs and put it on the dining room table - apparently the military is going to hang me in my home that night, and the medical file will explain everything to my roommate.

I bang on the back door with a stick many times, then yell as loud as I can at the park behind my property.  I describe it in detail and estimate how many kids could safely play there at once.  All at the top of my lungs with the back door open.  With people playing in the park.

Once finished, I lock the back door.  Again, voices in my head giving me orders and arguing over how awesome I am.

I run downstairs.

I get a belt.

I head to the room where I attempted hanging myself not long ago.

I put a stool beneath the chinup bar.

I tie the belt to it.

I get on the stool.

The voice tells me they are going to hang me as the final exercise.  Then it tells me to look around for supports to pull out once the exercise begins.

There are none.

A voice yells at me to kick the stool now, but a louder one is telling me to get a thicker belt.

I remove the existing belt and run to my room.  I am being yelled at to hurry.  I feel like I'm about to empty bladder and bowels.

Being yelled at by all voices I need to hurry up and hang myself if I want to prove my readiness.

I rush back to the room with the stool.

Garage starts opening.

I tear around the house cleaning up as much as possible as fast as possible.  Water from the faucet exercise is everywhere, drain the bath, there are clothes all over the floor and my dresser is knocked over, when did I do that?

I rush down to my room to sleep.  The whole time voices are telling me to sleep in professional dress because they are going to knock me out remotely (I am an android), abduct me overnight, and hang me from a tree where nobody will ever find me.

I comply with the dress code.

I wake up to my alarm the next morning.  My eyes are big and I am in full alert.

I run upstairs.

My roommate is eating breakfast and reading something.

I forgot the medical file.

It's from something a long time ago and a little humiliating.

Anyway I've never had any of this happen before or since, and it happened about four months ago.

Sober and not military.

24,"Hey there. I don't know if this sub is for this type of advice, but last week my brother got diagnosed with severe depression and has to go on meds. My mom is not taking it very well as she thinks it's her fault and doesn't know how to help. Last week they had an argument because he never leaves the house and he's failing college. He has friends but he never goes out with them anymore. They usually message a lot or talk over videogames. I guess what I'm asking is, if any of you have ever been in the same place as my brother, how do you feel your family could've helped you?

Others never answered the phone or returned phone calls. One person I found and made an appointment with for about 2 months out, when the time finally came I called for an address and they had no record of our appointment. 

I’ve tried my general doctor who prescribed my medication, but she won’t prescribe to children. She said her office would help find me someone for my daughter but of course they did not. 

I just looked up affordable health care treatment in my area and tried calling the number only to get a recording saying they do not accept income calls.

 i dont know if this is the right place to post for the eating disorder part but here's what i have to say. So 2018 has not been a good year for me. I was with a boy who i got pregnant by, i terminated the pregnancy and then i was forced to stop contacting him. its very difficult for me to go on about my days, knowing that i didn't even get to properly break up with him and its really bothering me and messing with my mental state. i also feel like its putting a wall between mine and my parents relationship because they made me do it, i know it was in my best interest, i truly do believe that and i will continue to stick by what they say and i wont contact him but it fucks with me. My thoughts about him consume hours of the day and i do home school so i sit inside all day every single day.. i wanna talk to my parents and they have made it very clear that i can talk to them but it's difficult to take the first step. I'm manic and i have highs and lows of course but i have extremely low lows and that kinda pisses them off or stresses them out. I also mentioned how i was pregnant, and i think about the termination a lot and how much i would love my baby and then i get very sad because i regret my decision but there's nothing i can do now i get so fucking sad and i cant pull myself together, like right now, so this is me venting.

&amp;#x200B;

 now all of that is off my chest, i think i might be developing and eating disorder. if you recognize the symptoms let me know. i gained some weight from my pregnancy, and i feel not so good about it. at one point i was going out a lot, partying and doing lots of drugs, i was also smoking cigs at the time and replacing meals with them. i was thin. at first i felt beautiful, but then people began to point it out and say i looked thin and unhealthy. then i said i wanna gain my weight back, and with the pregnancy it happened. now i feel fat. i weigh 140 and im about 5'4. the thought of starving myself or being thin consumes me, i often try very hard not to eat, i flush my system with water and im actively looking for ways to be thin and im willing to start purging but im scared if i go down that road i may not make it back.",05Dec2018,1

31,"Long story short, I was mentally abused and manipulated by a guy for over a year until he finally got me to sleep with him.  He then started acting distant and got irrationally angry at me when I said some hurtful things out of hurt and anger.  It ended up blowing up and I lost many friends, including my best friend who took his side.  I've been incredibly depressed since this happened to the point of feeling suicidal frequently and having a relapse in my bulimia. 

The thing is, he is a provider in my insurance network.  He is also extremely neurotic and I can 100% see him looking at my records to make sure I was ""clean"" before sleeping with me (especially since I was the one who had to insist on him wearing a condom).  This has bothered me since it happened but I didn't know what to do.  The other day, I mentioned it to another friend to try to get advice.  He happened to mention it to the guy (he was talking to him because of an obligation) along the lines of ""you'd better not have accessed her records"".  Within an hour I had a text from him asking if we could talk so he could apologize (after 4 months of him doing everything he could to discredit me and call me crazy).

I'm now incredibly anxious that he did access my records; I don't have anything embarrassing or secret, but it's a violation that just adds to the mental insanity he's put me through.  I contacted my insurance with an inquiry about it and am waiting to hear back on it.  

But for some reason I feel guilty for doing this, because he will likely get fired and possibly lose his license for this.  I'm also very worried that he will try to do something to me to get back at me.    I know logically that this is his own fault for doing something illegal (if he did), but I can see people coming at me for making him lose his job.  

I just... I'm so stressed and anxious about this.  I know I shouldn't feel any guilt but I do.  Did I make a mistake?  Was I wrong?  Should I have sucked it up for the sake of not ruining his life like he did mine?",05Dec2018,1
32,"I was the one who did the most babysitting, and woke up in the middle of the night, every night, to comfort my yngest sibling, 7 years my junior, back to sleep after he would wake up and get scared. Then I was up early to get him dressed because he wouldn't let anyone else dress him. I was 9-10 years old, and didn't ever think twice or complain. 

Since I was 12, I babysat my younger siblings every day while my parents were busy, and in the summers, I babysat them all day. I did the family laundry, and was in charge of my siblings' clothes. I learned to cook when I was 7 years old, and loved to clean. 

I was the one who didn't have to be worried about, I didn't need any extra attention and nobody had any reason to be concerned about me. If there weren't enough seats for all of us, I was the one who stayed home. If the dishes needed done, I was the one who was asked to do them, because I'd actually do it. 

I come off as strangely well-behaved to my fellow college students. I've never smoked weed, I don't drink, I don't cuss, I don't lie, I don't get angry, I don't know what it's like to be in detention in grade school. I'm simply disinterested in the vices and pleasures of life.

When my professor wants me to be a TA when I don't have time, I make time. When my research partner didn't do the programming, I show him how and we finish it right before class. 

I'm the one my parents brag about; my mom posts on Facebook the photo of the paper that says I got a 4.0 for the semester. My aunts beam when they hear that I'm in a grad school prep program that only allows 25 students at a time.

 I max out how many credits I can take and work multiple jobs. I get enough sleep and am up at 6am every day. I'm in a healthy relationship. I make time for friends. My professors have no qualms about singling me out, and my classmates tease me when I worry if I'll do well on a test or assignment. I get away with sassing my professors, and tell jokes that make the class laugh. 

People ask what my hobbies are. I work out, I bike, I swim, I play chess, I read books. What kind of books? I like nonfiction and classical novels, and sometimes indulge in science fiction. What Netflix shows do I like? Oh, I don't watch TV, never really have, it just doesn't appeal to me. What about music? Oh, I don't really listen to music. 

I keep people at arm's length, I'm friendly and good-natured, but always a little distant. When they need help studying or writing an essay or making a PowerPoint, they know I'm glad to help. But they don't see past the ready smile and well-kept hair. 

I cry in the lab where I'm a research assistant after the participants have gone home because I accidentally added the wrong time slot and had to cancel a participant. 

My counselor books me an appointment for the psychiatrist. She reccomends antidepressants. She knows I'll follow the directions to the letter. She doesn't have to worry about me. I'm the easy client. ",05Dec2018,1
33,"I had everything going for me really, I was smart, looked good, made pretty decent money, had a beautiful girlfriend.. and now it's all gone. For over a year now I have been losing tremendous amounts of sleep and have developed social anxiety beyond what I would ever imagine. I can barely leave my house and when I do I feel this burning, unsettling sensation that everyone is just out to pick fun at me, to glare at me, wonder ""what the f\*\*\* is wrong with that kid"". I play videogames all day, I don't feel as sharp or smart as I used to, I look like hell on earth. My face always feels so tight but I still cant sleep, still can't get rid of the stress even though I'm doing absolutely nothing with my life. My only purpose here is to pass time until I die, and I am beyond displeased that my life has come to this.

34,"I got a pet dog when I got in high school. And one fine day as I woke up I started to feel that he's in danger and needs my help desperately. I heard him wailing in fear and thought he's trying to run away from something he is afraid of. I so wanted to help him but could not do. The reason being, I had no dog. That was the first attack I had of schizophrenia. 

The time I realised I rushed to my cousin who happens to be a psychologist. And he, based on a long Q&amp;A session, diagnosed me with acute schizophrenia. 

It all had completely stopped but I was unaware of what I was going through for sure until the day I told my friends about a novel that my girlfriend authored and got published. I told them about the plot of the story and how I had put in some efforts with some chapter in  the same just to realize later that, there happens to be no such novel.

35,"I’m not suicidal or thinking about self harm.

A bit of backstory on myself. I’m a senior in college majoring in computer science. I am graduating next semester. I hope to take a gap year and figure things out before I settle down in my career. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m not desirable to my friends. I’ve never been close to my family, but I do care about them deeply. Not having a close friend that I can talk to about anything or hang out with without having to plan leaves a significant void. 

There are times where I just wanna disappear and leave everyone. I feel like a burden when I’m hanging out friends. I feel like they only hang out with me bc of similar friend circles. Individually, we never have intimate conversations or talk somewhat consistently. 

I have noticed that I’m slowly isolating myself from everything. I spend most of my time in my room. I recently got rid of social media. I’ve never acknowledged my depression because it felt manageable but now it’s clearly affecting my life. 

I want to improve myself. Any suggestions on actions I can take? How can I approach my friend situation? How can I better take care of my mental and physical health. Note, I will search through this subreddit for other post. I found this subreddit to be more appropriate than ones I’m subscribed too. ",05Dec2018,1
36,"So I have been professionally diagnosed with anxiety/BPD. Known that for a while. 
For a really long time, I've been feeling super detached from the outside world. 
Due to family issues, I've had to move around pretty frequently. Finding new friends is a big issue for me, and trying to find my way into friend groups or even just finding a person I can call a genuine friend is very difficult. 
I can get along with people pretty easy, and kinda change my ways and opinions to fit into crowds a little easier. But it seems like every friend I make could care less about me. Once I'd move away, they wouldn't try to keep in touch or anything. They'd unfriend me on social media, delete my number, ignore attempts on my end. 
This has been sort of a lifelong thing, throughout high school and middle school I very very rarely hung out with people outside of school. And if I did it would happen once and then we'd probably never talk again.

In really starting to think I'm a toxic person. I don't think I'm entitled to have friends, people can choose whoever they want to associate with. I go back and forth from 'Youre a good person! you deserve to have a best friend! and a fun friend group!"" to ""you belong in r/ niceguys! why are you so entitled? nobody HAS to be friends with you."" And it's really been taking it's toll on me.
I've been feeling like I'm not human- not like a cool edgy alien or something, but like some sort of gross, weird blob that people are avoiding for a reason I just don't know yet.

39,"This started when I was in my graduate year in high school. I was feeling overwhelmed with all the studying to exams and started to feel very empty. Things that made me happy before, suddently didn't work. I lost my interest in lots of things. For example, instead of studying I would just sit in my room, not even playing videogames, because I just didn't have mood for that. 

I graduated eventually and got to university. I thought, that when I will finally study something that interests me, this feeling would go away. But it just continued. I have no motivation for studying and still don't have much interest in anything.

Lately, this constant mood of emptiness/apathy started to get disrupted by abrupt change into mood of total motivation and optimistic look onto my future. It lasts about few hours and then it goes back to my ""normal"". It's so sudden and it doesn't have any clear trigger.

Now I don't know what to think about it. It scares me a little bit to be honest. It's weirder that the previous mood, because that could be due the stress from exams.

School doesn't make it better and right now I have 35% (permitted) absence because a lot of days it just feels impossible to get up in the morning. I have absolutely 0 motivation and all school does is stress me out with meaningless assignments and long, noisy, dull lectures void of any actual content. I physically can't have PE but my teachers are being dicks and won't let me remove the subject or help me come to a  compromise in any way (they just told me to 'not run' and get an E) which is also stressing me out and giving me anxiety. The only subjects where I actually feel like I am learning something are maths and physics. I'm also an overachiever so if I get anything less than a B I just break down.

I don't have any friends in school so that can't motivate me.  It just feels like a pointless time-consumer because in the end I sit through shitty and loud lessons just to come home and study for like 4 more hours. Nothing feels like it matters.

i don’t care about anyone but myself, though. i don’t care about my parents and i don’t care about my friends. my relationship with my parents is very strained due to emotional neglect since childhood. i have never had a real friend who hasn’t betrayed me in some horrible way, so i have no desire to actually care about or trust anyone emotionally anymore. so, i don’t care about anyone but myself. it’s made it very difficult for me to make new friends because i just don’t care enough about anyone i meet to try to get to know them better. i’ve stopped caring about whether or not i’m lonely forever because i’ve always been lonely. but, that also means that now i only care about myself and it’s putting a strain on my life in a lot of ways.

I need to have control over my actions, my outcomes, and my choices. The anxiety this causes me is the fear of mental illness consuming my ability to make rational decisions or act sensibly.

Meaning:

I need things in my life to have meaning. I need my emotions and decisions to count for something. The anxiety thie causes is me is the fear that circumstances outside of my control will either take away the things that are meaningful to me such as my friends and family, or that events in my life would influence me to become a miserable nihilist.

Well-Being:

I can accept that in life, bad things are just going to happen one way or the other, no matter how long I hold them off. This generally doesn't make me that anxious in and of itself. What does make me anxious, however, is that I should discover something no one was meant to know about, or that some event in life would render me so unable to come to terms with life afterwards that I'd have to delude myself into avoiding what I learned.",05Dec2018,1

The meds I take are venlafaxine (75mg, 4 caps), propranolol (40mg, 1cap), haloperidol (1mg, 1cap) and valproic acid (2 caps, total 750mg).

About three months ago, my stomach is suffering a lot from the side effects, and I've been I'm pain, not able to eat properly and feeling nauseous all day.

51,"So this is a kind of dream that has happened before, quite a bit at Uni too, I'm 25 now. But in the past 2 weeks it's been getting worse. 

Bare with me here, because there are 2 parts to this.

One is the recurringness of girls I used to date, perhaps still like, and having to witness them develop a relationship with my close friends, maybe in the dream i'm living with my best mate and one of my ex's who for some reason are together and having sex really loudly in the room next to me (this is a hugely common dream for me). I think the dream is trying to make me always feel not wanted by this. I get the feeling it wants me to feel like a loser, at least I feel like that what it's trying to do to me. The girl in the dream will also make it ovious they are not interested in me anymore either by ignoring me or just laughing at me, say when waling past my door, it's really strange. 

So the second part, which is always switches to and ends up at, is a huge flood/tsunami type deal. For instance, in my dream last night, it was about a girl I used to date called Nicole, and she was with my old mate Alex. And for the moments that I was in my room, when I looked about my window, he water level was past the window and I could see huge waves smashing everything in it's path. The dream always ends there, I never experience the water hitting me, but more just visualise a calamity of destruction and huge scary waves that usually are the thing that wakes me up. One time, it wasnt just a tsunami, but what looked like the end of the world. Some of these things are honestly terrifying, but honestly, the girl stuff is worse. It always brings back old feeling and memories of girls. 

Just like to also say, I'm not being hugely affected by this. I'm a big boy and know it's all just bullshit, but it's actually getting quite annoying waking up sometimes as I feel a bit shitty for 10 mins just due to all the horrible thigs people would've said to me i the dream/the rejection/fear I felt. 

So to conclude, I have nightmares that start my old girlfriends rejecting me for my mates, and then always ends up being a natural world disaster where I see waves the size of mountains coming for me and flooding of my local towns.

52,"Lately my(F/16) 16 year old male friend has become more aggressive than usual, and I’m really worried about him.

I’m not the only one that has noticed, another very good friend of his and his neighbor for almost life has also talked to me about how she found him too be extremely aggressive.

I kinda just noticed it all when he made a joke about raping me today. I understand, 16 year old boys’ “humor” is usually just offensive and explicit for the sake of being offensive and explicit, but when I pointed out to him that I found his “joke” quite disturbing and it made me feel uncomfortable, he acted very defensive, stating that i’m the only person that sees it that way (which i’m obviously not) and that he did nothing wrong and i’m wrong for criticizing him.

As for other aggressive behavior, the normal and occasionally “fuck you” shouted at the screen after losing a game of fortnite has turned into a “i will rape your mom” or “i hope that if you’re a refugee you get deported back to syria and die in the war” (we live in Germany). 

Additionally he constantly fights with his parents, is extremely rude and cruel to other people for no valid reason at all, and when you point out some of his rude behavior to him, he immediately fires back and shuts you down.

My friend (his neighbor) and I are very worried and we feel like if we tell him to go to anger management classes or get professional help, he won’t even listen and actively do the opposite as a way to spite us for “infringing on his freedom“. And since he doesn’t even listen to his parents or have any (authority) figures he looks up to, there isn’t anyone we could ask to talk to him.

So my question is: what is the best thing we can do in this situation? is this just a weird phase or should we seriously consider seeking help?

Its always manifested itself in what I understand to be a fairly normal way: lethargy, apathy, feelings of sadness and pointlessness. In the last year, I’ve been seeing a therapist who helped me notice a pattern: I need things to be perfect or I won’t engage with them. This means, for example that if my alarm fails to go off in the morning and I oversleep, I just won’t do anything that day. I haven’t left the house for 3 days now, and I can already feel myself thinking “This week is a write-off, I’ll just wait til Monday and then do next week properly”.

I don’t have any real memories of my childhood, every “memory” I have is based off of pictures, stories, and dreams. It’s not just my childhood, it’s everything. You would think that I would have clear memories of important life events like the death of my father, the birth of my siblings, high school graduation, etc. I don’t. I feel like I do because I’ve seen pictures and heard stories but when I really think about it, I don’t have any actual memories. So, in short, my long term memory sucks. But I also have problems with short term memory. Sometimes I will be in the middle of a conversation and then just forget what we were even talking about. This happens often. It pisses me off because there have been several instances where I’m arguing with my fiancé and he says something stupid, I fuss, then forget the stupid thing he said so I’m never able to back up my arguments lol. I have excellent memory when it comes to birthdays and phone numbers but if you ask me what I wore to work yesterday or what I did last weekend, I have to really sit and think super hard. It’s annoying when friends bring up old stories like “remember that time we did so and so freshman year of college?” And I always just have to pretend like I know what they’re talking about. 

I’m not saying I have no memories whatsoever because I have plenty, but none of them are clear or vivid and I really believe they’re based off of what I’ve seen in pictures and heard from other people. I also think most of my “memories” are just facts. Like I know that I met my best friend in biology class but I don’t actually remember anything about that class or even talking to her but I make up these scenarios in my mind of what it was probably like so now I’ve adopted those thoughts as memories even though that’s not how it really happened. 

Is this normal? I don’t like talking about it to my family because I always get the “oh, you’re way too young to know anything about bad memory, wait til you get my age!” and my friends don’t really think anything of it.

It got to the point where I didn't want to leave the house without a plastic bag with me (I still do this). I also get nauseous at home. When I go to sleep, the nausea start. The last 2 weeks, I've woken up numerous times and couldn't return to sleep until after a few hours later.

I gets so bad that, even with a plastic bag with me, I feel like I have to leave the room, otherwise I will throw up. My grades have gone down, because I cannot focus during the classes and the exams. I feel like I have to distract myself from the nausea and do this by playing games on my laptop. Of course, this prevents me from (completely) focussing on the class itself. 

Currently, I'm under treatment with a psychologist. After a couple of sessions, she concluded that I *might* be autistic and that that could be a reason for the panic disorder. Unfortunalty, I only have a session about once per month, so currently I do not know for sure.

The reason I'm writing here is to see if there are any other people that had a panic disorder where they felt like they would throw up. I think it would help me if someone could get me a few tips on how they dealt with the panic disorder and how they got rid of it. For example: did you go to a therapist/psychologist, did you use any medication, did a certain diet help etc?

I would be amazing if any of you have any tips that could help me dealing with my panic disorder. ",05Dec2018,1
65,"Hi all. Started receiving treatment in the form of meds earlier this year. So this all feels quite new to come to terms with. 

Recently I’ve found that I struggle with people referring to me as “depressed”. I feel like the word has so much permanence and identity built into it. I don’t know if my uncomfortability with this word is due to my own subconscious prejudices? Or just me struggling to accept what I am?

Maybe this feeling will pass as I understand more about myself in the coming months. 

If anyone has had a similar experience or has any advice for me, please do share! 

Thanks a lot. 

TLDR: the word “depressed” makes me uncomfortable. Why? Should it? ",05Dec2018,1
66,"I've had urges to cut my wrists for over a decade, but I rarely do it because I know I won't die and people will see the scars. My toxic family would bully me over it to no end.

I wish I could just cut during times when I could hide the scars, or during times I know I won't go anywhere and see people. Or maybe make them look like accidents so no one suspects anything. And when they heal, do it again.

I'm too depressed to cover them with make up my whole life.

69,"**This is very long. But I just need some kind of input from somebody, anyone because I need to know what's wrong with me. I cannot talk to anybody in real life about this. I have no idea what is wrong with me, but I just know something has been wrong for a very long time.** The last time I remember being fully happy and mentally ""stable"" if you must, I was a kid. Ever since puberty (7th grade? \~12 years old) I haven't been okay mentally. I'm 17 now.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have good memory, so aside from major memorable moments, I don't really remember the *specifics* of my life til now. Only the general gist. But I'd say my mental health REALLY took a turn for the worse in 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017, my friendship group started to expand as other friendship groups essentially came and ""merged"" into ours. We went from like, 7 people to nearly 20 *(yes, 2-0!).* To the other people in the group, this was fine because they were already friends with all those people. But I'm kinda shy, and those 7 initial people were the only friends I had. So when all these people joined, I went from being the ""funny, bubbly bestie"" to being a nobody within my own group. I started being left out (it embarrasses me to say it, but I'll detail it): being closed off from the circle, being ignored, overlooked, people generally not caring because they didn't know me well and my friends taking priority of those people over me, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

If this happened now, I would just leave that group. But since this was the first time this seriously happened to me, it was devastating. I didn't even care about getting my friends' approval. Naturally, I stopped liking them as much anyways. I turned all of that hurt inwards. I figured if they're leaving me out, it's ***my*** fault and that ***I*** must be doing something wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up becoming very depressed and suicidal over it (over the year). I started to search for the ""why"", the magical thing I could fix that would make me worthy again. I'd look at the popular girls to see what they had that I didn't. I figured it could be because I wasn't as pretty as them. So I started to analyze my features, see what was making me ugly, inspecting myself in the mirror... ***every single day.*** It developed into full-blown BDD (Body Dysmorphia). Let's just say at my worst, I thought I looked inhumane and felt ashamed of showing my face in public. I would sometimes come home from school at 4pm and sit in front of my mirror analyzing my face until 8pm. I would stay up until the sun rose researching plastic surgeons, proportions or photo shopping my pictures, taking photos and videos of myself, seeking reassurance etc etc...

&amp;#x200B;

Then came the obsessive intrusive thoughts. And the social anxiety due to being excluded. I started to isolate myself and stopped hanging out with people. Every lunch and morning tea, I would hang out by myself at the library or art room. I stopped talking, I only spoke when spoken to. Anytime I was distressed, cutting myself with a razor blade became really enticing (although I did it once or twice, I never made a habit out of it after seeing somebody addicted to cutting warn against it. Instead, I usually scratched and clawed at myself. Or slap/hit myself). I'd imagine horrible, horrible things happening to me. It made me feel better because I felt something was inherently wrong with me, so I deserved it.

&amp;#x200B;

I distinctly remember two times: one where I began to write a suicide note, because I planned to commit suicide when I turned 18 &amp; one where I was so upset and distressed that I held a razor blade against the top of my wrist and wanted nothing more than to just end my life. But for some reason, I just couldn't do it. My brother came into my room and saw the razor blade I put down. I told him I didn't want to live anymore. He's only young, so I don't fully blame him for not taking it seriously; but now he uses me saying that as leverage against me with my parents. So i regret saying it.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, it was just really shitty. It was mainly because of the school environment, going to school everyday was torture. When I wasn't at school, I was usually in a bearable mood despite what I was struggling with. I could never tell anybody what I was going through. I had nobody I felt comfortable talking to. And each time I'd tell somebody a glimpse of what was happening, things would go left. I remember telling one of my nicer friends that I felt really left out. He ended up telling the rest of the group, who all said they think I was hanging out by myself to try and get attention &amp; sympathy from people (another nicer friend let me know).

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, the school year ended and I had 2 months free of school for Christmas holidays. A lot changed. I stopped being religious. I studied CBT and mindfulness. I stopped feeding into my BDD and OCD thoughts. I became a lot better because of that break. I needed it depserately. Even when I went back to school this year, it stuck. I was nowhere near perfect. But if things stayed the same as they were last year, I would most definitely have at least attempted to commit suicide. It helped that my friendship group became small again, so I could hang out with them and feel more included (the smarter thing would've been to make new friends; but I struggle to make new friends).

&amp;#x200B;

So whilst I'm better than I was last year... things are still wrong. Now I'm not depressed almost 24/7, but I still feel stuck in this *'slightly blue/unstatisfied'* mood. That's like, my baseline. I still don't get happiness out of life. I don't feel much motivation to do good things for myself because I still don't see much point in life. I just don't. I wish I had a different brain because then I might. Lately I just sleep, wake up for a while and then sleep again because even my dreams are more enjoyable than reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I still have an extremely unstable mood. I can be at my baseline mood, then within an hour, go to feeling horrible and worthless, wanting to commit suicide. Then a couple hours later, feel pretty, confident and giggly for no real reason. Then go back to normal-ish. Then ugly, paranoid and sad again. Bla bla bla. You get it. It's annoying because I can't even be assured in my own thoughts and feelings. Anytime something bad OR good happens, I can't take it seriously because my mind will change later at it's own will anyways. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I do try! It kinda annoys me when people say it's all in your own hands. If it was all in my own hands, I'd choose to be happy. Duh! I tried diligently for so long to improve things (try to be more sociable, pray to God more, care about my looks more, think positively, stop ruminating, be proactive, take risks, join activities, etc). Did it make things better? Somewhat. But here I am writing about my crappy mental health on a Reddit forum, so that tells you the extent of how much it worked. And I know everybody has bad days/ mood swings, but I don't think it's generally normal to want to seriously kill yourself every time your mood changes for the worse.

&amp;#x200B;

And as I mentioned at the start of this post, I tend to forget that I've always been like this. 2017 was the result of my regular mental state combined with a less than desirable situation (being isolated at school). I realized the problem was much more deep-rooted than I thought when I found a diary entry dated back to 2013, when I was twelve years old. I was talking about how much I hated myself (including my race and appearance), how people treated me and how I didn't want to live anymore. I remember that the reason I always wear sleeved/looser clothing *now* is because of comments people made about my body, saying I looked like a duck, having boys slap my butt (without permission) and being told the only reason any of the boys knew who I was is because of my body.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember how I had bad insomnia due to paranormal fears for 3 and 1/2 years starting in 6th grade. Struggling to sleep for the whole night after that... I remembered how the first time I actually cut myself was in 8th or 9th grade  (funnily enough, I was just copying somebody else and ended up liking the relief it gave me), and my friends made fun of me for wearing jumpers to cover it up (we'd had a falling-out - they thought I said they were mistreating me, so they refused to talk or hang out with me; but I was talking about a completely different person!).  I just wish I could change my brain. I'll admit my struggles actually helped hone my talent, individuality and creativity, but I'd take a peace of mind over what I have now any day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could go back to being a child. I was very happy. Bubbly. Only a little bit shy. Still made friends easily. Loved playing online multiplayer games and watching Disney shows. Playing with the neighbours all the time. Less technology. Smaller town. I didn't overthink anything. I was so innocent, and now I'm a crockpot of random mental fuckeries and no matter how much I try to change things from the inside-out, it never works. I often wish I could try alcohol (or even drugs like weed or LSD) if it could just set me free of myself, even if only for a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that's that explained. I figured to show what I mean by my mood patterns, I should document my mood over a day so you can see what I mean (the times are approximate):

* **Before 6pm:** OK, Slightly below neutral.
* **6pm-4am:** Very depressed. Suicidal thoughts. Mentally + Physically Tired.
* **4am:** Very laughable, giggly. In turn: very confident, carefree. Problems don't matter anymore. Energetic.
* **7am:** Mentally/Physically Tired. Non-related Tension headache. Feeling below neutral. Hopeless, tired, numb. Mental exhaustion from changing moods. Frustrastion/Anxiety for next negative change in mood.
* \*Slept \~7 hours until 1pm\*
* **1pm:** Agitated. Feeling alright. Blue. A bit hopeless/given up, but not suicidal.
* **2pm:** Feel better due to good event. Confident. Neutral. Not good but not bad. Productive.
* **7pm:** Stressed. Detached. Irritable. Doubtful of self. Disappointed/Hopeless in self. A little upset/sad (influenced by stress). Tired.
* **8pm:** Broke down into tears (pushed over the edge by a misunderstanding with a family member). Calmed down. Felt numb. Went to bed.
* **10pm** until now: Woke up again. Feel neutral/blue again. Not bad, not good. Bored. Unmotivated. Felt a bit more happiness by distracting myself with YouTube videos and music. Feeling a bit detached/unreal because half a day ago I felt miserable and now I feel alright. Confused.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this was long, but if anybody could even give me their input I would be so grateful. I can't live my whole life like this or else I fear one day I will get pushed over the edge and commit suicide. I just want to enjoy life. Funny how I'm good at helping other people, but I can't even help myself.

72,"Background:


My boyfriend and I (both 20) met a few years ago and had a relationship for a few months but we had issues, mostly on my part, so it ended. I had pretty bad episodes of paranoia because I smoked weed every day, I had a whole load of insecurities and I was very emotionally unstable. He had anxiety and frequently stayed awake until early morning to do school work or play games, and didn't know how best to cope with my mental problems at the time - something I don't blame him for because retrospectively I can see that I was intense and would have been very hard to deal with.


Fast forward:


We reconnected recently and hit it off instantly, realising that the connection between us was still immense and that a lot of the things that had caused us issues had vanished - he had matured a lot, realised he hadn't dealt with things in the best way and was apologetic for it, and I rarely smoke weed anymore so the paranoia and emotional instability have disappeared, as well as the anxiety which now only rarely pops its head out of the water. He goes to university 200 miles away and I'm working full time - the long distance is not an issue for us though.


A few months before we reconnected, he had started smoking weed almost every day whereas he had previously been pretty averse to it. He gets generalised every day anxiety and he stays awake every single night until any time between 3am and 7am - he may get physically tired sometimes around midnight but his mind races and it stops him from sleeping. He also has episodes wherein he's manic and very energetic, as well as episodes where he feels absolutely nothing, and we suspect bipolar disorder.


He's a perfectionist, he's incredibly passionate and he loves taking on little projects which he sometimes obsesses over - this can often be what keeps his mind awake at night, alongside his uni work. He would tell me how he felt if I asked but he hates being seen as a victim and hates feeling pitied so he's reluctant to talk about how he feels unless asked. He constantly amazes me with how incredibly smart he is and he's doing well at university regardless of his mental issues, but I hate to think of him being anything but happy and I want to be able to help him to get better.


He is actively trying to improve his situation. He has drawn up a weekly routine which involves:

- Exercising at least three times per week
- Meditation
- Getting into bed at midnight (at the latest) - he is physically unable to get to sleep until about 3-4am most of the time though.
- Stopping smoking weed so often (limiting himself to once a week) - the problem with this is that since trying to follow this routine, if he can't sleep past about 2am, he'll smoke to get himself tired.
- Taking various different vitamins
- Eating 3 meals a day (something which doesn't currently happen because he wakes up between 2pm and 5pm)


Really what I'm asking here is: has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, what actually helped you to get better? And is there any way in which I can help him, being 200 miles away, except encouraging him to abide by his new routine? I see him approx. every other weekend.

She refers to her ex boyfriend (who she hasn't spoken to in a year) as her boyfriend and acts as if they are still in a serious relationship.

88,"I apologize for my poor writing, I can't clearly discuss this with proper sentence structure and wording  


About five months ago, the girl I loved died. It wasn't a normal death, it was a brutal beating. It took days to identify the body. Me, along with a few friends, tried to track her down, hoping it wasn't her, and eventually helped ""identify"" the body through a recollection of all our stories and whereabouts. Later that week, her dental records were pulled and it was concrete - it was her.   


I put her funeral together on a very short notice, held it all, said our goodbyes, cried, and everyone went our separate ways. That where it ended for most people, but things got worse for me after that. I am in the military, so I travel a lot and don't really have time to cope with things. Fortunately, the event happened while I was on an extended leave back in my hometown, so I was surrounded by friends and family. So the support was there, and I could cope with it. It was terrible, still -- but because I was around friends and family constantly, it was easier.   


Around October, I got word that I'm being deployed to the Middle East. This is where it really helped me -- and the loneliness, longing and isolating set in. For two weeks, I barely talked, slept, or ate. I was a complete mess. Waking up at 5am but not being able to sleep until well after midnight. No appetite. All I could think about was her. How much I loved her. How much she meant to me. The little memories go through my head all the time. Her smile. The way she talked. It was all so vivid -- I could hear her voice or see her in a crowd of people. I loved her more than you could ever know. For 4 years I loved her, dearly, and never a day went by that I didn't think about how precious, sweet and kind she was.   


I suppose it's my deep love for her that made things worse after she was murdered. At first, things started out small. On a few occasions, I would be walking in a crowd and ""see her,"" and it hit me that this was an issue when I found myself chasing after a woman and nearly scared her half to death when I grabbed her. My brain KNEW it couldn't be here, I know she's dead, but my legs just moved. My adrenalin pumped, hair stood up, and I had to confront her.   


The second thing that started happening where the voices before bed. Right when I was dozing off, I would hear her voice in my barracks. For some reason, I was filled with distress and fear, like I Was frozen and couldn't turn over and face what was on the other side of my bed. It got to the point where I just told myself, ""this isn't happening,"" and rolled over as quick as I could and jumped up, but of course, the room was empty. Just me and my roommate, who at this point is starting to think I'm a little crazy.   


I started going to the Chaplain and mental health. Chaps told me I was going through, ""grief,"" and there was no, ""right,"" way to deal with it, and that my experiences are completely normal. She referred me to mental health and they basically told me the same thing. Seems like nobody cares unless you're a harm to yourself or others.  


Moving forward -- I started to have some really concerning hallucinations. It started out as sleep paralysis just a few times a week, where I couldn't move but I would feel a presence in the room, as if ""she"" was standing over me and watching me. Things quickly became worse in that short amount of time. At this point, I am having sleep paralysis almost every night, and any time I nap. It's gotten to the point where I know see her there, standing at the bed of my foot. It's extremely vivid. Last week, I had an episode where I woke up, and I just saw her at the foot of my bed standing there -- I was so afraid but couldn't move. She started to crawl up on my bed. It was vivid. Very vivid. The entire experience seemed so real. I even remember the clothes she was wearing. It was an old T-shirt and shorts, with no bra, so as she crawled on my bed, her breasts where exposed. She got face to face with me and started strangling me. I remember gasping for air. It was like I was actually being choked. I closed my eyes and tried to scream but nothing came out. I started to see black and pass out, and then I quickly shot out of my bed screaming and breathing heavy, trying to get air into my lungs.   


I've tried to move on, too, and be with other people, but I can't have sex. Every time I have sex, and the girl wants something other than vanilla sex, I can't do it. I can't choke. I can't hit or smack, which most girls I presume enjoy that, and I've had sexual partners ask me to do that since, but I just can't. I refuse to. My body starts to shake. All I can think about is how she was beat and strangled. I can't watch violent movies, either, or anything with gore or rape in it. I panic, freeze, and have to leave the room .  


Recently, I've gotten orders to arm up and do combat training to go on a deployment. A deployment. While I'm dealing with these issues. And my chain of command knows I've been to mental health and chaplain multiple times, and I'm trying to seek help but nobody is listening -- all they want to do is hand me a gun and tell me to go kill people. I don't feel comfortable with a weapon. I don't feel comfortable with violence right now. I break down over movies, over sex -- I can't sleep at night because all I see is her. I'm terrified to fall asleep. I've started having vivid hallucinations outside of my sleep cycle, where I actually hear and see her in broad daylight. I think I'm going crazy, but nobody cares. ""Oh, it's normal,"" or, ""there's no right way to deal with grief,"" and nothing will happen. It's the same every day. I'm, ""mentally sound,"" on my medical record, so arm me up and ship me out, right?   


I'm tired of the hallucinations. The images. I hear her voice all the time. I see her. Smell her. Everywhere. I just want to move on and forget. It's so painful. There's a deep sorrow and feeling of distress within me that I can't run from. I just want all the noise to stop. I've reached out to everyone, and yet here I am on fucking reddit to just vent. Sometimes it's good to hear yourself talk.

89,"The title says it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: My roommate has diagnosed depression and anxiety. She tells mutual friends her suicidal thoughts but not me (which is odd because we are friends). Anyways, she is a complete slob. If I ask her to complete a simple tax *(such as ""its your turn to take the trash out"" or to put her dishes in the dishwasher)* I always get the ""I am too busy"" or ""I'm overwhelmed"" response. She in turn is just watching TV in the living room all day, or skipping all her classes. She is not actually busy, like ever.  
Since I know her diagnosis, I end up doing 99% of her cleanliness duties to keep my sanity. I may have a higher standard than most, so I just get it done rather than discuss problems with my roommate and have her make excuses. I will also mention that her room is trashed and has been for two months. I know she is embarrassed about it, but has never attempted to clean it, ever. This is something I don't discuss with her as not my circus not my monkeys.

  
Anyways.

How do I get her to take responsibility? I need to have a mature conversation with her, properly delegating tasks and addressing her hygene. I know I need to be respectful in this conversation due to her mental health. She lies to make excuses (I see this in her personal life daily) and gets extremely angry if anything is brought to her attention that she may be doing wrong.

I want to be respectful. But how do you accurately have a mature/constructive conversation with someone, who is basically a total wall (due to their depression and anxiety)?",05Dec2018,1
90,"First off I want to say I do not have anxiety myself, I've had just a few anxiety attacks in my life but I definitely don't know what it's like to live with it constantly. This is just me sharing an experience I've had involving anxiety. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to write this wall of text on but it seems close enough. 

So this all starts last February when I started dating someone who has anxiety. I didn't think too much about it, I had a few friends with anxiety so I figured it wouldn't be very different. Everything was going very well at first, things moved pretty fast because I really fell for her and I'm pretty sure at the time the feelings were mutual. I hadn't really had much experience before her and didn't really understand the issues with moving too fast.

So then in April things started to go wrong. I made some shitty mistakes in a short amount of time. I don't really want to go into detail about them but after that I noticed she was really distant and uncomfortable around me. I tried to get her to open up about what the issue was but she didn't want to. It really stressed me out, and on top of that we both had exams and were drowning in our own personal problems. So things just kept getting worse until she broke it off. 

That's pretty basic stuff, nothing too special but what happened after was the real learning experience. So at this time I was supposed to start an internship helping one of my profs as a programmer on this indie game that had been in development hell for a few years. The only problem was between when I was hired and when I started working the funding all disappeared. I should have looked for something else but I was feeling pretty shitty so I figured ""fuck it, I'll be an unpaid intern for the summer"" 

So the game is called Guide (supposed to release soon on Android and itch.io, shameless plug but that's why I decided to write about this today, and I'm probably not going to make any money off of it anyway). It was started by a few students who were dealing with anxiety and wanted to make a game aimed at teaching kids about anxiety. The game doesn't go to deep and is really short, but it was made to be used as a resource for counselors working with kids to start a conversation about anxiety. While working on the game I read a lot of material on anxiety, but more importantly learned about the experiences that my co-workers and pretty much everyone who play tested the game. We tried our best to make every feature related to anxiety in some way.

So now thinking back on that relationship I understand some things a bit better. One example that really stands out for me was the night before we broke up. We had hung out earlier that day and I was feeling relived because I thought things were finally getting better, but then when we hung out later she seemed really uncomfortable again. She didn't want me on her bed, which was weird because we were watching a movie in her room meaning we had to sit uncomfortably on the floor, and she was insistent that I had to leave by 11 which was also unusual. I'm ashamed to say it, but at the time what I thought was ""she probably wanted me gone so she could sleep with someone else after I left"". Looking back on it now I see that her bed was sort of her safe space, it was comforting to her and I was invading that space. She even had a blankey that was probably like a sensory object that helped her calm down, and only while working on Guide did I learn about sensory objects because we used them as pickup items. I just feel really bad about how I made that situation all about me.

I even asked her if she cheated on me a few months later, she said she didn't and I believe her because she really has no reason to lie about it at that point. I tried to reconnect with her over text about a month ago, I think we enjoyed catching up but she told me she wasn't really comfortable talking to me again so that's that. She did let me apologize for what happened and was very kind and understanding, so I'm actually pretty happy with that outcome even though I still miss her.

There are plenty more situations that I see a little differently now that I know more. I just really wish I knew more about anxiety back when we were together. 

TL:DR op dated someone with anxiety and it didn't work out, then worked on a game about anxiety and got some perspective.",05Dec2018,1

92,"I suffer from Anti Social Personality Disorder, I used to be referred to as a Sociopath but it was changed. I can't openly say what it is I suffer from day in day out and I also have to do my best to hide it , double check every word before I say it make sure my reactions to things are correct and basically spend my whole life hiding in plain site.

That all said I wanted to ask if there is anyone who had advise for me on this, I know for the most part people are paying more attention and are more understanding of mental health issues of late but I have one of those disorders people are still scared of so I feel I have to hide it and I am used to internalising everything but it takes its toll.

93,"I've just started high school a few months ago. Everybody made friends, has a great relationship with everyone. Except me.
I mean, I have 2 friends from class, but it still hurts. I've never even really talked to my other classmates, and I feel so bad because of it. I want to talk to them and make more friends, but I just can't. Something inside me stops me from talking to them. I dont want to be an exception. 

And it's not just about school... Wherever I go, whoever I meet, I just can't act like other people. I can't be open with people. 

I'm depressed because people don't talk to me. I try to be more open, but it doesn't change a thing. At the end of the day, I'm still the one who is """"antisocial"""". For this reason, my classmates don't invite me anywhere. I try to be better but I always fail. And I hate it. I hate myself for this. 

I think I have social anxiety, and I want to change it. I want to be a better person,but don't get me wrong. I don't want to be in the spotlight, I just want to be a normal human being who can talk and sometimes can be even fun. 

What am I doing wrong? Am I just selfish? What should I change about myself? Why don't anybody likes (to talk to) me? Is it my looks? Is it my personality? 

Please help me. It all started about 3 years ago and I still can't step forward. I always said to myself that it will change, but it won't. I need help.  

If anyone could give me some advice, I would be really grateful.

96,"I’m scared of alcohol. 

Backstory: 
Two years ago I was a huge party drinker but I quit because I just didn’t like the whole “get shitfaced twice a week”-lifestyle and I just felt like it was a waste of time. Also I didn’t feel happy at that time.

I haven’t drank anything in over a year. Last time I tried alcohol was about a year ago at my birthday party and I started to feel bad. I got anxiety. I have ocd and I have this fear of drugs and alcohol and caffeine because I’m scared to be affected by something and not be in control. 

I got this drink (in Sweden) we heat up for Christmas which said it was alcohol free, but it wasn’t. On the back it says 0,4% alcohol. I have it poured up in a cup and I want to be brave and drink it but I’m afraid I will get a panic attack or anxiety. I want to be that person that can drink a beer or take like a painkiller but I’m just so afraid of being under influence of ANYTHING. What to do?

97,"I was wondering if theres anything that can stop this..when i was living with my old housemates i was going in and out of hospital in immense pain, not really knowing why, the doctors were clueless as well, they tried giving seditives and painkillers but to no affect.

I eventually had to move back home with my parents because one of their dads was sick and they needed to care for him. After that it took a solid two months for the pain to fully subside. 

I believe it was stress induced pain. But not fully sure. Ive spoken to a few doctors since and they also suggested that.

105,"I want to start off by stating that I'm aware everyone has anxiety to some extent. Everyone has their own worries, and some people unfortunately worry to the point where the anxiety is heightened past what would be considered a healthy or average amount.  

That being said I've constantly told myself ""No, you don't have any kind of heightened anxiety. Don't be dramatic. Everyone worries about stuff, you're issues are nothing to be played up"". But then after starting college, I had three lovely crying breakdowns. One in the bathroom, one in the kitchen, both of which were on the floor. Fun. Does curling up on the floor and sobbing about my worries, looming tasks, and fear of falling short count as an anxiety attack? I'm asking this now since I worry my tendency to overthink has slowly somehow gotten worse without me noticing. But then again, I still continue to tell myself ""No we've been over this, don't be dramatic"". And yet I still sometimes can't make myself walk up to a counter to order pizza just because I'm somehow worried about doing something wrong. Maybe I'm just incredibly oblivious? Or love to deny stuff? Either way I thought I could get some internet stranger's opinion. 

The first two legitimate breakdowns were in the first term, third in the second. I'm dropping out to go home and work for a while, then find a different program.
