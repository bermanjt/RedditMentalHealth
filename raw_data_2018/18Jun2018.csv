0,"I am located in Houston.

Over the past few months I have been physically ill quiet a few times whereas I never really used to get sick much. My stomach often feels nauseous which I knew was from anxiety and recently it's to the point of vomiting for countless hours. I'm hardly able to eat most days. The last few times I wrote it off as a stomach bug but this one has lasted since Thursday night (now Sunday night) and it's happening too often to keep being stomach viruses in my opinion. 

I read anxiety can weaken immune system so that could be part of it. I've seen a psychiatrist before but my insurance didn't completely cover it and it was $100 each appointment and as much as I wanted to and knew it was worth it, I just didn't have the money. I was prescribed 100mg Zoloft and then some type of heart medication to take as needed for my anxiety? It made a bit of a change but since I wasn't able to go back I didn't get to keep up with the medication. 

My anxiety and depression feels so severe now it is really harming my everyday life. I have had to miss a lot of days of work when I am physically sick. I ALWAYS go even when I am not feeling well mentally but I can't go when I am throwing up every 20 minutes. Do I see my normal doctor for this since my symptoms have now become physical?

I am just so desperate for help and don't know how I can continue living my life feeling so unwell mentally and now also physically. I will find a way to pay for whatever it takes I would just like to know what other people have done if they have gone through something like this. Thanks for all advice.  ",18Jun2018,1
1,"It has been 11 years since I was diagnosed with major depression and ptsd. But, I've suffered from these conditions for 50+ years. You see my condition was caused by severe child abuse. But, back then, not only did anybody know what ptsd was, but my abusive mother did not have a clue of what her harse treatment was doing to my psychological and emotional state.

During my recovery, I began writing inspirational poetry which sooth my mind and gave me hope. I'd like to offer it to you.

4,"It’s very odd switching from a medicine that I’ve taken for so long but it’s time. I’ve heard good things about Viibryd, but nothing about the side effects. I have three days left of titrating off Zoloft and then I’ll solely be taking Viibryd, along with Wellbutrin but I’ve been on that and doesn’t cause any side effects for me that I notice. 

For those of you who do take it or have extensive knowledge about it, what are the most common side effects that you’ve experienced/seen? How is it working for you overall? I’d definitely love to hear from any of you who have switched from Zoloft to Viibryd. 

Thank you guys, of course. ",18Jun2018,1
5,"I'm a 20 year old male living in the UK, I've had a really bad year and a half and I feel like I'm losing touch with reality. I used to be pretty confident but I've lost my ability to talk to people. I'm actually terrified of being myself. Its causing me to isolate myself and I feel myself declining fast. I wont bore you with too much but Im getting really paranoid and I feel like the world is against me, cars follow me and my ""friends"" are all mocking me &amp; know me better than I know myself. Sometimes when I talk to people I seem to sort of re gain consciousness and can't remember the last 30 seconds but they look at me like I've said something horrible. I'm told that I can be really rude and abrupt but I honestly don't mean to be. I've been jobless for like 6 months and I've honestly given up on life. I do take recreational drugs, I try my hardest not to but I always end up on something.

A few nights ago I was in hospital after taking LSD, drinking 3 bottles of wine and smoking weed, I can handle my drugs but I was alone and really losing my shit. I asked to be sectioned or something, but they just gave me fluids and sent me home. 

About 2 days after the hospital visit, I got drunk and went to the local nightclub street and started a fight with a police officer. Got charged with like 4 things including assaulting 2 officers. They cut my clothes off of me and had my legs restrained, it was pretty traumatic. I'm not sure why I did it, but I knew what I was doing. I told the police that I need help, again, they just sent me home the next morning. 

I've tried talking to doctors but the healthcare system here seems to be crumbling and they just want to rush the appointments &amp; try to play down how I'm feeling. So I always just end up agreeing with them and leaving, only to get worse. I really feel like I'm at tipping point.

Any ideas on how to speed up the process of getting a diagnosis/help?? All I have is fucking sertraline and I don't feel like its enough.

6,"For the past few months I've been stuck in the worst rut. It all started in December 5/6 months ago when I got an abortion .. i found out i was almost 4 months pregnant and had no idea because i was still menstruating and on top of that actually losing weight. I had to abort out of medical necessity. There was no heartbeat and my body was rejecting the pregnancy and I had some form of toximea. When I found out, I was newly in a relationship with my girlfriend and even though at first she was upset, she stood by me because it was from a guy I was with for one night before I had even met her, so she couldn't be mad at me. Ever since then during the 3 week period i had to use to recover I slowly put on 30 lbs in the last 6 months and I'm the heaviest I've ever been. None of my clothes fit me and because I'm so ashamed of the weight gain I've been isolating myself from family and all my friends. I finally got a job that I'm starting this week and I'm afraid I'll fuck it up because my low self esteem makes me not care about anything. My depression makes me ache so much that getting up and dressing myself or cleaning the house is an accomplishment. I'm making my girlfriend miserable and she's getting fed up to the point where she might leave me because at first she was sympathetic and stuff but now it's becoming hard to live with. I'm sick of crying every day and having a pity party for myself and I'm so angry. I want to love myself again but I don't know how. Alot of it is the appearance aspect. How can I look good and dress better when I'm so much bigger and uncomfortable af? At least until I lose the weight. Also my skin is bad now too and I have issues with picking that started once I got all depressed. I've literally thought about checking into a psych ward cause I have moments where I can't breathe and I'm crying so much and panicking and I don't want to kill myself but if I had the option I wouldn't want to live anymore. Please help me out of this rut. ",18Jun2018,2
7,"I had a very stressful time last year working on a project, so I left and it was in someone else's hands. Somehow I got roped back into the project, and the stakes are higher than ever. The tension in the project is palpable, and they couldn't get anyone else, and a lot of people's personal investments could implode in this. My own stake in this is not having a giant year plus long blank on my resume where my internship right out of college should be. I was- WAS, working in a stable 9-5 that could have my debts paid off in a year, even if it wasn't career-relevant work. I really really wish I'd quit that, but I'm not getting a paycheck otherwise. And now I have no fucking time to so much as shave, when I'm currently unmedicated w/ ADHD to boot.

I want to crawl out of my skin, sell all my possessions, change my name, and hop on a bus

I'm getting heart palpitations, nausea, itching, fidgiting so bad I look like I'm having a fit, can barely work for 10 minutes before I have to get up and go for a walk lest my legs burn up, and would scream or cry if I hadn't burned that out years back.

The work isn't hard. My problems are just making me literally incompetent.

I'm taking St Johns Wort (more effective than placebos and some SSRI's in trials), Passionflower, 5-HTP, quit drinking and smoking last year, and getting regular exercise and full nights sleeps. I'm still having a very hard time not just shooting myself from the sheer anxiety every time I just \*THINK\* about working on this.

11,"So I haven't had a psychiatrist in about three months, but I've still had my meds. 

For some reason, I kind of just slowly stop taking them. It's not like I think I'm cured or anything like that. 

But, I have psychotic features. 

So, I'm a little ocd. So I do things specifically. 

I woke up about an hour after falling asleep and noticed a small thing was not in the place I almost always leave it in. 

I started getting a panic attack, and started seeing things. 

I relied on my cat and noticed she wasn't really freaked out. 

So, going off how she was acting, I judged that there wasn't a threat and was able to fall asleep. Only because of my seroquel. 

I've noticed a few other things, but my memory is lacking. 

I know I have been seeing things, they aren't severe. Just from a long time ago, I start to see butterflies sometimes. I've been seeing them a lot. It's a toss up if it's real or not.

But I'm kind of stuck and don't know what to do.

The place I see my therapist at, won't help me at all. 

My therapist is trying to get me in to see a doc, but that might be another three months out. 

My primary doesn't feel comfortable putting me on meds for something that has been there for practically my entire life. 

Not to mention I'm really not sleeping well. 

I have a pinched nerve, so playing games constantly can really kill my wrist. But I love games. So that's not really helping either.

I feel stuck and I hate it. Being stressed makes me snap at my bf and talk less with my family and focus less on what matters and more on the crazy scenarios in my head. I do have problems, in real life these are normal problems but inside my mind they are DISASTERS so I am living always feeling trapped and helpless and pressured even though my situation in reality might not be as bad, and if it was, then I should deal with it not stress about it.
I realise that life moves on and and that no problem is the end of the world and there is always a solution, but I want to whole heartedly believe these things and embrace them and live by them. I am always worrying, over thinking and I don't give myself mental or emotional breaks. I find it so hard to do that. My fears and thoughts and doubts and over thinking keep accumulating and then hit me like an avalanche. I am a stressed out, worried person and I just want to be happy. I want to be stronger facing my problems,  because let's face it, this is real life and problems never end. My emotional fragility is not compatible with real life stresses and I HAVE to change that about myself.
I try things like ASMR (which I love) and watching funny stuff to feel better but they only help temporarily. I need to change my mindset and be emotionally stronger. I don't want my problems to always have such a crushing impact on my mental health and emotions, I need to be stronger, tougher and less sensitive. I want to be emotionally balanced and stable. Any advice? I am open to all sorts of ideas starting with scientifically proven methods and also spiritual practices and mindfulness and so on. Also motivational speeches, quotes, books, mental exercises.... pretty much anything for the sake of mental health betterment.
If you have tried something that worked for you or changed your life please let me know your story!

Please note that I am completely against using food, alcohol, smoking, drugs, or any substance to feel better. So please don't suggest anything of the sort. For me, true change must come from within, I don't want to rely on anything but myself.",18Jun2018,2

\*\*On Personality, Identity, and Selfhood\*\*

\-

I've leaned towards the Buddhist conception of the self, which stems from the ""\[three marks of existence\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three\_marks\_of\_existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence))"", or three characteristics of the natural world.

These are impermanence (\[anicca\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence))), unsatisfactoriness (often misleadingly translated as 'suffering' – \[dukkha\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha))), and non-self (\[anatta\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta))); although really, they're all the same thing, different sides/dimensions of the nature of things. The first and third marks are really the same, ones just talking about nature and ones talking about man. Given that everything's impermanent, there can't be any true self, not one that can hold any enduring integrity.

The second, dukkha, is the unsatisfactoriness - which is all suffering but also all boredom, irritation, disappointment, lacking - and this stems from our perceptual delusions, according to Buddhism. This is a common factoid that goes around about Buddhism u may have heard, that ""life is suffering and suffering comes from desire."" kind of a meaningless way to say it, it's actually that 'existence is unsatisfactory because of our \*delusions regarding the nature of reality\*, those delusions being the lack of recognition of impermanence; in other words, \*our attachment to permanence\*, to independent/inherent existence, and to the separation of objects.

In Buddhism, the whole illusion is referred to as \*\[maya\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya\_(Buddhist\_mental\_factor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(Buddhist_mental_factor)))\* (literally translated as \*pretense\* or \*deceit\*. The illusion of separation, which leads us to believe we are independent beings with intrinsic, objective existence largely independent of our environment. That you are not me, and I am not you. The basis of the perception of scarcity, of believing there's not enough, due to powerful limbic activations that can't be quieted with the much weaker executive, rational mind. If we perceive to excess our reality to be material, that the physical is the ultimate, then we give our fears the advantage, our limbic system the gain over the executive system.

Science shows there is no scarcity - there's no physical shortage of food, of water, or of energy. Our global belief in scarcity, a collective fear at the root of many wars, is the very thing potentiating the experience of scarcity. In this way, we create our lived reality, one based on a collective delusion.

Our perception of scarcity stems from our perception of separation, of inherent existence. And so that is the basic tenet of all of Buddhism - that there is no such thing as inherent existence, wherein you exist, and have some sort of enduring, unchanging existence, i.e. a soul or personality. I still have deeply ingrained perceptions of an objective, separate world, and I most certainly am mostly biased towards that delusion, at an unconscious level of perception. But when I actually consider the issue either academically or in meditation, I’ve done a lot to let go of my belief in things that are based in concepts of inherent existence.

Including the unchanging and eternal soul and the idea of inherent personality or selfhood.

\-

\&gt;\*I see a world in the future in which we understand that all life is related to us and we treat that life with great humility and respect.\* -David Suzuki

\-

I've come to view the self as an ever-changing process, one which will never again be what it once was, and one which does not maintain features that are fundamentally human. This seems natural, that personalities and those things that are said to be “human nature” would only exist within the context of being human. Yet in my life, I’ve latched on to the idea that my human nature is me, and I am my human nature. That this is all there is.

This caused me great pain, to believe that I am only me, a person, a solid. Because if this is true, then I must be finite in description – I must have a distinct and limited nature. And so we call ourselves and others by labels which categorize and (falsely) imply stability. We believe in change and development of course, but only to a limited degree. When we label someone, such as “temperamental” or “patient,” we often imply that this is the base nature of this person, that it exists independent of us. That’s who that is, what kind of person they are, and it has little to do with me.

\-

\&gt;\*What is necessary to change a person is to change his awareness of himself.\* -Abraham Maslow

\-

But this isn’t so. These features were learned and expressed, they developed from a state of many possibilities. Personalities emerge and change fluidly, and are dependent on the act of mirroring others. They are learned. However, when we believe them to be stable and fixed, we have the ability to keep them that way. If we choose to identify as a type of person (and some stay more attached to a distinct identity than others), then we are perpetuating the personality, remaining attached to our identity or the identity of others. Not by any necessity, but by choice. Given the right resources and contexts, no person necessitates any personality from birth. No person is limited in how their personality can change.

\-

\&gt;\*It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.\* -Jiddu Krishnamurti

\-

If we do hold someone else to the identity we create for them, we keep them in a sort of social prison, restricting their ability to be fluid and dynamic in nature. A lot of social anxiety ripples through our culture, and underlies this process. We find a routine, a way of being with a particular person, a role to play – and we get comfortable. We assume that role when we interact with that person, and act with the assumption that they will assume theirs. As a matter of comfort, of avoiding the anxiety of unknowns, we trap each other and ourselves in a narrow version of ourselves, one which is not fully expressed.

\-

For myself, someone with severe social anxiety, this assumption could be difficult to overcome, even if I was aware of it. Because I know, whether I consciously contemplate it or not, that acting in a way which breaks the mold, cracks the long-running assumptions of those I know, is an act of great social force. By that I mean, it is forceful; it elicits a stronger response from others than maintaining the norm, and thus is more risky.

It provoked my anxiety greatly to consider breaking out my social prisons, to do/say something that would surprise others but allow me to express myself. But these experiences extend beyond social anxiety, and hold true for all of us. It is the nature of the brain to learn a way of doing things, to reinforce that way, and to prune away other possibilities. Many of us, however, are pruning away potential selves that are more truthful, more fulfilled.

\-

\&gt;\*The story of the human race is the story of men and women selling themselves short.\* -Abraham Maslow

\-

The stability of personality makes logical sense if one starts from a material worldview emphasizing objectivity and separation. But when one begins to intellectualize only \*after perceiving\* the interdependent nature of reality, a whole different set of logical conclusions are formed (remember that logic is not automatically truthful or valid – it is simply a method of inquiry, a method which can only be as valid as the premise to which it is applied).

I think the self develops and evolves, or regresses, according to natural laws, described as karma. Which, really, is just a transcendent version of newton's third law of motion: all forces bring about equal and opposing reactions. Our actions will send ripples through the fabric of reality, and will have consequences. This is a product of interdependence, of the seamless connection between things. If everything is totally connected, and not separate by any degree, then the laws of karma logically follow. Nothing could act or be acted upon without affecting the rest of the system, even if only slightly. You can touch no part of a spider web without all other parts receiving some of the energy.

\-

\&gt;\*When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world.\* - John Muir

\-

So, within the larger scheme of things, I don't think my self has integrity. I think humans blend and become one another, personality traits act as contagions and repellents. I think most of what we are as a unique individual is a result of developmental mirroring, co-dependent creation of one another. It is true that children who have been socially isolated from birth fail to develop fully functioning brains – the physical architecture which underlies personality and higher concepts of selfhood and identity is not constructed.

The same is true for all complex systems in the body, or species within ecosystems. They arise interdependently, and fundamentally \*\*do not exist\*\* without context. If one species of flower and one species of bee evolve together over some millions of years, so that only that bee can identify and access that flower, and therefore that flower can only survive alongside that particular bee... How are we to say they are not actually one organism? The obvious answer is that we can see the separation. But that’s not the rational answer - separate the microbiome from the flower or the bee, and all organisms involved would die. Because a part of its existence, as it developed interdependently with the environment, was removed.

\-

\&gt;\*I’ll tell you what hermits realize. If you go off into a far, far forest and get very quiet, you’ll come to understand that you’re connected with everything.\* -Alan Watts

\-

According the Buddhism, the bias in science to say that “I am Me, and that I has a microbiome”, is worded in such a way that exhibits our delusion. I do not have a microbiome - there is no ""I"" without the microbiome. I would not exist. Nor would any organism without the immense micro-ecosystems from which they arise and on which they depend. Letting go of the concept of permanence when investigating the natural world has been very fruitful for me. It's not surprising that the microbiome is so important, or that it can direct neural activity. When I begin from the view of interdependent arising, its more surprising that we can be so convinced of our independence.

There's some meditation techniques that focus on a state I’ve heard called ""deep awake,"" wherein you recognize in any situation, that all the beings and things around you are you, and you are them. Neurochemically, it corresponds to changes in how we identify. The brain networks that maintain our higher ego, especially the default mode network, become more diffuse, tear down their walls and interact more with outside brain regions, so you begin to integrate the identity of your environment into your identity.

I’ve said a lot here, but it’s all the same thing: the idea that it's all the same thing. The illusion of separation vs. the perception of nonduality. While we’re conditioned into the former without choice, the latter remains an option for all.

Thanks for reading.

By that I mean, it is forceful; it elicits a stronger response from others than maintaining the norm, and thus is more risky.

It provoked my anxiety greatly to consider breaking out my social prisons, to do/say something that would surprise others but allow me to express myself. But these experiences extend beyond social anxiety, and hold true for all of us. It is the nature of the brain to learn a way of doing things, to reinforce that way, and to prune away other possibilities. Many of us, however, are pruning away potential selves that are more truthful, more fulfilled.  


&gt;*The story of the human race is the story of men and women selling themselves short.* \-Abraham Maslow

The stability of personality makes logical sense if one starts from a material worldview emphasizing objectivity and separation. But when one begins to intellectualize only \*after perceiving\* the interdependent nature of reality, a whole different set of logical conclusions are formed (remember that logic is not automatically truthful or valid – it is simply a method of inquiry, a method which can only be as valid as the premise to which it is applied).

I think the self develops and evolves, or regresses, according to natural laws, described as karma. Which, really, is just a transcendent version of newton's third law of motion: all forces bring about equal and opposing reactions. Our actions will send ripples through the fabric of reality, and will have consequences. This is a product of interdependence, of the seamless connection between things. If everything is totally connected, and not separate by any degree, then the laws of karma logically follow. Nothing could act or be acted upon without affecting the rest of the system, even if only slightly. You can touch no part of a spider web without all other parts receiving some of the energy.

  
*When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world.* \-John Muir

  
So, within the larger scheme of things, I don't think my self has integrity. I think humans blend and become one another, personality traits act as contagions and repellents. I think most of what we are as a unique individual is a result of developmental mirroring, co-dependent creation of one another. It is true that children who have been socially isolated from birth fail to develop fully functioning brains – the physical architecture which underlies personality and higher concepts of selfhood and identity is not constructed.

The same is true for all complex systems in the body, or species within ecosystems. They arise interdependently, and fundamentally \*\*do not exist\*\* without context. If one species of flower and one species of bee evolve together over some millions of years, so that only that bee can identify and access that flower, and therefore that flower can only survive alongside that particular bee... How are we to say they are not actually one organism? The obvious answer is that we can see the separation. But that’s not the rational answer - separate the microbiome from the flower or the bee, and all organisms involved would die. Because a part of its existence, as it developed interdependently with the environment, was removed.  


&gt;*I’ll tell you what hermits realize. If you go off into a far, far forest and get very quiet, you’ll come to understand that you’re connected with everything.* \-Alan Watts

According the Buddhism, the bias in science to say that “I am Me, and that I has a microbiome”, is worded in such a way that exhibits our delusion. I do not have a microbiome - there is no ""I"" without the microbiome. I would not exist. Nor would any organism without the immense micro-ecosystems from which they arise and on which they depend. Letting go of the concept of permanence when investigating the natural world has been very fruitful for me. It's not surprising that the microbiome is so important, or that it can direct neural activity. When I begin from the view of interdependent arising, its more surprising that we can be so convinced of our independence.

There's some meditation techniques that focus on a state I’ve heard called ""deep awake,"" wherein you recognize in any situation, that all the beings and things around you are you, and you are them. Neurochemically, it corresponds to changes in how we identify. The brain networks that maintain our higher ego, especially the default mode network, become more diffuse, tear down their walls and interact more with outside brain regions, so you begin to integrate the identity of your environment into your identity.

I’ve said a lot here, but it’s all the same thing: the idea that it's all the same thing. The illusion of separation vs. the perception of nonduality. While we’re conditioned into the former without choice, the latter remains an option for all.Thanks for reading.

16,"Hey. I've always been having difficulties coming to terms with my body. I would look in the mirror and see someone who I am not satisfied with. I am not fat but my proportions make me feel like I am (i.e fat upper arms, ""man"" hands, some abdominal fat - the rest of my body is pretty skinny). The complex I've been having with myself ruined my lifestyle, giving me no chance of properly enjoying myself with others without having to think of how others think of me or how I look like and ruining my social life as a result. Some 7 months ago I tried to change that. I started dieting. I downloaded this app called myfitnesspal and recorded my daily caloric intake, restricting myself to about 800-1000 calories per day. A couple months later I have lost 16 pounds, officially becoming underweight. My period has stopped and hasn't come back since. My doctor warned me of potential eating disorders if I continue following the same path, so I began eating more and returned to a healthy weight by gaining back 10 pounds. But a couple months and a gynecologist appointment later I am told that the reason my period has been discontinuing since my first diet fiasco was that I still have a caloric deficiency (and a thyroid problem which I had since I was 7, but I've been taking adequate supplements to counteract that). Problem is I would have changed my eating behavior if only the way I felt about my body changed as well. Calorie counting has not only become an addiction but the relationship I've been having with my body hasn't changed in any way.

Also if this will clarify any better I am a teenage female currently weighing 108 pounds and 5'3 (19.1 BMI) - currently maintaining the weight.

TL;DR: My period has stopped ever since I've started dieting 7 months ago, but I hate my body and am addicted to counting my calories. I am NOT anorexic, but afraid that I have an eating/body image disorder and I'm harming my overall health and body image. What do I do?",18Jun2018,1

19,"It’s so real and I’m such living proof but I am just starting to grasp the realness of the facts. 
The first time I remember being suicidal was 7 or 8 when I would come home from school and just want to die. I was bullied pretty bad my whole childhood because of a skin disease that was impossible to hide. Kids are mean even if they didn’t realize the lasting impact it would have on me. I was also extremely ADHD (I still am) and had underlying learning disabilities (nothing severe) but I wasn’t as fast as a learner and didn’t grasp concepts the way other kids did. 
I struggled with a lot of self harm in various forms starting at age 9 and I always had the “hope” (if you would call it that) and confidence I would find a way to die before being an adult that wouldn’t hurt my family. 
I really thought this way till I was 17 or 18 maybe even 19 . when I didn’t have those feelings anymore I found myself struggling to catch up with everyone else my age because I didn’t hit the milestones I was supposed too. I also put myself in a lot of dangerous situations that I didn’t care about. As well as putting myself into debt with cell phone plans and credit cards.
I didn’t get my license till I was 20. I didn’t give a fuck in school so I struggled to graduate on time which threw college out the window for me. I didn’t have my first job till I was 18. I had no sense of saving money or anything related to being financially stable. (My parents didn’t give me money either I just always  found a way somehow) I went through friends like it was my day job because I didn’t care about anyone. 
I did and said  a lot of hurtful things to my family along the way as well, but mostly my mom. Even though she forgives me because she knows I was “sick” I still feel crazy guilt over it and probably will the rest of my life. 
I’m 23 now and I am finally on somewhat of the right track and moving forward with my life but it makes me super sad to see almost everyone my age like 3 or 4 years ahead of me in life and I’m just busting my ass to be an actual adult despite the fact that I self sabotaged my way into all this.

26,"I had a pretty rough childhood. And although this is not the point of this post, I think it's relevant to mention that I suffered child abuse and neglect, so I feel like a lot of my childhood was wasted or lost. 

Because of this, I think things just hit me harder now that I'm not a kid. As I grew up and had more mature experiences, I almost longed for the childhood innocence that can make the world feel wondrous. 

Me and my friends all had our own problems. Legal issues, abusive relationships, drug problems, hangovers, unemployment, etc. I saw these people transform from the wide-eyed little kids I'd go on adventures with around the neighbourhood and beyond, into messed up adults that were struggling to get by. 

From an innocent kid playing with action figures with big plans for the future, to someone suicidal, desperately hanging onto anything that will help them escape. 

I think this on its own could make anyone a little bit down, and feel a longing to go back in time, but I don't even have any real ""innocent"" memories to fall back on. It just makes me regret the way I grew up even more. 

I keep telling myself I wouldn't be who I am today if I hadn't had those experiences, but still. I wish there was a way I could have been me, without having to grieve experiences that I feel l missed out on. 

The glimpses I had of a more ""normal"" childhood through going over to my friend's houses, are what make me wish I could have had that more often. I'm grateful for every memory though. 

Growing up sucks, sometimes. When you're young, it seems you can't wait to be an adult. You don't realize all the small things that make childhood awesome. Imagination. Running around the neighbourhood with friends, biking around, getting slushies with your best friend, poking fun at each other.  Feeling like it's just you and them together on a journey, fending off the authoritative adults.

I don't know, I'm just sort of ranting. I needed to get it off my chest. It's something I've been thinking about for a while. 

There are some positive parts, though too. I still have that child-like sense of curiosity, and that inner call to adventure. I think it's because I was never fully able to express that, it's come through now, and become a pretty big part of me. 

All in all, it's a sort of sad nostalgia, combined with a longing for made-up parts of a childhood lost.

29,"All my life I have kept myself fairly busy - whether it be school, work, or hanging out with friends (or some other arbitrary activity) I have never had much time to solely myself and my thoughts.

However when I manage to be rid of all outside intervention, leaving a blank slate for my mind to wander devoid of distraction I often hear what can only be described as thoughts that are not my own. These thoughts, as that is the closest way I am able to describe them, are voices. The voice may tell me horrible and dark things about myself (these specific voices may appear out of nowhere during the day and disrupt me mentally) or they may tell me kind things.

The voice is often kind at night, and cruel during the day. The evil voice almost pretends to be me, or from my perspective, ridiculing and insulting those around me. I fear that I may accidentally say what the voice tells me and feel incredibly worried and uncomfortable in these situations. The kind voice, however, reassures me and helps me when I am down.

This night I was feeling extremely depressed and down, but the voice came to me and reassured me. It made me happy and brought a tear to my eye at the prospect of what it had to tell me (and for the sake of the voice, if it is what it says it is, I shall leave specifics anonymous). I don't often get the voice, and it's never for too long, but it is extremely noticeable and intelligent. I am able to converse with it mentally easily.

My grandmother on one side of the family is mentally ill, along with her daughter (my aunt). On the other side of my family my great grandmother had diagnosed schizohprenia.

30,"I play this video game called Overwatch on a certain game mode in which you play as a female character. Whenever you die, your character makes a death sound which sounds like a moan and highly sexual. I've been playing video games for years; however, only during these last few months have I noticed that I gain a sense of anger after having heard the death noise (moan).

This is only scratching the surface though. I've noticed that I gain a large amount of distress when I see a female anywhere, besides a family member. When I see a textbook that has a female on it, I feel sad. I feel bad when seeing a video that has a female in it. I saw an attractive female the other day in class when I turned around to see who is entering the class and I ducked my face because it made me feel bad.

Basically, how do I get rid of this anxiety? Speaking with them is out of the question. Is there a different way to stop this?

34,"About a year ago, an alarmed friend of my [23F] brother’s [21M] approached me to go talk to my brother, because my brother had come to him with concerns and he was really worried about my brother. I then went to go talk to my brother and got quite worried.

Apparently when my brother was 14, he had found his best friend when she had attempted suicide. [I believe she attempted to hang herself, but I am not 100% certain]. She failed in het attempt, probably because my brother found her, and is still alive as far as I know, now 7 years later. He never told me, either one of my parents, or anyone probably, because he didn’t feel comfortable. When he was that age, he was constantly in conflict with my parents. As for me, with us being so close in age, him and I were also constantly fighting, as teen siblings do. Assuming as he was a teen boy, he had no idea how to deal with this &amp; kept it to himself all that time. 

The relationship between my brother and my mom in particular has always been problematic, my dad and my brother do get along, except that my dad is often the sort of referee between my mom and brother. This is relevant for the story later on.

Last year, about half a year after my brother moved out of our parents’ house. That’s when he apparently started getting nightmares in which he relived finding his friend’s suicide attempt and he described it as being pretty deregulating in his life. Namely, he would wake up in the middle of the night very shaken up, and in general sleep very bad. In his own words, the lack of sleep also led him to develop a temper. He described an instance where he violently shoved someone very hard one time and he got startled by his own violent reaction &amp; lack of (enough) control.
Presumably he only started getting them when he moved out, because of his strained relationship with our parents and hence never processed it.

We had a really good talk when he told me all of this, and have had a couple since, and I am really really happy that he confides in me with this now &amp; that he trusts me, but that is also where I find myself in new territory/ am just clueless on how to “play” my part in all of this. He asked me for help and I tried to provide it, the best way I knew how. He and I agreed that it would be best for him to go see a therapist, because although he didn’t have the nightmares that frequently anymore, it was still something that obviously bothered him and I frankly had no idea how he could process this “correctly”. The system where we live (Netherlands) is that you have to get referred to a psychologist by your GP, so my brother would have to make an appointment there first, before he could get his referral. He put it off for months, despite gentle reminders from me. I eventually (after 4 months) made the GP appointment for him, which he wasn’t too happy about initially, but in the end he was very happy I did. (I’m aware this was overstepping responsibility, but I felt very responsible &amp; worried and that he wasn’t receiving the care he should be. Also that he was leaning no me for guidance, without me having the proper knowledge/ experience to help him deal with it. I also felt if I left it to him, he’d never do it.) After my little interference he handled the whole “finding a therapist” process by himself and succeeded 

Around this time someone also came up to him suggesting he might have ADHD, when I had just been diagnosed with ADHD. When he then finally got seen by a therapist (another 3 months later), he got diagnosed with ADHD as well, and now is getting treated for that. He isn’t mentioning the nightmares whatsoever, and it seems like he doesn’t believe he should get therapy or anything for it anymore. In fact I asked him if he ever mentioned it to his therapist, but he never has, and told me he doesn’t have the nightmares anymore so he’s fine

Basically my question is what should &amp; can I do? Is my brother right in saying he doesn’t need to talk to anyone about the nightmares anymore? Has he processed it enough by telling his friend &amp; myself about them? Is he avoiding it? Should I do something? Should I encourage him to still seek help for it? 
I want to support him, but I don’t want to overstep.  (I am aware I am inclined to overstep, as I want to protect him from it potentially gettin worse &amp; all that. I’m a pretty protective big sister you could say, haha)

37,"TL;DR at bottom 

I have been friends online with a guy for probably 10 years now since I was 15. We will call him Steve. Steve has spine issues and has been physically disabled all his life. In addition, Steve's mother is nuts and abused him for most of his life until his dad finally left her and moved Steve and his brother out of the house.  Prior to this, Steve was definitely suicidal, but since then I've never known him to be. 
Since Steve is disabled, he doesn't get out much. His brother is an arrogant POS who seems to think that Steve is wasting his potential and his father works all the time. These past few years, Steve's father has had major health issues that spur what Steve calls ""attacks."" I'm not sure what all those entail but it does involve throwing up and they have to get his father to a hospital ASAP. 

On Saturday, Steve went to a comic con. He was really looking forward to it and meeting one of his favorite celebrities. But in the middle of the Con, his father started having an attack and they had to go to the hospital. Steve ended up taking the public transit home and messaged me saying that he just wanted to die. He hadn't been out in months and had been really looking forward to comic con. Steve's life only seems to be doing his brother's homework, waiting on his nurses who come every day, and being online. He never gets out and his brother is too self important to take him anywhere while his father is either sick or working. 

I told Steve to call the suicide hotline. He said that he had twice already but that they only had cliches to say and weren't helpful. I started talking about solutions, all of which he shot down for one reason or another. I asked more questions about how long this has been going on for and why. I also told him that he shouldn't give up, that he's loved, and that we all need him. I think he mostly sticks around for his father, who needs him. (His brother literally refused to pick his father up from the hospital that night because he is tired of his father's chronic illness). 

I tried to talk to Steve as best I could but it's incredibly difficult for me. My fiance and childhood friend took his own life at the beginning of 2016.  I have been approached by 2 friends who have talked to be about suicide. They DO know about my fiance but I never bring it up during these discussions. It's hard to hear to say the least. I also have the urge to tell them that they shouldn't try to talk to me. Clearly I cannot prevent suicide. I can't tell them any magic words that will make it better. I'm always at a loss when I'm approached with these things and I try to offer up solutions to help with ongoing problems that might be causing stress in their lives, but I doubt that does anything.  I knew my fiance best and he knew me best, and I still couldn't do anything for him. It's emotionally taxing to say the least to hear people say these things to me.


TL;DR Online friend is disabled and never gets out of the house. He was feeling suicidal. I lost someone to suicide 2 years ago and it's hard to have these discussions. Is there any way that I can help proactively help while also taking care of myself? ",18Jun2018,10

I feel like I have lost myself. My personality. I let him get way too close to me, way too important. I allowed him to have so much influence on me, but it happened so fast and I was desperate and weak enough to let him become my light, my mentor, on some days my reason to live for. 

This is your classic ""weak unstable girl fell for the narcissist"" kind of story and the more I read about that dynamic the more I came to terms with the fact that he probably moved on by now and never really cared anyway, while I am suffering every single day.

And I start to resent myself for it. For my weakness. For me still hurting after nearly a month. For randomly crying during the day, for being unable to let go of the thoughts and for dwelling in the past. Daydreaming about ""but what if..."". For wasting time! While I understand that this grieving part is ""natural"" and will pass there is this other aspect which has me more worried.

I feel like I lost my personality. I have no desire to be around people anymore. I have no will / strength to share any of ""me"" with others. It's not only the fear of getting hurt again but it's the feeling that my confidence / self-worth (which was as you might have guessed lacking to begin with) is gone completely. I stopped hanging out with my virtual friends (where I felt most comfortable before) simply because the thought alone is terrifying. I feel like an empty shell and the worst part is that I am so convinced that there is no way back to before, that this is now my life.

Will it pass? I read so much during the last weeks but nothing seems to help for more than some hours. 

Why can I not stop missing him :(",18Jun2018,2

42,"I'm 24 and I'm from sweden, but that really doesn't matter. On to the issue. 

I've thought allot about this. I've got like well over 20 failed romantic relationships in my baggage, some of them more destructive than others. I'm currently a couple of months away from my last breakup, which was tougher on me than usual because we had everything together, so I had to leave the apartment and two cats behind. 

We had no intimate contact what so ever for like a year before the breakup, for reasons too complex to get in to, and since the breakup, even before I moved out, I started having this gnawing, annoying feeling of wanting to be physically close with someone. 

Not like I wanted to get into a new relationship. That would obviously be a bad idea. And not like I would just go out and have sex with anyone. But no matter how socially close I get to people, I can't shake this feeling of being alone and unwanted. 

The other night, a friend was over. I've had thoughts about her before, she looks good and the's got the perfect 3 personality traits on fleek, being kind, confident, and intelligent. In some context, I was gonna rub off some mascara lumps from her cheek, and as my thumb touched her skin, it was like being struck by lightning. 

My heart skipped a few beats, I lost my breath, I got dizzy, and most intense of all: I felt physically hungry. Weird, right?

So this kind of got me into this topic. I'm not some fucking incel or whatever, I'm not saying I have a right to get laid, and I have a full and deep respect for the integrity of other people. I wouldn't force or nag someone into sex, I wouldn't take advantage of someone drunk or emotionally unstable. That's not what this question is about. 

But do you think intimate contact, or straight up sexual contact, is a need, on the level of the need for rest, or stress relief, or the general need to feel like you're using your time effectively?

*I realize there isn't going to be a straight up ""Yes or no"" answer to this question, and it's got a high volume of individuality. I'm also not saying I'm super horny or starved for sex, that's not it.*

But I am interested in hearing your thoughts, if you think there's some truth to my theory, if you have any ideas what you think I or anyone else could do with it, so on so forth. 

Otherwise, you folks have a nice day. ",18Jun2018,3
43,"Hi. I am a 26F from Texas. I apologize if this little rant is not appropriate for this subreddit but I need to sound off for a moment,
     First off, depression and anxiety is just as pleasant as getting hit by a bus. In fact, most days I feel like I get hit by a bus of just pure mental crap. 
     Second, there is this strange stigma in the US (or perhaps just TX) that if you struggle with you're mind you are then some sort of weirdo delinquent or you're ""disturbed"". I have depression and anxiety. You know what I also have? A full time job, night classes for a master's degree, a car payment, a house payment and no criminal record. I struggle with my mind but I can still use it.
     Finally, if you try to get help in this country be prepared for difficulty. Most psychiatrists don't accept insurance where I'm from, they sure as heck do not take government funded programs. If you want care you need money and lots of it. This is so ludicrous when we know from research how prevalent mental health problems can be across ALL populations INCLUDING low income areas. 
     We see horrible things on the news about people who did not get help and later went on to do something ""crazy"". I would like to argue that open communication, education, REAL access to medical care and a breakdown of negative stigmas could go a long way for EVERYONE.

45,"I just recently turned 18 and I've finally decided to get help. When I was around 14 my father started getting sick, I slowly watched him wither away mentally and physically to the point where he didn't even recognize me most of the time. Up until that point I was pretty normal but I started to lose interest in hobbies and friends. I pretty much lost passion for everything I used to be. Then Christmas day 2014 my father was admitted into the hospital where he later died on January 11th. I ended up dropping out of school and refused any help my mother or doctor offered which I fucking hate myself for now. I completely isolated myself, spending all day every day playing video games. I completely lost the confidence and ambitions I had to do anything in life. I have crippling social anxiety to the point where I get nauseous just by talking to a cashier. I feel like my mind goes blank anytime I talk to an old friend or try to make new ones. I've even considered the possibility that I could have ASD but the only sign I have is the lack of social skills which could just be caused by SA. I was invited to a party for one of my old friends who was moving out of state for college. The whole night I said less than 15 words. My mind just went blank and I didn't know what to do, I felt so out of place. Everyone's lives were moving forward and I was just A sad sack of shit who's been stuck in the same place for years. After being mentally scarred from that party I finally got the balls to give it another go. I ended up talking to one of the chicks I used to go to school with, we were going to see a movie but she ended up having to go to dinner with family and she invited me to go with. The exact same situation happened again, my mind went blank and didn't really talk to anyone, I just sat there.

But now, the morning after has left me rehashing and I can’t seem to stop. Agonizing over every stuttered word or if I could be misconstrued and people have the wrong idea of the type of person I am. I keep thinking everyone must think I’m so fucking weird and I’m so pathetic because I’m unemployed and mooching off my husband. Then it just erupts into personal shit that has nothing to do with having fun at a completely innocent party. 

This happens every time I meet with anyone other than those in my family.

47,"So I had an awful experience over the weekend at a party but I am happy because I think I identified some of my PTSD triggers.  I think my biggest trigger is feeling like I have no control and trapped. 

Over the weekend I was with my boyfriends family. We drove to Wisconsin with his mom and sister and it was a nightmare. His mom screamed and yelled because she was stressed and when we got to the party it was in a small one room building with white peeling paint in the middle of nowhere. My boyfriend neglected to tell me that not everyone there was his family. So I tried to introduce myself and people were like ""who is she?""

Anyways the entire time we had to do what his mother wanted and it was a nightmare because I was stuck usually in one spot trying to focus on a conversation I had no interest in and no context for. My brain melted. I have ADHD so that was really hard too. 

On the ride back there was the biggest family blow up over movie seats. I don't know all the details because I tried to tune a lot of it out. 

So I talked to my boyfriend about it and he has been very understanding. We agreed that we will never go up with the family and we will be an independent unit.

Despite my anxiety and just feeling awful today I am so happy I know why and how we can fix it. Has this happened to anyone else where you have a terrible experience but in the end you're happy because you know why you reacted so strongly to something that normally isn't a big deal?",18Jun2018,2

53,"I have always had a bad relationship with my family. I’ve always been oppressed and laughed at just because of who I am: my family is very superficial, they are so conditioned by society, obsessed with norms, with that bullshit idea of “normality”.
My mother, for example, doesn’t get the concept of subjectivity: she thinks there are things it’s a fact that are good, beautiful and things it’s a fact that are ugly; anyone who thinks differently is a weirdo and has to be laughed at.
I have always repressed myself, then.
That’s one of the reasons why I hadn’t understood to be transexual earlier: I had to try to conform, unless I wanted to be made fun of.
However, I have never bonded with them because they were often abusive, and still are. They react aggressively and keep yelling at me. Also insulting me. Once I was told someone like me can only end up being a prostitute or a drug addicted.
I can’t be happy around these people, I can’t.
I don’t know what to do; I’m 16 and I’ll have to rely on them financially still for years. I don’t want to fuck things up because I can’t trust them and I’m afraid they could decide to get rid of me and, this way, I won’t be able to enroll med school in the future...
Right now, they know I selfharm. I stoped cutting, but when I get the urge, now I bite myself or hit myself someway.
As fast as she discovered that, my grandmother (who lives with me, upstairs) changed suddenly, so suddenly I don’t know wtf has happened. Maybe the demon who lived inside her decided to leave lol
However, my mother still victimizes herself for my problems, because I seem to be very inconvenient to her. I know she is not very mature, quite self-centered and struggles managing her emotions, that’s why she’s often abusive; but I can’t live like this.
I came out to her, I told her I’m trans and she is very annoyed by it. Obviously she doesn’t understand at all, but I can accept this. I know she struggles with empathy.
I’m seeing a gender psychologist soon, I’m looking forward to that. I hope I won’t be too depressed to be able to talk properly.
I feel so alone. I often fantasize about having true friends and being appreciated for who I am. I am very happy with those imaginary friends, but then I come back to reality and I realize how lonely I am.
I am afraid the whole of this will trigger depression again. I have already been suicidal and heavily depressed for months, but now I’m not there anymore. I still feel awfully, but I can tell it’s not depression anymore.
However I’ve never been diagnosed, but... It’s easier to talk about it this way, let’s say...
My mother’s approach towards my transexuality makes me feel humiliated about it and I question heavily. She makes things even harder because she thinks it’s a bullshit, a fixation, and I’m leaded to think it truly is. I’ve always struggled validating my own thoughts and feelings because my family has always made fun of them.
I am miserable... I no longer know why I’m crying.
I no longer know what’s dysphoria and what’s depression. I feel like I don’t have the right to be what I feel to be, what I want to be and, actually, what I already am.

When I inquired about someone taking over his practice he shook his head and said that he didn't think there would be anyone to take the practice as-is. He encourage me, as he has every other patient, to look for alternate practices. 

I've done a cursory search in my local area, and there are only 2 practices within reasonable traveling distance, and neither are taking new patients, mostly because the doctors are also elderly and planning to retire. 

There are clinics in hospitals, but they are further away, and right now I don't know if any are in the insurance network that I have or would be able to submit bills so that I can be reimbursed for out of pocket costs for visits. 

I've heard others talk about this same problem, that they cannot find a doctor that they a) can work well with b) will take whatever insurance they have (or be willing to submit bills for patient's reimbursement) and c) is within reasonable traveling distance for them.

57,"So I’m 22, suffered from severe depression with anxiety for about 7 years. All throughout my life I’ve been susceptible to picking up bad habits of things that was cause me some form of pain/discomfort. 
An example, biting my nails. Something I used to do obsessively to the point my fingernails have permanent damage and will never be the same again.

Something I’m experiencing at the minute, I have chapped lips. I know you shouldn’t lick your lips etc but because I know I shouldn’t I can’t help it. 

A more severe one, since about 2006 I found there was a way that if I move my jaw to one side specifically, my teeth jab into my gums causing pain. This is something that I couldn’t stop doing throughout my childhood and still struggle not to nowadays. 
There was one time I had to have a filling at the dentist, so my mouth was numbed. My dentist saw the damage and saw which teeth were causing it, he thought it was just the way they naturally rubbed against the gums and offered to pull them out, although it would be extremely uncomfortable. After the appointment I was walking home with my mouth completely numb, I continued jabbing my teeth into my gums and only realised how bad it was when I got home and my mum pointed out there was blood on my tongue.

58,"I've been medicated for about 10 years now. Low dose of Zoloft.

I can't argue that it has helped me be a functional member of society, and likely a better friend/family member. Pre-meds, I was a ball of mess. I would pretty much work, obsess, cry, sleep, repeat. Nowadays, I only cry when life truly gets overwhelming, and I am mildly effective at everyday life.

But I almost think I may have hit a plateau. I am in therapy (highly recommend), but how do I word this.... I almost feel like it isn't as effective as it could be if I were not medicated, because my feelings are blunted. So the habits and thoughts I want to change, I don't feel as motivated to change, because they don't feel as severe as they probably should. Does that make any sense? It's almost as if the natural sense of urgency one gets to signal ""hey, stop procrastinating!"" or ""hey that's rude to say"" is missing because I'm on meds. So it almost makes those awful habits more permanent.

I also really miss ""highs."" I understand that I needed to be leveled out to be a more predictable and effective human, but I miss the little pleasures I used to love like music and art. Some of that flood of appreciation is diminished when medicated.

Okay, I've got a bit to unpack here.

Context; Lesbian, 22, never had sex, never been abused in any form. I'm not getting aroused in any of these examples but my brain still thinks about sex anyway. (Unless thinking about sex counts as arousal even without any of the physical stuff?) 

So, for instance, if I'm feeling a surge of innocuous affection towards, say, my mother or stepfather, I start imagining sex (between fictional characters if it matters). 

If I'm looking at certain body parts, the same thoughts get triggered, although this happens plenty often with strangers, too. I feel like this hasn't been happening lately, but I do remember it happening.

My older sister is very attractive but I used to feel like I was too aware of that fact and it made me uncomfortable.

There's this one character on TV we always swore looked just like my aunt. Lately I've been rewatching the series and was thinking how  attractive this character was, and then thought, ""Wait, no, that's weird, isn't it?""

I don't know if it's a result of the sandbox, intrusive nature of brains mixed in with my being a pervert or I'm subconsciously incestuous or something. I do think about sex a lot (although almost exclusively between fictional characters). I know that people find facial features familiar to them as attractive, that's why genetic sexual attraction happens, so is this just some weird extension of that?

Regardless, it's weird and I don't like it and was wondering if there was a way I could train myself to stop having these strange thoughts.",18Jun2018,2
67,"This post it going to be a long, rant-like explanation of my current mental health.

I was raised by my grandparents and my mom and dad were young when they had me. They tried to parent me, but just smothered me instead. I resisted and always chose to stay with my grandparents, even though my grandma had significant issues of her own. As a child, I witnessed her hallucinate a lot - hear and speak to voices. She was emotionally and verbally abusive towards me. Her anger was clearly a problem, and she would act on it a lot - call me names as a child, tell me that my fathers side of my family didn’t care about me, etc. It took me many years to realize that the root of my anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem likely stems from these issues in my childhood. 

So I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a child. In high school, it got so bad that I begged my parents to go to a different school because I felt like I was being ostracized at my og high school when I started having panic attacks.

I worked on my mental health. Started taking vitamins. Went running. Made new friends. It seemed like things got a bit better, but depression has always seemed to hover over me, and my anxiety fluctuates. 

Fast forward a few years — (2014-15)
I met my current bf of four years. Our relationship has had many ups and downs, but we try to work things out in the end. 
My parents split. The way they handled it was incredibly immature. They both tried to use me as ammunition to attack the other, and would try to talk shit to me about my other parent. I was already hurting because of their split, and it made it harder for me.
Eventually I started seeing my father less and less. I didn’t know why, and thought maybe his own mental health was spiraling him into isolation. Then I found out the truth —
He basically went back to an old gf (one that he was with during one of he and my moms splits when they were in their early 20s). This lady has her own kids, and he basically started to play the role of their father. I knew nothing about this. He did things like get engaged to this woman, buy her a car, etc. and I found out thru IG. When he and my mother split, he acted like he was going to take on the father role for me which he never really had. Now we barely talk. A couple years ago, he flaked on me during the holidays and I left his gifts at his house but never saw him. He never gave me anything in return - not even a card. It’s not the monetary value of an item I care about, it just hurts that I tried to see and build a better relationship with him and he ultimately chose to run away and raise another woman’s children and take care of her since she’s a SAHM. 
My mom brings my father up from time to time, and I feel like her intentions are only for her benefit. She clearly is not over their split, and tries to get me to feed into her gossip and shit talking. It takes everything in me to not go off when she does this.
In addition to this, I had a back injury a couple of years ago and gained a lot of weight (I’d say about 20-25lbs). I was never able to receive proper treatment for it because I was only working part time and going to school full time, so no insurance. I also have a hormone imbalance which I believe contributes to my issues with weight, anxiety, and depression. I wish I had the resources to go to a doctor, but I just graduated with a BA and am broke as hell. Last year my dad was supposed to put me on his health insurance, only for me to realize this year when I went to urgent care bc I was very ill that he never did. His excuse was that the process was very complicated and he “must’ve not filed the paperwork correctly”. 
I used to empathize with my dad and really cared for him. Now I am just hurt and angry.
I’m hurt that he treats me like I’m disposable. I’m frustrated that I feel like a low-life because of this weight gain, and my depression and anxiety make it hard for me to even get out of bed in the morning. 
And I’m supposed to look for a full time job to replace my current part time job, but I can’t hardly bring myself to look. I’m afraid of rejection, and I think my self-esteem is at an all time low. My current job is temporary and over in August, so I have a time limit as to when I can find a full time job.

I just feel so overwhelmed and it feels like I can’t take it anymore. There’s more to this and plenty of other details, but I guess I’ll just leave it at this for now. I apologize for any discrepancies, typos, or confusion.
Any advice or tips on picking myself up from this low are appreciated.

TL;DR My anxiety and depression are at a high; I can’t find the motivation to look for a job and have gained weight in the past cpl years which has taken a toll on my self-esteem. Don’t know how to pick myself up.

They weighed me and I had lost a bit of weight, the nurse congratulated me. What she doesn’t know is that because of my anxiety and depression along with other issues, I’ve relapsed and have stopped eating most days. I also have been purging due to being anxious.

Every other emotion, both good and bad it takes a lot of effort to provoke it from me. I've never felt sad when people die, I've never felt excited at large events, I've never felt giddy in a relationship. I was even sexually assaulted when I was 17 and it had literally 0 effect on me. I got home, ate cereal, showered and went by my normal life. Occasionally I can short circut and experience rage or extreme sadness  the amount of time I have spent crying or angry is literally less than 2% of my life. I just always feel emotionally dead.

I'm looking to collect stories for an upcoming book on taboo topics that *so* many of us deal with on a day-to-day basis, but aren't talked about nearly enough. I'm talking about mental health, substance abuse &amp; addiction, and survival. 

I need raw stories from real people who either live with mental illness, have experienced addiction, or survived tramatic situations. My goal is that this reaches the people who think they are alone. The door to these conversations needs to be opened, and we need to talk about it without feeling judged. 

I have specific topics I'm interested in and would like to feature short 'stories' from real people...think, Chicken Soup For The Soul, or Post Secret. The topics are as follows:

Mental Illness  
Anxiety (which goes hand in hand with mental illness...but I know this is a very widespread issue for youth at the moment)  
Grief and Loss  
Substance Abuse and Addiction   
Trauma survival   


My email inbox is always open for anyone who needs to talk, or prefer to share their story that way. [TheMentalHealthBook@gmail.com](mailto:TheMentalHealthBook@gmail.com) \- but the stories are okay to be shared over this forum, of course. If possible, a name and age included in the story would be great, but not required.

80,"Hi. I know the title sounds like a scam, but it's not.

Basically, since there is no real way of checking to see if you have a mental illness, doctors usually rely on your compliance with medication to determine whether you are ""mentally ill"" or not.

If you are completely compliant with the doctors, meaning that you give them no problem with taking medication, they will give you placebos instead as they see no reason to give you real medication if you give full compliance.

I tried this, and it worked.

They basically think it's the same as a diabetic who has an insulin deficiency and they take insulin to correct it, depression and anxiety is far more complex than that. I was actually explaining this to a youtuber who makes a lot of videos about his mental health that its impossible to say your depression is being caused by serotonin deficiency, as there is no concrete evidence to support this, but yet he still says this in all his videos (I suffer with depression because my brain does not produce enough of the feel good chemical serotonin, so I have to take my medication to correct this) That is what he always says.

83,"I had a best friend for years and I truly cared so much for her. One day we had a fight. It was our first fight in years, but she ended friendship. It was my mistake but I was genuinely sorry. I also have history of depression and suffer from mental illnesses too.

I got so sick, and couldn't bear her decision. I begged her for help. I have had every bad thing since then, and I still think about 1.5 years later. I had road acciedent, pick-pocketed, lost job, used to have panic attacks everyday, locked myself in home for so months and didn't even used to leave home, for months I was scared to leave home, I also got major depression, borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, I still have so many nights I feel like I am going total crazy, and I should just kill myself.

I couldn't bear her decision because it was genuine mistake and I respected her so much in my heart. I was not a shitty person she assumed I am. I just want to be understood and since it was genuine mistake, I couldn't bear her decision.

Anyway nobody helped me. Therapists never took me seriously either. To add to insult, she have assumed I am a crazy lover when I am so much sick and desperate in need of help. I am not crazy lover of course. It's mental illness make me look like, and so called good friend should know this.

When I talk about this to other peoples, they say nobody is responsible for other person. I know. But I never understand how good people can be like this. If you are shitty person, I don't care what you do. But she was such a nice and caring person. I just don't know someone can be so cold towards other person health and life. 

I used to think people care about each-other, at least their life and death. I always cared for her and we were very good friends, but still it won't matter if I am dead to her.

I just don't understand. How good people can become like this. I am trying to move-on from this. But i wonder what if my wife do the same to me one day.

85,"Hey, this is quite a long one, but I'd be very grateful if you read it all :) 

So I'm a dancer and my ultimate goal is to be the world champion in my main style of dance. I work hard every day  to reach my goals and that work has led me to win the national champion title a few months back, but although I have been given every opportunity to succeed and it would be extremely selfish to still complain with what I have, I have been feeling really down lately. 

See, I have never been into drinking or partying and would always rather stay in the gym working to perfect my routines. My ""friends"" would call me to go out and get waisted and I would never want to do it and over time a lot of people started calling me weird or ask ""what's wrong with you?"" when I told them I don't like drinking and so after some time I lost all of my friends. We would have so much fun chatting online but after some time they would just start ignoring me and be extremely rude when I helped them with every single problem they
had. At the time I was still extremely social and outgoing so losing those friends wasn't such a big deal because I thought ""they don't matter, I have other friends"" After some time, I was still training hard, but I dedicated every free moment I had to my friends and we would chat online til 5 A.M. Despite all that, I lost almost every single friend and had one left. We had a connection that I hadn't felt with everyone else. We would talk until morning and I could tell them everything. We spent every single day together and would take trips across the country every month. I didn't dance for the entire summer just so I could be with them. It was all going great but after 2 years I get a phone call. She calls me and admits that she has pretty much despised me for years and would only fake that she liked me so I would solve her personal issues for her and she was bored and had nothing better to do with her time than to use me. I was absolutely mortifed and cried for days. Ever since that I am completely unable to trust anyone because every time I start to trust someone I think if the person I thought was my soulmate secretly hated me for years after everything I did for her, how can I possibly trust anyone else? I haven't been able to find a real friend ever since and every person I start talking to finds a better friend quite fast. 

What is wrong with me? Am I just meant to be alone forever and am I just not worthy of any love? I love dance more than anything and all my teachers have told me I was born to perform but is it worth it if I give dance so much of time I don't have enough left to find friends and find love? Should I be a ""normal teenager"" and give up my dance dreams? 

Needless to say, I am extremely confused. I love dancing and performing with all my heart but I also know what it feels like to have someone love you unconditionally and I've started to think I will never find love again if I don't dedicate my time searching for it. Does it help me in any way later in life to be a ""normal teenager"" right now or should I still never give up on my dream when I know it's possible if I work hard and smart at it? 

I would be extremely thankful if anyone has any advice to bring some clearance into what I want from life, because right now I feel extremely lonely and all I have is dance.",18Jun2018,1
86,"*Society tames the wolf into a dog. And man is the most domesticated animal of all.”  -Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Friedrich Nietzsche*

The following ideas are a piece of ancient Toltec (a long-gone society from Mexico) wisdom, brought to us by the author Don Miguel Ruiz. As a Toltec nagual (a healer), he wrote The Four Agreements, which you could read in just a few hours. It’s one of those books that has the ability to bring you a rush of peace as you turn every page.

There are hundreds of five-star Amazon reviews for this book, and a few well-written negative reviews that say, “This is all just common sense.” Well, our world might need a little more common sense right now. We strongly encourage you to pick up a copy of this book, because you’ll end up lending it out to your friends and family as soon as you finish it.

**WHY WE HAVE AN INNER CRITIC**

Day one, you are born. Nice job, you nailed it. But you are now helpless, and so begins the process of domestication. For the next six to eight years, you are like a sponge. You are using your five senses to absorb everything from the world around you. Your parents and society do their best to reward and punish you to help mold your behavior so you don’t become a wild animal.

Who raised you, what lessons you were told, what behavior you actually observed, and how you were taught all have a massive influence on your programming. Sometimes (most of the time?) parents and society don’t do a perfect job. Once you’ve taken in enough information, and practiced enough behavior that makes you feel safe and makes your family proud, your process of domestication is almost complete. You begin to police yourself internally.

There’s nothing wrong with following the rules that help you live a good life within society. But that’s not all we do. We beat ourselves up. We constantly criticize ourselves. Don Miquel Ruiz calls this incessant nagging, accusing, internal voice we all have the Judge. Capital J.

**UNRAVELING YOUR RULES**

Take a moment to recognize your own personal Judge. It will attack you at every weak point. It will try to break down your confidence and your contentment. It’s made to keep you in line. Who knows if that is good or bad for you specifically. But I think we can all agree that it would feel so good to be free from the Judge.

Most of us are insecure. Don’t let anyone’s bravado convince you differently. We judge ourselves more harshly than we ever would our friends. Before you can start to make positive changes in your thinking, you need to realize everything you believe down to your core is from this process of domestication and experience. That has nothing to do with what is ultimately true, just what is true for you.

Your views on money, good living, relationships, health, sexuality, spirituality, and yourself are all products of your environment. It seems quite overconfident to believe that you just happened to receive all the right answers, if there even are any. But once you realize this, you’re left feeling very lost. What are you supposed to believe? How are you supposed to guide your life? Enter religion, government, community, or articles like this. It’s all just our attempt to make sense of it all. 

We place no judgement here on any of those things. All of our views on these subjects change and solidify through time (based on our personal experience with them, of course). If all of this is so manipulatable, why don’t we start over from the beginning?

**WHY THE FOUR AGREEMENTS ARE SO POWERFUL**

The four agreements are an attempt to bring you inner peace. They are an attempt at reprogramming. There have been thousands of attempts over the years, so don’t feel too bad if these don’t resonate with you. Look for another path that makes you feel good. But the power of the four agreements is undeniable. 

You can use them every day in every situation. They transcend “rules”, so you don’t have to toss out any old beliefs if you don’t want to do that yet. If you “agree” with them, and “do your best” to follow them, you can go to sleep every night with a clean conscience.

**THE FOUR AGREEMENTS**

Here are the four agreements, taken directly from the book. Let’s go through them together.

**1. Be Impeccable With Your Word.**

Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.

**2. Don’t Take Anything Personally.**

Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.

**3. Don’t Make Assumptions.**

Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.

**4. Always Do Your Best.**

Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.

**MOVING FORWARD**

If you guys want, I founded Conquer Today, a platform that helps people with mental and lifestyle health. We support MHFA where I first got certified in mental health first aid. A while ago I wrote a full book I never released with 27 habits that can help you build what I call a ""stainless-steel mind"" :P There's a [page where you can download that](https://conquer.today/kaizen-habits-27-skills-master-powerful-mind-body-life/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=kaizen+habits&amp;utm_content=kaizen+habits&amp;utm_term=mental+health) for free if you are into this kind of stuff.

And as examples, the agreements are applicable from work to family. “Always do your best” helps you recover after a failed sales pitch you practiced for days. “Don’t make assumptions” will help you communicate and ask better questions before you destroy your relationship from insecurity. “Don’t take anything personally” will help you see the world more clearly over time.",18Jun2018,3
87,"Hi Reddit,

I've started therapy for the first time after dealing with anxiety and depression on my own. I've only been about 4 times now, my therapist is very kind and has given me a few useful tips and tools. She keeps mentioning that we need to ""dig up"" things from my past and work through them but that hasn't exactly happened yet, there was one attempt at this but she almost seems at a loss sometimes. I did have to fill out a questionairre and we did go over the main points in my life.

I know she is a newer therapist. She let me know she has another more experienced therapist that she consults with. I was fine with all of this, but sometimes I'm worried I'm not getting the help I need because she's not that experienced. Just as an example, she asked me a question and I tried to answer it as best as I could and after my response she kind of just sat there and looked at me. I got uncomfortable and did a sort of laugh.

I guess I just thought she'd ask more questions and kind of guide me through talking about this stuff but it's almost like she leaves it up to me. I have a hard time just talking about things and getting my thoughts out, it would help if she asked more questions and guided me through it. I have explained this to her as well.

Is there something I am doing wrong and a way I could get more out of my sessions? Is this typical when beginning therapy and should I give it more time or could this be due to inexperience?

I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this and offer advice. I've been really unwell lately and I'm just trying my hardest to do everything I can to get better.",18Jun2018,1

So I’ve known I have depression and anxiety for quite a few years now, and was diagnosed by the doctors last year for both.

I can be ‘happy’ but by the end of the day or any time where my thoughts are in control, it all boils down to the fact I’m sad.

- did you make any friends?

92,"Just to clarify, I am only expressing this on here due to the sense of anonymity. I feel like here, I can share my feelings because no one knows me and it's far away from my personal life.

For a while now, I have been feeling really low. I have lost all motivation to the point where I didn't want to get out of bed. I stopped caring about my grades, and even worse, I gave up revision right before my GCSE's. All of that then haunted me later, especially during evenings and at night time. I usually stay up until 3 am, everyday, thinking that I am a disgrace and a disappointment to my parents. It feels like I am stuck in a loop of a short period of time where I don't care about anything and everyone, but later spend days, weeks hating myself for being so selfish, beating myself up with the facts that my actions were unfair towards others. And I feel like all that self hatred is deserved, because I hate myself to the point where I KNOW that I deserve all of that. At the same tie, I tried helping some of my friends cope with depression and suicidal thoughts by letting them talk it out to me. And apparently, it helps them out, but I know that I am bad at helping people out. I am just bad at everything, and a huge waste of oxygen, space and organic material.

In reality, I am afraid of talking to people about my problems. Even though many of my friends and family encourage me to talk to them, I feel like it's unfair on them to do so. I hate to bother and worry them because I care about them. If I feel worse than usual, I will not talk to a person who is happy from the fear of bringing their mood down. I will refrain from talking to people  who are on their lows as well, because  I don't want to bring them further down. Also, I feel like talking to someone will be a display of weakness. I have always tried to be the supportive friend, but it has gotten more and more difficult. I will not tell anyone though, because I will disappoint everyone with the fact that I am so mentally weak. Psychiatrists are out of the picture. I feel like they are not as useful as everyone is making them out to be and their involvement will require insight and financial input from my parents, which is something I am not ready to expose them to. I don't want people to care and waste their time on me.

The main reason I decided to resort to this pathetic writing is to try and find another way of coping. I want no pity, I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me, because I am just a waste of time. I tried many things, from writing, drawing, video games, music etc.. In all fairness, music and cutting help occasionally. But if the thoughts get overwhelming, nothing is enough. If anyone has read through this, I want to thank them, and apologise for wasting their time. This is just a failed attempt to cope with the fear, because I have no idea what's wrong with me. I have no diagnosis for anything, and in my opinion, it is just my brain realising the truth. If anyone can tell me what they think is wrong with me, leave a comment. Again, sorry for wasting your time.",18Jun2018,2
