1,"Hey guys so I’ve been trying to figure out what could possibly be wrong with me and my brain and google has helped but can’t really trust the internet so I was just curious as to what you guys think is going on

For years I’ve been very paranoid, getting worse and worse as time goes by. For example, last week a girl who used to go to my school tried to start an argument with me over the internet and all of a sudden I was convinced she had planted a camera in my room and was spying on my, i tried to block the area where I thought the camera was and made a blanket fort to hid from her. This is just one incident but you get the point. It comes in waves and a thing to point out is not every fibre of my being fully believes the stuff I get paranoid about but I still have to act on it and i still feel intense fear.

Another thing I get paranoid about is that someone is out to kill me and sometimes it gets so bad that when I’m home alone I have to haul my ass into the bathroom to lock myself in with a knife and police on speed dial.

Just recently in the past 6 or so months I’ve started having mild hallucinations such as shadow people or even last month just saw a French bulldog in my room. I also have auditory hallucinations when in silence which I’m fairly sure is tinnitus like it will start of like ringing in my ears then move on to strange voices, almost haunting voices?

Another thing that has recently showed up is an intense paranoia of my bones breaking or loved ones getting hurt and to relive that anxiety I have to “touch wood”. There’s a rule to it if I said the paranoid thing in my head I say touch wood in my head and touch my forehead. If I say it aloud I also have to say touch wood aloud. It gets really frustrating though when your brain won’t stop having these thoughts that your sat there slapping your head, especially in public.

It’s not everything that’s going down but these are the highlights but I just wanted your guys opinion on all of this. What do you think is going on? (Apologies for the post being long)",25Jan2018,3
2,"Our hospital is pure shit. 

But every time I ever seem to go in, I get over stimulated and my brain just kind of lies to everyone. 

So I appear to be better, when in actuality, I'm not.",25Jan2018,6
3,"(I'm from the USA)
I've been thinking lately, and trying to do some research but not finding much information. It's very stated online and by doctors that the idea is you will take antidepressants for 6-12 months, and then be able to live without them. 

I question that. For years and years I could tell I needed medication. There have been some hiccups with adjusting to meds, and they don't solve every problem of course, but they are essential to me personally. 

So I want to know more about all this. Is taking medication a while supposed to correct the chemistry in my head? Whats the science behind this idea of ""short"" term medication? ",25Jan2018,3
4,"So I won’t go back to when all my mental health started but after a stay in hospital I was diagnosed with bipolar, extreme anxiety, intrusive thoughts with OCD. I was out on 600mg of quetiapine and 225mg of venaflaxine. It helped me a lot, it saved my life if I’m honest. That was 7 years ago. Recently I had surgery and was in the high dependency unit for a week as a nearly lost my life so I was off my meds for that week and it’s taken up until now (6 weeks later) for me to feel ‘normal’ again. I was horrific, crying constantly, extreme depression and anxiety. I had to be put on Valium while on the ward. I’m also struggling with an eating disorder at the moment so it heightened that and I have a feeding tube at the moment. Anyway back to the topic, I’m out of hospital now and I met up with a friend tonight and we were discussing medication and I said I can’t imagine ever coming off it as it terrifies me. So I’ve spent the last couple of hours overthinking about the fact will I ever be able to get off these, will I be stuck on these for the rest of my life? Does anyone else think this? I don’t want to be stuck on these but the thought of being back to where I was before hospital where I attempted suicide 7 times in a month is a no go area. Has anyone else successfully been able to get off meds and be ok? ",25Jan2018,1

I am scared that I am close to a mental breakdown, and I don't know what to do.

9,"I have a long history with mental health. Anxiety, Depression, self harm, suicide attempts, self medication and more. I have had long term hospitalizations when I was a teenager. I have since learned to manage my mental health with various Healthy and unhealthy coping skills.
Recently, I have had a perfect storm on my life. I’ve been dangerous close to decisions fueled by  my mental illness. I decided to seek out help in the form of intense outpatient therapy. Which is 3 evenings a week working in group and individual therapy to work through what’s going on and find a stable place. I’m happy to be in this setting, because I don’t want to feel like I’m in a black hole anymore. I want to get better. I want to feel joy. So, I’m taking the right steps.
But...
I’m married. My spouse is completely against my seeking help, because they say I am going to make all my problems about them. It’s really manipulative and hurtful. We do have marriage problems, but I have suffered from mental illness since elementary school. 
In my group sessions, I hear other members talking about opening up to their spouse and getting so much support. It makes me very upset, because I’ve always been open with my spouse about my feelings and I have never gotten support about mental health. The only support I really have is at treatment. At home, I can only depend on the coping skills I have learned and bottling my struggles until I am back with group/therapist.
Tonight when I got home, my spouse was laying on the couch. They got up and went to bed immediately. Not a hey how was therapy, how are you feeling, or what did you learn today.  It is putting me immediately back in a bad place when I’m home. 
Does anyone else face these kind of issues when seeking help for their mental illness?",25Jan2018,1
10,"Hello, r/mentalhealth. 

For a while now, I've had this issue of ""unwanted"" thoughts randomly passing through my mind. These thoughts almost always make me very anxious, as I feel like a horrible person for thinking such horrible things. For example, I will be going about my day, when a random thought suddenly passes through my mind, and I find my self repeatedly saying to myself: ""I didn't just think that, I didn't just think that..."". After calming down, I'll try to suppress these thoughts by repeating a phrase like ""I'm alright, I don't actually think these things"" over and over and over and over again. The more I try not to think of these random thoughts, the more they come back, repeating the cycle again. It has become so common in my life that I'll catch my thinking of a ""reassuring"" phrase, even without the random occurrence of an unwanted thought. 

How should I go about getting rid of both my random, unwanted thoughts and the phrases I think to myself to try to flood them out?

Thanks. ",25Jan2018,9

I’m currently a half time student but I want to be a full time student, the problem is I feel like it would to be too difficult to balance school work and therapy sessions. I would like to hear other people’s general experiences if they were able to balance both and hold up atleast a B average. I’m currently trying to get myself back to normal and everyone I have talked to said it would be better to take 2 classes instead of 4 while going to therapy.

12,"I'm personally an 18-year-old male, currently unsure about life and how I got myself in the situation I did, however, this is where I am. My best friend of 4 years, whom I have gone through all of high school with has been showing definitive signs of being a sociopath. She tries to restrict my actions by constantly becoming aggressive towards the way I respond or react to a scenario. I.E I am asked to do something, if not done exactly how she wanted it done, I am told how much of a f***ing idiot I am and that it's no wonder that ""you can't function on your own"". I personally feel I have been mentally dragged through 5 minefields at this point and am at my witts end. I've been walking on paper-thin ice for months with my mental health due to constantly being told that I am a shitty friend who doesn't care. She will act without thinking of the consequences it may have on another person regardless of the relationship she has with the person. She is aware of the fact that she is hurting others, however, she has told me that it doesn't mentally affect her. When we first became friends things were much different, but in the last year or so I have felt I've been walking on eggshells in every conversation to avoid being demeaned or told that I am not good enough. I am just reaching an end and am unsure of how to handle this situation without continually dragging myself through this mentally abusive friendship. Being her friend of four years, I feel like I can not just leave her, especially due to her own mental health problems in fear that it may escalate to anything worse. Any advice would be greatly appreciated - thanks reddit. 


TL;DR: My friend will knowingly hurt others, with the intent to do so, without a sense of morality, showing no remorse even for her closest of friends. I have to walk on eggshells to not be told I'm stupid or a f***ing idiot. Not sure how to deal with this, advice would be greatly appreciated. ",25Jan2018,3

I had an even recently, where I know absolutely something happened the night before. The problem is that I recorded my actions. I don't want to go into too much detail but the jist of it is, in my head, something happened, I can vividly remember it, the next day I was losing my mind and said something to someones family about what happened.

A few days later, I was thinking about what happened and I was kind of conflicted so I check all of my interactions for that night. I looked and nothing added up. It was like nothing that I remember happening happened. No drugs, no alcohol, I just feel like I lost time somewhere.",25Jan2018,5
17,"I’ve been having a lot of trouble keeping up with my thoughts, and recalling what I previously thought of. Like I’ll think of something important, and my brain realizes it as ‘important’ but the thought slips away. 

It all disappears It’s a constant fog, Constant forget. I think a lot in a day, (*like what I need to tell my friends, or stuff that I need to do, or like life stuff*) but I forget it, there is no recall memory, or not enough of it and not enough creativity to form memories. It has been happening over and over... and is really annoying me. i think, and then I forget. every day. And then usually just move on to something new.

It was ok at first but has been getting worse and worse over the past couple of months. Last week was the worst. (Is it my Anti Depressant causing this?)
.
What part of the memory is in charge or thought recall??

Today I was outside and had been analyzing stuff and thinking, but by the time I got home I had no recollection of what I had thought of. when I’m at home it can be much worse than this also. I will go on whole days just constantly forgetting stuff. the memory is fried. That’s best I can describe it

This is mind boggingly strange I remember having much better memory Things now just constantly go away. :( Can anyone help? (It’s gotten much worse tonight after I took my anti depressant) Same goes for things from previous days, and things that I needed to tell people from previous days. They don’t stick at all It’s like a fog. Not remember until the morning anyway unless I’ve written it down. I also need to write it down multiple times 😥 I feel like I’m basically the guy from that one movie that couldn’t remember anything. that’s how bad this is.

Q: *How do I get checked for this? Is there tests I can take?*
It has gotten much worse tonight since I took my anti-Depressant, so I know **that’s** whats causing it...😭 How do I fix though?

Like my memory capacity has become 0. there should be space for those previous thoughts and I should have access to them but they actually went away. my head’s decided they’re not that important? There’s no need for them? Some days it’s so bad that I think it’s Dementia...  literally everything I think of, it just keeps disappearing! It’s become so hard keeping friendships/goals like this. cause no thoughts stick. Like brain laziness or apathy. :(

It’s so bad every time I’m on the phone I’m having to read off my notes. It’s so bad and especially on days when I need to remember a lot in the day. I also am constantly glued to my notes app on because I’ve learned to write it all down or else nothing. 😔but even then I don’t remember it! My whole life is on notes and papers &amp; that I don’t remember what I wrote. Unless someone mentions it only then I can recall, but not on my own.😤 So in an ADHD kinda way too. 😶I just checked my phone and was shocked to see all these important notes that I hadn’t even remembered. I should have remembered all of them but nope..and that’s so bad and wasteful😡.. I know it’s my anti depressant doing this, cause when I take it it makes me happy but at the same time that’s what causes that effect. So what do I do??

It all adds up on a day to day basis...And even then, when I’ll wake up in the morning (or forget the morning, even right now) I’ll remember nothing. Or what I needed to tell my friends too no recollection. I had carefully mapped it out and wasted time. But it’s gone. then I look at my notes and slowly start remembering but only barely it’s gotten so bad. 😣This is such a shocking/strange thing I’m going though 😫...shouldn’t we all have had some sort of mental map??

Of course I should have thats just what a NORMAL memory does. 😤But mine doesn’t. And that is what it’s like to be human but I’ve been robbed of that privilege.😤 I definitely know something’s not right. It used to be much much easier/better than this. I have a strong feeling that it’s my Anti-Depressant causing it, over the long run... (Effexor) Like what meds do. Some days when it’s at its worst, I’ll forget about it all.. Or just, keep forgetting over and over, everything, despite even having written it down. the fog is so bad. none of my friends even take notes to begin with, and here I am relying on my notes for dear life, and using notes to TALK to them!! (Also this has gotten worse.)

This **article** is definitely also somewhat how I feel, except mine’s over time become much worse then this: https://www.additudemag.com/working-memory-deficit-weak-short-term-memory-symptoms-test-adults/
Definitely having ADHD is part of it, but definitely not to the extreme that it has become. It’s a conjunction of ADHD and Medication.

It’s been happening for months like this but has been getting much much worse lately. :(  I don’t know what to do anymore. the only explanation I have is that it’s the Effexor causing it. what else could it be 

TL;DR: *I have to write it down or else I’ll forget 100% sure. And nothing will come back anymore.*

**Could I get some help on this?? Which part of the memory is at fault right now? Is it working/recall memory? And how do I fix/improve and go back to normal?
Is there tests/doctors I could see for this?**

I do strongly believe that it is my Anti-Depressant Effexor that’s been causing this. It just sometimes feels like the thoughts go away because maybe it’s the anti-depressant “telling” them that they’re not “that important”, so also in the process positive thoughts go away too, Or maybe it’s stopped working over the long run, and my brain started getting it as a side effect. Also I’m on a dose that’s too high for me 150mg But I have no choice to come off it/ even lower the dose, due to the debilitating *withdrawal effects.*What do I do. I can’t stop taking it!!

*Also any recommendations to improve my memory?? I don’t know what to do it’s gotten so bad :(*

TL;DR: Earlier I had to walk to the kitchen and halfway there I had already forgotten what I needed from there.

**Is there any tests I can take too, to check brain activity?**",25Jan2018,1

19,"My mother, currently 50, always has great relationships with myself and sister-in-law and a pretty good relationship with my brother and I won’t comment on her marriage to my father cause it’s hard to be objective on that to be honest. 

About 7 years ago, I moved away (military family) and 5 years ago my brother moved away with his family for work. My father was in the Army so moving away was part of our upbringing. When my brother moved, my dad believes my mom’s personality changed greatly and I remember her being very strange and toxic towards me during that time. Things improved, I shouldered blame—maybe I wasn’t the beat daughter. 

I did notice all of her friendships deteriorated drastically—with her sisters specifically. 

Last June, I cancelled a trip home to see her with my son due to money and she was visiting my brother at the time. According to them, her entire demeanor changed after hearing the news and she became very angry. She upset my niece and nephew and my sister in law tried to smooth the waters which insulted my mother and led to a dramatic blow out. 

In August, they visited and I was on BC which was making me a bit crazy... so I didn’t help but the entire trip was just... insane. It was a disaster.

She had another blow out with my brother while I was visiting in October. During the trip, she was so toxic—narcissistic I felt at the time—that I became depressed and disassociated from my son (he was about 18 months). She also started talking about my brother in a demeaning, insulting, and nasty way that I’d never heard from her. It was very uncharacteristic. Once I left things improved greatly for my mental health but... communication is still hard for me. She’s still displaying those narcissistic personality traits to me and so my coping mechanism has been to avoid her as best as I can while dutifully calling regularly. 

At Christmas, she had another blow out with my brother over... him refusing to give our adult cousin a home and job (he dropped out of college and was smoking too much weed to join the military—the request was absurd on so many levels). But the crux of it is—any time she tells us what to do, we are disrespecting her and being bad children and being mean if we don’t do exactly what she says. 

Today, my brother called and told me she’d directly called him a bad father and some other things that upset him enough to call me. 

I’m not sure WHAT is going on or what to research or what direction to go. 

I live about $1500 in flights or 4 days drive from my parents. My brother lives one days drive but he’s been bearing the brunt of this so hard that he’s done. Visiting for a family sit down isn’t an easy task BUT we are all in agreement that it needs to happen. However, we need to be prepared. 

Honestly, I miss my mom. My dad and SIL think this has been going on for years and I’ve noticed it off and on but we haven’t lived near family in 7 + years. I used to call her almost every day from when my son was a few months until they visited us. I just am struggling so hard because our relationship was good but the constant commentary from her about my parenting and life choices is too much to weather. Combine that with the way she talks and treats my brother and Dad (guess I get off the lightest) have created a volatile situation. 

We all love her and want her to be happy and healthy but... we don’t know what to do of where to go. 

Additional information: she is constantly at the doctor, suffers from a back injury/pain that has her on disability, is treated for ADHD, treated for depression (I think), she’s 55, she speaks to a life coach after dropping therapists and counselors because they didn’t tell her what she wanted to hear (she had other reasons but basically they were wrong and she was right, my father even attended counseling and the counselor said my dad was right and my mom never saw him again—personal recounting, truth can’t be verified by me).

Sorry if this is all over the place.

20,"So I have no clue where to begin. I’ll try and keep it short, but it’ll be a long post. Sorry ahead of time. 

So I (20 M, from WV, US) have always had my issues from anger management in my early teens to getting really depressed in high school. Ended up pulling the trigger one day after school. The bullet was a dud, thankfully. I keep that bullet as a reminder to never get that far again, but lately it’s been really hard. 

I’ve had off and on mood swings with my depression over the last few years, but once I got into college, it got much worse. In between high school and college, I joined the Air Force. It’s been great to me, and it had been paying for school. But as things got worse for me, started not caring about myself or anything. Started failing PT tests, started failing classes; things just went to shit. 

But in fall of 2016, I reconnected with a girl who I met a few years before. Back then I had crushed in her, but I knew she was out of my league then and now. So I would just be her friend, drive her to a few places, and just talk to her. We had a lot in common and it was great. I had started developing feelings again, and it felt great to be in that “crushing” phase. Never acted on it. 

Then in the spring, after having shit grades in the fall, it got really bad for me. Was planning on going home to kill myself. The night of, I got a text from that girl’s mother telling me she had attempted and was in the hospital getting help. That was a blow to my heart that she didn’t ask for help from me, but it snapped me out of my funk. I called her and wrote to her when she was in the hospital. Once she got out, I would drive a few hours to go see her and hang out with her. By then, I was really liking her. But I was there for her, not me. Helping her helped me. But she told me one day she liked me, and that she wanted to kiss me. I got really happy about that. I had never had my first kiss. Since I also had never been on the receiving end of feelings, I was also not the best at flirting. But it was fun. I was happy. But then I went and visited her, and attempted to be the one to initiate the kiss. It was so awkward. I went from a kiss to a hug and it ruined the whole vibe. A while later, she told me she didn’t want to be with me and that I should leave. It hurt really bad, but I was used to rejection. 

The whole summer passed by, and never heard from her. It really hurt me. I was in summer classes to raise my GPA, but I spent the nights drinking myself away and meddling with drugs. Not a fun time. At all. But I was trying to block out my heartbreak, my depression, everything. Kept it well hidden. After school started back up in the fall, I heard from her. She wanted to apologize for pushing me away and that she did it to everyone. Despite my friends telling me not to, i started talking to her. She invited me over to her place to watch some TV and possibly drink. We did drink. We kissed, cuddled, and I stayed the night with her just holding her in my arms. It was soooooo amazing. 

But then after I left, I saw her one last time before she ghosted me again. I reached out to her several times. After I came to the conclusion that I wasn’t good enough for her, I started drinking again. A lot more. 

Things progressed till I completely failed a semester and nearly got kicked out of school. I have a semester to fix it before I do. But I went home for break, hoping being at home, I’d get better. My family found my alcohol stash, and took it and started giving me tough love. Things just kept going downhill. They threatened to kick me off family plans and kick me out if I didn’t meet their demands. I did, but they still followed through with all their threats. They have control of my bank accounts, and anytime money goes in, they just take it out. They mean well, but it’s just not what I need honestly. 

I was so done with everything, I wanted to die. Made the preparations. I said my goodbyes. I reached out to this girl one last time telling her everything that had happened and she basically said “sorry, wish I could help”. I know she wasn’t and isn’t in the place to help me, but I wish she had said more. We both took to Twitter to tell our people we now felt like shit, but she told her people that “if we stopped talking, there’s a reason we don’t.” And that “I’m leaving all the toxic people behind in 2017”. 

Yeah I shouldn’t have been creeping on her twitter, but I didn’t understand why she said what she did. It made me so much worse. But somehow the Air Force found out, took me in, and talked to me for hours. Don’t know what will come of it. Hopefully they will help me and not punish me, but being 20 and drinking doesn’t help. 

I’ve stopped drinking but the pain is still there. I don’t wanna blame anyone but me for this, and I don’t wanna blame this girl. She was the cause for a lot of my pain yes, but there’s not much to like about me. So I’m not mad at her. And maybe what happened between us or what was said was different from what she experienced, so I don’t want to confront her again about it. 

I sit in bed for hours upon hours trying to get to sleep, but either the nightmares keep waking me up, or my thoughts on how I could’ve done something different, and maybe she and I would be together. 

I want nothing but the best for her. I hope she never sees this post, but part of me wishes she would so she could see how much pain I’m in. 

But I have no one at the moment, pushed most people away or got kicked out. So I’m lost. I know I need professional help,  but I don’t have that kind of money. So fun times. I keep making similar posts to different /r s but I just need more advice

TLDR:
I’ve always had depression/issues surrounding that, and I’ve attempted several times. Met a girl who had similar problems, helped her through her rough times. Feel for her and she fell for me(or so I thought.) she ghosted me several times, only to ask me back when she needed me. Basically used me (I think) and left me. We were never official, but it still hurt like hell. I had been solving issues with drinking. Got kicked out of family house and kick off family plans, broke af, school grades are in the toilet.

I don't know what's become of me over the past several years. I was on the right track in 2010ish. Had my own place and managed my money well. Held down a job for over 2 years which is the only time that's ever happened. Had a good healthy circle of friends. Had optimism for days and regularly tried to convince others to get out of their ruts and back in the saddle. I was also not dependent on others for my happiness, I was okay on my own with my hobbies and passions and interests.

It all changed when I pursued a long distance relationship that went heartbreakingly south when I traveled to meet her. It wasn't a good fit for either of us, but I took it out on myself mostly. I had built it up so much in my head. I know the right thing to do would have been to chalk it up as a learning experience and move on, but I immediately collapsed in on myself in the aftermath and turned to isolation and things like smoking pot to get through the way I felt.. or to avoid how I felt. Not sure which. Maybe both. 

I've become needy and sometimes nasty towards people. I regularly contacted the girl I traveled to see and tried to figure out what went wrong, why it went wrong, tried to figure out a way to fix it.. but she didn't want anything to do with me and blocked me because of my over-persistence. Recently I killed a decade-long friendship because the friend started slow-fading out of my life. In a jealous rage, I contacted not only her, but the people I perceived her to be replacing me with and unloaded on them. I contacted her fiance with proof that she's been unfaithful and basically did everything in my power to... not really burn the bridge so much as drop 2000 lbs bombs on it and bulldoze the remains. 

I resent people now, even when they aren't responsible for my problems, and they don't deserve the anger and pain I'm inflicting back. It's come from something else, or me being mad at myself.. and just spiraled out of control. I felt like I was seeing red sometimes or just didn't care that I was causing so much damage in my own life and to others.

^ That's screwed up, I know. I really do! And.. it hurts me at the core that I've become this way.. because if you asked anyone who used to know me, I was never a hostile person for most of my life. At the very least, I used to be capable of walking away from situations that didn't serve me without being a destructive child throwing tantrums about it.

For the record, I did seek out medical intervention last year and I've recently come off 6 months of antidepressants/anxiety medication. The side effects were too great to justify taking what they gave me. ( trembling hands and digestive problems ) 

Let's talk about now: I'm at the point where if I could just get past all this anger, my life could be at least a clean slate. I have a supportive and patient family that has allowed me to live this low-life way for years without kicking me to the curb. My family is the only people I haven't become nasty towards, and in fact I'm trying my best to help financially assist when I have the energy to work. ( home based graphic design )

I just don't know where my optimism went. I quit nurturing my interests and passions because.. maybe I've kinda given up? I don't know why I can't look forward to socializing anymore and I completely dread people. Even when I do go interact with people, it feels like I'm trying to paddle upstream and I get tired. All I want to do is lock my door, turn on some music that understands me, get high, and sleep. 

So what do you say, how do I recover from being this guy that I never intended to become? I'm NOT suicidal, but I can't honestly see myself continuing down this road much longer. Something has to change.",25Jan2018,2
23,"20 year old male, Dutch.  
Whenever I see police chases, riots or big crowds fighting/trampling, I start crying.  
A few examples:  
A while ago I watched a video of a popular youtuber trying to get into vidcon, but his fans where trampling each other to get near him.  
I didn't like the youtuber, but that was not the reason why I started crying. The video did not shock me or sadden me, but I still started crying.  
  
Today I watched a video called ""curb your police"" in which police chase a women who stole one of their cars. First I let out a laugh, even though I didn't find it funny, then I started crying.  
Again, the video did not shock or sadden me, but it still made me cry.  
  
Prison documentaries make me cry too.
  
I have no bad experiences with police or big crowds and I think it has something to do with hormones, comparable to how pregnant women sometimes start crying when they see violence on tv.  
  
Is there something wrong with me?

24,"I keep having episodes during which I have a lot of intense feelings going through my head, and I cannot calm down. I feel extremely anxious to the point I cannot step outside of my room, and when the episode ends, I feel extremely exhausted, dizzy, and sleepy, but my heart also keeps beating fast for a while. I can easily sleep for a whole day after that.

I don't know how to describe it better, and it has been happening to me more frequently these days, to the point I'm not going to my classes at all, and I'm not eating too much since I'd need to step outside to buy food.

26,"“You are an important person. Together we can work out what’s been going on in your life,” says a laminated poster haphazardly tacked to the white bedroom wall beside me, “whatever it is we know you can get through this.”

Between the poster, the rubberised coat hook and the whirring of the doors to ensure any sharp object is promptly hidden in the jam, there’s no mistaking the nature of where I now stand. It is the path not so rarely taken, or forgotten, but so often ignored. Mental health, after all, remains as taboo as ever despite ongoing narratives attempting, in vain, to suggest otherwise.

Consider that in each calendar year, approximately one in five individuals will experience some form of mental illness. Or consider that every day, an approximate of six people in Australia will take their own lives, and a further thirty will make an attempt on their own lives. Or consider, perhaps most damning of all, that suicide remains the leading cause of death for Australians between the ages of 25-44, and second leading cause of death for those aged 15-24. It’s no wonder then that mental health is spoken about in such hushed tones, if at all. Certainly it’s no great wonder that, as I lay here, nobody but my immediate family know where I am and, worse, why.

“I’ve had a mental breakdown,” I might say, “And I’ve been seriously considering committing suicide.”

The admission would be met with a deafening silence, I’m sure, with those who would hear it unlikely to know how to respond. There’s no great likelihood that they will share their own stories, perhaps their sons or brothers, wives or mothers. In reality, the greater likelihood would lie in only one word, “oh.”

Oh, but here we are. The drone of a distant light buzzing in the background, between intermittent squawks of an intercom abruptly startling all those unprepared to hear it. The pallid walls, devoid of any substance bar posters advising the reader to reach out for help, or reminding them that they matter. Which they do, and I would hope that I do, also. Fortunately, I have managed to dodge the bullet of the louder, far more traumatic mental inpatient ward the doctors speak about in ominous tones, out of sheer luck more than anything else. For once, my aversion to violence or unkind behaviour has paid off with my landing in a small, low dependency ward nestled away besides the hospital’s Emergency Room.

Still, however, all precautions have been made to ensure I have no means with which to harm myself, and the reality of my situation has no opportunity not to fully sink in. This is, naturally, assuming I have forgotten my first ride in the back of an ambulance, or the hours waiting in a hospital bed, which unsurprisingly I have not had the fortune of doing. 

Worst of all, I have not had the fortune of forgetting the apathy of Emergency Room staff when being greeted with a case of Mental Health, their beleaguered, overworked and underfunded work force regarding me with backhanded derision and subtle skepticism. They need not know that I haven’t been able to eat, the anxiety eating at my bowels. And they need not know that I haven’t been sleeping much, the anxiety and the depression corroding my mind. Likewise, they need not know that I hoped the ambulance carrying me in it would crash on the way to the hospital, causing only one fatality - me. 

They need not know because they aren’t paid to know, and they don’t care to. Not so long as they’re worked and paid what they are, far below proportion. Likewise, they need not have to care, when government funding for Mental Health admissions and subsequent treatments is criminally destitute and, frankly, disgusting. But then, it’s hard to imagine them also knowing how it feels to lie here in this hospital bed, being sucked in to the firm mattress by the weight of thoughts calling and screaming for your early demise at age 25. If they did know, I wonder, what would they say?

So, too, our politicians, and all those responsible for the funding of our Mental Health programs, what would they say if they laid where I lie?

30,"Hello, how are you today?

I'm 25 years old, and have been diagnosed with OCD at the age of 17.  My OCD symptoms were purely about intrusive thoughts, no compulsions and no obsessions about cleanliness etc. A bit of a perfectionism. I lived with OCD for only a couple of years, it is mostly calm up there now.

Lately, both my GF and my mum are trying to talk me into visiting a doctor to confirm if I have Autism Spectrum Disorder or not, after my GF found a blog post of an adult woman that described how it was like to live with undiagnosed autism. I did a bit of research, and ASD wasn't what I thought it was, I must have been confusing it with something else.

I fit a lot of symptoms. I'm okay at social interaction; but that's all practice, I learned what means what eventually. Yet, I have no innate understanding of social signs and clues, I make a lot of mistakes, and the stress from both the confusion and the effort to keep my interactions normal has made me hate dialogue and being in public. I'm not even comfortable with my GF in the room, and want to be alone all the time. I'm constantly angry because I'm not alone at home, just happily dealing with my ruitine.

I've learned how to spot them eventually but I still have trouble with metaphors, irony and sarcasm. My body gets very hot and tense when I'm subjected to a loud noise, I'm unable to go to the movies. I also hate light and being touched. I make very weird sounds, reminiscent of tics, especially when I'm stressed, making my life even more difficult during important work meetings. I'm generally tense and stressed out when I'm not doing something I like over and over again.

I think I need to tell these things to a doctor. I've visited one a few times this year to decide if I'm good to drop my OCD meds, but I didn't like him. Now, when I find a new doctor, I'm not sure how to approach them on the issue.

Should I tell them right away that my parents are concerned I might have autism? Should I talk about my previous experiences with mental health? Should I just skip all of that and discuss how to eliminate my extremely strong desire for a solitary lifestyle? Should I visit multiple doctors? 

Thank you for your time good people, waiting for your answers.",25Jan2018,1
31,"I'm writing this because as I'm reading back on these posts, it reminds me of where I used to be six years ago, and that lonely, hopelessness that used to gnaw at me what felt like forever.  I don't want to write this as any authority or someone who's 'made it'.  Life still has its challenges and I'm not one to think of myself as 'crushing it' or having it all put together.  Just want to put that out there; if that's the vibe you're getting from me, don't read further and just move my post in the trash.  I know I wouldn't really want to read anything like myself.

It may or may not get better.  But I've learned, and continue to humbly learn, that you start to see the pattern.  You start to see the game that you're set up in your mind.  Some days, it's claustrophobic and you just want to run out and scream.  Other days, it's so deadening that you want to sit on the floor and cry until there's no tears left and all the joy in the world has evaporated into the dark chasm.  Your dreams will feel like they're just holographic films playing in a make believe world, while the nightmares and terrors start caving in.

But I somehow fought them. I don't know how, honestly.  I can't tell you a twelve step program, or a book that gives you the answers, or something to tell yourself.  You don't.  This is the terrible game that's set up.  You can't trust your mind.  But fucking hell, you fight it, somehow, with everything that you have.  Even in the pit of hell, you look for something, anything, you find that piece of brilliant light that's buried in the middle of the black flames, and you find your way out.

You can do this, even on the days you feel like you can't.  Especially on the days that feel like you can't.  You take out that sheet of paper that has your goals or your dreams - maybe shit went down and they're not real or they seem so far in the distance like climbing the range of a mountain and all you have left is a ragged jacket and some biscuits.  You feel like you have nothing.  The world tells you to march on, like you're just walking up a hill, like what you're seeing doesn't matter.  It's shit.  You feel like shit.
But your truth, the truth that it hurts and you're in pain, and the mountains are real, and the ice is cold and bitter.  That's real.  You know it.  You can feel it in your bones.  And I know it; it is real, those moments are real.  Terror can be real some days, and it can crush you.

But I know, somewhere inside you, and somewhere inside me, there's a voice that keeps you here.  You think it's weakness, that if you were really courageous, you would end the nightmare and leave this world behind because there's nothing left in it.  The voice that tells you to stop and let go of the noose and go back to the humdrum, you think that's just the fear.  It's not.  What keeps you alive, is you, is the real you.  If you post here, if you write anything to reach out, you're reaching out to the world and grabbing that tiny light in the darkness.  Maybe you don't post, or you're anonymous, or you think no one cares.  But that voice tells you, you're alive, stay alive!

I lived the nightmares for years.  For years.  And I look back, and I don't even recognize who I used to be.  I don't know how to tell you, that something can change and you can get better.  I can't say that without feeling like I'm letting you all down, because I know my old self would never believe that.  I couldn't then.  And maybe I can't really now - it doesn't feel like I need to get better anymore.  Life is so beautiful, even in the muck and the rain, and the dark clouds that roll into my mind.  The voices are still alive and well, but I've learned them.  I've learned their terrible tricks and well conceived plans.  And I know they're not me.  And wow, what a life to live, my friends.  I don't know the secret to living with demons, but somehow, that voice that tells you to stay alive.  It's right.  I've been given so much more than I can ever possibly imagine.  And of course, I have my goals and dreams, some of them unfulfilled, others just waiting and incubating.  They're hatching, little chicks that need tender love.  The voices come and they try to steal them away, to pull them into the black pit.  But today, I gave those baby chicks love and they're growing.  They're bigger than the pit; they're so big and wide and beautiful, that they can't even fit in the pit.  The pit looks like a tiny crack in the earth now, some moment in time that has no place anymore.
I don't know if you can do that; I'm not going to tell you that that's going to be you.  But I want to believe that, I have so much hope that there's a way to move forward for everyone here.  You're here, you're reading this.  You want it too, I know you do.  I was there, sitting on my computer, in tears trying to figure out a way to throw myself in front of a train.  I can remember that moment, and a friend calls who was supposed to meet with me.  And then, I get some help, and I'm in the hospital.  I remember those events, like dreams far away.  Like a nightmare I once remembered as a little boy.

Now I have more than I can even believe.  It's unreal.  I don't say that to boast.  It's little things, small things, like an espresso in the morning, or looking out the window and realizing I have a place to stay away from the cold.  It's going on a drive with the woman I love, and singing show tunes.  It's laughing because I said something silly that doesn't make sense, and realizing it's all a great big joke.  Not one I would ever trade in for the world.  A joke with beauty, and laughter, and light.

And I've lost things.  Good friends, people I wish I'd connected more with, relationships that never quite worked out.  I've had my regrets, and maybe I revisit them for old time's sake.  But they don't own me anymore.  Who I was, I give love to that person.  I know they did the best they could do.  I know you, in your own way, even in your nightmares and pain.  You are doing the best you can.  It's so hard to hear that, and know that, and believe it's true.  I know.  It's almost like slicing your gut open to hear that, and let that in.  But there's love there.  If you read this, if you can feel it in your bones, there is love there.  It will keep you alive.  It will keep you above the water, the terrible blue depths of the drowning ocean.

And one day, you'll learn to swim that ocean, and dive right in.
Good day to you, and may all your dreams, hopes, and goals be fulfilled, in one way or another, in the form appropriate for you.  May love reach you, from wherever it's meant to come.",25Jan2018,4

I failed exams, my mother got diagnosed with cancer and had to have massive life altering surgery, my girlfriend cheated on me repeatedly then almost died of a drug overdose. There was a period where I was so stressed my hair fell out and my weight dropped to about 95lb, but then past that something seems to have cracked.  I am doing ten hour days of studying to retake my exams, and also I live in a non English speaking country by myself. Now, the only thing I feel from time to time is frustration. I don’t feel sad or lonely or stressed - just angry and overdrawn.

What’s most worrying me is I kind of worry I’m losing it. Everywhere i go I feel like it’s like it’s a movie scene or made of modeling clay , and the people around me aren’t real people, they’re just mannequins. I have no urge to reach out to friends or see anyone other than my girlfriend, and even she drives me insane most of the time.  I’ve smoked a fair bit of hash/weed, but recently I’m starting to have auditory hallucinations. Voices approaching me, music, clocks ticking that aren’t there. The obvious thing to do here is stop smoking weed, but even still I don’t like that this symptom emerged at all.

I told her about my struggles with past doctors not taking me seriously and general failures by the system, how I get so anxious about going to doctors now because every time I bring up my mental illness it gets brushed aside.

She was meant to call me on Tuesday and talk to me about what was going to happen going forward, after speaking to a psychiatrist, and she didn't. Instead I got a three line letter basically saying 'thanks but no'.

37,"My worst nightmare came true. Since I was maybe 12, all I feared was not to ever have a boyfriend, and here I am, 14 years later at 27, and I'm alone and never ever been in a single date despite trying very hard. All I know is rejection and feeling of being left out. I've been feeling hurt and down for far too long. Now I'm getting old and the love experiences (with sex included) that young people experience are gone for me. No chance of time rolling back, because let's not be hypocrites, life at 15-24 is way different than life at 30 especially regarding sex life and love relationships. Some say life at 30 is better than at 20, but that might only be true, which I doubt, if you enjoyed love and sex at both ages, which I didn't. I think about dying every single day and I can't bear this pain anymore. Life has been too tough on me. All I wanted from life was a boyfriend and never had one. I don't see the point in my life anymore. The pain of isolation is too damn hard. I was the first among my family and friends (I only have online friends at the moment, but I had IRL friends in the past) to come out as gay, and yet am the only one not to have had a relationship so far. As far as I can remember I started feeling sexually attracted to boys around 9 or 10, or even earlier than that, and even masturbated thinking about them, although I didn't accept myself back then (Is it common for males to be sexual at such an early age?).

My heart is in a million pieces. I wish I was never born. I feel like punching my face every day, I feel like killing myself every day, I feel disappearing every day, I can't go any further. The feeling of wanting something since a very young age and never being able to have it is so heartbreaking. The pain is beyond description. This unfulfilled part of myself also took a massive toll on other areas of my life such as getting a degree or having a stable job, but that's not the aim of this topic.

I was such a romantic person in my teens and when I came out, but I'm slowly becoming a bitter and resentful person which I have absolutely never thought or wanted to become.

Sorry for venting on here guys.",25Jan2018,49
38,"I have recently started therapy for a variety of reasons, mostly based on what I am now realizing is a deeply ingrained procrastination and a desire to find a way to ""cheat the system"" when it comes to getting stuff done, often finding the easiest way, rather than the best. Mostly this is work related and production related, but this same attitude is pervasive throughout my life decisions.I also struggle with use of pot in a non-healthy way, using in situations that most in-control people would rightfully not get high for. 

Anyway, that is just background as to why I am seeing a therapist, and as you can see, none of it is related to my relationship with my Wife. We have our fair share of issues, but none that are deeply troubling and none that I feel threaten our relationship. I feel we just have the normal, living with and connected to a separate human being, type of problems.

Anyway, her first reaction to me starting to see a therapist was that she was worried she had done something, and she was worried that I was going to a therapist to talk about her. Recently, she and I got in a mini-argument because she has this resentment toward video games, and my buddy just got a game and wanted to play online with me, so I did. She got upset because she was only going to be up for another hour and wanted to hang out with me. She than said something along the lines with ""its fine you can play with your friends, i dont want to give you more ammo for your therapist.""

There is clearly some anxiety about me seeing a therapist, but this comment really hurt, and I didnt expect it. Not sure if she fully understands how much it hurt, or how much its still sticking with me. In most situations, she has been completely on board and positive about my therapy, but I can tell she is concerned that I will figure out that I hate her or something.

I just wish she would understand that I am trying to better myself, and I am not going there to have a person who is ""on my side"" of arguments with her.  It almost feels like she knows she has to be positive about it, but deep down she is very concerned that I will discover I dislike her or something. I just want to make her understand where I am at, but even when I say these things explicitly, I feel like she thinks I am just saying it because I have to. How do I possibly assure her that she isn't my problem, that my problem is all myself, and that I am only going there to work on myself?

TLDR: Wife seems to resent me going to therapy, possibly in fear that she is the problem. Cant find way to reassure her that she has nothing to worry about and that I am going to better myself and fix some deeply ingrained behaviors that need to be changed. ",25Jan2018,4

41,"I went to my first psychiatric appointment today, worried that I would be wasting my time and money. My closest family suggested that I should see a doctor after some anxious episodes I had during the holidays. I admit that sometimes I might get very intense, so I agreed to see the psychiatrist they suggested.

I went in and I struggled to figure out what to say so I ended up just saying whatever I thought was appropriate. In the end, the doctor told I would probably benefit from getting therapy from a psychologist, as it sounded that part of my issues could be fixed by figuring out how to change my behavior or thinking patterns. On top of that, I was prescribed with antidepressant, anxiolytic and antipsychotic meds. 

I feel overwhelmed. I didn't think I needed this much medication? The anxiolytic seems understandable as I really do struggle with anxiety sometimes, but the others seem too much. I don't know what to think about this. 

I really did worry that I might come back with a pat on the back and a ""you're ok, you don't need to take anything"" and a lifetime to think about how maybe I just need to change my personality and how I see the world for things to get better. Turns out apparently I can get help through meds and therapy, yet I'm still worrying like crazy that it might not be needed and maybe it's too much.

49,"Social interaction is incredibly hard for me. I had very little meaningful interaction and friendship with kids my age growing up &amp; have a quite limited understanding of my own emotions. My parents are both emotionally unstable and I was diagnosed with social anxiety, ocd &amp; depression as a kid. I don’t really have much empathy now as an adult. 

I’ve had a series of fake personalities for every single relationship I have for as long as I can remember but I’ve only noticed it quite recently since it was brought up in therapy. I do this with everyone, even family. I build up a profile of a person’s likes/dislikes/mannerisms and imitate them to tailor my personality to what I feel is most desirable to that person. How much I imitate them varies. 

It’s gotten to the point where
 a) my personality can vary drastically depending on who I’m with
b) some people have noticed 
c) I often dissociate/go on “autopilot” when I talk to people 

I have a personality for each of my parents, each of my friends, strangers, etc. They vary wildly, some are extroverted, others are introverted, some are loud and opinionated and some are quiet. It’s exhausting for me to do but I can’t seem to turn it off. I can’t be myself because I don’t know if there IS a self. I don’t know if there ever was a self. I do have certain core values &amp; opinions but I even compromise those to a certain extent. I genuinely don’t feel as if I have a core personality. I can’t understand if this is normal for people to do or if I have a personality disorder of some sort. 

I have an extremely hard time forming close relationships as a result and have very few. 

I wanna know if anyone else can relate? Any insight or advice would be really helpful. ",25Jan2018,17

51,"A film festival wants to feature my college thesis film on their website and interview me live on the internet. I’m extremely worried though, because I made that film almost 2 years ago and, since then, my depression has developed and I’ve been too busy fighting that to make any more films. I know they’re gonna ask what I’ve been up to in the interview and I don’t know what to say 😰 do I mention I’ve been dealing with mental stuff? Do I just answer very vaguely with something like “I’ve been doing stuff,” (which I don’t like doing, for reasons I’m not sure of yet). 

I was recently in another film festival where I was asked, in front of a crowd, what I’ve been up to and what my plans are for what to do next. I ultimately lied and said I was working on a film and I felt really bad about that answer. I realize one of the reasons I said that was because a lot of my family was there, and I worry about “using depression as an excuse” in front of them. My family is also going to be watching this interview, so I’m just really anxious and worried.",25Jan2018,9

53,"I'm a 21yr old maintenance worker who's secretly struggled with (suspected) BPD for as long as I can remember. The only time I made any progress in my battle against it was when I was prescribed clonazapalm because it helped me open up to strangers over the internet with similar conditions and for once and my life I could try and talk this through vs surrendering my body to science (registered organ donor).

I've tried talking to males about my issues but I guess they primarily lack the compassion and advice I'm looking for and mainly because I have a very difficult time opening up to males because it makes me feel pathetic.

I do currently have a gf of 4 years who I have no intentions on cheating on but she has discovered my venting kik account and read through my transcripts with other males and females from all over the globe about coping mechanisms and just to have someone there to talk to but she took it as I was being scandalous so I deleted everything and decided I'm good on my own.

I tried venting to her but she has limited knowledge in mental illness and every time I try and tell her how my brain makes me feel she cries and irrationally worries about me day and night. 

If I could just have one or two penpal type friends it could help me drastically but it still feels adulterous discreetly conversing with others so I don't know what to do with myself anymore.

54,"Hi guys, I dunno if this is the right place but I don't know where the hell to express myself and I need to know if anyone relates.

I'm an ex anorexic, my anorexia was mild for about 2.5 years (but with prior history over 7 years) compared to a lot of people and I overcame it myself. I was bullied as a kid for being chubby and wanted to be thin, get rid of my thighs and love handles for so long. I did that. In a messed up way. I realised I was harming myself and worked through a series of issues... I'm now about 8 pounds into my recommended weight range. So still on the low end but ok. 

Now I've noticed its basically undesirable to be thin, to be slim. It's not enough. NO. It has to be the right kind of thin. It has to be Kardashian thin - a tiny stick waist, long arms and legs but then huge flaring glutes and hips and a protruding muscular butt like a bustle.  

On a side note, and this event is what made me realise I have an issue. The other month I was dating a guy I met on tinder and we were getting to know each other and start dating, when he completely ghosted on me. I noticed there was a new girl on his Instagram and it was apparent they were at least meeting each other and intimate. I saw photos of her. She IS that body type. Goes to the gym for 1 hour everyday and she lifts huge heavy weights, muscular back, betty boop waist but heavily muscular butt. 

My heart sank. I've been noticing this a lot, and even on reddit. I feel like I am just wrong. Not as attractive as I could be or as these girls. I'm feeling like this guy didn't really fancy me and if I looked like the other chick maybe him and other guys would. I hide these feelings through a veil of normality and happiness over my body. I feel unfeminine. 

There are loads of articles online, that keep popping up even on here saying how a woman should be strong and have curves. I just don't have either. 

Now i worry about being too thin, but also how I can be slim and muscular/curvy. Its yet another battle I can't win. I don't even have enough time in the day to devote to weightlifting etc. 

I just don't want my body. I'm so ugly. All this 'healthy strong woman' stuff is not as positive as many people think it is. And embracing curves has just become another way to shun women who don't fit the new mould. 

Please, can anybody help or relate? 

I feel myself sinking..........",25Jan2018,60

56,"I'm not sure what's going on. I'm exceedingly tired all the time. I have a diagnosis of PTSD and chronic major depressive disorder. I'm on meds. I'm not suicidal. I love my life. But I just don't have an interest in anything anymore. I spend all day in bed. I was a high libido individual and I'm not interested in sex anymore. I just feel despondent. Overall, I'm just so tired. It's like my soul is tired. There's a heaviness in my chest that makes me want to sleep. I'm on citalopram. 30mg. I have teenage boys that are annoyed with my total lack of interest in anything. I'm not getting things done.  I just let everything go. I just don't care. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be this way.",25Jan2018,1
57,"In the past two months, my motivation has gone on vacation. Despite the fact that I'm a student at a really good university, maintain good grades, have a job and play in a band on the side, most of it doesn't seem to matter to me. This really came to a head after a lot of self-reflection, when I realized how much I've actually fucked up. I sunk down the lowest I ever had, and didn't leave my apartment for four days. Couldn't even feel the motivation to feed myself properly.

How the hell do I get out of this?",25Jan2018,1
