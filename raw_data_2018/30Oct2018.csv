0,No one. asks everyone ignores. it’s not their fault I know. Honestly my best friends have been treating me like dirt and idk what to do. I feel so pointless it’s taken all my mental and emotional energy to even send this. ,30Oct2018,1
1,"There was a moment in my life where I realized just how fucked up I really am. For years I heard voices in my head, just screaming at me, but I had thought that was normal for an individual that was stressed out. However, now it has been made known to me that not just any person experiences these types of things. I'm 18 years old and suffer from moderate to severe anxiety. It wasn't until high school that I realized that my way of thinking was pure evil. I thought nothing of people dying, I merely mimicked what a normal person would feel. I'd have to intentionally make myself feel sad in an effort to be normal. On the outside no one would question me... I looked and 'acted' like a normal human being, but when it came the time to be alone I had a totally opposite personality. I literally feel like a psychopath sitting in my room laughing at seemingly nothing. I would laugh but at the same time feel like I was in the pit of despair. I don't know whats wrong with me and I know damn well something is wrong here. Who else wallows in despair and just laughs. Then the next morning I'm a regular person... I go to school, do homework, dick around with friends, and enjoy my life. I can't seem to figure out why it is that I'm such a different person by myself. Is it a psychotic break? or just a mental breakdown. Give me some advice here, I'm looking forward to what others have to say about this situation.",30Oct2018,1
2,"WARNING: I'm not a native english speaker  


Ok, so, I'm 25 years old and most of my life I've had this conversation with myself where I would hesitate on my daily occurrences and how I behaved, misbehaved, the good and bad things of life, etc. And in the worse scenarios I'd torture myself because of how I acted in social situations. I mean, asking myself if what I did was ok or not (even when I really didn't do something bad). But that didn't happen when I was child. I guess it started when I hit adolescence.   


I've always had friends around me, I guess people like me somehow because I'm a good person and etc. I also appreciate my friends and try to keep them close.   


However, I'm also an addict but the only drugs I use are alcohol and marijuana, which are ""socially acceptable"" (I've also used DXM but only for a window-period of a month per year since I was probs 19). I'm not sure if abusing them (i'm 100% sure i'm an addict and dependant even to weed because I can't go a month w/o using weed/alcohol) has caused me this mental disseaes.   


I always had a fear of death when I was younger, let's say 10-11 years old. Anxiety was always in me. Then I started using drugs and maybe the fear of death got away but in my last school years I became paranoid. So paranoid that I had dellusions of my friends wanting to hurt me. And a psychiatrist had to give me topiramate (for the abuse of substances) and anti psychotics (for the symptons).   


My real question is what if ""know"" that I talk to myself, but the talking makes me behave a certain (probs not healthy) way?   


TL;DR: Am I behaving the way I am (destructive behavour according to parents, drug abuse, etc.) because of my own dylema with myself, or am I having this psychotic traits that go beyond my will to be ""normal"" and ""functional""? ",30Oct2018,1

4,"So this is long im sorry, but last week was my Boyfriends birthday and we went out with a bunch of friends and got drunk. back story we have been dating 2 years...

 alot of people were telling me to take him home as he started feeling sick, i was gonna call an uber but my jacket was in my car and one of his friends that i have known forever was trying to talk me into me and my boyfriend moving in with them, it was cold out side and the bar was loud (haloween party) so we sat in my car and talked we kept talking and it led to us talking about me trying to convince him to go to college hes (24) and the friend agreeing i was doing the right thing by encouraging him because he has no real drive. anyway his best friend comes up to my car and gets involved in the conversation and the other friend went to go tell my bf i was okay and talking to his friend. any way my and his best friend end up talking alot and i was drunk and start crying about how much i love him but know he could be doing more than he is now and he wanted to keep talking to me about it saying hes been trying to motivate him for so long and im the only one really making a difference. and i start crying saying how much i love my bf and just dont know what to do if he doesnt start having any goals or ambition. 

any way, the friend was very understanding as he has been through the same convos with my bf about that subject. 

i told my bf the next day about the conversation and he didnt care at all honestly, he said that we know him the best and just want to help him , which is true.

i guess my anxiety about the whole thing is it wierd that  i had a conversation with his best friend about that, my boyfriend and i regularly hang out with him and i know him pretty well.
i also was scared someone at the bar might have got the wrong idea cause we were gone so long talking? 

my bf says im overthinking this as i know i am but i guess id like some reassurance that its not a big deal.",30Oct2018,1

7,"I guess some people are just meant to be alone. I usually don’t mind that because of past sexual trauma but I’m finally putting myself out there, with a man of all people. Not that I blame all men for one selfish assbutts choice or anything so yes please don’t comment “not all men are rapists” yes I know. The majority of men and women are not sexual predators.


Anyway sorry went on a tangent there but I finally put myself out there and we had set plans but now it’s changing and I have no idea what the fuck is happening. Should I just give up? Wait and see what happens? 


**Disclaimer:** We did hang out last night and then went to his friends house, I was the only girl and somehow didn’t have a panic attack like I usually do in those situations and I *do* feel protected around him but what if I’m just being oblivious? 

I’d get it if sudden plans came up but that’s what’s happening here. What did I do wrong? 

I do have BPD but because of medication and DBT I’ve been doing so much better. Less lows and highs. Only problem now really is dissociation but now I feel like I’m manipulating him and y’all by making this post and I also feel like I’m being manipulative by pointing it out it’s just this constant fear of manipulation. My doctor(s) told me I don’t show any signs of it but what if I am and I’m just that good? It’s so scary.


Okay so back to point am I in the wrong here? I made sacrifices to hang out and told him that there’s no pressure but e confirmed we’d be hanging out he we are. It’s like he’s a different person today than he was yesterday and the last time we hung out. 

Stupid fucking BPD and anxiety. I just don’t know what’s happening but I am damn sure I’m overreacting. If I had a super power that’d be it. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.


I do have screenshots but I won’t post them here. Not to be picky but if a woman can respond to see the texts that’d be great. I don’t mind men either actually so scratch that. An unbiased perspective might be best. 



**Disclaimer:**


I don’t usually freak out like this over boys, unless Stefan Salvatore counts.

But on a serious note please help me. I don’t want to lose a friend just because I’m an idjit. 



**To anyone reading this thank you so much. Even if you can’t offer any advice that’s okay. It’s just nice to talk to someone who knows what I’m going through. I hate that expression but it’s the best I could come up with. None of us deserve this.




Also if it couldn’t get any worse, I self harmed last night. Not too bad or anything and not because of him. Just an urge and it’s different for most urges people get. I can explain why I do it is anyone’s interested but I do not wish to trigger anyone.



So if you’re still around after all this nonsense; thank you for reading. I hope you all had a great and wonderful day. We all deserve it. Whether we believe it or not. Maybe not today but some day. I can feel it.

Shouldn't it be Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder? And then, there was a picture right next to it of an array of objects with one object out of place. The typical misconceptions...

13,"My life isn’t great but it could be worse. I don’t really have time for fun things, mostly just reddit while I’m walking between classes, other than that it’s school, a sport, homework, housework, and work-work. Not like I’m in a bad situation though so I really shouldn’t complain, the worst is honestly going to an overly competitive school.

This weekend (like most weekends) I did nothing but homework, and I had to stay up late yesterday to finish. I have to stay up late again today. I had a lot of stressful stuff for classes and an unusually difficult practice, but that’s par for the course even on four hours of sleep.

Still, this whole day I’ve been absolutely ENRAGED. Someone bumped into me in the hallway and I ignored them. A few seconds later my friend shoved me a bit and she said that when I turned to her I had this look of rage for less than a second before i went back to my usual deadpan. With the timeframe she described, I went back to my normal face before I’d even seen her. Even now, hours later, I’m SO angry and I can’t explain why. I want to destroy something or fight someone. I even got into an argument over idealogical disagreements during my only relaxing class (I have some opinions that are very unpopular in my area). One of the girls at my table noticed that I was arguing with emotion instead of my usual parade of logic and hugged me and I just started crying. The thing is, nothing beyond the usual is wrong, so I just don’t get why I seem to be falling apart. I can’t work, i can’t focus, I can’t do anything. I just can’t understand why I’m so angry when nothing is wrong.

14,"People always wanna hear about what's going on and then you tell them and (IME) they either act sympathetic for 10 minutes then forget you ever said anything when you're showing signs of struggle again or they just start talking about the one time they were depressed and use it to vent about their problems.

Don't fucking ask me to talk about something I have a hard time and don't enjoy talking about in the first place if you're just gonna make it about yourself. Every time someone convinces me to open up I regret it almost immediately. 

I have never once felt better after someone convinced me to open up to them. I think it's because the friends I do have that actually care don't ask me to open up cause they don't feel the need to prove to me that they care they know that I know that they're there for me if I need anything. And the people who don't actually care or just wanna talk about themselves only ask to give off the impression they care.

15,"I feel helpless, really.

I work at a CBRF for the behaviorally challenged and mentally handicapped. I love my clients, all of them. Even the ones who have become violent with me. I’ve been almost beaten with a home phone twice in the year I’ve been there.

I’m not a nurse tho, just a daily in-home living assistant. I can pass out medications and help with showering and what not, but I’m not anything special. So I’m only paid $9.60 an hour, much less than my friends get who work at gas stations. 

For the last 2, maybe 3 months, I’ve been full time working swing shifts since we’ve been working at 5 employees instead of 6. I usually worked 7am-3pm, but they put me on night shift 3 times every paycheck. It’s a long and confusing situation, but basically, it’s been wearing me out slowly. 

I’ve recently started to have nervous breakdowns while working night shift. I remember preparing lunches for the following day and absolutely busting out into tears. It was at that moment I decided that I needed to quit my job. But I felt so guilty because that would drop yet another staff member from our team. The clients don’t deserve that. So I told myself to hold out until I’m at my absolute end.

Now, just this Saturday, my co worker informed me that she’s resigned. So we now have 4/6 staff members. And to top it off, our home is receiving a new client who is very challenging. She requires door alarms on her bedroom and she’s known to be violent.

I can’t sleep anymore, I dread going to work now. It’s all coming to a head. I CANT quit now. I can’t leave the clients with half the care they need. Dear god, I did the math, and with my co worker leaving, everyone else will have to work 70 hours a week to keep peace. I’m exhausted and absolutely burnt out.

It’s overdramatic, but I just want to disappear. I work night shift in an hour and I know I’m going to be stressed as all hell.

Little things like cleaning up one spot or going to a thing I was supposed to attend, or not picking up on social queues because my mind was wandering, seeming like I was not paying attention... Little things that add up quickly to the point of people just flat out hating me. I've annoyed and seriously cheesed off more roommates than I'd like to admit just because I forgot to do the dishes one time too many or something.

The latest mistake comes after *obsessively* checking the thing that needed checking (please don't ask for details) and *still missing it anyway* because... well... I just did!

Today I quit my job, via text. While I know that’s not the best way to go about quitting, that’s not what this is about. Within the text of why I was quitting I mentioned that I ‘shouldn’t have to be worried about responding to her (my boss) quick enough when I am not working and specifically when I am at therapy. ‘ I am not ashamed that I am going to therapy but that is my choice as to who I share that with and this all started to unfold right before my therapy apt this morning, while also getting texts from her during my appointment and me quitting shortly after the appointment. 
Fast forward to tonight. I get another text from her, of screenshots of our conversation and a not so great caption, that she accidentally sent to me and not to whoever she meant to send them to. I simply responded and said “hi you’re sending this to me. Thank you for sharing with everyone that I am going to therapy.” And of course she didn’t respond. For the record I expect a work place full of women to talk shit and gossip, and while I don’t agree with that I was fairly certain that would be happening. But you can talk shit without sharing I’m in therapy. 

I am just curious if for the future if this is some sort of violation of my privacy rights - her sharing with my now former co-workers that I’m going to therapy - or if this is just more of her showing her lack of consideration for other people’s situations. I have no intention of suing her or anything like that, if that was even a path I could pursue.

I guess first of all, I'm a 16 year old female, I've struggled with anxiety for my whole life, and depression/self-harm for the past half-year.

So, I talk to myself. A lot. Most of its in my head, but sometimes its out load. A few years ago, I was feeling lonely and bad with friends and altogether terrible. So I created a new identity and friends for her. Her name is Tala. She's like me, but a badass, and smart and perfect. Her friends, my friends are Allistaire, Callie, Liz and Scott. They all love us very much, and they both interacted with Tala and I. They treated us as the same person, even though I could tell the difference. It used to be that I could see them and interact with them. We would talk in my room and whatnot. We would go on adventures and hang out in my imagination.

 I always knew that they weren't exactly real, or at least in the real world but I wanted to believe in them so I did. It was a ""just because they're in your head doesn't mean their not real"" I didn't want to talk to anybody about them because I didn't want to lose them. Now I have friends and I think about them less and less, but the emotions in my head have become personified. Most of them take the form of the AI from the web series red vs blue. Theres one for rage/hatred, one for logic, one for trust, happiness, deceit etc. 

Sometimes the emotions take the form of them, and sometimes its just me talking to myself in the mirror. Sometimes there are arguments and It gets so loud that I scream, but without any sound because my mom is terrible with dealing with mental health (just ask my bipolar sister). She's the worst when it comes to self-harm because she always seems to blame me for it. I want to talk to my therapist about it, but I'm too nervous.

25,"TLDR: my fiancé is probably going for 6 years and I’m not sure how I plan on functioning without him


All my life I’ve never really been able to picture the future. I started having suicidal thoughts back in elementary and if never really went away. I couldn’t picture moving on to next major millstone (ie graduating high school and going to college) and some days I couldn’t even picture moving on a month from then. I tried to kill myself in high school, because I couldn’t imagine a world where I was alive. I went to college and discovered alcohol and that was a mess, I can’t even get 1 drink down with out throwing up now. I tried to kill myself on impulse by drinking myself to death. (I say on impulse because college was one of the first times I actually felt alive and happy but for whatever reason I thought that was wrong/not genuine). I think if I hadn’t of passed out on my side I probably would have succeeded and choked on my own vomit. 

I’m telling you this as a backdrop to my over arching concern. In college I met my fiancé, he was my ever concerned shadow. He was the reason, the morning a woke up after trying to drink myself to death I had an RA knocking on my door (I didn’t forgive him for days). I was his sidekick, I practically lived in his dorm room. I could picture leaving college when I was around him. It felt like for the first time I had a future, there was a light at the end of the tunnel. We didn’t start dating until the end of the first school year we met. Fast forward to our sophomore year. He gets arrested for pot and we get engaged shortly after. With everything that was piled on he’s looking at a minimum mandatory of 6 years. We were still keeping a positive light, we can move out to Colorado, get away from this all once it’s over. Live a life and salvage what was shattered, after all his Laywer was confident the 6 year min was just the state high balling it/a scare tactic. It’s almost a year into it now and today we talked to his lawyer. His lawyer think he’s not going to get rid of the 6 year minimum mandatory. 6 years in prison. I don’t know what to do, think, or how to move on. That’s 6 years of space that I need to fill. 6 years of imagining a future that I can get help from him with. 6 years. I could pop a child out now and it would be in school by the time he come out. 6 whole years. Sure there is the possibility of getting out early for good behavior but that possibility doesn’t happen until he’s 3 years in. I don’t know what to do, or how to process this. The family dog died when I was 18, we had her since I had 3. It was probably the hardest thing for me to lose. I didn’t say goodbye to her before she got put down. I cried the next for 30 minutes at most. I never told anyone from school, they found out through my sisters Facebook. It’s weird that I’m think about it now but that’s basically how I handle everything I ignore it, go about my life, and worry next. Not less than thirty minutes after that phone call with his lawyer we both go to work, we don’t talk about it, and I just keep reminding myself that work life is for work, home life is for home. Ironically as I write this post from work. A therapist once called me a walking contradiction. I hate therapist, but I think that one got me the most. Any thoughts or advice is welcome. I mostly just wanted somewhere to organize my thoughts. Thank you for your time. ",30Oct2018,1

I was told i have Aspergers syndrome when i was 14 but i was never taught what that meant or how to cope. I was given so many psychiatric drugs during my childhood i don't even remember it. As a young adult, now in college, i'm struggling so much. i haven't been in therapy or on medication for four years, and my family seems to think i'm better. But, i know i'm not. when i'm alone, sometimes i just sob for no reason, i stare of into space, i get stuck in mental loops of random delusions that don't make any sense. i fantasize about killing myself in really graphic ways. I don't drive, i don't have any friends close friends except my boyfriend. But, i'm doing good in school so i guess my family doesn't notice, or they just don't acknowledge it. I've been going back and forth for about a year now, trying to find a therapist and then deciding not too. My OCD has come back and i've been becoming a hypochondriac, and i have started developing chronic pain. my doctor wants me to start taking lexapro but i'm too scared because last time i tried taking an anti depressant i had terrible side effects.

* Every time he makes a *mistake* ( like stuttering in public speeches ), no matter how big or small, he panics and tries to mend it ( if he fails to mend it, he gets more anxious )
* If he doesn't know or is not skilled at something, he does it repeatedly until he deems himself good at it or else he'll stress about it for the rest of his days.
* He is insomniac, he wakes up in the middle of the night and starts fussing about what he has not done yet. These days, he can only sleep when he passes out rather than sleeping by choice.
* He's neat and organized but doesn't feel anxious when something is messy or dirty ( he simply cleans it because, well, it's in the way ).
* Whenever the phone rings ( even though it's not his parents ), he gets cold fingers.
* When talking, seeing or even the mention of his parents, he gets petrified.
* He doesn't isolate himself, he can still talk to people comfortably.
* He's always on edge and easily startled.
* He avoids thoughts of his parents and his upbringing. Doesn't talk much to his relatives as well because they are the ones who usually ask about it.
* Can't remember much about his childhood, only that it wasn't a nice experience.

I'm in therapy ( started 6 months ago) and am learning a lot about self care, taking care of oneself, and self discovery. I have mental illnesses and am finally doing what I need to do for my health, although truthfully I am finding it hard to deal with everything all at  once.  I'm working quite hard and feel myself grow as a person, but man, I'm surprised at how much work this is and how exhausting it is. Is anyone feeling/ has felt the initial stages of dealing with crap and figuring out this whole self care thing to be difficult and uncomfortable? Like it's stressful? My other question is has anyone had a point where they started to deeply question oneself and be confused about  their life and what they want? I'm a very self aware person and don't like to lie to myself about things so I'm finding these feelings to be...odd.

41,"I dont know if this is the right place to ask advice. This is my first post and it's a long one.

My older sister (34) has always suffered from schizophrenia and BPD. Constant blow outs and anger over nothing. Psychotic episodes. Paranoia etc. Last year she had a baby to an ex gang member. He attacked her and was put in prison. Fast forward to over a year later, she now has a second child to him as she got pregnant again before he was locked up. Social services are involved, I actually looked after the oldest with the help of my grandmother for two weeks after the dad was put away while they decided if she was fit to have him. After several meetings they decided yes. 

We try our best to stay involved too without alienating her or ourselves so we can keep an eye on things. My two nephews are absolute honeys and I love them very much. She cycles between coping and seeming like a great parent to lashing out again and causing worry in our family. I go from getting attached to them to freaking out and having to keep my distance because all of a sudden she will want nothing to do with us and then it repeats.

I saw her last night after a good month or so with her however she lost it at the end because I let her oldest eat with his hands and he was making a mess. Full screaming in front of him etc, that we dont understand what it's like and we don't care about her. She screamed until my grandma and I left and got in the car. Whatever I said made it worse, as usual. When I got home I was in tears for them. I hate leaving them there. We called her social worker etc and a few others but they are yet to give us a run down. I cant help but think I need to take drastic action and get them taken off of her. I know it would be unimaginably painful for her but they shouldn't have to grow up like this. On the one hand shes suffering from an illness and she can't help it. She can be so loving and on form. On the other it's just not fair for them to be exposed to that and gosh knows what when we aren't there.

54,"Knowledge is Power; ignorance is bliss. Know what a Psychopath is and stay away from them. These human predators (Alpha-predators) will destroy and cripple you in every way they think they can get away with. They dance on the razors edge of law without being cut themselves (commit crimes and not get caught). I am a victim of one such predator. I now know why sister-in-laws have such a bad rep! But! This One! Let's just say I'm glad she's an EX-sister-in-law now! But she has her Tentacles tight around my Brother for child support until 2035!!! Lets call my EX-sister-in-law, ZG for short.
ZG is Promiscuous.
ZG is a Malingerer, Plans not to Work for a living and lives a Parasitic Lifestyle.
ZG is Psychologically and Emotionally Manipulative.
ZG Does the Gambit of Drugs and Alcohol.
ZG Hurts, Hazes, Bullies and Intimidates, Abuses and Intentionally Cripples people Psychologically for FUN! She loves getting an intense fear reaction out of her victims. This leads to Trauma, maybe PTSD, but it gets her off!
ZG Has NO shame, guilt or remorse.
ZG has a Loose Moral Compass! No Conscience!
ZG is a Pathological Liar. (Social Chameleon) She Lies to HURT others, not just to exaggerate her own accomplishments and abilities (white lies)
ZG has the best poker face I've ever seen, she is cold emotionally and only feels anger. ""Blood Boiling,"" to use her words.
ZG is a Master Manipulator. (I.e. Crocodile Tears!)
ZG wants you to feel PITY for her because then she can metaphorically ""get away with murder"" easily! (i.e. exploit the gullible) She was ""raped!?"" NO! That's a lie that elicits Pity even though there's No Proof! and her MOM was completely unaware of this claim &amp; is still married to ZG's supposed ""Rapist?""-&gt; (Her Bread n Butter for Eliciting Pity = ""I was raped."") AND (She Calls Anyone Who's A Threat To Her Plans a Rapist without proof! And Dehumanizes the person and turns everyone against them with this go-to-label of hers) A double-edged sword. ""I was raped"" to elicit pity and ""rapist"" to dehumanize and vilify her exposers!
ZG is Charismatic and Charming before she shows you her TRUE COLORS (before she uses &amp; abuses you). (I remember thinking she would be a great magician or CEO or easily win a season of Survivor)
ZG is Impulsive. Makes bad decisions like leaving a trail of burned bridges at jobs and relationships.
ZG is Grandiose. She likes purple, the ""color of royalty,"" &amp; thinks she's a ""queen"" or ""diva."" Hurricane Zuley""
ZG has Consistent Irresponsibility: Scapegoats, Blames and Shames everyone around her (Divide and Conquer) without assigning any blame to herself! Even if she did something UnEthical and Immoral.
ZG believes in ""looking good,"" without actually being good: NO INTEGRITY!!!
ZG is a High Self Monitor. Lies Extremely Effectively!
ZG studies Psychology and Sociology to this day. This is The reason why she knows how to LIE So Convincingly, Seduce Men (including my Brother) and Manipulate Everyone So Well (even Psychologists and Judges) is because she studied Psych and Soc.
ZG Gaslights, Stockholm Syndromes and Learned Helplessnesses people who threaten her plans.
ZG only wants power. To get the last word. To hang up first. To have a set of keys. She was (still is and always will be) married to money, not ever my brother. To be in the know. To align with people who have legit power. To have the top tier title. To have friends in gangs and an ex-marine brother (threat of power over life). To have judicial power (her mother works in a courthouse and knows the ins-and-outs of law and how she can break it and manipulate the situation).
ZG  her Social Role as single mother to elicit pity, along with many other social roles to manipulate people. Sociology!
ZG uses her daughter as a paycheck and ""a baby shield,"" against criticism.
ZG Pulls Psychological Fast Ones.


A Recipe for This Type of Psychological Manipulation goes as follows;
1) ZG creates ""Evidence,"" by scapegoating other people to admit to certain innocent, at first sight, premises that she later uses as ammunition against the scapegoat (i.e. it was your idea for me to get married for child support with your son). When in actuality, ZG uses the Power Of Suggestion and Psychology to get the potential scapegoat victim to agree and admit verbally, publicly and on record, to something seemingly innocuous at first, a premise initially being ZG's idea and part of her plan, and later the scapegoated victim recieves the blame for ZG's Psychological Manipulation and Suggestion. According to plan! (i.e. leading the horse to water)(doesn't bloody her own hands) She twists your words (Ammunition) and uses them against you.
2) She relies on the Element of Surprise. If you've got her ticket, know what she's trying to do and threaten her plans, she will cripple you Psychologically with what she knows about the Science of Psychology &amp; Sociology! She seems innocent and good at first, but she is a dark heart that spreads dis-ease wherever she goes. She trusts no one and her life is one big chess game over resources. She relocates when she's: lost the Element Of Surprise, has Psychologically Crippled the Heroes trying to stop her &amp; has made too many enemies (and/or once she's done using and abusing those around her).
3) Kind of like in Hypnosis and Magic, ZG keeps talking constantly when she is trying to hoodwink you, take advantage of you and persuade you towards making her goals happened (you giving her your resources: time, energy and money). She is constantly trying to make you feel comfortable and relaxed as she skins you. She is constantly talking, redirecting and guiding your Train Of Thought and Attention towards chaos &amp; confusion and accomplishing her own selfish goals &amp; intentions and away from the bad that would happen, and that you'd immediately recognize, if you had time to think.
4) You've had no Time To Think! And then she pressures you to make a decision with this limited thought on the topic. She's Constantly Pushing Deadlines and is Controlling the Tempo of the Communication (But not when it's her time to make decisions. She takes her time then and attacks/intimidates/stares down anyone trying to urge her forward= Hypocrite &amp; Psychological Bully). She rushes you and makes you feel like you have to make a Choice, AND NOW!
5) Most of the time, in this situation, you don't know what to do next and you FREEZE! You feel threatened Psychologically by her aggressive psychological attack. You feel like a bad person (according to plan). You feel empathy, pity and bad for her (reinforced by Crocodile Tears) and you give her the benefit of the doubt and are letting her get away with trespasses you wouldn't let slip with a person who wasn't ""raped?"". You still trust her to a certain degree. You don't suspect she's up to no good. As of yet, you're still under her spell. She's pushing her own selfish &amp; evil agenda and ""you've already incriminated yourself."" (she scapegoated you in step 1)(THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS HAPPENING IN YOUR MIND SIMULTANEOUSLY. YOU FEEL BACKED INTO A CORNER, ATTACKED, LIKE A BAD PERSON AND DESPERATE. YOUR ATTENTION IS BEING PULLED 100 DIFFERENT WAYS. CONFUSION, CHAOS AND CLOUDED MIND REIGNS. YOU'RE NOT GIVEN TIME TO THINK CLEARLY. AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE A GOOD DECISION?) You FREEZE (and don't speak or respond) while she's pushing this agenda and she continues talking &amp; moving forward as if you've accepted her plans by your omission of objection. ""Exactly...see what I mean? You don't have a good answer!"" = ZG. Acceptance by Omission!!!
6) When your Gut Instinct tells you something's wrong and you Confront her she says that ""she doesn't need to explain herself; you're interrogating her and being tyrannical; she doesn't have to put up with this; you're bullying, hazing, harassing and threatening her (again augmented with Crocodile Tears); you're intimidating her; she forgot and doesn't recall; She doesn't understand or know what you mean; etc..."" She will keep talking and give the Victim no room to Interject! Basically she will try her best to discourage you from closely inspecting her ""evidence,"" and intentions. Because this is the only way of rooting her out. Let there be Truth! Closely Inspect the actions and claims of a Psychopath. She'll keep the focus off of herself, attack you psychologically, keep putting the spotlight on you as much as possible and stay low key as well.
7) Be the Hero and try to stop her (Threaten Her Plans) and she will pull out all the stops to Cripple You Psychologically. She will Dehumanize you and put a wedge between (""Divide and Conquer"") yourself and those you love &amp; see you as a good person.
Psychopaths Relish Labeling You As A Bad Person (Social Role) In Society.
Psychopaths have the power to destroy lives. Recognize them and keep a wide berth away from them. Something I wish I did in hindsight! Oh if there were Time Machines...I would have cut out the Cancer (Psychopath = ZG) in my life early on! Or at least minimized her damage! THE WORST MISTAKE YOU CAN MAKE!, and It's the same with ""Vampires"", (not literally) is to invite a Psychopath to cross the threshold of your front door and into your life!!!

55,"I'm hoping this is the right place to turn to. Back in March, I was in a multiple vehicle crash (rear ended and pushed into the car in front of mine). Managed to walk away with just whiplash thankfully.

The reason I'm reaching out is because since then I've been terrified of driving. It's slowly gotten better with time but I still avoid highways and take whatever back roads I can. It takes me longer to get to work. I never see certain people because I just don't want to deal with the stress from driving.For me it felt manageable, just drive when I have to. Get to work. Go get groceries. Stay home when it's not a necessity. 

Unfortunately, it's beginning to put a massive strain on my relationship. My fiance tries to understand but it's starting to stress him out too. I used to love road trips or just driving around with him. Now, I cringe when he mentions a surprise trip to the beach on a weekend because I don't want to be in a vehicle for so long. I jump at the slightest things. I see brake lights in the distance and tense up, urging him to slow down while gripping at the seat belt.

56,"Hi, I posted earlier asking about how to deal with Anxiety, and symptoms of PTSD.
There is a new problem, I think I may have developed depression as well. Constant apathy at times, complete disinterest in regular life, some days I’m apathetic but I’m constantly on the verge of tears. Paired with my constant anxiety, this is not good I think.
Another thing I discovered recently is that, aside from nicotine, alcohol helps calm my anxiety and slows my mind down to only a few thoughts and sometimes just one if I’m lucky.
The counseling does not seem to be helping out and I may have to go to a psychiatrist soon. It doesn’t help that my girlfriend of 6 months told me to not bother her this week, we will have a discussion later this week, and that shit has hit the fan.
Naturally, this just set my mind off like the public transportation in New York City. A hundred different directions taking by a hundred different thoughts. I’m now terrified for the end of the week, which will have me at Fort Jackson doing Rifle qualifications.
I don’t think I should handle a rifle right now, and am pretty sure that there is a need to talk to my counselor before we leave for the FTX.

Time from time I visit family \[Well mother and her BF and my sister\] but i can feel theyre fed up with me. I simply dont know what to do.. I feel like a total human failure unable to take care of itself.Everyday is worse and worse but i dont know what to do with it everything is just too much draining and or meaningless...   


Any tips..?

58,"My Doctor diagnosed me with an obsessive and anxiety, he originally tired to put me on Prozac for the anxiety and the panic attacks but I told him that I was scared I was going it gain weight. I know its kind of a dumb reason to not want to be on medication but its something that I actually worry about alot which he said is a form of my obsessive anxiety so then he suggested that I try Topamax which is originally for people epilepsy but it would help with the obsessive form of my anxiety and would work as a mood stabilizer I would also lose weight from taking it instead of gaining weight. but I'm also scared that being on medication would change who I am and wouldn't do anything but just kind of mask the problem and that I would rather learn to work through it and deal with the anxiety. But a part of me thinks I should try one of the two medications becuase my anxiety just destroy me somedays, it's hard for me to stop the obsessive thoughts that makes me worry so much I feel sick, or to wake up in the morning to go to work. But I just can't bring myself to actually take my prescription. 


Has anyone been on either of these? 
I would just like to know your experience with the medication and the side effects.

I went to counseling on campus but they have a waitlist and I'm going back to see their case worker to look into off campus counseling, so at least another 2 weeks to receive any actual help. I feel like it's taking too long, and I'm getting worse every day.

 I'm trying to push through but I can hardly focus on my school work anymore. I want to go to an in patient facility but I have clinical every week and have no weeks off until the semester is over (December) but I can't wait that long. I just don't know what to do anymore, I was even considering going home next semester and just taking classes online, but I need help now. 

I had intentions to ask a question but I don't know what to ask anymore. I hate feeling like this, I'm always feeling anxious, or depressed, I hardly eat, I miss classes.

61,"I visit a psychiatrist monthly.

I'm currently taking 15mg aripiprazole (for the disorder) and 25mg quetiapine (for sleep during benzodiazepine withdrawal).

I'm also very slowly withdrawing from 2.5mg lorazepam, and I'm on 3/4 of it now. I haven't felt any of the withdrawal symptoms in the past week. But I remember feeling the dizziness even before this withdrawal.

But, before withdrawing from bromazepam 6mg (3mg twice daily), I remember not having dizziness.

My psychiatrist strongly feels I shouldn't take benzodiazepines, and I agree with him. It's why I'm withdrawing.

The dizziness is usually caused by either drinking sweet drinks, such as tea, or by walking around my room, which I do incessantly. I used to take risperidone, which ruined my sugar metabolism, but thankfully my GP says I'm not diabetic yet, and my blood tests are clean.

It's completely debilitating. Most of the time, I can't take a shower before taking lorazepam, but it's fine after taking it (even the new, lowered dosage gives the same relief).

I'm very hopeful that after withdrawing from benzodiazepines completely I'll be okay again.

Meanwhile, maybe there's someone here who knows what this could be and how to cope with it properly?

64,"I'm here on a potential throwaway. I'm also on mobile. 

Hi, friends.

I have been learning how to manage my ~~poorly functioning meat suit~~ mental illness for a couple of years now. It was hard going  until however long it was ago that I started taking generic Wellbutrin. Thanks for that one, Medicaid. (Shout out to Ashland county for providing accessable mental health care!) A year ago I almost committed myself, two years ago I was such a trembling leaf I was afraid to start the vacuum in my first by-myself apartment. Somewhere in there I got a divorce, and I can't remember three years ago very well at all. I don't know what relevance my memory has to any of this, I'm just going to say all of it and try not to backspace a whole lot. With any luck I'll have an authentic Reddit Miracle™ and I'll find the meaning of life in the comments. Or not, whatever. No pressure, guys. 

I need to quit smoking weed is the moral to this next bit.

When I'm sober, I feel like I'm making good choices. I feel like I'm doing things the right way. And then I smoke and the curtain falls and it turns out I was actually being rash and emotional and if I had just waited to do anything at all until like tomorrow or something I would have made better choices. I also think that people who usually show me kindness are actually not kind, or they're agitated by me, or a wrong action from me toward them might result in friction I don't deal well with. I smoked a bit ago and started mulling over last night and here I am, still a little high, still pretty overwhelmed with anxiety but whatever, this might be a throwaway and I gotta do something because what I'm doing isn't working and this is worth a try.


I don't want to throw a wall of text at you about the way my night at work went. I just want to convey the beats here because I think this is a pretty good example of the kind of shit my mind is putting me through. 


I normally have my emotions in check. I can handle constructive conflict now. I can be brave and say what needs saying - with greater and lesser degrees of success. Sometimes I still clam up, and then other times I'm surprised about how painless it was. Sometimes I can't say anything. My mind turns and turns and I want to say something but nothing is right and every word is a risk too great to donk up. It feels like everything is at stake, all of the time. To handle that feeling, I don't say much when there's friction. Like tonight. I work with someone who I want to leave me alone. That's the best I can say it. This person's actions nearly messed with my job. She's nice enough, I just don't owe her a friendship and I want her to leave me alone. I haven't been unkind to her, but I also haven't spoken to her. 

Conflict really screws with me. I was originally really peeved with her, just after the thing happened. I said hello to her when she said hello, but my tone was not welcoming, just flat. I have to see her at the time clock and one other time for literal seconds unless work requires her to communicate with me via-radio. I have always been amicable over the radio, but not familiar anymore. I sent every ""leave me alone"" vibe I could her way at full strength. I haven't stopped to talk to her since the thing that happened. I just recognized too many red flags about her fecklessness and I decided that I like my work, I'll just be more productive and she can just leave me alone. 

Tonight, she did a thing that really made me angry. I reacted the way I did with one thing at the front of my head: I need to handle this by minimizing any possibility of future problems by being frank. I don't know why I haven't managed to control my temper. I was seething with anger. She made eye contact with me and I stared her down. It's a fucking accomplishment that I've been managing to make eye contact with the nice guy at the gas station, and I made direct eye contact with her until she looked away and if I was a cartoon my nostrils would have been steaming. 

I talked to my boyfriend about it. He asked me questions that made me feel a bit defensive. I already know how I need to change what I did there. I need to focus on what's practical rather than why I'm right to be angry. I should have talked about how unimportant that woman really is because the problem is that I can't handle my temper and this lady has been pushing me to engage her since day one. She asked me to do something for her once and I said yes I would so she would leave me alone, but my tone was flat and I was stuck getting my things put away to be picked up at shift change. As soon as I offloaded I walked away. I said goodbye flatly when she did. I didn't do the thing she asked me to do (it was inconsequential) and I continued not to be familiar or anything but flat and fleeting. Tonight she did something just to be contrary because I spoke to someone at shift change normally but rebuffed this dang woman again. I think after that she got it. 

She did something to be contrary tonight (you're just going to have to trust me cause I'm not explaining the minutia of my life against anyone, okay?) and it undid a lot of work that I had done. I wouldn't have said anything, but she had just confronted me at a pinch point on my route to do the one thing I need to be near her for with a clipboard I forgot to fill out at shift change. Nobody remembers that clip board all the time. Most nights I do and I remind people to use it when they haven't been because it really should be used, but the way she said what she did to me made me really angry. Her flippant tone bothered me. I said something to her, just stated a fact about what she had done, and I didn't listen for her reply. She said something, but it's like there's blood pounding in my head and clouding up my eardrums. Is that a thing? To stop hearing words when you're angry? 

Anyway, I knew that my temper was irrational. I knew that she didn't deserve all of this anger. But it was there, and I thought it would be late enough that my boss wouldn't get a work email. I don't think she uses her phone to handle work emails. She has a laptop that she uses all the time, so I figured if she was in bed I wouldn't bother her. But now I'm worried that I woke her up with a notification on her phone and kept her up with my emotional upheaval. She's a very kind person who I think genuinely appreciates the work I do and who I am as a person. We got to know each other as friends very well before she got that well deserved promotion and now I hardly see her. I saw her recently and I was thrilled to see her, and she was happy to see me. She said she would have to stay late again some time and see me again. By all appearances, I think we're good friends. But I also have this paranoid worry that I'm actually on her nerves or bothering her. I imagine her at home singing because here's a long email (even though she told me she loved to get my ""50 emails a night"" since something had broken and I needed to be in communication with her about the operations on my shift that night when I apologized for sending so many. That kind of worry really effects me, especially when I get sporadic positive feedback from her nowadays. 

The first email I told her about the thing she had done and explained to her that it was part of the things we had been discussing the night before through email so she had context and what this woman had done. I got a little wordy. My manager told me that she appreciated the work I had done. She isn't as articulate as I am. She's a bit older so her relationship to technology is different. I write like I talk. She sends a couple of sentences but she talks like I write, like I do. It makes me second guess myself to read it over again. I might need to remove the goddamn email application from my phone. I think taking that home with me just creates a new drain on my peace of mind. 

The second email I explained that I knew my temper was irrational and that I knew this lady didn't deserve it, not really, but my way of handling it is by being quiet and this woman won't get out of my space. I told her I didn't want it to be a problem and that I just want to coexist peacefully. I just want to let that woman be another person I work with who I see in passing and that's it. I told my boss that my coworker needed to leave me alone. She agreed and said that it was important for me to feel comfortable and that it's okay to email her because that's what she's here for and she'll handle it. Just a few sentences, and it's really easy to tell myself stories about how negative my boss actually feels towards me. The anxiety sort of spirals.

I could have handled the continued passing incursions just fine, but she blocked me going through a doorway with the attitude she had and then I saw what she had done and that was it for me. But I bit off what I was saying halfway through a sentence and walked away because silence doesn't make mistakes and I can't afford to make mistakes. I need this job. I'm getting on better footing with my financial situation. I'm becoming stable for the first time in my adult life at 28. Go, me. 

I got out of the deepest and darkest part of my journey toward ~~whatever is at the end of this misadventure~~ a growing sense of safety and stability. I got there by learning about the way brain's and minds work together to create a personality. Understanding how memories can be rewritten by our brains to justify our actions and trick our minds into blustering confidence even though that person is wrong, wrong, wrong. 

If a bipedal hominid in a pinch did that, its brain might have saved its life. My brain doesn't know that my mind isn't ramping up the demand for cortisol (or however that exchange works) because my life or something important isn't in critical danger. My brain doesn't even know that most of what worries me isn't even real, it just does what it does. Minds are vastly different. Some are exceptional, some are narrow, some open, and so on. But a brain is a brain. 

Mine though, I dunno. I joked with an acquaintance about my medicine: this one keeps my heart from killing me (I have slightly elevated blood pressure all the damn time) and the other keeps me from killing me. Ha-ha, me too, he said. 

Someone told me that because sometimes I can scratch a random place on my body and feel sensation somewhere else, that's a sign of brain damage, but I only mention that because current talking points have made me think a lot about it in general. I also have a terrible memory. If I don't do things the same way every time, I lose things. Important things that just turn up somewhere silly weeks later. When I lose my debit card I just wait to find it again, whatever. I'll just take some cash out. It's around here. When I lose my keys I preempt complaints about my poor memory by reminding my boyfriend that I don't like it either. I should start following that up with: but sometimes it happens. Gentle self talk is important. I also don't remember most of my ... life? I would struggle to tell you, for example, what I was doing when I was 25. Where did I work? What didn't I drive? I have no idea. I deleted Facebook so all those horrendous reminders every day going back to when I was seventeen are gone forever (and for other reasons). I don't know what's normal. I don't ask. Can you remember things you did when you were young? I read a lot of books and watched a lot of television. Great parent, that television was. I'm just glad I didn't get raised by the internet. Would have been great to get raised by my mom but, I mean, who was?

Oh man, this is getting really long. I'll tell you now that I'm going to send this off, typos and all, without doing any editing. We can all understand the context clues I think. I'll edit the mistakes later, if this post lasts past the first ten minutes after I wake up. Sometimes when I wake up I regret what I did when I was high. I regret everything I ever did all the time though, so meh.

What's your assessment, doc? Am I doomed? 

But really, is it normal to deconstruct situations so completely? I go one way or the other: before, I was in tears about the worst case consequences after tonight. Now I feel silly because it'll be okay, I didn't do anything really wrong and all I'm doing is expressing myself. I'm developing my personality. I'm really hard on myself. I know where I need to be. I know what I need to do. But only in hindsight. I resent myself for making the same mistakes, and my brain pumps out the cortisol, keep making the same mistakes, feel bad, fo a bad job, feel worse, fuck it all up. Or at least I used to. Now I mostly just keep my mouth shut and wait. There will always be an opportunity to correct something again and I wait until the time is right to do it: when the outcome has a better chance of being favorable. 


I'm not cold and calculating. I'm really warm and open. I don't show up with defences. I'm friendly with people. I'll make small talk, listen to someone vent about some annoyance, commiserate about shared woes, whatever. Most people just want to be seen. Some don't though, and I give them their space, too. I'm pretty genuine. All I've got is honesty here. Lies are too hard to manage and they're not worth the effort, anyway. 

My diagnosis was PTS, and as a result of that, anxiety and depression. At my worst I used to have intrusive thoughts about killing myself. I still have a hard time with the urge to cut my skin when I'm angry with myself and I haven't done that in over a decade, but even that has gotten better. It was unsettling to realize that those specific thoughts come up when I forget to take my medication for a few days. I'm getting better at remembering, and my life is improving, but I still end up crying in a corner somewhere pretty often. 

Thanks for sticking it out till the end. ",30Oct2018,1
65,"I'm really just having one of **those** days. The kind of day where it really do be like that.

72,"She believes that because she doesn't have pronounced hips or a large rear end, she's ""not a woman"". Because she believes she's ""not a woman"", she believes that no one can, and no one will ever be attracted to her. This has caused her to irrationally resent and hate me, as she believes that I constantly lie about finding her attractive, because in her words, ""most men prefer curvier women"". She is very fixated on proving herself right by using objective thinking, like statistics, studies, numbers, etc. She's been on Reddit several times to discuss her body issues and they almost always end up with her disagreeing with everyone's input and arguing with them.

This has caused an excruciating amount of stress and pain for her. All she thinks about, day in and day out, are her body image issues. This has reached to such an extreme that she thinks about it the second she wakes up, and it ruins her day. She's grown to resent and hate ""ungrateful women"" so much that she's unable to watch most television/movies, go out in public, or even browse the web because she gets triggered by a majority of depictions of women. All of this has led up to a recent problem where her appetite is at an all-time low, and she barely eats. 

She just visited her GP and they told her that there's nothing they can do, and recommended she go to an inpatient psychiatric program. She has been in and out of hospitals for depression and according to her, they've done nothing. I don't know if they genuinely don't help, or if she's just refusing to listen or take advice. She's also had therapists and she's expressed that they've done absolutely nothing to help her. I tagged along with her to her therapist once and the therapist kept agreeing with everything I said, and my partner kept arguing and denying every single point we were trying to make. She has expressed multiple times how going to an inpatient psychiatric program would be the end of her life. She equates it with prison, and has expressed that she would likely kill herself rather than stay there. The last time she was in the hospital, it was for two days and she absolutely hated it.

Ive known I’m this way basically forever, but it was never really an issue because it wasn’t tangible.

I acted on my desires one time and then spent half an hour crying on the floor of my shower in shame and disgust at myself. I just don’t know what to do to be happy. It seems like if i don’t do anything with a man i will be lonely and unfulfilled, but if i do i will feel disgusted and shameful. Either way i lose. There is no way for me to be happy.

For starters, My mother and grandmother have both been diagnosed with OCD (my mother is much more severe though) and a form of eating disorder. My mother I believe to have some sort of mood problem, but I dunno. I was also diagnosed with OCD and anxiety, but I think something else is up.
First, my self image fluctuates constantly. I can feel great for a while, but then I can gradually feel worse and worse about myself until I'm just depressed for a while. Sometimes it suddenly fixes itself, sometimes it doesn't. Currently I feel pretty great about myself.
Second, I've got really bad paranoia. Like, terrified to talk to people sometimes or headache-inducing levels. Sometimes it gets to the point where I feel physical pressure as well.
In the past, I've been heavily self harming, which almost led to me accidentally killing myself. I'm clean now(6 months!), but sometimes the urges come on way too strong and it's hard to resist.
I was in an abusive relationship in the past and was really messed up by the things she did. I believe I have gotten past that now, but I still feel strong mixed feelings for her.
I am currently on 150mg of Zoloft, but it doesn't help the periods of feeling awful. Just helps the compulsions be more bearable.

Any ideas?",30Oct2018,1

Dear Sir/Madam:

We are a team of academic researchers interested in early detection of signs of depression. The main purpose of our project is to instigate the development of automatic methods that try to learn how to link word usage to psychological problems (e.g. depression, eating disorders, self harm, etc).

We really believe that this kind of ""text mining"" research might be valuable as a complement to more traditional screening strategies. As a matter of fact, there are multiple studies that show that depression is often undetected or detected at a late stage. We think that these low ratios of early detection could be improved. At least, we think it is worth to try.

To meet this aim, we need some data from individuals who were diagnosed with depression. If you were recently diagnosed with depression, we would greatly appreciate if you could fill the questionnaire attached. It is a standard inventory of questions related to depression and used by psychologists at the earliest stages of detection of symptoms of depression. Note that the questionnaire contains a field in which the respondent has to provide his/her Reddit username. This would help us to link word use (as extracted from your Reddit's public submissions) with the level of depression (as estimated from your answers to the questionnaire).

Of course, we will treat the information you provide with the utmost confidentiality and privacy. All information we will extract from Reddit will be anonymised and we will be the only one capable of connecting your username with your postings and your questionnaire. Such information will be kept in an encrypted file and will not be disclosed to anybody.

The information you will provide through the questionnaires will enable us to properly weight each and every symptoms to enable their best identification in what people writes.

We really thank you for your time and consideration, and we hope that our activities help to gain insights into the development of depression and how it affects those who suffer from it.

80,"Does anyone else go through manic episode, then weeks of depression? I’ve had anxiety attacks for 3 weeks straight except for 4 days of those weeks. I am sooo self conscious and I believe that everyone hates me and I want to disappear. It’s this insane irrational paranoia that’s wrecking my life lately. Although on my good days which happen very occasionally lately I can wake up ready to take on the world and then one second later I’m crying and want to kill or harm myself and I’m admitted to a mental health crisis center. But on my really good days I could take on the world, rob a bank, and become president of the US and feel untouchable. I’m on 400 mg of lamotrogine and take 2 20mg IR adderall pills, I normally don’t take the full dosage though unless I really need to focus. I’ve tried other mood stabilizers and god only knows how many antidepressants and they never work for more than a few weeks. Does anyone else have similar issues? ",30Oct2018,1

82," Hi friends, as an introduction I am a medical student going into psychiatry. I joined this group to share positive messages, encouragement, and to spread information that may be helpful to some of you. As a future mental care provider I would like to be active in not only in the physical offices but also on the web, where I may reach out to more people.

Today I would like to introduce you to a technique that may help people combat negative thoughts called **“thought challenging”.** 

Before we talk about that, it is important to define what **“cognitive distortions”** are. So what are they? They are irrational thoughts and beliefs that are false biased pattern of thinking about our situations or surroundings and have potential to cause psychological damage. We all have been subject to these thoughts, and depression makes them more likely to occur.

Here are some common ones, but obviously the list is not complete. Which ones of these can you relate to?

* **Magnification and minimization**: exaggerating or minimizing importance of events. Belief that one’s achievements are unimportant or that their mistakes are overly important. 
* **Catastrophizing**: Seeing only the worst possible outcomes of a situation.
* Over generalization: making broad interpretation from single or few events. “I felt awkward during that meeting. I am always so awkward”
* **Personalization**: belief that one is responsible for events outside of their own control. “my mom is always upset. She would be fine if I helped her more”
* **Mind reading**: Interpreting thoughts and beliefs or others without adequate evidence. “she would not go on the date with me. She probably thinks I’m ugly.”
*  **Fortune telling:** The expectation that situations will turn out badly without adequate evidence. “I will never find a relationship because I haven’t had a decent one so far”
* **Emotional reasoning**: Assumption that emotions reflect the way things really are. “I feel like a bad friend, so I must be a bad friend”
* **“Should” statements**: The belief that things should be a certain way. “I should always be friendly”

The first step in challenging these thoughts is to **identify** them. It may be helpful to keep a log of your thoughts to recognize your pattern. Then the next step is to challenge them, actively, and as consistently as possible when these thoughts occur. Put them to light, and to a trial.  Start asking these questions to challenge them:

* What’s the evidence behind this thought? Is it **opinion or fact**?
* What would I tell a friend if they told me they were having these thoughts?
* Is there other ways to look at this situation? An alternate explanation?
* How would I view this if I didn’t have depression?

You may be surprised how easily you can discredit your thoughts, and get greater control of your perspective on our day to day happenings. 

I would love to hear your opinion on this! Anyone have experience incorporating this exercise into your life? 

I wish that all of you have a wonderful day today!

83,"This is my first post ever. I created an account just to get some feed back. 

I’m 25 and an alcoholic and addict. About three years ago in treatment I got diagnosed with bi polar. It made sense to me when I read the symptoms. I relapsed multiple times but now I’ve been sober for a little over a year. I felt like my brain is some what under control now that I’m on meds for bi polar. This biggest part of my issue is anxiety i suffered with it my whole. I thought bi polar meds would completely fix it. So I’ve been seeing my same psychiatrist for 3 years and we’ve tried different things but it just got to the point where I was like my bi polar is under control, the rest is just who I am as a person. I saw my psychiatrist a week ago and I told her about things I was afraid to share. I get into deep deep thoughts and day dream. Probably once every ten minutes. And they’re not good day dreams. They are ones where I feel like I’m actually there. Things about my three year old daughter. And I’ve always been afraid of everything. Literally everything. Get bit by a spider, omg it’s poisonous. On a roller coaster, it’s going to crash etc. I thought that was just my personality of a hypochondriac. It’s even worse when I drive. I hate switching lanes on the interstate it takes me a long time to do so because even if I know it’s clear, I don’t know if I missed something and I would crash. I never ever ever ever get in a car with someone else. I ALWAYS drive. I haven’t ridden passenger seat with my wife in over three years. Well after I shared this with my doctor. She told me that I was OCD. and my interpretation of OCD was completely different. I thought it just meant counting things and hoarding and things like that. I didn’t know OCD was that detrimental to a persons mental health. So before she prescribed me anything for OCD, she told me to read about it. And omg is it spot on. Obsessive thoughts. Irrational fears and double checking everything. And I do weird ticks ALL the time. I just thought I had a mild case of Tourette’s. After she told me that I’m OCD I paid attention to every single move I make throughout the day. If I’m not clearing my throat for some reason, I’m blinking really hard. If I’m not doing that I’m cracking my knuckles. If I’m not doing that I’m applying pressure with my fingers on something. And it’s severely hurting my relationship with my wife because of actions I do with my OCD as well. It makes COMPLETE sense. So I’m honestly relieved I got diagnosed with OCD because now I can control it. Rather than just saying “oh it’s who I am. Just get used to living this way the rest of my life” most of my problems come from OCD rather than bi polar. 

With all of this being said, someone with OCD who is on medication for it. What is it like? What changes? Are you a different person? Anxiety better? No more obsessive thoughts? It’s been this way my whole life so I cannot imagine not feeling like that anymore. I want to feel normal. I want every detail about the meds you’re on. Because I see her in a week and I want an idea. 

Thank you!",30Oct2018,1
84,"First of all, I'm already seeing my doctor regularly and I'm set to see a therapist. This is mostly to check whether this sounds like it could be Pure-O OCD or something more serious.

&amp;#x200B;

Skip to the TL;DR if you don't want all the context.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I was about 8 I've been experiencing depression to different degrees, and for the last few years I've been experiencing extremely disturbed intrusive thoughts, feelings and urges, which may be a result of Pure-O OCD. I've coped so far by treating my depression with lifestyle changes and counselling as well as using meditation and mindfulness, but this year they've been getting a lot worse. In the last 6 weeks they've been getting so bad that it's hard for me to function normally.

What I find really disturbing is that, although I know how to deal with individual intrusive thoughts (by simply not reacting to them and letting them play out), all these thoughts seem to be collaborating on one point - getting me to kill myself. Earlier this year I was experiencing non-stop thoughts all day and night saying ""Kill yourself!"", ""Throw yourself in front of that bus!"", ""Slit your throat!"", etc.. These types of thoughts have died down a lot because I stop myself from reacting to them, so my brain must realize that it's just wasting energy by throwing them at me. However, they seem to be manifesting themselves in other intrusive thoughts. 

In the last 6 weeks I have had the weirdest experience of my life. My previous posts give more detail, but basically I thought I was transgender. Whether or not I am is another topic, but I realized I was definitely fixated on the idea. I let it play out, and it's died down a lot since then. But the problem is the moment my brain figures out I'm not reacting to the current fixation, it immediately jumps to something else. In the last 6 weeks I have fixated on the following:

 \- I'm transgender/non-binary and I have gender dysphoria, which means I'll have to transition

 \- Every time I'm near a sharp object I'm either gonna slit my wrists/throat, stab someone or cut off my genitals

 \- I'm not actually gay/androphilic/whatever and people will think I've been lying about that to everyone for years

 \- I'm losing my attraction to guys and I won't be able to build a relationship and fall in love with a guy in the future

 \- I have cancer (particularly brain cancer since that would explain why I'm so fucked in the head) and I only have months to live

 \- I have schizophrenia and I'm slowing going insane to the point where I won't be able to function

 \- My family members are going to die in the immediate future

 \- I'm a danger to other people and if I lose control I'm gonna end up hurting a someone, especially someone I love

 \- I'm gonna be falsely accused of touching/sexually violating someone and my life will be over (which is why I generally avoid getting close to people in public)

 \- I'm generally a monster and I'm evil at my core

&amp;#x200B;

What all of these fixations have in common is that when I let them play out in my head, they all end up leading to the idea I should kill myself. For example, when I experienced what I thought was (and still may be) gender dysphoria, I was having non-stop thoughts of ""My life is over, I want to die"", ""A huge number of trans people die of suicide so I probably will"", ""I should just end it all now."" There was even one night where I couldn't sleep because all these thoughts were there and I was genuinely considering suicide, but thankfully I didn't act on it.

Another example is the schizophrenia one. I've had periods where everything had an unreal quality to it (or sometimes hyperreal) and I felt like the only person in existence. During one of these periods recently, I kept having the thought that I was still asleep on the plane I had been on a few weeks ago and if I kill myself I would wake up. I thought this was a delusion, like in some forms of schizophrenia, because I could watch my mind believing it. But were those just other intrusive thoughts, and if I was able to watch the belief without actually thinking it was true, how could it be a belief?

In the moment I can get a little caught up with these thoughts, but after a while I see them more clearly. What concerns me is that even though I know they're intrusive thoughts, they're still there constantly and I always feel drained. It's getting to the point where it feels like the thoughts are ganging up on me to wear me down to the point where I will actually kill myself.

Is this usual for Pure-O OCD and depression, or are there other mental illness where the brain tries insidiously to get the person to kill themselves?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I've been experiencing non-stop intrusive thoughts about different things but when I let them play out they all lead to the idea that I should kill myself. Does this sound like Pure-O OCD or could it be something else?",30Oct2018,1
85,"Let’s look back around 60-70 years in our past and how the informed, qualified and wise treated mental-health. We cringe at those methods adopted many years ago, back then mental illness was much a very taboo subject.
Fast forward 60-70 years into our future and what would society view our society on how we treated mental illness, I’ve often thought of this.

My 2 cents would be that our future society would have cringed at how easy we associated labels to illnesses and utilised medications as a treatment source.

Would love to hear anybody’s else feedback on this scenario.

86,"It's been almost two years since my husband died from suicide.Although I have tried to put my life back together I am struggling with the guilt.I feel like I caused it to happen.I left him.I was so unhappy I was getting ready to live out in the woods with my dog.I had a job but not enough income to live by myself.I did not want to be home.I even tried to stay at work so I would not have to go home.Eventually I became too miserable and that's when I decided to leave.Before you ask: He was a good man.He never hurt or abused me at all.He was simply stuck in a rut himself.Did not want to do anything except what had to be done( work,eat,sleep) I tried to get him to talk to me and get him to tell me what was wrong but he insisted he was fine.Nothing I did made him open up to me.I often said that if living with me made him unhappy I would want him to tell me and move on because I do not want to make anyone miserable.He kept saying he did love me but I just felt like he did not mean it as much as he did when we first got together.I am the first person to admit that I am not easy to live with.I got some issues that make it hard at times.I try what I can to make them better but I still have bad days.I think I had overcome my depression for the most part but he would bring me down every time.I tried to have a positive outlook on life .I could not do that for him.He did not seem to want to.I felt like my presence was bothering him.Of course I 'll never know if this was the case.It's just a feeling I had.Anyway, I loved him as a person as a friend but I was not feeling ""in love"" with him anymore.I hate to say this.After a while I met someone I began feeling a crush for.I did not want to lie or deceive him so I told him upfront about it BEFORE anything went any further.He was understandably angry at me but in the same token he didn't exactly try to understand why either.""Why him and not me?"" Sorta questions you would expect from someone in his situation.Maybe he did not feel strongly in love with me either.I told him I wanted a separation. I stayed with this other person BUT nothing happened between us.He knew how I felt but we never kissed or had sex.

I got a barrage of hateful text and a day later I picked up my dog and found out he had sunk to a new low:He had kicked my dog and he was now limping.He was fine the last time I saw him so I knew he did it! I was furious and cussed him out, telling him he would get a large vet bill if my dog was not getting better in a few days.He never admitted or denied what he did to him either.At this point I knew this person was not the same man I fell in love with years ago. It showed me how much he changed and how hate filled he really was.He left me one more text that was not about me being a whore and when I went back to my trailer to pick up some documents and my ID I did not see the car and he knew we were coming.I called the cops because I did not want to trespass although this used to be my home.I went in when they did and found a note on the kitchen counter.I knew it was a suicide note.I was not allowed to read it and was made to leave the house.I told the cops about a place in the woods we used to hang out at because it was beautiful and they went to search for him.We were too late.I cried for days and I don't think anyone could ever hurt me this bad ever again in my life! Everyone blamed me and probably still do to this day.I feel like I did this and the guilt about it is killing me on the inside. I have never read the letter, my ( former crush) boyfriend has read it and told me the gist of it.He did not say it was my fault or caused by the breakup but in the same token it was his response to the breakup.It seemed to have been very planned because he knew I was coming by that day, he put the letter where I would see it and he knew I would go in the woods to search for him.I believe he intended for me to find him and kill myself because this image would be too horrible to be burned into my mind to live with.
I go through feeling angry at him, myself for leaving and back to feeling like I murdered someone and don't deserve to have a life because he is not able to have one now.Do you ever recover from feeling responsible? How do I live with myself?",30Oct2018,1

88,"It's been a rough weird year. With only two months left of 2018 it's really made me look back and think about how many life altering events have happened and how I've changed.In January I was inpatient for a week for suicidal ideations. I was then enrolled in a partial hospitalization program at the end of January. I was diagnosed Bipolar in February. In April my dad had a heart attack so bad he was in a coma. I had to take a break in PHP so I could drive to Nebraska from Mississippi to be with him. This was following an incident where I fell down the stairs and got a concussion as a result of med side effects that made me dizzy. I wasn't able to drive, I felt even more helpless because my husband had to drive the entire 18 hours to get there. After I returned from Nebraska I came out with my trauma that incurred before the military that resulted in an additional diagnosis of PTSD. I'll talk more about that in a later post.Through these stressors I ""graduated"" from 12 weeks of PHP. The summer was supposed to be a light at the end of a dark tunnel. Boy, was I wrong. I struggled to grasp the meaning of my diagnoses, how it was going to impact me as a future mother, a wife, and a person in the military. My whole life plan had to be rerouted.The fall at that point had the optimism of being a time for change, a time to start a new chapter as a strong bipolar woman. Yet again my plans were derailed. Life seemed to be downwards spiraling and here was nothing I could do. My meds caused me to gain 50 lbs this year, no matter how religious I was to dieting, my marriage was deeply affected, I had isolated myself from my friends, work was miserable. I just wanted to push the pause button.So October the 11th, I decided impulsively that I was going numb myself just for one night to escape reality. I had already increased my alcohol intake this year and was drinking nightly. But that night I decided to take two Klonopin to feel even better and relaxed. I was feeling pretty good so I took two more, then two more, then four more. All of a sudden I was falling out of consciousness.October the 12th I was admitted inpatient and referred to a drug and alcohol program on my Air Force base. I was guilty. Why would I do this to my family and expose myself, my deepest fears on display? Outing myself in a way to the military. Officially October was the worst of 2018.There are two more months and I'm ready to put this year behind me. I hope 2019 is the year I separate from the military, work on my marriage, travel. 2018 was intended to be ""my best year yet"", but things just happened. But I'm going to stay optimistic and hope for the best. Maybe this will be a year of self exploration, work on my book. But all I can really do is stay hopeful and just keep swimming.

I've come home 2 hours ago from our last session and she told me that she doesn't want to disregard the last diagnosis, but that I don't seem to be depressed, just very anxious, no meds, no nothing.

My first doctor was actually a gynecologist (the only person I could find at the time in my town) and she prescribed me an anxiety medication and sent me on my way. She tried, but she was unqualified for this. Her prescription helped for a while. My next doctor was after a mental breakdown. She basically let me choose what to take. We went with Zoloft- she told me where to start and from then on, it was up to me. Still not feeling well? You can up your dose if you would like. Still not feeling well? Maybe you should try lowering your dose, if you’d like. I saw a therapist during this time. She talked about her own anxiety struggles throughout most of our session. She was a nice lady. I think she was trying to show solidarity with me.. But I needed someone to hear me. I needed help. I tried to find another therapist.. I couldn’t. The only way for me to get therapy was to quit my job. I worked during their hours- what was I to do? My third doctor was after years of turmoil. Finally, finally I get to see a psychiatrist! Yippee, I will finally get the help I need. Yet when I arrive at my appointment, I am meeting with a darkened computer screen. I cannot see her face to face- sorry, bad connection. I can only hear her voice as I sit in a quiet room alone with several people listening in the waiting room 5 feet away through the paper thin walls.  Our appointment was at 11:30. I was supposed to see her for an hour. She finally met with me at 1:45, and I was ushered out of the room at 2:00 with no answers and the same prescriptions, except let’s add another one on there too, my 15 minutes of checking boxes on a list tells me exactly what I need to know. To make matters worse, no one even called in my prescription. When will anyone LISTEN? When will anyone CARE? And how..HOW can we expect this society to improve with this being our attitude toward mental health problems? When will the realization spread that mental illness is the same as a physical illness? We need help too, we need to be taken seriously too. I am afraid. I am scared. And I have no options. The worst part of all... I am only one in a million who feel this way. ",30Oct2018,1
100,"The day I feared is here. My life is completely broke down. I met and lost the love of my life this year. I sabotaged it, I was presented with a good thing and my fear responses, defense mechanisms and fight/flight told me it was a wrong thing. Fear and anxiety and depression have totally consumed me. All my illnesses have come full circle and now I have nothing but a body and broken dreams. I have tried all my life to fight it. Fight the doubt and the thoughts of inadequacy. But I knew this day would come. Heck actually it's this year. This year has been one bad news story after another. Now my days are getting worse. All my hopes of getting a good job are gone. I don't even feel like a qualified human anymore. I just spend my days in my house, paranoid.",30Oct2018,1
101,"My best friend and long term boyfriend of five years are severely depressed.  They have both been through some pretty traumatizing things throughout the last few years. Lately, both of their depressions has gotten worse. They have started to lash out and get very angry at me. Today, my friend got extremely upset that i was linking her mental health resources she could contact, (she was crying in the bathroom after being turned away from her university counselling for being too full that day) she said i was making her feel incompetent and when i explained otherwise she accused me of being defensive (??)   
It feels like their depression and anger are becoming too heavy for me to carry around. I am not exactly in the best state of mental health either and I feel as though their lashing out on me is creating so much anxiety and panic.  
I want to be there for them and help them out, but I do not want to be the punching bag anymore. I don't want to upset them either and I feel if i say something it will be turned around on me.   
What should i do? I feel helpless",30Oct2018,1
102,"I am constantly fighting over being handicapped by my mind. No matter what I do the darkness for finds me. 

In the last 5 years I have seen 5 therapists, 1 psychiatrist, been on 6 anti-depressants, 1 antipsychotic, taken mushrooms/lsd/dmt/4aco-dmt/ practiced several distracting hobbies, excerise, diet changes, any every other generic piece of advice. 

I have symptoms of schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, bipolar personality, borderline personality, narcissism, and others I’m forgetting. I have a fat ego too that I am always fighting to keep down. 

I dedicate most of my time to psychoanalyzing myself, going as far as creating a website to house my psyche and posting a variety of content and art on there. Last year I asked over 3000 questions on Quora in a 4 month timespan.

Anyways, I’m stuck. Idk what to do. I’ve exhausted all the options any human can possibly suggest. Do I go back to a psychiatrist? I’m pretty reluctant to take any more drugs both prescribed and recreationally. I really don’t think  the United States mental healthcare services can help me at all (Indiana btw). 

Yeah if you have any further questions for me I’ll be happy to answer. Thanks.",30Oct2018,1
103,"my psychiatrist diagnosed me with dysthymia a couple years ago, so i’m not trying to figure out exactly what mental illness I have. I was just wondering if rewatching the same book and tv show are a weird symptom of depression?? I try and start ones I haven’t read or seen but I always fall back to watching the same show on loop and reading the same book because nothing else feels right ",30Oct2018,1
104,"My goal was to tell my therapist that my thoughts of self harm and suicide were coming back, but I got the times switched and missed my appointment. I won't see her until next week. I know the Hotlines and chat lines and crisis Text Line, I have them all saved and I've been using them. One night I was up so late on the suicide Hotline that I slept through my morning class. 

The main thing that's got me stressed out and freaking out is school, I have a paper due, a group project where so far I'm the useless dead weight, a quiz and an exam all in the coming week. I keep getting so overwhelmed that I just break down, have pain attacks and dark thoughts rush into my brain. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to kill myself because I know that'd hurt other people, especially my dad and little sister. 

Sorry for the rambling post, I'm taking a break from studying and learned about this sub, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to post here. Thanks for reading.",30Oct2018,1

106,"I have been looking for 6 hrs to find any facility that can provide mental health counseling and no one can except one where I would need to pay $225 for an assessment and $175 per session. Btw I am also a veteran. I've tried my two community colleges, military one source, and several local facilities. I'm not suicidal so I don't want to take up the crisis line, but something is wrong.

 I can't remember anything, constantly on edge (idk what edge, just always on it), haven't had any feelings other than anger, hopelessness, or love for my baby son (that will never go away) in idk months or a year, no concept of time (idk the day of the week or what was for dinner yesterday as opposed to 3 days ago), constantly (if I'm not walking or at school I'm laying down on the ground or falling asleep in my chair trying to do homework), I haven't completed any homework in about a month, can't complete any task really. Idk what's wrong but something is wrong. I have my drive and motivation in me still but it's like it's in a bottle and I can't access it. My head is swimming and there's no constant stream of thought, just partial thoughts and if I think about it I get tired and can't think about it anymore (just happened, and just noticed).

 I just want to talk to someone. Idk how counseling works or if it'll help or why I would need to talk to someone to fix something like this but I'm out of options. Life is going on and I am stuck in suspended animation. I can't have this right now, I need to be normal like everyone else and get over this. ",30Oct2018,1

110,"I’ve been dealing with mental health problems for many years and recently I’ve plucked up the courage/realised i needed to get a therapist. However today when contacting a therapist and counsellor providing centre they told me the waiting list was 5 months. I do not know how long i can take my mental illnesses anymore because its getting worse and worse. Everyday i feel like im about to do something i might regret to myself and so I desperately need quick help. I’ve called suicide helplines but they are shit. My question is: does anyone know any counsellor/therapist providing centres in london that are under the NHS with short waiting lists? Preferably with 1 on 1 therapy sessions as many of these things i want to talk about are childhood trauma related and involving my mental illnesses (psychosis, depression and anxiety). However i am willing to do group therapy too if there is no other option 

Thank you anyone that responds",30Oct2018,1
