Something happened (a lot of negativity) to me and I actually feel more right brained, and more depressed, and suffering from existential angst.  I know it's not healthy for your world view to revolve around others, to be dependent on them for my happiness, but I really feel like certain brain circuits, the desire to connect, to care, have been shut off, and I'm stuck in this depressed state.",31Jan2018,2

3,"I've been reading through accounts of other people who have survived attempts and it's inspired me to share my own, hopefully it might help someone.

The basic backstory for it is that since the age of 13/14 I've wished to have not been born and for my life to be over.

Eventually I reached a point where everything was too much, and I mentally broke. I did an awful thing to alienate all the people who otherwise would have been hurt by it, my memory of that time is still broken and hazy, and I'm not sure I'll ever understand what was going through my head. I probably hurt them more than if I'd have just gone straight for the attempt but at the time I wasn't thinking properly.

I ended up stabbing myself in the neck, in an attempt to sever my carrotid artery.

After 30 seconds I realised I'd missed the spot and went for another attempt but I was already too weak to do anything else, so I spent the next 12 hours outside in the middle of the night, fading in and out.

When I woke up and the sun was up all I could think about was getting a drink, I remember a raindrop hitting my lips and it being the most euphoric sensation I've ever felt, eventually a guy walked by and I shouted asking for a drink and he ended up called an ambulance.

Turns out I was scarily close to death and by rights shouldn't have survived.

I was emotionally numb for a few days, angry that I'd failed, then after speaking to my family who hadn't been a part of my life for a long time, started to hate myself for trying.

I got help and spoke to professionals, ended up in a psychiatric unit and spent a month getting used to who I was now.

For the first time I can remember, I'm happy to be alive. I've been having dreams where someone is trying to kill me and the weird part is I like them because I desperately don't want to die and it's still a new feeling.

I'll never stop hating myself for the way I hurt and alienated the people who cared for me at the time, and I wish I'd have gotten help sooner, it's the single biggest regret I'll have for the rest of my life.

Depression is absolutely terrifying, and the help I've been given has undoubtedly changed my life for the better, don't be like me, get help before you end up hurting the people who care about you.

I'm not looking for kind words or anything like that by sharing this, I just hope that someone who reads this might get help and have a better life because of my own mistakes.",31Jan2018,51
4,"I hope all of this makes sense, apologies if it's a little bit of a read. 

I have been dating the love of my life for a little over ten months now. We're currently living together, and everything is going very well, except for one thing - my mental illness. 
I have been diagnosed clinically depressed for about five years now, this has been an issue that I've carried my entire life, it's not something that somebody can all of a sudden fix. Currently I am prescribed medication to help with thoughts, although I am not able to refill my prescription due to finances, which is making things go slowly downhill more than usual. 

The problem that is here, is that whenever I have ""one of those days"" or fall into a more depressive state; she gets frustrated (which I completely understand, it must be difficult to live with somebody who is damaged).
She gets frustrated when I don't tell her whats going on, but when I do tell her what I'm thinking and how I'm feeling, she always blames herself, and says something along the lines of ""I've tried so hard to help you and it's clearly not working, I just don't know what to do or how to help you"". I can't find the words to explain to her that a chemical imbalance is not something that can be very easily fixed, especially by one person. She just always, always blames herself. She will often get upset or frustrated at the fact I feel this way the majority of the time, and she'l get short or blunt with me, and sometimes leave the room all together., which makes me feel worse as I've dropped her mood. 

 I guess I'm just worried that shes going to get fed up, realise I'm too much effort and leave. The thought terrifies me. 

I just want to know a way of explaining to her how this mental illness works, so she doesn't constantly blame herself or get upset when I'm not in a good place. 

Apologies for such a long post, I didn't intend it to be this big. A huge thank you to everybody who read the whole thing, I hope you understand what I'm getting at.

Thank you again, it means everything./",31Jan2018,3

I will talk to my friend for hours about the various topics such as the politics of the systems, different fuel mixes and the sort and how the weather effects it.

6,"I remember wishing I didn't exist since the age of 6. It's a feeling I've never been able to shake. Besides my parents messy divorce when I was a kid, I've experienced minimal hardship in my life. For some reason, thinking about the past, in almost any context makes me depressed. It seems over my lifetime my brain has responded by making sure I'm not very good at remembering things. I forget things constantly: names, words, ideas, even entire vacations. I once forgot that I had taken a week long trip to Paris a year after going until my gf reminded me.


I've been very fortunate in life, had a very caring single mother who worked hard to make sure my siblings and I had every opportunity. I've taken advantage of those opportunities.  I'm under 30, single, in decent shape, perfect credit, net worth over 500k (from my own work) and no issues when it comes to dating. Through my work I've been able to solve complex problems and save lives.


The reason why this is relevant is because if someone had told me 10 years ago where I would be today, I would have though I'd be the happiest person in the world.


But this feeling of not wanting to exist persists. There's a part of me that wants to forget about everyone and everything and return to non-existence. I like guns for recreation, but I've never allowed myself to own one, because I'm concerned that in a moment of weakness I would not resist the temptation. 

My belief in the afterlife and the pain it would cause those around me are the two reasons why I've never attempted to take my own life, and probably never will.


I'm not sure there is any amount of success that could make this feeling go away. Has anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions on what I could do to enjoy this objectively amazing life that feels like a burden?

7,"Is there a diagnosed mental condition where someone can alter their perception of reality just by convincing them self something is true?  I’m watching the relationship of a close friend of mine deteriorate because his wife is absolutely certain he cheated.  For clarification he has never cheated on his wife.  She will name specific names of women she is certain he slept with.  She will tell stories of interactions with the women that never happened.  This is most evident because the story changed slightly from time to time when it was told.  It has basically turned into he has slept with pretty much every woman they mutually know.  To her, this is reality.  
   
If he challenges her and asks for proof or denies what she says then she gets extremely angry.  Yelling is very common.  She will put him down and call him a cheater and some pretty hurtful names even though none of that has happened.  Is there a name for this type of behavior or condition?  Where someone believes something so much that is their new reality.  Psychosis seems a little extreme.

12,"I was born with something called Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. Statistically, 1/6000 people have TSC, or put more simply, 0.016% of the population of the world. TSC can affect the brain, eyes, kidney, lungs and heart. My case affects my brain, giving me a brain tumor and epilepsy.

As TSC is a rare condition, it hasn’t been thoroughly studied. But what is known is the genes it mutates is TSC1 or TSC2 (depending on the case) however neither of these have shown the mutation in my brain in all my 14 years of scans post-diagnoses.

There is the off chance that because of the lack of information, the scan hasn’t been perfected, but I’ve been informed that it’s 85-90% accurate. The thought of being the first (or one of the first) to be diagnosed with TSC without either of my genes showing traces of it has made me think and wonder if some actions taken on me might be experimental.

16,"I have been going to a therapist weekly for almost 3 months now and I haven't really noticed improvement like I have hoped for. I'm 16 and I'm wondering what options there are for group therapy with others my age, I talked to my current therapist about this and she suggest a IOP (Intensive Outpatient Program) through a local psychiatric hospital.

I went in for the first evaluation and it felt all way to hospital-y if you kinda get what I'm saying. It didn't feel like what I was expecting in the interview but I am going to one of the meetings on thursday to try it out. 

My question basically is: is there such thing as group therapy like what you see in the movies. For example The Fault in our Stars had the group therapy scenes where they sit in a circle of chairs and talk about how they felt and what not. Is IOP exactly that or should I look for something else? I guess on thursday I will find out what it's like and I'll come back here and give an update. Thanks",31Jan2018,1
17,"I need help. I find myself constantly thinking about past events that I wish I could forget. Events that have happened years ago. I've tried to take steps like removing reminders of said events, writing down what went wrong, what I could have done different, and how to avoid it in the future. Then tearing my notes into shreds of paper and tossing them in the trash. I try to catch myself when they come to mind and tell myself to stop but it doesn't help. The bad thoughts overpower the fight and take over my mind for hours or worse......days. I've tried saying prayers even though I'm not religious, praying to deceased family members to not let a certain event haunt me and protect me from it but that's not working either. 


Just today someone associated with my past I'm trying to forget reached out. I had erased their number from my phone trying to erase them. Missed the call but like an idiot called back the number thinking it was someone else only to find out it was the someone I don't want to talk to or associate with anymore. When asked if I was still around I started lying saying not for long. That I was getting ready to relocate for a job half a country away. Now for the past 8 hours I've been going crazy asking myself why did I do that and worrying if I somehow run into them how I'm gonna respond when confronted with the lie. My crazy mind is now thinking I need to reach out to them in a couple weeks and say yeah plans fell thru to save face and then avoiding all future contact. In a metro area of maybe 4 million people I'm scared to death of running into 1 person. It already happened once a while back and nearly gave me a heart attack.


I have many regrets. Things that have happened to me. Things I've done to others. Things I wish I've never done. Things I wish I could correct. I've learned from mistakes made and would never do them again but I'm still haunted. I can't forgive myself and here I am thinking about going to church to confess for past wrongs looking for someone else to give me forgiveness and wipe things away. I don't wanna to be a liar. I don't want to lie ever again but here I go doing it again as a defense. I'm tired of feeling like I always have to look over my shoulder. These things are even starting to haunt me in my dreams.


I try to be a good person. I try to put others feelings above mine. Everyone close to me tells me I'm a good person but I don't agree. I think I'm a bad person due to past mistakes I can't get past.

18,"Hello Reddit. The first thing you need to know about me is I’m 13 years old and in seventh grade.  There are several things I need to address, so please, bear with me:

1) If you were to ask me where all my problems started I’d say third grade. I have no idea what eight year old me was thinking, but I started acting really prideful. I’ve kinda fixed that by now, so it doesn’t really worry me. What third grade me did that I hate the most was create drama. When I look back at my diary entries from back then all I see is me complaining about how my best friend has a crush on my crush, then the next day me saying I’ll let her have him so I don’t break our friendship, and then the next day I’m heartbroken because I think my bully likes him too. This continued for about another year or two, me pretending to have problems I didn’t have, until my problems kinda became real. Could this behavior have influenced how sucky my life is right now? 

2) As stated above, my life really sucks at the moment and I have no idea what to do. I probably sound like one of those angsty teenagers in sitcoms, but hear me out. In fifth grade my best friend went back to her home country for a year and I was left best-friend-less. The only problem was that besides her I wasn’t really close with the other girls. I befriended this Japanese girl who I still talk to and is still one of my besties, but that’s pretty much it. I’ve always had the bad habit of isolating myself from my classmates, but that year it got worse. I felt terrible and I had no idea why. In sixth grade my old best friend came back (let’s call her Claire) and my old best friend left. I thought things were gonna be better but they weren’t. First semester she started hanging out more with the cool kids and I was left behind. I did befriend a British girl who we’ll call Carol and an American girl we’ll call Jenna. All three of us really liked Harry Potter, so that’s what really brought us together. Second semester Claire become one of my best friends once more and this boy called Jacob arrived at our school. We were best friends for like two months until Jacob started hanging out with other kids. Sixth grade actually finished okay. Seventh grade is not okay. First semester Claire became best friends with this other Japanese girl and I felt kinda left out. Jenna, who I thought would not give up on me, started ignoring me and hanging out with her brother. Carol is actually still a great friend, just very oblivious. She started hanging out with Jacob and a girl we’ll call Nina. Nina is also a good friend of mine, but I’m not her best friend. Carol never noticed I’m very alone these days. All of these people remain my friends, but only *choose* to be with me when none of their other friends are around. The worst part? It’s probably my fault. I’m a terrible friend. I’m rude and a know-it-all and get far too excited about stupid things no one cares about and I can’t socialize and I’m annoying. Now that I’m stuck like this, with no one I can really rely on, I’m forced to carry the weight of life on my own, with absolutely no one I can count one. 

3) At this point, y’all are probably wondering what this has to do with mental health. Well, here’s the thing, ever since the start of seventh grade, my social abilities have dropped. I actually think I have social anxiety, but I haven’t been properly diagnosed. I can’t talk to strangers without stuttering so much you can’t understand what I’m saying, I can’t talk on the phone, I think about things way too much, and every day before theatre I feel like I’m gonna throw up. (That feeling usually fades away as soon as I remember how much I love my theatre family). I’m a shadow of my old confident self and I *hate* it. On top of that, I’ve been feeling sad and just generally down for months now. I can’t enjoy things anymore like I used to and on my worst days I’ll go to bed thinking about death. I wouldn’t really care except my mom sees me not smile after she bought me new shoes or whatever and she scolds me for being ungrateful. It makes me feel terrible. I do suspect I have depression, but once again, I haven’t been properly diagnosed and I might be overreacting (I do that a lot). My parents already know about my socializing troubles and I’m seeing a therapist, but I feel like I can’t be completely honest with her ‘cause she might report back to my parents and they believe a lot of the stigma. That kinda leads us to my next problem. 

4) My mom makes everything worse. Don’t get me wrong, I love her so much and she loves me even more, but she makes me feel like absolute crap. When I was younger she used to threaten to hammer me and my brother’s toes if we walked around the house barefoot, she threatened to slap our teeth off (her wording, not mine) if we apologized too often, she once threatened to wipe my spilled milkshake with my hair if I did it again, which absolutely terrified me since I’m fairly clumsy and I was already crying (did I mention I was eight?), and so many more incidents. I recall me and my brother once playing in the living room (I must’ve been nine, he was probably eleven) and my brother’s foot moved the curtain. My mom somehow heard that from the kitchen and came out. She saw my brother on the floor, saw me next to him (for some reason we really liked to play on the floor) saw my toy in his hand and thought I’d thrown it at him, so she threw a cup at me. It missed me, but I was still terrified. I don’t blame her, I used to have anger management issues, but it must’ve hurt me in order to remain in my memory after so long. She once yelled at me for throwing all over my uniform skirt (I was six and the previous day I’d stayed home from school because I was sick) and constantly yells at me and my brother for not doing things right or not knowing things we should know. It sucks since she never taught us this stuff, and honestly, I’m not that smart. When we were younger she called us stupid, daft, slow, and “maco” (I’m fairly certain it’s slang from Colombia. The way she uses it it means someone that’s big and dumb and that can’t figure things out). She still calls us those things, but when me and my brother say they’re hurtful, she says she’s just joking. They still hurt. I distinctly remember when I was younger (maybe 8-10?) my mom read an article on Facebook about toxic parenting and told us that if she ever was like this, we should tell her. Last year my brother told her how she was hurting him with her words and both she and my dad started telling him how he wasn’t the victim here. They started talking about him having to man up and practically yelled at him for hours. I’m pretty certain he started having an anxiety attack and then my mom called him weak for that. I locked my myself in my room and turned up my music to try to drown out the sound of their screaming while wishing I was brave enough to be there with my brother, telling them he’s right. I want to tell my parents I’m so sad most of the time, but I’m terrified of how they’ll react. My dad isn’t that bad, but he backs up my mom when my brother stands up to them, and believes the stigma about mental illness. If I tell them they’ll tell me to try harder, or my mom will say it’s my fault. She constantly says how I need to be fixed and how I’m messed up and will need a therapist for the rest of my life because I’m not trying hard enough. I’m fairly certain that, and half the other things she says to me on a daily basis are emotionally abusive. I know I’m probably exaggerating, but I feel like I can’t even trust my parents. 

5) I wanna die. Those three words have been coursing through my mind day and night for the last few weeks. I feel terrible, because a mere *kid* my age shouldn’t feel like this, but I do. It all seems so hopeless. I thought it’d get better with time. I told myself it wouldn’t even last six months, but I’ve been keeping tally and it’s been six months and a little bit more. And those months have only been the worst ones. I’ve been feeling afraid and lonely for about a year now. Reddit, I ask you, what do I do?

TL;DR I might have depression and might have social anxiety. I don’t have any friends to fall back on. I think my mom is emotionally abusive and my dad allows her to. I also might be slightly suicidal. Any advice?

21,"My ex was and still is very depressed and has suicidal thoughts. She harms herself. When we were together I had fully committed myself to keeping her happy at all times. Except it didn’t work. It didn't matter if I was wrong or she was she always seemed to turn a fight around to make me end up feeling sorry for her. While you may say this is manipulation I know that she genuinely has depression issues she needs to work out. I felt like I couldn’t take the chance of not taking her seriously. If she actually tried to end her life I would never be able to forgive myself.

After a while everything took a toll on me. I've had my own depression and anxiety issues for a while . I became someone who was constantly stressed out and scared to lose the person I loved. At times I wasn't happy and I felt guilty when I felt this. Selfish. It’s hard to be happy when you’re constantly with someone who is severely depressed. It’s impossible to live your own life when it becomes centered around keeping one person happy. My main priority wasn't making sure I was happy it was making sure she was. Making sure I'd sacrifice my own happiness if it meant she could still be here on this earth.

But I had finally come to the point where I realized that I needed to start focusing on myself. I had finally realized that my life could not revolve around making her happy because she had to work on getting help. Work on wanting to be happy for herself. We broke it off. I felt selfish for doing so but I knew it was the right thing to do.  I loved her and cared about her so much, but I knew it wasn't going to work. The most important thing I learned from this entire situationis it’s not your fault. If your boyfriend or girlfriend is severely depressed and wants to harm themselves it's not your fault. 

You can’t handle it on your own. I tried to take on her issues on my own and felt like I had failed when I couldn’t make her happy. The reality is they have to take the steps to make themselves happy. It's not your job to try and fix everything. Ultimately they have to want it for themselves. I still keep in touch with my ex and when she gets in a place I can't get her out of it still terrifies me but I've learned I can't fix everything. I can be there for her if she needs to talk and remind her her life is not worthless but she has to find her own happiness. I hope one day she will 

tl;dr: It's not your job to fix everything for someone no matter how much you love them. They have to want things to change and make that decision. Your happiness is just as important

25,"I’ve been diagnosed with both Aspergers and dysthymia (among a few other things), and there are a few new things I’ve learned about those two diagnoses today. Not a lot, but here is what I’ve learned:

1. The fact that I am rarely ever happy (a handful of times per year) is dysthymia. It may sound stupid, but I didn’t realize that. I thought it was the times when I felt sad. It’s also the days when I just feel hopeless and not happy (which is 99.99 percent of the year). It’s been this way for a few years now.

2. Apparently, I don’t have a lot of facial expressions. I really thought I was within what’s normal. Turns out I’m not. I pretty much have the same facial expression all the time, but I will smile and laugh every now and then.

So... not a lot of new information here, but I just felt like sharing it. I feel more confident that I have dysthymia now, and I can kind of see why I have been diagnosed with Aspergers. I still have a lot of unanswered questions. Really... that last one was a bit of a shock for me. I mean, I have facial expressions, but not a lot of!?!? Hah!",31Jan2018,12

30,"This does NOT happen with the things that I simply like. It only happens with the things that I become obsessed with. And it bothers me, because it fucks with my feelings and with my ability to get attached to things and people. For instance, I used to be really into a MMORPG a few years ago. I think I played it so much that I started to hate it and I moved on to other games. Then I met the first person that I fell in love with, and one year later I was asking myself what I saw in him that made me like him so much in the first place (I should mention that he is a great person, he is interesting, caring, sweet, and we never argued at all. I just fell out of love with him for no particular reason). I stopped talking to him because the relationship literally didn't mean anything to me anymore. Later, I fell in love with a band. This one was very STRONG, maybe even stronger than my first relationship. I loved this band and their music with such an intensity that they became my entire universe, and their music became the anthem of my life. Now, almost one year later, I literally can't enjoy ANY of their songs and I randomly started to hate them. Then it happened with a few hobbies like playing guitar or drawing. I was obsessed with both, until I randomly started to hate them and stopped. I'm thinking of selling my guitar.

&amp;nbsp;

After all these experiences, I am literally SCARED of trying new things, because I know that, at some point, I'll end up hating them. Again, it doesn't happen with the things that I simply like. I still have hobbies, music, games and people that I like and they're still a part of my life and have been for the past 8-10 years at least. However, I always end up hating everything that I once loved. What is this and why does it happen to me? Oh, forgot to mention that, after I stop being obsessed with a certain thing and I start to hate it, I will feel guilty for feeling that way towards it and I'll end up hating myself for the next 6-7 months for it. So I kinda switch between being obsessed with something to being obsessed with the sad realization that I have started to hate it and it drains me of all energy and positive emotions. I literally have no idea what it is, because I feel like this behaviour is NOT normal. Is this linked to any mental illness, in any way? I used to suffer from depression, but it's not so bad nowadays. I feel like I've improved mentally, but the obsession issue is still here. I know that people grow and change, but what bothers me is not necessarily that I lose the connection with the things that once meant something to me (even though this is a big issue too), what bothers me the most is that I actively hate these things now, and something always reminds me of them and makes me sad and extremely angry. So not only that I'm unable to relate to those things, but now I actively hate them which makes me feel miserable.

I also have inconsistent character, as I might be empathetic/caring one instant but an asshole the other. I get distracted way too often by unusual things, like reading Reddit, Quora, or Facebook. Other distractions include random Rubik's Cube solving urges, craving oddly specific food items, or just aesthetically organizing my stuff. I also seem to have erratic short term memory and forget stuff that popped up in my mind seconds ago (there are too many things in my brain at one time). The Ugly: I am toxic. While I explain subjects to people with patience at first, if they do not understand it at one go, I turn cocky as to their ineptitude. I also feel that I am turning painstakingly elitist, as I look down on people with scores lower than mine (I do not act on these thoughts, obviously. It feels like I maintain a facade of 'nice-ness'). Help me.",31Jan2018,1

35,"When I started my freshman year of college, I met a guy who would be my tutor for chemistry. I never really spoke to him outside of our sessions, and I developed a crush on him. For some reason I started feeling really shy around him anytime I saw him and ultimately had this like-hate relationship with him in my mind: on the one hand, he was someone who I could go to for help in chemistry, but what I hated about him was how intelligent and how charismatic he was to other people, especially females (I'm an openly gay male).

I'm now at a point where I've started picturing these scenarios in which I hurt him physically (I'd rather not describe these fantasies, but they're pretty graphic and involve a knife or a gun). Last night I dreamt that he was attacked by a group of people from my school and it was oddly satisfying. In the dream I vividly recall me seeing him being attacked and asking him if he needed me to help him get medical attention. In the dream I can remember feeling extremely devastated at how much pain he was in. I can't explain why I have mixed feelings of liking and hating toward him.

Second off 3 years ago my best friend/sort of little brother died in a plane crash, my parents divorced and some other bullcrap

Thought it might matter in this case

Okey so lets get to the topic,
When all these events happened i was only sad for about a week after and after that i was (kinda) back to normal not fully recovered ofcourse but just alright.
I think it’s kind of weird how the plane crash never affected me that heavily since my family was affected more while i was (except for my mother) the one closest to the family we lost. I see this as a good thing tho. But i find it weird how things like this are not heavily affecting me while i often get sad for no reason at all. I have good moods empty moods and sad moods. Im usually in a sad mood when im tired (and sometimes just randomly) and the empty mood just occurs some days and it stays this mood doesnt bother me. And happy mood is just rest of the time. Dont get me wrong in the sad mood im still laughing with friends its just that when im not, im sad. I am not depressed or anything like that im happy with my life but im just wondering if there’s something not working how its supposed to in my emotional system. Any advice?

I've been having some odd medical issues (muscle pains, joint aches, nausea, fatigue, unexpected weight loss) over the past month+.

Been to the doctor once (when the only symptom was back pains) and was diagnosed with stress trigger points. But the fact that more and more symptoms are coming up have me worried that the issue is really something systematic and that I have a life-threatening disease or that I have cancer.

I have another appointment to see a doctor in a few weeks but in the meantime I can't shake the feeling that I am dying and that I am going to go to that appointment and get diagnosed with bone cancer or a brain tumor.

It seems like the universe is foreshadowing my demise. Recent talks with coworkers/friends/family seem to inevitably arrive at a story of someone who has/had cancer. Even the media I consume (podcasts/online videos/tv shows) weirdly have coincidentally brought up life ending diseases in recent episodes. Even as I type this, the video I'm watching just brought up the fact that someone they knew just up and died out of nowhere due to cancer.

I'm walking around all day thinking I better get my affairs in order, and freaking out that come next month I might not even be here. Not sure if anyone can really help me with this, but I kind of needed to vent it all because it's really freaking me out.",31Jan2018,2

text:
Hi /r/sleep, I've had a couple occurrences of unsettling, yet extremely brief, hallucinations during class, followed by a momentary loss of consciousness, then picking my head up as it is falling. I realize everyone sleeps in class, but... I just can't tell if this is just normal sleep deprivation.

For a long time I've had trouble falling asleep, trouble with feeling tired during the day, not feeling sleepy or tired, and not feeling well rested after sleep. Normally, I go to bed to have 7-9 hours of sleep, but it takes me a long time to go to sleep. At night, I take melatonin, and that has been helping.

But a couple times a week now, especially during class, I have been feeling spells of extreme exhaustion. I will feel normal as I'm sitting down in my chair. I try to fight this exhaustion, and zero in on every word the professor is saying. It's not like I'm slowly being lulled to sleep, like how I would imagine falling asleep during class. Here is the most extreme example:

The professor will be talking and taking notes. ""Ok here's this equation, here's this fact, here's this..."" and after a few seconds, this is what I perceive: ""Here's llamas wearing beanies, there is a green field, all is peace and equality, so naturally the equation will be..."" and this feels perfectly logical to me, and I take avid notes, but I soon realize my head is very rapidly falling, jerking my whole body in one direction. I snap up, and look at my notes, and my handwriting just trails off where I thought I was writing. This is the most extreme example.

For other reasons this has been a time of high stress and fairly extreme emotional pain, but I've dealt with this problem a few times now over a few months. Should I talk to a doctor? Am I just not getting enough rest? This whole thing has been very frustrating. My Dad thinks I may be depressed, but I have the sneaking suspicion that I'm on the autistic spectrum, or have a combination of that with mild depression/anxiety and insomnia.

Unfortunately this is the first time ever for me having one of my low moods whilst in a relationship - I’m depressed most the time but at the moment I’m like an extra level of depressed. 
I don’t know how to handle it because I can see how this is hurting him and I’m getting frustrated because he’s not handling it well and says stupid stuff (I was having a break down a few nights ago and was texting him whilst crying and he says ‘I can’t handle this right now I’m stressed and tired’ - stuff like that) 

He’s never been with a person who has depression before either. 

He’s not handling the fact that I’ve no libido at all, and things such as cuddling are too much for me as well. I know this is down to the fact that I was assaulted early last year and I never dealt with it because I didn’t know how or if I could (also I don’t want my mum to know because she’s emotionally abusive so would use it against me)

I believe that he believes that he knows it’s not his fault but he’s been saying the odd stuff here and there and it’s made me feel guilty, I don’t think he does it on purpose because I do think he’s just a bit obtuse. 

I just want to know what to say to him. What are the magic words I could use to just fix things? I want him to know what depression is, I want him to think before he speaks and I want him to stop pressing for sex and even talking about it via text because that makes me anxious. 

I feel terrible because I feel like I’m dating an itch, or a clicking pen that won’t stop.

I was 16 at the time, and I was extremely hurt by this because she was the first girl I ever loved despite only dating her for 1 and a half months. I spent the first couple months of the breakup crying about it but hiding it from everyone I knew. It got worse when I found out she cheated on me two weeks before breaking up with me. I also had to go to work with her every day afterwards for 3 months straight until she quit, and I frequently see the guy she cheated on me with, even today.

I withdrew from friends and lost all of them and now all I have is my sisters. I can't make friends now because I am far too cynical and have a strong sense of disdain for everyone around me.

When I was dating her, I was a fairly charismatic motivated, and funny person. Now, I display no emotion, I can't be funny even if I tried. I can't express emotion to others whatsoever, I stutter and slur my words, I keep misspelling common words I used to know well and feel more stupid overall, despite the fact that I read more books now than I ever have. I get angry easily. I can't get to sleep at night. I have bags under my eyes and they're bloodshot.

This is where it gets bad.

I have constant suicidal thoughts. Sometimes, I'll think about my ex and think about killing myself in front of her, or just killing her. Sometimes it's the guy she cheated on me with. Sometimes it's their entire groups of friends. I don't actually feel compulsion to do it. I just have the thoughts. I'm also pretty apathetic in general, although I still care about human life (mostly) and don't want to hurt anybody.
