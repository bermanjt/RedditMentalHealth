0,"Bipolar

Yes, I’m bipolar… I take a pill to stop the extreme highs. I take a pill to stop the extreme lows. I take a pill to sleep and yes I take a pill for anxiety. I hate taking pills but I’m stable. 
Having bipolar disorder does not mean you are broken, it means you are strong and brave for battling your mind every single day. 
Some days, I feel everything at once. Other days I feel nothing at all. I don’t know what is worse. It is like drowning underneath the waves, or dying from thirst. It is both a blessing and a curse to feel everything so deeply. 
Having the motivation to change the world one moment, then not having the motivation to even wash my hands. One day I’m on top of the world the next I feel like I don’t deserve to be in it.
Not only does bipolar disorder rob me of my sanity, but it robbed me of my ability to see beyond the space it dictated me to look. I know longer could tell reality from fantasy and I walked in a world no longer my own.
Sometimes I don’t know if I’m actually happy or its just my mania talking. 
I’m not afraid of the dark, I’m more afraid of not being able to find the light again. 
I am good for a while, I’ll talk more, laugh more. Sleep and eat normally. But then something happens, like a switch turns off somewhere. And all I am left with is the darkness of my mind. 
At night, I cannot sleep. And in the morning, I cannot wake up. 
I know I have to be careful because there is something self-destructive within me. I knew who I was this morning, but I’ve changed a few times since then.

1,"And I don’t mean tired like, just slept a few hours the night before kind of tired. I mean I’m exhausted. Mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted. I got diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks about two years ago. I’m currently on 100mg of Zoloft daily, but I feel like they’re doing more harm than good. But the other medications I’ve tried did the same thing. 

I’m also angry. I would say I’m generally a good person. A little rough around the edges, sure. I have a temper and can be brutally honest, but a good person. I would drop anything for anyone I care about. So how is it fair that I was given the mind I have? A mind that constantly tells me how fat I am. How disgusting I am. How the meal I’m eating is only going to make my husband more disgusted with me. A mind that tells me I’m worthless, and everyone around me would be better off if I was gone. 

I’m tired of fighting with my own mind. At what point do I give up and let it win? 

I’ve never posted to reddit before, and I don’t even know if anyone will read this. But I’m hoping that writing it down will make me feel better. So far it’s not working. ",26Jul2018,7
2," (IM NOT USING THIS AS A DIAGNOSIS, NOR AM I SELF DIAGNOSING, IM JUST TRYING TO SEE WHAT IT *COULD* BE, I AM SEEING A PSYCHIATRIST WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO)

Hey all, heres some background on myself, im 16, i realize what i did was fucking dumb, and i wish i never tried LSD, but, whats done is done, i just want help now. After my LSD escapades, i found out my biological father was diagnosed with Schizo-affective Disorder when he was a 20-something year old. So that means that it was, more than likely, passed down to me.

So, after trying LSD + weed 3 times (LSD 4 times in total, but mixed with weed 3 times), the last time being on June 23rd, and, to be clear, im not tripping now, nor will i ever again, I've been having lasting issues for a month, all of the trips were pretty negative, in a sense that I was seeing manifestations of my fears of failure, but as a second reality, as if this is a dream, and that is reality, deep down, I know that this has to be reality, but it's getting confusing sometimes.

Every time I've done acid, it's like I would remember everything about that moment, like it's happened before, and I mean, not deja vu, like a full on memory, like, I remember seeing it during my 1st trip. Almost premonitions, as if I've already lived this life before, and as I live it, I remember it, and that's the deja vu? I don't know.

I have some visual snow, floaters, seeing dots, after images, and random light when I close my eyes, and sometimes when they're open. I have never ending deja vu, it's all the time, every hour, every minute, that makes it really hard to dismiss the other symptoms as it just makes me think I'm living in a dream I've had before on my 1st trip, idk. I can also hear police sirens over top of a like, whining noise, for instance, my AC makes this whining noise, and it's like I can hear police sirens on top of it, it's faint, but there, at other times I can like, hear family members and friend say things related to ""hes tripping out"" or, just about me going crazy, it's only either very faint or in my head, but it's still very fucking scary.

I'm just scared that I'm living in a fake reality, and soon, I'll wake up in a reality where my bad trips were real. I've tripped images of myself being arrested, going crazy and killing my dogs (I don't know why, I love animals, especially my dogs, I'd never hurt them) being put in an asylum, just like, going full in insane. As if I'm one of those people who are tripping forever, and this is the trip, idk. I've seen myself (and this is embarrassing to admit) like, pissing and shitting myself fully unresponsive and surrounded by police in my bedroom. All this, I try to tell myself was just my fears brought out on LSD, but it's so fucking, realistic, it scares me. They were all almost like, a vivid dream, playing in my head while I was tripping.

Deep down, I tell myself this is reality, I mean how could it not be? But, why is the ""2nd reality"" still playing out? Why the fuck does it feel like I'm in a dream of some sort that I'll wake up from, like, I'll wake up back in April in my 1st trip, or I'll wake up in an asylum or something. This deja vu, it's just awful, I don't know if this is HPPD cuz of the persisting of my perception i had on LSD, or if this is psychosis, and I'm just trying to get a second opinion. Thanks for reading. I plan on seeing a psychiatrist sometime soon. But I don't know if this will pass on it's own or not.

I really hope i didnt do anything serious, but, at this point, having been a month of experiencing this, i dont know anymore. I just want to know if anyones schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder started out with what im describing? or if im just overthinking this, the deja vu and certain thoughts are intrusive, i can't always get them to stop, and when i do, it usually lasts an hour or so, then i think of it again, today i feel, off, i dont know if its dizziness, or numbness in my body, or both, im not sure, im just looking for as many answers as i can before heading to a doctor. Thank you guys so much in advance, i just want to feel normal again...",26Jul2018,2
3,"I just need to vent a little...

For the past month, I have been seeing a therapist every week for my intrusive thoughts that have been ruining my life. 
She’s great! Thanks to her I am finally learning to cope and I feel the best I have ever felt in a long time. 

But for the past week my mom has been lashing out at me for going and is continuously pestering me to cancel my appointment that is scheduled for tomorrow. 
She believes it is a waste of my time and that the therapist is “basically stealing money”, and that with the money she is paying for me to go she would rather spend on a new car. She also insulted my therapist a few times for no reason, she hasn’t even met her. 

I’m in tears right now. I don’t know what to do because I have an appointment and I haven’t canceled because I’m afraid and I don’t know what to tell my therapist.

4,"I’ve suffered from major depression and social anxiety since I was young, and in my later years of high school it had only gotten worse (due to bullying and sexual assault). Because of this I would often skip classes, didn’t do the school work, and even when I went to class, had to fight not to run screaming from the classroom (some teachers let me go for small walks in the hallways when it got really bad).

My grades were terrible of course, and my parents had no idea why because I just never told them about my issues. Because of this, post secondary was never an option for me.

I know I could go off now, but I still have those issues (am currently getting help) and know that I just wouldn’t be able to handle it at this point, maybe not ever. Some days I wish I could, to the point where I get mad at myself for having those issues.

5,"I'm feeling so lonely right now. I only have one friend and she's not wanting to talk lately. Whenever her depression and anxiety is bad, she pulls away from everyone.

6,My wife is what I believe to be mentally abusing me constantly. Always accusing me of stuff I clearly didn’t do. Calling me names. Telling me to kill myself. Now I won’t lie I’ve retaliated and said stuff I definitely shouldn’t have. I only did so because I felt as though I was in a corner. I feel like shit constantly. I want to cry but last time I did that all she did was make fun of me. I don’t know maybe it is my fault. I just need to vent I guess. Sorry.,26Jul2018,1
7," Hey everyone,

With hopes of helping some of you find a natural way to decrease anxiety, I did some research and put together a short eBook that includes a few methods that have been studied by mental health experts and found to reduce anxiety.

I normally sell the eBook on Amazon, but the goal is really to help people, so I want to give a free PDF to anyone in this group who wants it.

The best way to give it to you is if you email me at [thecrew@strengthenthemind.com](mailto:thecrew@strengthenthemind.com) and I will reply with the PDF of the book. If it is easier for you, feel free to comment your email or message me, but for privacy’s sake, it may be better to send me an email directly.

Have a good day :)",26Jul2018,1
8,"Now that I feel like I am in a better headspace, I have decided to do this. I had a really bad day yesterday. I went straight to school from a 8 hour shift so that I could have a quiet place to have a phone interview. At my school, I am required to do 2 semesters of co-ops and everyone I know is having a really difficult time finding one for the fall semester, but I digressed. The interview went bad and I felt absolutely horrible about it, but I was determined to not let it ruin the rest of my day.

That plan failed miserably. I had a ton of homework to complete, but as soon as I locked my room door I began crying, thinking about the things that normally put me in one of my states. Then the one that always hits me the hardest comes up - why do all the people around me try to kill themselves?

Before college, I had no friends, but once I made friends, we were all revealing to have something ""wrong"". I have a group of close friends, 2 are girls - A and M, and C is a guy. First A tried to kill herself. Her issues run deep and she has been hospitalized several times since. Then was C's turn. He had expressed his desire to no longer be here and I told him how concerned I was and eventually got him to see someone in wellness, but he too would attempt. Right after this incident was M's turn. I found out she was cutting and along with her severe anxiety, well, it was only a matter of time. She ended up going through a program as well.

My family has a long history of mental illness which is too much to get into, but my mom has attempted suicide in the past, has depression and is going through a really bad patch at the moment. My brother has expressed his desires to die, but to my knowledge, has never attempted.

In high school, a family friend killed herself and a girl I was friendly with did as well. 

When I get in one of my states I think about all of this and wonder why everyone around me wants to die. Why did I attract these people and choose to be their friends? I honestly feel like life would be so much easier if I was alone again, if the only person I had were myself because if seems like I am nothing but bad news. This sounds extremely self centered.

I have a past too, but I NEVER get to share because someone always seems to have something going on before I do and it always seems to overshadow me. I stopped sharing my issues with my friends because I didn't want them to think I was copying them. They are the only ones who know (besides my family) the abuse I suffered at the hands of my father and how it affects me on a daily basis, how during high school I would get panic attacks leaving the house because I was so anxious and how I still do sometimes. How sometimes I put in headphones and pace back and forth for hours sometimes because it is the only thing that can calm my nerves. I wish I could tell them because I love my friends and I don't want to loose them. I've never had friends before this and if I were to loose them, I don't know what I would do. 

I just needed to get that off my chest. ",26Jul2018,1
9,"I just wanted to say to a group of people that I knew would understand...

One of the hardest things in the world is to hear: “Mom, I cut myself earlier. I’ll give you the razor.”

(Which was apparently missed on my sweep of the house when I realized everything needs to be locked.)

My 14f is addicted to self-harming. She’s been admitted, she is on 100mg of Sertraline a day for about 8 weeks and she has seemed to been stabilizing. 

She regularly sees a psychiatrist and a counselor and attends group therapy as part of a Youth Mental Health out patient clinic. 

She hasn’t in about 6 weeks and I thought things were on the upswing so I’m puzzled as to why now.

Parenting is really hard. That’s all. Thanks for listening.

10,"I’m posting this here because I’m pretty sure these thoughts are solely due to depression and self-loathing, and I thought maybe you guys could relate.

I’ve been with my fiancé for about 2.5 years. Just a couple of months ago my self-esteem and body image issues took a nosedive, and since then I’ve been wondering how he could love me so much or stand to be with me. He is friendly, open to new people and experiences, and so cute. Meanwhile, I suffer from social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and am scared of new things and people. I can’t form relationships, and he has no problem doing this. I’m also the fattest I’ve ever been, largely due to antipsychotics I have to take for my schizoaffective disorder. 

I just feel like I’m no match for him. I love him so much I can’t express it, and I know he loves me too. I just feel so unworthy. I wish I didn’t. I feel like he’s going to figure out how terrible I am and leave, even though he says he would never leave me. I want to feel worthy of his love, and of love in general.

15,"**I’m venting so I apologize for the length of the post, but this has been bottled up for a while**

I’ve pretty much self diagnosed myself with anxiety since I was a teenager. I’ve always struggled in crowds, doing things that should be easy but require enormous effort from me not to be terrified of, etc. However, I’ve had random bouts where I felt like my anxiety was gone...and then times when I’ve come spiraling down in horrible meltdowns every other night. 

I have no idea what has caused me to become so horrible with abandonment- that’s the only thing I can link it to. Whenever I get upset with my boyfriend, I typically prefer to bottle it rather than express it because if I do express it I’m going to break down into sobs and fear that the moment I speak my mind he’s going to leave. It’s irrational and I KNOW it’s completely irrational...which is why for a while now I’ve deal with my melt downs alone and told no one. Because I know they’re irrational and that it will pass. But I need to find a way to cope and speak my mind without a full on ‘panic attack’ if that’s what’s going on and I can’t when I don’t even know the root of it.

In past relationships I’ve spent countless hours coaching myself not to expect anyone to love me like I love them because it just won’t happen. This started as a young(ish) teenager and I have no idea how or when these feelings developed. I did it with friends and romantic relations as well. I pretty much coached myself into being okay with not being good enough. I refuse to believe that a little bit of bullying that happened in the 7th grade has turned me into a 19 year old mess. Lol. Have I accidentally brainwashed myself? What the hell? When did I become so self destructive?

Around November I had something particularly bad happen to me. During time’s of stress (which I am in right now, queue the meltdowns every night) sometimes I feel as if I’m flashing back to what happened. I still don’t completely know what happened and it kills me not knowing. It doesn’t stop intrusive thoughts of what I do remember though.

I guess I should mention that I don’t have the money for therapy. I don’t know how to help myself. I have no idea what’s wrong with me or if there’s anything wrong at all; maybe I’m just INCREDIBLY stressed out. The point is... I’m tired of suffering in silence because I’m scared no one will take me seriously. It’s never been this bad. Why am I freaking out so badly? What the hell is going on in my head? Maybe I just need validation that I’m not crazy. 

I live in the US and I’m a college student. Does anyone know if there are resources available for me as a student?",26Jul2018,2
16,"I've been dealing with guilt for a good long while.

It started 2 years ago, there was a girl in my class I secretly had a crush on. Though, I expressed so through the incorrect means. Namely, stalking (just in the school building), and gathering information from others. I was hesitant from the start to even try, since I knew it wouldn't work at all. But, I persisted. Through the course of the whole school year, I did the same routine. Over and over again.

Now comes the second year.

How I started messing with the same girl the second year, I would give stuff out when a holiday was around the corner. For Christmas, I gave candy canes to students. Everyone except her. I usually teased her, and on top of that, I was joking about things she liked to get a reaction out of her. I kept teasing her and teasing her with things I brought (strawberry chocolates for Valentine's Day, and caramel chocolate eggs for Easter). Around the end of that year, I had changed in a way. Until around then, there was something about my childhood I hadn't really learned about. I started learning the weight of the situation, and couple that with the fact that I had already felt some guilt for my actions, and you likely see where this is going. That information my dad gave me, about the situation, help me see a different me. I've seen more or less, the worse in everybody, rather than taking people at surface level. Malicious intent, self-support, you get the idea. Most importantly, I started seeing myself in a different light. Malicious. Nothing more than malicious. It's been taking a bit of a toll on me. I can't even look her in the face, I'm that sorry. I started talking to less people, and started trusting people less, to the point where I trust absolutely nobody, except my dad. One thing wamna do now is apologize. I'm not so sure how to apologize for two years of rude and tasteless actions.


What should I do now? I don't wanna make the wrong decision, and I don't trust myself to handle this carefully. So, I'd rather reach out to others.

17,"I make a choice every day to be happy, I don't fake it but I legitimately make an effort to keep myself out of my low points. I'm pretty sure I'm moderately depressed, I'm still very functional but I'm ready to stop feeling those lows. Lately when I have free weekends I'll sleep a lot, mostly to catch up from the week since I have trouble sleeping. But also because sometimes I just need to. A little over a year ago I got out of an abusive relationship, and a few months ago I finally started the process to file charges against him for sexual assault. He also was very manipulative, gaslighted me, and was emotionally abusive. My low points, as well as flashbacks, panic attacks, and problems focusing lately are pretty much entirely related to what he did. So I know I'm not hopeless, just dealing with a traumatic situation. 

I have no mental health history, nothing diagnosed, never seen even a counselor. As much as I don't like to admit it, I'm highly intelligent. Always have been, but my social skills have been the trade off. I'm almost 24, and now I can talk to people with somewhat manageable awkwardness, I'm doing pretty well in life, and I have people I'm close to. 

With everything lately though, I've had so much social anxiety. I deal with it with the help of amazing people in my life, but like with my depression I'm ready to talk to someone and be completely free. It's the only thing holding me back from my full potential. 

All that said, the reason I'm holding off is because I'm in the Navy. Have been for a year, and I'm still in school, but for something that requires a TS clearance and polygraph. I've been honest on my clearance paperwork, especially since I have no mental health history and I have a super clean record. But I'm scared once I talk to behavioral health, since I have trouble putting my thoughts into words, they'll either remove me from the program or the Navy entirely. That fear is probably due to my anxiety and overthinking, but still. 

As much as I've been feeling depressed lately, I am very much not ever going to be a danger to myself or others. I love my life, I know I'm a decent person,  I have family/friends/goals, and I want to have the best life I can. I don't want whoever I talk to to get the wrong idea. I read something recently about intrusive thoughts, how they're normal and actually a sign of you being a good person because you react negatively to them. And the only thing bad is if they make you worry/they're more chronic, which might be a sign of OCD or anxiety. That made me feel so much better, because apparently I'm not messed up more than anyone else. And not to diagnose myself, but after doing a shit ton of research, I'm 99% sure I have moderate OCD, anxiety, and of course depression. Everything makes sense, I know I'm not a terrible person, and everything I've heard and read about says that the Navy will be supportive. 

I guess my main point is that since I have no mental health history, I've been honest on my forms, and I've been having depression since after I joined/mostly situational, and I'd be going to behavioral health just to get a little help to be a better Sailor, I hope I'll be okay with my leadership, the polygraph, and getting my clearance. Which of course I'll have to disclose everything, but I'm an open person. 

Sorry for such a long post, but that's how my thoughts work. Hopefully everything makes sense! If you have any experience with stuff like this, any tips so they don't have the wrong idea of why I'm finally getting help? And the Navy should do what they say they do about mental health

24,"I posted the other day, on my birthday. Things really haven't gotten any better. Short breakdown;

I've been working hard to rebuild my relationship with my mom for about 3 years now. Constantly trying to keep in contact despite her never trying to call me, trying to get her to spend time with me in some way, something. Anything. I don't really have good childhood memories of my mother, but I'd been hoping that maybe she'd be a batter mom, now that I'm an adult and a lot more dependable on my own, and not such a shit like I was as a kid.

My mom's always been pretty generous to my siblings. She's taken my two brothers and sister on.. probably 20 or so out-of-country vacations, all on her dime. Me? Never. Not once. And yeah, I'm a little jealous, but I've never, ever mentioned it bothered me to her. I just kinda kept it inside.

So, my birthday; I wake up, I wait to hear.. something from anyone, really. I don't have a big social circle, and I guess I got my expectations up. I wanted to at least get a 'happy birthday' from my mother. That's it, really. Just to have her call me and let me know she cares.

Instead, around noon, I see a Facebook alert; She's posted a picture. She's in Mexico, with my sister, getting a pedicure. On my birthday. I was.. more than a little heartbroken. I call her on her birthday and Mother's day, I help with all the cooking for Thankgiving and Christmas, and I just felt like none of what I was doing mattered. And, really, that I didn't matter.

The only person that wished me a happy birthday was my roommate. I feel like shit and I'm usually able to move past things pretty easily, but I just.. can't, this time, for some reason. I shouldn't be so upset, I know, but I'm just hurt.

When I called to speak to her, she admitted that she had 'accidentally forgotten' to send me a text message in the morning. And that, honestly, stung even more. A text message is all I get? Not even a call? Maybe I'm blowing that out of proportion in particular, but it still hurts.

So, well, I started crying. And understand, I don't really cry all that much. I don't really handle strong emotions well, I'm a very logical person. Crying makes me angry at myself, because I can't figure out how to *stop* crying when I'm emotional. My mom's response? 'I don't have time for this.' and a hangup. And radio silence for the past two days, except for an email apologizing, and I quote, 'I'm sorry there are 7 people around me at all times and I don't have time to deal with all your worries.'

And that's the last thing I've heard from her. Am I crazy and overblowing this whole thing? Am I being too sensitive? Be real with me; I'm not a precious snowflake, I won't break if you tell me I'm being a dumbass. 

I need advice, because I just don't know how to feel.",26Jul2018,2

Curled up to go to bed, and bam. Wide awake. Exhausted, but unable to slip into sleep. Got really frustrated and decided to take a break from trying to force it.

30,"Hello,

I need some advice on a situation with my dad. He is late 40's nearly 50. As far as I know he has suffered with mental illness as far back as his childhood because he believes that he was being abused as a child (memories of strangers coming to the house) he grew him to find out that who he thought was he dad wasn't actually and when he was 19 went to war. While he was at war he was sending money back to his parents that where losing their house whilst his mum died of sclerosis of the liver from being an alchaholic. He came back with ptsd which lead to many complications in my parents relationship which resulted in them splitting up when I was very young. Since then he just simply has not been able to get on in life and his situation has spiralled in to a hell of absolute mistrust and paranoia.  He has never been able to approach his own issues because he can't allow anybody in because of the deeply seated trust issues. He  has attempted to do things with his life, but those attempts have been attempts to bring people together to walk the vision that he himself can't and when it falls apart the people that have ""let him down"" are people that have stabbed him in the back. This has lead to a list of enemies, including the government, who is the ultimate enemy. He claims to have been followed by government agencies, tried to be taken out by people that he thought were his friends and believes that the whole thing is connected, all of the events in his life are connected. And now with the internet and technology which he himself can't use, is the platform to which it all goes on behind the scenes. This has been getting worse and worse to the point as of very recently (the past couple of days) he has reached a new peak and said things to let me know that he can't even trust me. If he can't trust me and won't listen to what I say, it is almost as if the delusion has won. I don't know what is left, It has got to the point of near crisis but I'm still holding on to hope that he does trust me. I've tried to get him admitted in to hospital but ""they aren't bothered and would rather see me dead"" and I feel like if I intervene with the crisis team he will literally be sectioned for the rest of his life and put on drugs. I really don't know what to do, I'm not sure if he is bluffing when he says he is a danger to himself or to others because he does have a good heart, it has just become drowned to the point of no return and he himself claims there is no return now. He has been away before for psychiatric help and supposedly they couldn't do anything for him, but it's hard to believe when it's absolutely true he can't do anything to help himself. Every time i can't get hold of him by the phone or whatever I think I'm on my way to find him dead. At what point do I intervene, when to do so is to submit him to ""the enemy""? 

TL:DR Dad has extensive mental illness that has gotten out of control to the point of extreme paranoia leading to distrust of everybody, the whole country and now finally me, his son and last family member. ",26Jul2018,3
31,"So I’m 25 years old. In my college days (19-23) I used lsd on average once a week. Sometimes I would do it multiple times a week, staying up for prolonged periods of time (up for 24-36 hrs straight on average) twice a week when I got into using it multiple times a week at the age of 22. 

I don’t feel the same. I think I have persistent psychosis and have been floating around at jobs for the past year(I’ve held 3 jobs and quit all very suddenly). It’s like a build up, but one day is fine and the next i just walk in and quit halfway through the shift. 
I put on a fake behavior to blend in but I work hard. I think working hard is a way to blend in but the current job I have (busboy at a restaurant) it’s gotten me more attention because I feel like everyone hates their job and hates me for working hard.

Have also had this reoccurring thought that I’m dead and this isn’t really my life anymore because I had a near death experience while driving drunk and almost slamming into another car.

I’m worried that telling my friends about my suicidal thoughts because 13 is really, really young. I feel like telling them about it and asking for help is something that’s unfair of me to do because honestly, we’re just kids. They don’t know how to deal with suicide. They shouldn’t have to deal with me when they’re supposed to be having fun as kids since I might’ve missed the train on that.

Basically to put it simply, my mother and father are both failures. My dad I haven’t seen in years because he never wanted me or my brother. He is a failure. He has extreme anger issues and would always shout at us when we were kids. He especially hated my brother who is autistic. Anyway, he has no money and is living in an empty apartment now I hear. He is always trying to weasel money off of everyone and is generally just an awful human. 

As for my mother, she is a failure too. She has no job and hasn’t worked in over 10 years. She gets all her money from the benefit system and, well, me. Although she is never thankful and instead continues to make me wish I was dead.  The point is I made a vow several years ago to never be like them. I vowed to strive to succeed and prove that I’m not cursed by genetics to be a failure. The thing is now whenever I do fail I have a panic attack and depression kicks in. The fear of being like them is now controlling me and how I feel.

okay before I start let me give you a bit of a background about me.

I'm a male, 21 and I have a nice part-time job that pays well with friendly co-workers.(i'm not at uni atm cause its too expensive) I also have a loving parents who supports me with whatever decision I make. I do not have a  poor nor luxurious life just simple life. I also have friends that I know but never talk to lol (though this is not much of a problem for me). there's really nothing bad to complain about my life. frankly i'm aware of how nice my life actually is.

back then I had a goal in life, I play a lot of video games,do some drawings or go somewhere to sate my boredom and it works.but for some reason for the past 12-17 months (year and a half), I cant seem to feel anything nor do anything at all..I know it sounds stupid but anyway...I cant get motivated to do nor achieve anything in life at all. I cant say i'm depressed cause i dont feel sad but then again I also dont feel happy,excited, anxiety or any of those things...i cant feel anything...its like something feels empty.....I play video games,do drawings for 5-10 mins and i'm already unmotivated to do it. I travel around the city but it doesnt feel exciting at all..I try to find other different hobbies or things to do(working out,baking,sewing,drinking,date someone,hang out with someone, getting a pet...damn I even tried to smoke and do drugs..dont worry I stopped...it was only a test i guess), all results to the same thing = losing motivation to do it after couple of times...everything I do seems to be not working my 'engine'....everything I do feels like nothing more but an action to distract myself until i get tired and sleep...none of them makes me feel happy,sad,excited,fearful, or any feeling at all............just..emptiness....I really dont know what to do anymore......sometimes I think being dead is better..(though dont worry, i'm not inconsiderate nor selfish enough to commit suicide...its just a figure of speech..'not inconsiderate/selfish' yet ironically i want to satisfy my own empty feeling without regards to others. I have a bewildering way of thinking...)

frankly I made this post unsure of what I actually want...I dont know if i'm just venting or seeking for a solution or answer or probably just looking for someone who feels the same way. I even google this feeling of mine hoping to find a solution but none of them seems to work....so I dont know....I.....dont.....KNOW....what to do nor what's the purpose of everything i'm doing...",26Jul2018,2
42,"TL;DR - I am putting this here as I can imagine everything is really unstructured below, this is a rant about my existence at the moment, I am not a normal 20 year old and I am beyond lost. My parents resent me and I am breaking the family apart slowly. I am pretty close to just forgetting everything and leaving the world but I don't want to as it will cause pain to others around me at the moment. 

So I really am just existing at the moment, i've been fired from multiple jobs I have little money to my name and my friends are confused about my actions at the moment. When I say I am merely just existing it's mainly because I am too scared to take the easy way out mainly for the fact I know it's selfish and although I would be gone too many people would be affected by my stupid actions.

I am seeing doctors at the moment but I don't know if they are really aware of the extent of what I think I have, constantly tired I never want to do anything, constantly being threatened by my dad that I am going to get kicked out of the house as I am making the whole family depressed. I have always been under the impression I am different, I have always been told you will go on to do great things yet whenever I do something I always end up hurting someone and losing out on the whole thing myself. I have incredible memory difficulty, I struggle with simple small tasks even such as finding an item somewhere around my house for parents or whatever, I have behaviour issues and whenever I muster up even the tiniest of bit of happiness it's soon diminished by my dad. I have speech problems, I am extremely socially awkward, I have been fairly clumsy for a while but now my clumsiness has gone off the scale and im breaking things by accident that before I wouldn't. When I am at home all I really do is play games and watch youtube videos until I pass out pretty much around 2/3am each night. I am about to start a new job in a call centre which includes training and honestly I don't really know how long that will last as I can't even carry out basic tasks that people teach me how to do. I never remember where any place is even after going there 10 times lets say I have to use a GPS to get there by car and exactly the same if I am walking. My muscles twitch and spasm on a hourly basis whether it be my left eye, either legs or my bicep. I am overly affected by the tiniest amount of alcohol or nicotine, they both go straight to my head which I have no idea how to explain at all. I have been fortunate enough to go on a lot of holidays when I was younger but I always wanted to go home as soon as we got there, again cannot explain this but it's what I remember. My IQ is apparently around the 120 mark but I really don't see the point in that anyway seeing as I can't even pay bills on time or talk on the phone properly. My room is a complete mess, every time I get the motivation to clean it I soon realise it's too much work as i've always brushed things under the rug. My dental health is appalling for a 20 year old I have had recently a root canal and 7 fillings. My sister who I have always wanted to connect with recently told me how I acted when I was younger and how she looked up to me, only to get shunned away every time I would come home from school which made me feel like even more of a horrible person. Whenever I am in new surroundings I am always speechless and struggle to take in any surroundings which is why I am seen with my head down a lot just looking at the pavement or wherever I may be at the time. Forgot to mention as well if I lose this call centre job, I will be getting kicked out of the house which to a regular person would seem pretty reasonable but when you realise I literally struggle to even do the basic tasks you would probably understand why it is so scary to me and would most likely lead to me becoming homeless. I've only ever had one girlfriend in my life and I couldn't even properly show emotion at certain social cues because I didn't understand them. I used to religiously follow social media profiles of people around me mainly to escape from what my life is. I have an extremely low ability to make decisions for myself and I have to make them based on those around me.

I wish it was as simple as pinning the blame on something like MS or another health problem for example, yet that cannot be the reason I am so socially awkward and that I can never do things without someone helping me from a young age. To be perfectly honest this has been going as long as I can remember probably around the age of 4/5 when I started to be aware of surroundings and had some means of communication. It honestly feels like my brain has severely lacked development skills and only now have I come to that realisation because of all the shit that's happened and that I have caused people. Whenever I do do something to try and help myself I quickly stop it for whatever reason, be it healthy eating, gym, breathing exercises I just forget everything and seem to go back to my old ways as quick as possible.

My cousin recently killed himself. Shot himself with a pistol he always carried. He was dealing with schizophrenia and stopped going to a therapist and taking his meds.

At the time this happened I had not told any one other than my husband about my depression and suicidal thoughts. My dad called to tell me what happened and it was during one of my bad days so I did not take it well. I had no idea he was battling these urges as he had no idea I was battling mine. It was a real eye opener as my husband held me and confided in me that of course he would never want to make that call to my parents and friends. I don't want that to happen either. I don't want him to have to tell my daughter what I did so I decided that I was going to reach out. Somehow,to someone.

47,"My friend and I, along with my son rented a cottage for a week.  My son is 14, I’m 38 and my friend “M” is 50.  The week started fine, however this is also the longest we’ve spent together.   I started to get irritated on our 3rd day.  We went into town, and it’s like she wanted me son and I to be a tour guide, even though we’ve only been to this town one time, many years ago.   Rather than say things like “I want to check out this store” she’d make comments as my son and I walked by like “just so you guys know I like going into these little stores”.  Meh, just go in, say “hey guys let’s go in” but the negative tone to her messages was unnecessary.   The whole day was things like this.   Since then, all I notice is how she acts like a toddler, wanting everyone to do everything for her, and throwing fits.  Instead of saying “guys want to swim” she’ll say “it would be nice if I didn’t have to go swimming alone”.   I can play it off and be light so many times, now I’m pretending I can’t hear these rude comments.   I don’t know how to address is directly, she’ll lash out I’m sure.  Not sure it’s worth it. 
The last straw, we ask her to play a board game with us, and we’re going over the rules.  She’s texting on her phone the whole time.  My son plays his turns and she very snidely says “why did you do that” and we said, “M” those are the rules we just talked about.  And shes all “well I was on my phone” so I offer to go over them again and she’s “I’m not as hardcore as you guys” then proceeds to question everything very rudely.

My love had been copping my moodiness, my coldness, and my general unhappiness had reduced our relationship to a shadow of what it was. I have no interest in sex. 

He recognised something was up, and told me not to be afraid to be honest, to communicate my feelings, to tell him what is going on with me.

So I did that, and two weeks ago he arrived at my house with a bag full of all my stuff, which he offloaded as he blurted out ""I WANT TO BREAK UP"" before running off down the street. 

Later messages revealed he was ""sad"" and ""stressed"" and he ""couldn't help""  ""didn't know what else to do.""

Platitudes from friends and my psych just annoy me. I am trying so hard to get help and yet appointments take weeks/months and in the meantime I am in agonising pain.

I know from experience that the standard American diet causes depression.  So, according to that article, the SAD stressor would be a combination of long-term stress, chemicals, and starvation.  The high carbs of SAD is a chronic stressor.  Hours and even days after a person eats a SAD meal, the stress remains with elevated insulin levels, insulin resistance, and many other hormonal and metabolic problems.  Long term, the SAD stressor forces tissue changes when the body is trying to adapt to the stresses, like obesity and damaged pancreases, and those tissue changes become stressors in and of themselves.  Tissue changes are difficult to correct.           

A ketogenic diet, fasting, and various forms of intense exercise can restore most of these tissue alterations to their correct state.                                                 ",26Jul2018,0
51,"Looking Forward

I realized today that I have stopped living life. I’m literally just trying to get to the next day, just living in the thought of tomorrow. I’m not living, I’m waiting. And the trouble is, I don’t know what I am exactly waiting for, I’m kind of scared for what it might be. 
Having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time. It’s the fear of failure but no urge to be productive. It’s wanting friends but hate socializing. It’s wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely. It’s caring about everything then caring about nothing. It’s feeling everything at once then feeling paralyzed and numb. 
The thing about an anxiety disorder is that you know it is stupid. You know with all your heart that it wasn’t a big deal and that it should roll off you. But that is where the disorder kicks in. Suddenly the small thing is very big and it keeps growing in your head, flooding your chest and trying to escape from under your skin. You know with all of your heart that you’re being ridiculous and you hate every minute of it. The fact that many people don’t recognize or have patience for your illness only makes everything worse. 
Most people who don’t have anxiety or depression don’t get it. They don’t understand what you mean when you say you cry for no reason. They think you’re just emotional. They don’t know how it feels to have your heart pumping out of your chest and to be short of breath and cannot control it, or to feel like the whole world is tumbling down on top of you and you can’t fix it. They don’t get that anxiety and depression are both illnesses, not a birth defect. It’s not your personality either, it has just taken over it. They think we like the attention, but they have no idea how badly we want to feel happy. To have a real smile, not a fake one. To not have to go through the day feeling worthless. To not cry for a week straight. To just be happy, like the average person should. 
Please be patient with those who have anxiety. They say sorry a lot because they are genuinely afraid they have insulted you somehow. They ask if they are annoying because they genuinely think they have somehow annoyed you. They say things are “awkward” because they can be uncomfortable in any situation, no matter who with, they don’t mean to personally hurt you. They cry because sometimes people and situations are too much, not because they are looking for attention. They don’t text you a lot because they are clingy, it’s because if you don’t reply, they think they have done something wrong. They can be set off by little things, so don’t say they are overreacting when they panic. Please be patient with those who have anxiety. They only mean the best.

54,"My Addiction 

“With the depth of my eyes and the future in your sight, there is nothing past or present that we cant overcome.”
I am an addict, the disease that makes you too selfish to see the havoc you created and to care about the people you shattered. 
I am an addict every day, at any time I am subject to delusion, denial, rationalization, just fiction or insanity. All the hallmarks of the typical addict’s way of thinking. But today I have a choice to be a recovering addict. I will make that choice each day, by staying clean and working recovery. 
Recovery is exhausting, why was I cursed with an addiction? Will I ever live fully recovered or will it always be a struggle?
I want to be better but I don’t even know what that would mean because I have no memories of a life without addiction. 
I don’t know what that is, I don’t know what I’m striving for. I don’t know why I’m doing this. But I know if I don’t stop I’m accepting death. That’s just enough reason to keep trying. I’m just moving forward and I hope things will get better. I believe there is a possibility in a better life. So I keep trying. I still remember the long nights of desperation. The endless days of shame. All the time I felt lost in all the pain.
Recovery from addiction requires hard work, a proper attitude and learning skills to stay sober. Not drinking alcohol or using other drugs. Successful drug recovery involves changing attitudes, acquiring knowledge, and developing skills to meet the many challenges of sobriety. 
Do everything day by day, you have the advantage to acknowledge this, if you continue being hopeful and believing that you are stronger than your addiction every day. Be proud. Last time was not yesterday. You are not a whiner.
Don’t think about what can happen in a month. Don’t think about what can happen in a year. Just focus on the 24 hours in front of you and do what you can to get closer to where you want to be. 
Recovering addicts are the strongest people you will ever meet. They are strong because they know the only way out of addiction is death. They know this and continue to fight for their sobriety. They fight to regain all the things they lost in active addiction. They fight every single day to be better than they were the day before. And they will fight every day for the rest of their life. 
Every addiction, no matter what it is, is the result of trying to escape from something by going in the direction of a need that is currently not being met. In order to move past our addiction, we have to figure out what we are trying to use our addiction to get away from and what needs we are trying to use our addiction to meet. 
Addiction cannot be cured if the fear of consuming is greater than the will power to quit using.
You don’t get over an addiction by stopping use, you recover by creating a new life where it is easier to not use. If you don’t create a new life, then all the factors that brought you to your addiction will catch up with you again. 
One of the most important facts to remember about addiction is its progression. Addiction begins in an early stage that looks nothing at all like a life threatening disease; proceeds in to a middle stage where problems begin to appear and intensify and gradually advances into the late, degenerative stages of oblivious psychological deterioration and loss of control. 
I felt empty and sad for years and for a long, long time, alcohol and drug's worked. I’d drink, use and the sadness would go away. Not only did the sadness go away but I was fantastic. I was handsome, funny, I had a great figure, and I could do math. But at some point, the booze and drugs stopped working. That’s when it started to suck. Every time I used, I could feel pieces of me leaving. I continued to drink and medicate until there was nothing left, just emptiness. 
Addiction stunts the spiritual, emotional and mental growth of a person. For the addict, they literally stop wanting to learn or advance themselves on any level other than the one they are already on. This is why many addicts are emotionally stunted and are unable to contain their emotions. Many addicts believe that once they are sober, for a few months they are cured. Nothing could be further from the truth. An addict is not cured just because they stopped drinking or using, remember, “the drinking or using of alcohol for the addict is only a symptom of an underlying problem within him or her.” Total sobriety takes more than abstinence, it takes a spiritual and mental awareness through healing and growth. I have never yet read about, or heard of a case where an addict stopped using, but then years later they were able to just have one or two and stop.

55,"I had a friend die by suicide last week. I'm a mess over it, which I guess is a normal reaction, but the thought I keep ruminating over is the chain of events in which it happened. It is just so tragic and confusing and I really need help grappling with it:

He had been telling his family for awhile that he was struggling with ""life's uncertainty"", but he was always one to express himself with light-hearted humor (and never had a history of mental illness) so his family didn't think it was anything too serious. I should also mention that none of his friends had any idea he was struggling either.
The day it happened, he went to lunch with his dad and told him he was definitely not ok and needed help immediately, so his dad booked him an appointment with a therapist that same day like 3 hours later. He was apparently all for it, then said he wanted to go home and take a nap before the appointment... But instead he drove himself to a park, texted his dad his location, and hung himself.

Like I don't understand HOW he could reach out for help, and in the span of 3 hours decide to kill himself, KNOWING that he was getting help. It's just so dark... Like WHY would he beg for help then not accept that help and just go and do that!? Like it just seems like such a strange sequence of events, like he was deranged or something... Like he was trying to resist and just, couldn't? He was always such an intelligent, rational person it's just so bizarre and scary. He was 29; isn't that a bit late for the onset of a first psychotic episode? And no, he didn't do drugs. 

I have bipolar 2 with obsessive tendencies and chronic anxiety—which I am medicated for and live a pretty normal life—but this event has sent me into an absolute obsessive anxious spiral. My biggest fear is getting to the point where I can't take it anymore and just irrationally try something stupid just to get out of my head. I've checked myself into hospitals in the past due to not wanting to hurt myself. I've been told that the fact that I fear this so much and it brings me extreme panic means it is an OCD fear of losing control and I'd never actually do it because I don't actually want to. But now I'm like WTF!? He was asking for help one minute, and gone the next. Couldn't even wait 3 hours.

I just don't understand... I guess suicide usually leaves people confused, but I find it so incredibly horrifying that he asked for help and couldn't wait, then ended it in such a dark way. I'm not even sure what the goal of this post is... What could have possibly been going through his head that day? Is this a common suicide scenario? Did he actually just lose control? I know we'll never know for certain, but I'm just so confused and scared and anxiety is off the charts. :(",26Jul2018,13
56,"One word: Hobbies. I learned the hard way that a lot of people can have Netflix, work and school as their only hobbies, but I can’t. I try to stick to the same hobbies for at least a month and get good at them, whether it’s reading a novel, working on an art project, learning Spanish, or watching Khan Academy videos. Also, I exercise for at least 15 minutes every day—conventional wisdom says to exercise two or three times a week, but I learned the hard way that going a day without exercising is not a good idea for me!

60,"This is my first post here. Nice to meet you all.

I am somewhat in a crisis here. Been feeling very anxious, do not know if I would like to call myself depressed. Partialy I am writing here to feel a bit better and maybe get some advice from you. Thanks.

I am 20 years old, a student. I lived most of my life in Lithuania, finished my high school there. Fell in love with my current girlfriend (back then I was just 16 years old) and we have a wonderful relationship, we do really love each other. She is a year older than me.

I finished my high school last summer (she finished hers two years ago). Although, I chose to study in England. I study physics, people say I am gifted with that, I personally think I am great at it too. Always enjoy just solving physics problems, learning complex topics, mathematical modeling and ect. Lithuania did not really satisfy my study needs, that is why I study in England. My girlfriend lives still in Lithuania, she studies there and she also chose to study what she loves and she is doing a great job. So we have been in a long distance relationship for about 2 years. We are going to finish our studies in 2 years (we are half way through). 

My parents moved to the US after I finished high school. They moved there as they could earn more and most of my relatives live there. My parents did not really seem happy or relaxed. To be honest, nor do they look happier here in the US. They were always overworked and both of them have their own personal mental issues. I think my mother was always anxious and maybe depressed, she tends to be verbally and emotionally abusive to me and the rest of my family. The other problem she has is that she has the need to control everything and has a bit of a narcissistic personality. My father is a very silent man. I assume he is also tiried. He usually has to deal with my mothers rants (which are usually very irrational and emotion based). Then there is also my younger brother, he is just 9 years old. I see that he is becoming very similar to my mother. Although, he might just be a child and I might be overthinking it.
Now what to say about my family is that it feels very tense. I am not saying they are bad parents, but I do feel unhappy being with my family.

Since I study in England, I have two fronts to visit (Lithuania and US). Since a semester lasts about 2 months and afterwards I have 1 month vacation (yes, I am lucky for that and can spend time with my loved one) I do visit my girlfriend during the free time. Now I go back to the US during the summer vacation (which lasts roughly about 3 and a half months). I am right now in the US and I came here with my girlfriend.


Now I have noticed that my anxiety levels have risen since I finished highschool. First came the time when I helped my parents move to the US right after highschool. It was terrible to leave my girlfriend behind knowing that I will see her only after 4 months. Anyway, when we first moved to the US we lived at my grandparents house for about a few weeks. It was terrible, I really hate my grandfather. He is the definition of narcissisim. I was afraid of him and tried to avoid him aa much as I can. He was not abusive to me, not at all, but he had anger issues and tends to verbally attack (like my mother) others. We did finally find a house to move to but then again I had to work at the construction site with my grandfather and father. I was isolated, had no friends and anxious (about how my girlfriend feels and if we are ever going to be together again). 

The the two months passed. It was hell, I had never felt so isolated in my life. But then I travelled to England to start my studies. Again, had to adjust amd ect. Although, it was not that hard. Started to feel better.

Girlfriend and I held pretty good. Yes, we did have fights over facetime, even split up for like 2 weeks (2 weeks before I came to visit her during Christmas). Well she was herself in lot of stress (so was I, pretty intensive studies I have) but we managed to stay together and we still are happy together even if not always physically together.

I tend to overworry about my girlfriend. Not in the sense that she will cheat on me or something similar, I trust her. But what is bizzare, that my brain is wired in such a way that I am very afraid to lose her. Now almost everyday I worry and create scenes in my head where she tells me she is tired of waiting for me. I do feel guilty leaving for the studies and I am a super sensitive person. I am anxious about the day she is going to have to leave for studies, as I fear to never see her again. I think I have seperation anxiety. Most likley might be that we had to split up for some time and could not be there physically to stop this. I felt guilty she has to wait for me. 

Now we are in the US. Working at the same construction site but only with my father. Thank God.
But still have the same anxieties. Overworried about how my girlfriend feels with my tense family. I am afraid to disobey or argue with my mother. I am stressing about how my brother feels. He is clingy right now. I also feel that I left him for my studies and did not visit him often. I feel super anxious and lost. Always thinking about the worst, even my girlfriend tells me there is not problem and I am super sensitive.

Anyway, I am lost. Any advice how a super sensitive and anxious person who feel constant guilt should manage himself. Cheers

62,"Black being everyone is right/innocent/makes mistakes, and you being wrong all the time.

White is seeing the bright sides of you and your intentions. Validation is a great word to describe it.

I'm having a serious problem deciding which form is ideal for me. Being validated is extremely important for me. I always get the sense that there have to be some sorts of objections to your mind for your treatment to be successful, but I am getting really frustrated with that since all the ""maybe""'s and ""perhaps""'s of therapists is getting really over my head and it's just nonsensical to me. You know, the ""maybe they did not mean to do that"", or ""some people do not know how to express their anger"". I mean, who cares? Even if people ""do not know"" how to express their anger, the subtlety is really hurtful.

I may have anger issues, but it's only because I could never let out my anger on the right people. Even most therapists would invalidate my need to express my anger towards specific people, because they would say ""The anger is YOURS, and they do not necessarily contribute to the anger itself"", which is super and utter bull\*\*\*. This is also doubt-inducing, rather than confidence-breeding. More invalidation, so many of them that I am starting to wonder if this is really therapy. Also, that statement of theirs is rather capsuling, capsuling my anger away from others, that assshit is probably trying to get me to see a psychiatrist. They can forget it, it's their problem and their fault that they choose to see my issues as a part of me rather than having to do with the environment's true disgust and terrors, hidden beneath faces of subtlety",26Jul2018,1

My long distance boyfriend has been suffering crippling panic attacks and it absolutely breaks my heart to see him this way. I want to help him desperately but the distance makes it difficult because I can’t be physically present for him when things go wrong. We’ve eliminated as many triggers as possible and I give him all my attention when he’s experiencing an attack. I try to calm him and redirect his attention to other things, but it’s not always enough. I want to know if there’s anything more I can or should do so I can help him when he’s struggling.

65,"I have a job, that I kind of want to keep, but don't want to keep.

I want to travel, especially to move out of my parent's house, and am trying to save up money from my job and research and develop skillsets so that I can freelance or work odd jobs or do anything to make more money, since my factory job only brings in about $300 a week, but now I work for 10 hours until 2:00 AM, six days a week. It's great because it means more money, but it's bad because it means I get a lot less time to sleep and work towards other goals while also spending time with my family and working according to their schedule. Normally I would just quickly cook something and head out the door, but since my dad cooks, I want to, and feel obligated to wait 30 minutes to an hour for him to finish cooking, which acts as a major speed bump to my day.

The only time I get to exercise is when I go to the gym, which I can't easily do if I have to go right after eating, and now if I go to the gym after work, I may be out until 4 or 5 AM because it takes 30 minutes to drive to and from the town I work in, and then I also got to account for the hour I spend working out. And then I get conflicted about whether if I should spend money on the gym or not, since I'm trying to save up at least $1,500 for moving or travelling the country with. I'm trying to come up with ways for me to make money while travelling, but with my limited free time and distractions and bad habits, it's difficult.

Since living with my dad and starting my job, I've gained 30 pounds, I haven't had a social life, any attempt I make at connecting with someone is short-lived at best, I'm trying to start good habits like meditating, but I ended up vaping nicotine instead because holding a cigarette or cigarette-like thing and the nicotine gives me confidence and helps with my social anxiety. I hate the weekend because I don't know what to do with myself or where to go on the weekend. If I stay in my cramped house I get, I guess depressed. I just feel deeply sad. Yet I hate driving, I already have to drive half an hour to and from work, and sometimes driving gives me anxiety.

When I'm at work I feel almost fine. I get anxious that I'm not doing a good job, but I also feel optimistic thinking about the money I will make and my future goals, but when I get home, it's like ""whatever."" I've been getting less and less sleep, and when I wake up in the morning, my hands hurt, my back hurts, I feel like crying but I can't, and I just feel like I just want to go back to sleep.

I tried to look for psychiatrists in my area. I found one, but when I called, her asistant said that she was booked up until the end of August, but I don't even plan on being around that long. So I said screw it. I would find a psychiatirst online, but I doubt that I have time and money for that.

Anyways, I think I'm going to quit my job soon and travel to Texas or Colorado. It's just that I've been told that without a good plan to make money and without a job (which I plan to look for), there's a good chance I will end up homeless, but I don't care. I feel better when I'm travelling. I feel excited. And I'm sure that with the skills I do have and with the right mentality, even if I end up homeless, I'll survive, and I won't be homeless for long.",26Jul2018,1

I can't process anything without twisting or overcomplicating it, and I am afraid that this will only get worse and worse until I take my own life. I just wanted to vent somewhere because I have burned all of my bridges",26Jul2018,24
83,"I recall a past conversation with a friend where he mentioned that in his college years his anxiety eased up when he realized that everyone is going through a lot of the same insecurities. This knowledge never clicked with me. 

I believe it’s true but I don’t really understand other people’s existence outside of the moment. I mean I do, on some intellectual level, but there is some gap. For example, when I call a friend and they don’t pick up, I don’t think “they’re probably busy with dinner”, instead my mind begins to question whether I’ve wronged them somehow, maybe they’re avoiding me. 

I just feel lonely all the time and I’m scarred that the few relationships I value deeply are brittle. I have empathy but it seems to have been learnt through being bullied. I just can’t relate to people enough to form new friendships and my trivia knowledge sucks. I have nothing to talk about unless it involves politics or ethics.

Is there any specific disorder I may have?",26Jul2018,1
84,"Hey guys hope its okay to post this here if not i am sorry.

I just made a discord server called 'Gamers Anonymous'. It's an 18+ peer mental health server that is video game themed! If you like to game, talk about games, or are looking for some mental health support; this is the place for you.

This is a new server so we are still a small community trying to learn and grow

Our support team is filled by peer volunteers. We aim to maintain a safe and comfortable space. We are accepting of all diverse interests and diagnoses. Most importantly, you don't have to be a gamer to join! Thanks!

Gamers Anonymous: Care when you need it, care for others when you can.

86,"I am 14 years old, I of course live with my parents, and I think I might be developing an eating disorder. I have been shrinking my meals whenever I have the option to, and when my parents leave for something and I am alone I try to make myself throw up, I feel like I would do it more if I wasn't worried about my parents hearing me vomit, according to the BMI I am ""obese"" I weigh 146 at 5'4"" but feel like I weigh more than that.. I don't know what to do here",26Jul2018,1
87,"I can't afford a therapist right now at all. 
I can't afford medication. 
I have no friends to talk to or hang out with. 
Nobody seems to care about me or want me at all. 
I spend my days by myself with nobody wanting anything to do with me. 
I hate everything.
Nothing inspires me anymore. 
I honestly wish I had the strength to hurt myself, but I don't have the motivation to even do that. 
I'm so afraid that this won't stop. 
I've had feelings like this for years. 
It's never gotten better. 
I don't know what to do.

88,"I wrote a long ass post on the offmychest subreddit so read that if you wanna understand my situation more. Long story short, I've been trying to get a referral to a psychiatrist (or someone in the same vein) for years but the GPs never take me seriously. I've told them several times that I deal with suicidal thoughts and they've never done anything about it. I asked for a referral to someone who actually knows what they're talking about a few months ago and the doctor just arranged for me to see a therapist who had no qualifications to provide the answers I so desperately need.

I just don't understand what it takes before a doctor takes you seriously when it comes to mental health? Do I have to literally stand there with a knife to my throat before they realise that I need help?",26Jul2018,1
89,"So I'm standing in the kitchen making some food for me and my friends and I was using my phone to look something up and I thought I heard my phone in another room. Like, I heard it as if I butt dialed someone and they were trying to get my attention by yelling my name. I heard my moms voice, my dads, my sisters laughing. it freaked me out so I started searching for my phone, looking outside, like I could hear it even if it was outside. I was searching everywhere before realizing it was on the kitchen counter, and no one had called me. I already know I'm really mentally ill, but nothing like this has ever happened and it scared me so fucking bad. ",26Jul2018,82
