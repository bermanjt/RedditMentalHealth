0,"All my life I grew up just eating one meal a day (dinner). And my family hardly ever made breakfast or lunch, so it wasn't weird to me how little my family ate. Paired with my fast metabolism I was always underweight. I'm a guy btw 5'9"" 120lbs if it helps. Since I started going to my psychiatrist for ADHD, she always asks about my food habits and low-key tries to get me to admit to some sort of ED. I get she means well and doesn't know my life to the fullest, but one meal a day with a few healthy snacks here and there is odd apparently. Of course this way of eating does make me feel fat when I'm not my default skinny, but I'm not overwhelmed by it. I'm just like, oh I'm getting kinda pudgy lol",17May2018,3

Hi... I need to know if [the therapist organization](http://www.counselingandwellnesshelp.com/) we're going to is qualified to treat and diagnose personality disorders or mood disorders, as well as do effective couples therapy, or if we should just move on? **We've (mostly me) have had a few bad, seemingly unprofessional experiences so far and we do not feel satisfied with our treatment so far.** My ex's plan is limited but there should still be more options out there, she doesn't have the will to start searching again. We're putting our lives in these people's hands and we need to know how qualified they are or aren't for me, for my ex, and (hopefully, someday) for us.

So besides advice, I had a few questions as well:

1. What is a LCPC or Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor? What is their education level, their limits, etc?

2. Is there a difference between a therapist and a counselor?

3. My ex's self-help book on caretaking BP/NPs says that personality disorders are very hard to diagnose, that most therapists cannot diagnose BP/NP, that insurance companies do not pay therapists to treat an ""incurable disease."" How much of this is true?


A little bit of context. I tried not to go into too much detail below but the gist of it is:
&gt; We met online and we've deeply cared for each other for years, we've helped each other grow and been there for each other during bad times, but we have BPD-like attachment issues that have torn us apart
&gt; Assuming she has BPD, she researches effective therapies and finds out about CBT. She finds a place that claims to practice CBT
&gt; We moved in together March, she left April after having an episode where she locked herself in her room thinking I was killing her (I've never hit anyone in my life)
&gt; We had already agreed to couples therapy beforehand, so we had one and a half sessions
&gt;First session is OK, counselor says I shouldn't see him because he doesnt' want to ""triangulate"" 
&gt; Get therapy sessions with ex's LCPC counselor, I show him the card the receptionist gave me with the appointment date, he didn't say no to this
&gt; Yet when I get there for my appointment I find out I don't have an appointment anyway (did he cancel the appointment? Idk.) so my ex and I waste 40 minutes of our day. He wants me to see his Adlerian clinical psychotherapist colleague...?
&gt; The second session was terrible, nothing was accomplished, counselor just let us bicker like an old married couple for an hour, then he antagonized me because he's taking my ex's off-day depressed statements at face value (never loving me, etc.) He has a very shallow understanding of our years-long relationship and he can't even seem to remember what my ex tells her in their sessions!
&gt; Counselor says my ex is manipulating her(???), concludes I'm toxic (after two sessions) and tells her to cut me off from her life (this happened yesterday)
&gt;Ex has a nervous breakdown after her devaluating splitting emotions of me feel validated, and she no-contacts me
&gt; After the LCPC snubbed me, I'm still expected to have my first appointment at the same place tomorrow with an Adlerian clinical psychotherapist. I need to know if I should cancel or not. (I would have to walk anyway, ex took the car.)


If this bias from the therapist seems a bit far-fetched, well, my fears were confirmed yesterday when he said that he'd ask me to stay outside instead of having a couples therapy session we've requested. My ex texted me last night:

&gt; Her:
&gt; The therapist said that if you had come today he would have asked you to let me go in alone.  He said I've just been manipulating him into saving me.  He said the relationship is toxic and he doesn't know why I haven't cut you off.  He said the way you spoke to me really bothered him and that he watched you try to control me and talk me out of my feelings.


So she told me off, swore at me, called me a piece of shit, leech, liar, etc., then blocked me. Told me she doesn't want to move back in anymore after all the planning we'd done, some of her stuff is still here, she still has to check our mail here (one mail key), etc... and she's still burning through finances and giving away all her stuff, not even selling it. I'm hoping she comes to her senses and comes back. And sooner than later, but I can't take much of this rollercoaster anymore. But I have no choice, for many reasons it would be too long to get into. (trust me I spent hours working on this post and it just became a huge ramble.)

And worst of all what kind of therapist or counselor accuses their patients of manipulation, and judges your loved ones in less than 2 hours? *Isn't the point of going to therapy to be saved in a way?!* ***What is going on???***

Now I have to go there tomorrow at 11 to start my own therapy at the same office where my no-contact ex is going to see a counselor that's urging her to cut me off completely. No ""triangulation"" at all...

I'm also hurt, I'm frustrated, and most of all I'm lost. I don't know what to do. I have no friends and no family to turn to, I'm stuck here without a car or roommate or a job, and my situation with the most important person in my life is just chaotic. 

If that's all the info you need then please let me know what to do. If not I can post a potentially TMI amount. Thank you.",17May2018,2

3,"So, I have had BPD for quite a while, but I have just recently been diagnosed, along with the anxiety and depression that usually goes along with it. I am just wondering what other people's experiences have been who have BPD. I am in a funk right now, just feeling pretty depressed and having large feelings of emptiness, impulsivity, etc. It is just getting so frustrating, and I'm on medication, but of course no medication can cure BPD. I have trouble functioning in a relationship, I can barely talk with my parents without becoming angry, I lie a lot, I can barely control myself (with thoughts, feelings, anxiety, etc), I can't focus...it's just gotten out of control. Any tips on dealing with this? I have a therapist and a psych but i'm awful at talking with people and I tend to tone things down and not always tell the truth (which is bad, I know).",17May2018,1

Left everything until the last day on purpose, didn’t do anything the entire day and so decided to go to bed at 8pm, wake up at 2am and study until the exam (at 10am). But I can’t get myself to study and I *know* I’m doing this on purpose and I know it’s me self sabotaging myself and I’m going to end up failing now because of my stupid unresolved issues and I don’t really know what to do anymore. I’m thinking of just sleeping for a bit again as it’s useless trying to get myself to concentrate.

7,"I have been on medication for 442 days now. You could say I run on it. I have tried to stop taking it before and It doesn’t work. It’s like trying to swim in open water during a storm. My medication is my life raft and while the sea is still rough at least I’m above water. In the recent year or so I’ve tried to be more open about my illness to connect to people out there that felt isolated like I did. I suppose I want something good to come from all this. The earliest I can remember feeling this way was 12 years old, I don’t remember what it feels like to feel happy anymore but, I’m working towards that goal. Therapy has helped a lot, I remember being reluctant at first because I had heard so many bad things but honestly it was the best decision I ever made. 

I don’t know what I’m trying to say with all of this. I wanted to put something out there for Mental Health Awareness Month. I want you to know if you are reading this you aren’t out to sea alone, there are others out there fighting the storm trying to get back to land with you.

10,"So I guess a little brief backstory, I’m 21 F, USA Ohio. currently in college for graphic design. I love drawing it’s my passion. I’m pretty shy and introverted regularly.  I’m not aware of any family history of mental illnesses, I know my mom has mentioned before that when my grandmother didn’t take her medication she would get really bitchy, like she would not be enjoyable to be around but I was never told what exactly she was taking the medication for. I remember my mom saying something about my grandmother being bipolar, but I’m not sure if that was factual or just her guessing, and my father also has some anger issues, not diagnosed with anything though. I Had a relatively normal upbringing, parents divorced when I was around 6-7. I have an amazing mom that I’m really close with, 7 siblings total (some half, one full blood brother) pretty normal I would say. 
 however within the past year or so I’ve noticed patterns in my own behavior that worry me. It’s not that these patterns have developed over the course of just a year, but that it’s been the past year I’ve really started to noticed them. 

I don’t want to say for sure that I think it could be Bipolar disorder because I’m not a professional psychiatrist, but i want to get other people’s opinions because if I can maybe explain my experience, and get an idea of what it might be, maybe I can get it under control IF it even is anything, before it causes disruptions in my life. And also, if anyone else is having a similar experience they can learn from what you guys have to say. 

I’m going to try and explain it to the best of my ability. 

So I’ve noticed that I have days, it can be anywhere from one day to that whole week where I feel really inspired and motivated and everything is just looking up. It’s this really euphoric feeling that seems like it’s never going to end. I don’t do crazy stuff like go on shopping sprees or do anything drastic like you usually hear about with BPD, but it’s more of me feeling more confident and inspired and talkative than usual. I bounce back and forth between different things I wanna do because I can’t decide which one I want to do because I’m so excited to do all of them, like for example, a few days ago when I was feeling really good, I kept bouncing around in my room, going from my guitar because I was feeling really inspired to write a song, to my drawing board because I wanted to start a new drawing, then to my computer because I for some reason wanted to start a YouTube channel. now this might sound like a good thing, but the problem was I couldn’t stay focused on one before getting distracted with and moving on to the other before I could make any progress on anything. 
I have this general, “I can take on the world right now!” Kind of feeling that is just constant for days. I don’t sleep as much because I’m excited to get up early and get started on the next project I have planned in my head. 


And then I have days like I’ve been having since yesterday, going on till today and I’m writing this at 11:30pm. I call these days the “funk” 

I get really agitated, at everything. I have mood swings between anger and sadness.

I eat ALOT more than usual, like all the time I’m snacking. Even when not hungry.

 I get really emotional and want to cry. It’s like this feeling like all my problems are accumulating, and they are just to big to burden and there’s no light at the end of the tunnel. I know I have a great life, family and boyfriend. I have a roof over my head, plenty of food, a job and the opportunity to attend college to pursue my passion. I know ALL of this but still I can’t shake that feeling of dread and helplessness when I get in these funks. 

I don’t enjoy art as much, like today I was trying to get this drawing started that my brother asked me to do. I normally get really excited and really into my drawings, but today I just couldn’t get into it. I eventually just scrapped it and decided to start over. 

I get less talkative during these funks, it’s like people will try conversing with me but I just can’t muster anything more than a basic answer and that’s about it, if that makes any sense? I’m just not very talkative. Which I’m shy usually, but it’s more than a shy thing, it’s like I don’t even want to converse. Then I feel terrible for it, because people who interact with me probably think it was something against them, when it was really me.

I just a general apathetic period, these usually don’t last quite as long as the euphoric periods, but they are intense. 

Now it isn’t a constant switch back and forth for me, I usually am in a regular normal mood most of the time, but I find that what happens is I will get in the really good phase and that will last for a few days and then the “Funk” usually follows immediately. 

I can’t tell you what triggers either one. 

Maybe I am just a really sensitive person, so whenever something good happens I feel euphoric things the following days afterwards? But that doesn’t explain the “funks” I get in after. 

What do you guys think? Sorry this was so long but it’s so hard to explain everything in just a short paragraph without omitting important details.

12,"Sorry for the vague title, but it's accurate. I'm scared. Of everything. I'm scared of my own thoughts because a lot of times they don't make sense. They race and have no direction. I can't focus. I'm scared of the world around me because most of the time it doesn't feel real. Sometimes it feels far away and like I'm watching it from somewhere else, or someone else's eyes. 

I'm scared of how I could feel tomorrow, because it all feels so volatile. One moment I'm on top of the world and everything is possible, and the next I'm so depressed and numb that I don't see myself ever feeling better. Even though I know that's not true, I can't convince myself of anything else. I feel like I have no control over my mind. 

I couldn't sleep the other night and at around five in the morning, the light was beginning to come in through the window and I suddenly felt afraid again. I convinced myself that time had stopped and would never continue, and I would just be trapped there forever in that moment. That time was just an illusion and the illusion had been broken. 

I dream very vividly and sometimes my dreams feel more real than my waking life. It takes me hours just to orient myself in the morning and convince myself that the things around me are real. I sleep a lot because what I see there feels more certain, more concrete.  

I'm scared to get help with this because I can't afford therapy. I have tried medication in the past and it helped for a while and then made me suicidal. I have tried free therapy and the person I saw victim blamed me (I was in an abusive relationship for four years). 

It's not always like this. I have clear moments, and moments where I feel more hopeful. I have a loving family who have helped me through so much. But I'm scared that these strange ways I feel will get worse and worse.

Right now, I'm struggling really hard with my own self hatred. Something my parents instilled in me. It's keeping me from losing weight because I get started, I get motivated and then I hear my parents and siblings telling me I'm just a fat piece of shit, why bother? I can't seem to silence their voice. I've had panic attacks about it, my therapist just says 'ignore it' but honestly, I can't seem to tune them out. 

I want to lose weight, I'm 34 and it's only going to get harder, but how do you tell those voices off? How do you convince yourself you're worth it? My friends have told me they like me, and think I'm great but I can't convince myself that they aren't just saying it... because it's happened before. 

It also fuels my slight agorophobia, making it hard to go out and exercise because i think the world will just laugh at me too. :/

19,"So several years ago when I was still in high school my mom began to have some subtle signs off some form of psychosis. At first she thought that our neighbors were listening in on her using some form of listening device. At the time my dad and I thought that this was just some ridiculous train of though that would wear itself out (which I now know I was wrong in thinking that), my sister however kind of went along with it mostly out of sympathy. A few years pass and my mothers mental health deteriorates. Her paranoia gets worse and she begins to think that the neighbors are breaking in the house causing problems, miss placing things, and following us, specifically her. On my second year of college, that summer she suffers a stroke, and then a second one the following year. Her paranoia gets worse and worse. The neighbors become the topic of nearly every conversation she has, she has trouble sleeping staying up all night trying to catch them in the act. We have tried to get her to talk to a therapist and she totally refuses to acknowledge that anything is wrong and gets extremely upset when we suggest to her to get some help. One day, three days before Christmas in fact, she calls the police thinking there is someone in her house, not the first time she has done this, this time however the cops take her to a mental hospital where she stays for a few days. She believes that our neighbors own and run the facility (no evidence or course) and the nurses that were working there said she suffers from psychotic depression and suicidal ideations. Btw this is not the first time that a professional doctor or nurse has said she has psychotic depression. A few days after she got home me and my dad try to convince her that was she is imagining is not real then she started crying particularly about how no one believes here, and at that moment I told her that I did believe her, I'm not sure if that was the right decision or not btw. Now my mom has not gotten any better and she still refuses to believe any of us. It is driving my dad crazy and stressing him out. I hate that my mom continuous to suffer from this and I fear another stroke that could kill her. I also feel bad for my dad who has to deal with this, both me and my sister do not live with them anymore and my mom does and has always been suspicious of others and spends too much time by herself, she doesn’t speak English very well.

20,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/4ql87t/can_momentary_stress_cause_angina_pectoris/ - look at this post I posted two years ago. I recalled an old incident (seven years ago) when I was 21 and my grandmother 69, she insulted me and I pour hot coffee on her as a surprise. She has chronic cardiac problem like hypertonia and a month after the incident afterwards I was shocked her results from the heard doctor saf she has angina pectoris. back then I fell in a horrific deep depression because I decided, right there, on the double, that I have caused this condition. After this depression period I somehow managed to pull myself together up but for years I never forgot about this incident untill almost two years ago when it started haunting me again, so I posted the story in the AskDocs reddit and the people there incudling a physician explained to me  agina pectoris needs years and decades to develop, so my guilt trip is pointless and I need a therapist. Their explanation made me forget about this... but here I am again again I still recall, because it was a terrible thing to do, to pour your hot coffee during a verbal fight on your elder grandma, she was shocked and angry and stayed all day in bed for two days. So my OCD minds keep bugging me, tells me there still might be something between hear health and the incident, not to mention that it is an uncanny coincidence she was diagnosed with the angina a month after the coffee thing? She probably had it from before since she has cardiac problems since she was 10 and has hypertonia for decades, but still this coincidence is triggering the obsessive wondering on my guilt. Or my OCD goes like ""well what if the stress by the coffee triggered her thyroid problems"" as two years later she was diagnosed with low thyroid function. I have OCD and all the evidence in the world won't calm my mind. Also for these two years that I didnt feel guilty about her, the OCD changed into a fear of her death, no guilt, just the death, lbeing afraid of the pain I feel, or making me feel absurd feeling like f.e. there is no point to study for a career change or find a girlfriend since she is old and could die in ten years, but f.e. even next year...

26,"My parents were heavily conservative Mormons growing up. My father in particular sought to cover up anything that would weaken the family image and basically pretended misfortunes never happened, even when they did occur. For example, when my mother committed suicide, he went about telling everyone she died from a terminal illness rather than admitting the truth. He also kept my mother’s previous marriage a secret from me until I was 19-years-old and demanded and even made threats to extended family members and friends to maintain this secrecy. Having taken all of this into consideration, I am doubtful I can obtain an honest answer from anyone who would have been aware of these possible allegations I’m about to delve into. I’m curious if there is any way or means to find out if I was indeed assaulted as a child?

(GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW)

At age 6 I recall being diagnosed with Condyloma acuminatum (genital warts) around my anus (yes, this is on my medical records). I remember my mother being extremely distraught over this and my father telling me I could tell no one of it, though I was clearly unaware at the time as to what this might imply. From then on I was an extremely shy child. I was submissive, irritable, terrified of being alone, subject to flagrant bullying, and absolutely hated to be touched (except when I wanted other kids to hold me down). Even as an adult in my mid-twenties I continue to have an issue with touching and more specifically intimate contact. Between the ages of 6 and 8, I would ask classmates to tie me up or hold me down and by the time I was 12 I had fantasies of being bound, dominated, and penetrated; which I have disclosed to no one until this post. I’m taking this all into consideration in regards to my younger cousin who came out of the closet about 3 years ago. At the same time it was revealed his older half brothers had molested him when he was extremely young. Is it rational to consider a correlation here?

Honestly, right now I’m unsure if these thoughts are rational or simply delusions. Looking back on my life and childhood from a now adult perspective, I’m realizing I was never anything close to a normal, healthy child. And having delved into psychology and developmental biology courses, I’ve also realized I had/have many of the red flags of a child who was sexually abused, though I do admit I have no recollection of any such event(s). Was I sexually assaulted as a child, and more specifically is there any way I can tell through testings, screenings, etc if this is indeed the case? As I stated before, relying on the testimonies of family and close friends who may be aware is significantly unreliable at this time. If this indeed happened, my father would have undoubtedly sought to cover this up at all costs and have pretended it never happened.

32,"Hi, 

I wanted to know if anyone else experiences what I do. 
Sometimes if I’m lying in bed, or somewhere quiet, lost with just me myself and I. 

I start to hear things around me, however it’s extremely loud and forward. Everything around me feels intense. I can feel my body shaking and my mind seems like I’m in a tunnel. With things happening all around me inside the tunnel, like I’m on a subway in rush hour. It’s almost like an anxiety attack, however I’m sitting by myself with nothing around, with no trigger. 

I sometimes hear my parents in my head shouting or my mum screaming. It’s like my thoughts are screaming at me. 

I also get the feeling as if I were the slender man, holding my phone. As I type, it’s like my phone is far away, and I’m typing away, focussing on each key press. And each key press is like an explosion of sound and feeling. 

I get stuck in this headspace for a while but I either fall asleep or snap back into my normal self. 

It’s extremely hard to describe, I did my best, I’m just wondering if someone can relate or feels the same sometimes. I do have depression/anxiety, however the anxiety is quite mild and rarely have panic attacks. When I do it is when I feel trapped. 

I’m blabbing on now, just typing whatever comes to mind. 

Let me know! I’d love to hear a few of your opinions. ",17May2018,1

I’m not exactly capable of denying or rejecting the notion of having such a thing, as I have felt for some time now that something fairly serious was going on; and from all that I was told by my psychologist and all that I’ve subsequently read online a lot of the indications for DID match up really well with a lot of the things I’ve been noticing and experiencing. However, I would like to hear from anyone whose also been diagnosed with DID, and find out what their experiences have been, just to see if I can get a better general idea of what it actually feels like to have to have this disorder, as opposed to how it presents professionally in books and on paper.

38,"I'm not sure whether this is the best place to post this, or whether I should post in r/relationships. Basically I was just hoping someone might be able to provide me with some relationship advice. 

I have generalised anxiety disorder, low self esteem and depression (Dr diagnosed), with controlling parents. I have episodes of disordered eating (self diagnosed). My boyfriend has whats been diagnosed as an emotional split personality. As far as I understand it, it manifests itself in having periods of time where he cuts himself off from people, gets extremely depressed, drinks a lot, doesn't want to talk to anyone, and gets annoyed at people caring. He has said that he feels people treat him like he can't do stuff for himself/""treat him differently"" because of his diagnosis, and are ""getting too involved by caring"". Generally, he lacks empathy - the opposite to me who's an emotional wreck half the time! 

As his girlfriend, and someone who already never feels good enough, I'm struggling as I want to be helpful and kind and caring and supportive to him (he's currently in a job he hates). Yet he was having a bad day yesterday and said that the only happiness he gets is from impulse buying. He has however also said to me I make him want to better himself, I've taught him how to love again, I mean the world to him and I've been his rock recently. It's so hard to reconcile the latter with the fact he doesn't like people caring about him, or helping him as he sees it as a weakness. 

My anxiety makes me feel like I'm useless if I can't help him and support him. And then I feel sad that he doesn't want to turn to me for help. 

Is anyone else in a relationship with someone with a split personality? I feel like it's hard to know what s ""real"" as I get so many mixed messages from him. I don't know much about the condition, so any further input would be much appreciated  

Thank you. ",17May2018,1

40,"I grew up as a normal, only child. Everything about me was pretty ordinary up until about 7th grade, except an (embarrassing to admit) extreme tendency to lie.  I don’t know why I still lie, or have lied in my past.  Some things I don’t lie about anymore.  I can’t even tell you the last lie I made, but I tend to be a compulsive liar who loves to deny it.   Majority of the lies are to my parents.  


My parents really do love me,  but sometimes it’s hard to see.  They’re very stressed people, who have sacrificed and worked their asses off to send me private school since 5th grade.  They knew I was incredibly gifted academically at that point, so they viewed it as worth it.  I instantly started holding myself to high expectations because of my guilt of what they were giving up to send me to school. They never told me they wanted me to be making at least this amount of money and be this successful when I grow up, so my extreme expectations for myself to be making six figures and attend a prestigious college was my own.  


In 6th grade, my first problems began to show.  The feeling and need to write perfectly and do things in a nice looking way started plaguing my efficiency.  Also, I began a trend that I would continue all the way through my academic career — the loss of motivation and drop of grades towards the end of the year.  

In 7th grade, I mentioned to my parents that I had attention issues.  They weren’t extreme at all, but I found it easy to use as an excuse for performing poorly in my math class.   “Plus, so what if I get some medication for attention?”  was what I was thinking.  Sure enough, I went on ritalin and despite being put on the highest dosage, I never really felt anything from it.  Sure, my grades were a little better, but honestly I never focused more.   To this day, I don’t feel like my body responds to amphetamines normally.  


In 8th grade, my compulsive traits went crazy.  I had pretty bad grades, and I started to losing the dedication to complete assignments for school.  I wasn’t sad, or dealing with an excessive amount of stress.  I just didn’t care.  I would rather do anything else.  At the time, I preferred to just play games on my computer.  All though 5-8 grade, I wasn’t popular.  But, I wasn’t unpopular.  I really only desire to be respected, and not hated by anybody.  I don’t care if I’m popular or not.  I began spiraling out of control.


9th grade was a disaster.  Grade wise, I did OK.  But, as a former straight A student, I was doing horribly.  My dedication and motivation to do anything except play on my computer, and anything other than school work got worse.  I ended up leaving the school after they didn’t put me in challenging classes that I wanted to be in.  The move was a good thing for me in the end though.


This year I started at a new private school.  I like all of my teacher, and the guys who I go to school with.  I feel like I gained my first real friends.  Although, I never fully trust anybody.  But, I look out for them.  I’m semi-popular despite being new, and it’s because I became friends with the most popular guy in my class, but because I started smoking weed with him mid-year.  This was the first time I’ve smoked, and it was around the very few friends I have.  I still don’t have the motivation to do homework nearly at all, but weed actually really helped me.  I found something to look forward to all the time.  My parents knew I was smoking eventually, but started cracking down because of drug testing at possible future job.  I stopped because I don’t have much money on me to even spend on weed.  I started raiding the medicine cabinet to find something I could get high off of.   I’ve since abused lorazepam, diazepam, DXM, my current ADD medicine (Vyvanse), snorting ritalin (literally didn’t even affect me, I just did it because I wanted something to look forward to so badly), and more.  I don’t plan to stop anytime soon, either.  Honestly, I’m losing the motivation to even write this.  I don’t know what to do.

I went on anti depressants and I went along with it to be able to use it as an excuse to explain poor grades.  I stopped taking them once I found out they could interfere with drugs I want to abuse, such as DXM.  Although, I prefer being off of them.  I don’t feel emotionally numb.  Whatever, I don’t know what’s wrong with me.  Psychologist doesn’t know, and I don’t want to go to a therapist because my psychologist acts like one.  Therapist visit might stop me from getting a job.  I don’t even fucking know.


What set me off and gave me the motivation to write this is that, when I was taking my daily medication, my parents shoved it into my hands and I put them into my mouth when I realized I briefly noticed Zoloft in there.  They tried to trick me into fucking taking it.  It didn’t help me, I don’t want to take it.   I even made up side effects I was experiencing to the doctor and them, which would make me as a parent never make my kid take it.  I fucking hate my life. ",17May2018,2

Today, after over a year without treatment, as stuff got worse for me, I went to the GP to try and get some actual psychotherapy or something through the NHS (I live in the UK). And all I got was a referral to the exact same kind of useless counselling.

47,"I truly don’t know what to do anymore. **I feel at a complete loss.** My partner has been struggling with what was initially diagnosed as BP1 for around 7 years. He believes he was misdiagnosed, but I can tell you some of his symptoms—he is often depressed, has issues waking up in the morning and can barely handle working two days a week. He's easily affected by external stimuli—delayed trains or bad weather threaten to derail him. He has severe health/body anxiety—right now he has a pesky shoulder injury that he has complained about for years but hasn’t gotten the right treatment \(he’ll say it’s bc doctors fail him, but I believe he isn’t advocating well\). Lately the injury has consumed him. He will struggle greatly for a few days, constantly talking about the injury and what it could be and his frustration about it. He will repeatedly feel his muscles on both sides of his body and stare in the mirror and ask me if he looks uneven, even when I try to talk to him about other things.

Like many people in a relationship \(often women, but not always\), I do a lot of invisible or emotional my house \(almost everything\). I pay the bills and worry about the cats and the loans and our taxes and our groceries and I clean and cook and provide financial support \(I work over 50 hours a week\). This has always been a bone of contention between us—my partner believes that we have built a problematic relationship where he feels incapable of anything. We discussed this in therapy months ago after a depressive episode of his caused me to have a breakdown and cheat. From my perspective, he can barely handle the few things on his plate now, so why would I give him more to do?

Anyway, I tried to tell him how stressed I was feeling last night, after a string of days of him only really talking to me to complain or get help with appointments led to me feeling pretty empty. I wanted to talk to him bc the last time I felt so empty, I was unfaithful, and I didn’t want to do that again. Naturally it became a major fiasco. He accused me of calling him useless and attempted to try and end things under the guise of ridding me of worrying about him. I repeatedly tried to reason with him, but it continued to worsen. When he is angry he repeats things constantly, and doesn’t retain anything other than a sentence or two of mine that were negative. I must have tried to clarify a dozen times—he continued to repeat the same sentence I said \(that he didn’t do anything and couldn’t work and was useless\) until I began to get angry. As soon as he saw me get angry, he upped the ante. He began to remind me I was a cheater and pathetic and a c\*nt and mocked my reactions to those words. He said he was going to leave, that we were always doomed, and that I should go sleep with someone else about it. We argued for hours. It ended with me getting very, very angry and exploding.

Now i feel desperate to fix things and scared of where it’s going to go—am I trapped in an emotional abuse cycle? Why do I feel so desperate to fix things after he acted in such a manner? He is not always or only this man, he has so many layers and can be so genuinely kind...but why am I okay with what happened? He seems like he’s going to be the one to cut the cord right now and that petrifies me—what is wrong with me?",17May2018,3

There are reasons to feeling this way but beside all those, there's just isn't a legitimate one. I just feel it. Feel this melancholy. Constantly.

Self-diagnosed, I like to think that I'm dealing with Dysthymia. But IRL I can't really say anything about them or explain it, how serious or mild it is, how true or missing it is. I know my diagnosed condition generally includes Alexythymia into it but I'll keep that enshrouded for now.

This is just me confessing though. Not really seeking for any help eventhough I know that I actually need help. I'm not suicidal nor this message implies it. Even that I have had been close somewhat, I'm a coward at harming myself and never had any negative outcome from it so far. Just want to let my word out there. Just knowing someone reading it maybe is enough for me to feel lifted I guess.

I've been reading philosophy and some self-help tips and I'm glad that it actually helped me control my emotions better up to this time. The only thing I find myself missing is being redundant.

55,"Wrote this last night, woke up hungover and with little memory of writing it with some drawings of skeletons (average depressed anorexic art student shenanigans) next to it. I remember thinking that I was really poetic, now it just looks self gratifying and sad. Eh. Here is my drunk poem, as typed out (took ages) by sober me.
Ahem:

I hate everything about myself. 

I hate my face, it's round and podgy and when I smile I look like I'm faking it and my cheeks are flushed all the time so I feel like I'm lying to people when this sweet little doll starts breaking them down. My face betrays every thought I have of  'don't worry, you'll be a man someday' because I look at it and see the face of a gluttonous childish pig.

 I hate my eyes, they don't tell a word so when people try to see my soul hidden away all they see is the two icy blocks that protect me.

I hate my chest, the two gross mounds of skin that show my sins, the things that I hope to starve away but still stay because they remind me of my failure even to self-destruct. They scream at me that I'm not who I hide behind online, that my body and mind cannot be in time to one another.

I hate my stomach, it folds and rolls with my movement, weighing me down and showing me my own faults every time I look to the ground and it's there, stopping my vision, so vivid is the idea that I could stop this if I stopped what keeps me living.

I hate my legs, flabby and pale and weak not supporting my hips, made for a child that will never come, that stop me from being who I feel I should be they drag me down into pity and into the habits that bring me to this state.

I hate my brain, my brain that forces a mask of hatred and anger that pushes everyone away, that forces everyone to believe that he could never have something wrong with his mind, the mask that I hide behind constantly pushing back into my head and before I am dead I need to tear it off but when I try others don't believe me when I cry out for help they only see it as a mockery and turn their heads from the broken, angry, bitter mess on the floor who's sobbing behind closed doors and breaking down others so he can hide his own suffering. 

I hate my voice, that says things wrong and gives away my weakness as it regurgitates opinions of others into one mess of malignant malice that cannot show his own true self to others, cannot speak how he feels if he tries and backs and stutters and doesn't say the whole truth until the time's tides have turned and he is left behind, drowning in a sea of his own words.

I hate my hands that write poetic nonsense that sounds formulated and fake despite the fact that it's my mind churning over my anger in a rhyme to stop my thoughts from spilling over into a mess so inconceivably broken that no one can see it's purpose. 

I hate the fact that no one will see this and that even if they do it doesn't matter since the few that will have no affect on the ones that mean so much to me. I hate my malice and I hate my envy, I hate my attempts at empathy and the empty lack of that which I desire so much of in others in myself as it's a criticism that I take to heart everyday.

I hate to the depth of my soul that I've sat here writing poetry of a kind in one go with countless spelling mistakes in a book that no one knows I use, that no one cares about whilst the people I care about know nothing about what I'm going through.

I fucking hate myself for being proud of writing this out, for taking a step to confess my hatred as I know that pride leads to fall and I fall so often that I can't remember what it feels like to rise. 

I hate how everything has to be a poem in my head so I'm not just rambling worthless words onto a page or a screen, I'd scream for someone to see what I mean but instead I just write away.

I hate that I need to write this, that I can't just tell my fucking therapist, whose job it is to listen or my friends who I know would accept me. 

I hate that I can't end this, that I'm too filled with cowardice to end it. I hate that when I tried to overdose twice I just woke up a day or so later with a headache. I hate that my therapist told me I was faking, that I've thought for so long that I've been wasting everyone's time.
I hate that I'm a waste of time.

I fucking hate it.

56,"This is a long, long read, so if you make it through, good on you! I am married with two kids, but most days I honestly couldn't care less about any of them. If they all left tomorrow I don't think I would be affected at all, I would be relieved I can go back to living my life how I want to, without the responsibility of parenthood or being a good husband. I currently stay at home with them most of the time while I am finishing up my degree, and I am perfectly content with them going to play in the playroom or dick around on youtube kids all day (one is 3 1/2, other will be 1 in a few weeks). I just want to play on the computer, or do my own shit when I am at home with them. I have no interest in doing crafts with them, or taking them to the park, though I sometimes will do it out of guilt or to make it look like I am being a good parent. 


I rarely ever plan things for my wife on her birthday, mothers day, valentines etc etc... I just don't care. I rarely plan for anything at all, so I never think ahead about that stuff. I will usually make a panic purchase of some type to show I thought about her and not get the disappointment talk or lectured, but I wouldn't ever do it if there was no consequence for not doing it. Like, I don't really know if I love her. I used to do things for her when we were first married, I was in the military and had all the time in the world to try and impress her and get kudos. Once we had the kids and started my stressful degree, I just want to do what I want to do with the time I have, I have no regards for keeping balance and it depresses me when I can't just dick around playing poker, or watching movies, or playing some game when I want to. 


I get really angry when the kids aren't sleeping well or they are being needy/crying/acting out. I don't hit them, but I have punched many holes in the wall or dents in doors and am constantly slamming shit around. Its worse in the middle of the night whjen one is sleeping bad. I am the one getting up with them most of the time, and when I am not getting enough sleep I turn into a beast. It was the absolute worst when they were young (the infant is getting better). I might have actually hit one of them I get so mad, but I know the consequences of that, so I end up hitting myself in the leg or as I said before, the walls. Outside of them waking up I don't get that mad, I am fairly apathetic to most things. 


I don't really have any friends, I haven't had a friend I would call to catch up with or anything like that in a long, long time. My friends from high school until I joined the military were just people I'd do drugs with, I wouldn't just hang out for any other reason. Once I joined the military, people reached out but I never took them up on it, I would just do my own thing and be content with it. I talk to my parents maybe once every three months briefly, though they try to talk to me a few times every month, but I just ignore it. I don't want to talk to them, I couldn't really say why, they weren't bad parents and they gave me everything I needed growing up, but I still don't care to talk to them. I barely ever talk to my brother, like once every six months. We were never close so we fell apart. 


I used to steal money from my parents wallets, or sneak weed from my brother and friend's bags, steal games and toys from the store, broke into my neighbors houses a few times, all of this without getting caught (except by my parents). Most recently I stole oxycontin at work. A patient either died or left it behind when they discharged along with a bunch of other meds they brought from home and it got put in the lost &amp; found section. Nobody did anything about it, so I looked in and saw those and took them. I don't even like oxy's, but I took them and will take one every few months. I cheat on my tests at school by using test banks, or I will flub my homework when possible by using quizlet to get the answers or even edit the HTML to reflect I completed whatever if I just need to send a screenshot to confirm its completion. I don't care that I cheat, I just want to get it done as easily as possible. I got caught cheating on tests in the military for an advanced school I was in, and they kicked me out of the training and I just did my regular job (a medic).

I regularly forget to pay bills, or just ignore them until they can't be avoided. My car registration is expired by two years, I have gotten a ticket for it and had to go to court for failure to appear, but I still haven't gotten the registration taken care of. I just try my hardest to avoid cops. I would print a fake registration just to not get caught if I could. I can't just renew it online anymore, I have to go to the tax office, which is too much work so I don't do it. I have like 3-4 unpaid bills right now, I will forget to pay the sewer bill even though I know about it and get my water shut off, then pay the fee to get it turned back on, then hopefully remmeber to pay it before they turn it off again next time. 

So as you can see, there's a lot of traits of antisocial I know I display, but there's a lot more I don't. I have never been in a fight in my life, I avoid conflict whenever possible. I care for animals a lot, I feel like there's never been a cat or dog I met that I didn't get a long with right away, like I put them at ease or something. I have never been in trouble with the law for anything more than traffic tickets or one misdemeanor charge for negligent discharge of a firearm (was shooting a .22 in my backyard, it hit a neighbors window). I am good with people, I was a medic in the military and I am now getting a nursing degree, currently working as a medical assistant as needed. I will make sure my patients get everything they need and I will go above and beyond to help them, not necessarily for them though, but because I want to be considered thorough and good at what I do. I have gotten a lot of accolades for my performance and am considered one of the best on my floor. I got a lot of awards in the Navy for my hard work as well. I can talk to people well and a lot of people think my black, dark humour is hilarious. I go to church with (for) my wife, I go to events and hang out with the guys from my bible study group sometimes, but I don't really have any strong religious beliefs, I wouldn't consider myself a Christian even, I just do it for her. It hurts me to see my kids cry, unless I am in my blistering anger state, and I try my best to comfort them when they get hurt or are upset for whatever reason. 

It's these traits that make me think I don't have fullblown antisocial disorder, but I am on a spectrum of it or something. Some days I would be content just abandoning everything, but I don't think I could live with myself abandoning my kids and them not having a father in their lives, but sometimes I think they'd be better off without me being a fuck up. I don't know what to do... I think of suicide but not very seriously. If it happened it would be a spur of the moment thing, like I fuck up majorly and just grab a gun and shoot myself before thinking about the consequences. I don't know how big the fuck up would have to be though, but I could do it. 


I have killed before, when I was deployed I shot someone. I didn't feel anything, I was glad they died and I didn't. I could do it again, but not just innocent people like shooting up a school or something stupid, more like a vigilante taking out bad guys and not feeling remorse for killing them. It's fucked up, I know...",17May2018,1
57,"Hello,

I’m a 22-years old male, whos in a bit of a fickle. About a month back, i was finishing my university exchange abroad and getting ready for a trip with a friend of mine and a couple of his friends that i wasn’t acquinted with, from his exchange. Prior to this trip i had, for some reason (final exams, going on a trip with strangers etc) developed a slight anxiety, which i wasn’t able to pinpoint exactly. I was sure that this anxiety would go away when i finished my exams (like my anxiety usually does) but when it didn’t, i felt puzzled and somewhat hopeless (the anxiety made me feel very weak both mentally and physically). Due to this, i was quite nervous for my trip, since i didn’t feel very good and i was supposed to spend a couple of weeks with strangers. In the end, this anxiety resulted in my first panic attack, just when i had landed from my flight to LA, where my friend was meeting me. I spent about three hours in bed that night, feeling the most intense fear, despair and anxiety of my life, recognizing that i was on the other side of the world from my home and that there was no way out. I was only able to calm down after i called my good friend. After this episode, i felt a little jittery for the whole vacation, fearing another panic attack. Luckily, an attack never came. However, after this episode, i’ve had a serious case of derealization. I knew what the feeling was, since this isn’t the first time i’ve suffered from it ( my first, couple of months of duration derealization period was when i was eighteen, which resulted in depression). Since then, i’ve had a couple of longer derealization periods, but they’d all gone away without any professional help. However, this time the derealization seems more depressing and hard than ever. In fact, i’ve crossed a treshold, where i don’t only feel like every moment is a hazy dream, but i’ve actually started to look at humans (my friends for christ sake) as something weird and unrecognizable, like i was another species or something. This is truly fucked up, and since i see people everyday, i can’t escape this horrible feeling. So, my question to you, the good people of reddit, is, how should one proceed? I feel like the more i let myself believe that this feeling is forever and that i live in a weird world filled with people that i can’t recognize, the more i’ll believe it and the harder it’ll be to get normal. Thanks in advance",17May2018,6

59,"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety the majority of my life, and alcoholism over the last 11 years. I'm currently in rehabilitation and 40 days sober, it feels great (relatively speaking). The depression and anxiety is still prevalent, and is more towards the center of focus now in my outpatient treatment.

Through many counseling sessions, a 700 plus question test (Nearly just left halfway through but figured that would prevent any chance at tackling this mental health issue), and a few doctors appointments, they concluded I have ADD which has been a huge contributor to my other mental health issues.

My counselor who spoke with the doctor said they're about to prescribe strattera, probably because I was asking for any non addictive treatments. 

I wanted to ask in here if anyone with similar symptoms has had any success at restoring their mental health with treating their attention deficit disorder? I'm hopeful, but not expecting it to be a cure all.",17May2018,8

63,"I am 24 years old (female), and I have had this same problem with every ex boyfriend I have ever had, and unfortunately almost all (if not all) have used this ""owie"" of mine to their own advantage. I think it stems from some sort of trauma I experienced either in my first relationship or prior to my first relationship. I have been through years of counseling and have SIGNIFICANTLY improved myself, but this one thing seems to stick around every time:

I constantly yearn for the approval of my exes even though in the back of my mind I know I will never get it. I don't say fuck you and leave because I know I deserve better. I constantly try to tailor myself, even within an after-relationship-friendship, and try to be the best person I can be so I can keep them around. I let them treat me however they want to treat me, talk to me however they want to talk to me, because I am so worried about keeping them around, maintaining their image of me, and keeping things good between us. Three times this has happened now. It's so unhealthy. I want to break free of these chains. Why should I allow myself to be treated poorly? It's so painful, because I know on the outside how it is and what I need to do. When I confront it, it just pains my chest to walk away and value myself like I should. It's like I can't stop myself. I just want their approval and that's all that matters to me. I know it's going to take a lot of work to figure out where this is coming from and how to get there... but I'm wondering if anybody could offer any sort of advice about how to either let go of that part of me or how to get to the bottom of it? I know that I am not alone in this, I feel as though many deal with it.

""No one cares about me and no one will miss me"" and ""Dear Landlords Name, sorry about the mess."" And has her enemies names in hearts. She is 40 but mentally retarded.

I also tried to contact the doctors to also provide pictures and proof that she needs serious help. The doctors told my sister that my mom was trying to stop the release, but didn't mention me at all to her. 

I don't understand why they would divulge that my mom was trying to get them to not release her.

66,"Hi everyone, 

I was victim of a mugging attempt 2 weeks ago, 

\[TW: Here is what happened\]

&gt;!I was walking to join some friends at a bar, and while walking, 2 people I was passing by turn to me, the biggest of then said ""Who were you lookin' at?"" \(I was behind them lol\), that immediately followed by ""empty your pockets"" \(I later learned that muggers usually have some approaches like this, or asking for the time, and that it's in order to get the person to stop walking\). !&lt;

&gt;!He grabbed my shirt, my first reaction was to say ""no"" and I pulled back. I don't know how I managed to break away but I did, another one had his hands in my pockets but they only took airbuds. I screamed help and started to run away, one of them kicked my knee behind me but it didn't make me fall and I could run up the stairs up to a public park and they didn't follow me, they just screamed ""Ya that's it! Get out!""!&lt;

&gt;!I kept walking and I ended up meeting them again in another street like 2 minutes after. They wanted me to follow them to another street, of course i said no. My tactic now was to speak very loud \(it was a crowded street, lots of people having a drink\) ""I don't know you. Please leave me alone"". It worked because after a while some people came up and told them that it wasn't worth it, calmed them down. !&lt;

&gt;!One of the mugglers then came up to my face, told me he could punch me in the face if he wanted to. I don't know how I managed to keep some calm \(bc I was panicked\), but I stayed in front of him and said ""No I don't want you to punch me in the face, I don't know you and I haven't done anything to do. Please leave me alone"". Finally the biggest of them told his friend that it wasn't worth it and they somehow finally leaved me alone. !&lt;

&gt;!I can say that in some way I was lucky in my unluckiness because I managed to get my way out without getting hit \(except the failed attempt at tripping me down from behind but no pain or injuries at all\) and any valuable stolen from me \(only $10 worth airbuds, but my phone and wallet are still with me\).  !&lt;

The thing is that I cannot help but overthinking since it happened. I can't convince my brain that it is over now. It's the first time it happens to me. I can""t help but fear that they are still after me. 

My mind is like ""Maybe they noticed who you are now, and they are probably quite unhappy that you got away from the harm they wanted to do to you. What can prove you that they don't plan a ""revenge"" with more than 2 attackers this time.."". 

In consequence of it, I now regularly change my way to go to work, and of course I don't go out unless absolutely necessary \(work, grocery store and that's all!\). My concentration at work has been decreasing, I sleep less. The only way I can give my mind some rest for a few moment is to drink some beers while alone at home

A part of me wants to say ""Wow it was a bad event, lucky it didn't get worse! That's now an interesting past story to share with friends"", but I just don't manage to. I've always been an anxious person all my life. The way my mind evaluates risk is not through actual likeliness or probability that it happens, but by saying ""Is there an irrefutable proof that {worst\_scenario\_ever} won't happen?"" \-No? Then it's real and very probably imminent

Does anyone here who have been victim of something similar had the same fear\-mongering thoughs? And how long do they usually last? Are my fears of another imminent bigger attack being planned after getting my way out of a muggling somehow justified? \(I live in a mid sized city, about 200k\-300k people\)",17May2018,6

68,"I don't feel like i can collect my thoughts well enough to form meaningful, long sentences right now, so I'm sorry in advance if this doesn't make sense. I wanted to write this post in the hopes of meeting someone who can relate to my feelings and thoughts. I need to speak to someone around my age or slightly older, and who can understand me without judging, who will make me feel less alone.  

I'm a 21 year old girl. I'm lonely. I've been lonely most of my life. It doesn't bother me much. I usually find it calming. But not always. Some days it hurts like hell, and today is one of those days. It's one of those days where my mind just doesn't stop, it's chaotic. Thoughts are running so fast that each of them pass before I can even figure out what they are. But there are some thoughts that just stay there. I don't know how to talk about this, because I've never talked about it before, but sometimes my mind is filled with violent thoughts. It's not like daydreaming, or imagining hurting or killing someone. Those kind of thoughts happen quite often too, but this one of not quite like that. It's more like violent images popping up in my head like a flash and then going away, and then coming back again, flashing. Over and over again. And these images make me feel something that i can't explain, or feel with anything else. I can't quite describe it, but the feeling i get with these thoughts is really different, and too strong to ignore. I would never hurt anyone. I really wouldn't even hurt a bug, in fact, i don't. Whenever I find a bug in my room I usually take them and put them outside. I love helping people, I spend most of my time here, trying to talk to people and making them feel better, as they deserve to. I also love animals more than anything. But these thoughts of violence occur frequently, usually when my loneliness hits really hard, and i feel disconnected with the world. I really, really feel disconnected. And these thoughts usually block others. If you've read this far, thank you so much. You must be someone who cares. I don't feel comfortable going in too much detail here. Please, if you're around my age \(21\) or maybe older, and you somehow relate to me, i would love to talk. I really want to share thoughts and form a connection with someone. I need a connection. I'm also a good listener, so I can listen to you talk about anything without judging one bit. Thank you. I hope something makes you smile today. ",17May2018,6

71,"I've been involved with a guy for six months now and found out a little early on that he was on a break with his girlfriend. He kept telling me that I was his perfect dream girl and that he wanted to marry me one day so I stayed. I was under the impression that they were just friends. Found out a few months later that they were still sleeping together and I was ready to leave but he was so apologetic and pulled me back in by telling me how much he loved me and how he would regret losing me every single day of his life blah blah. Fast forward to a few months, he is still sleeping with her and she knows I exist and he just keeps telling me I'm not the side chick and that he cares about me a lot.

I feel like I'm in so deep and I'm always crying my eyes out over him because I just wanted us to be together. Lost my virginity to him in the middle of this whole mess. I feel so angry all the time and I don't know how to leave the situation. And I dont even want to leave without hurting him back. I want him to miss me as much as I'll miss him. I ended up telling his girlfriend a little bit about us because I wanted to get back at him. Ended with me crying to him apologizing and him telling me to shut up because he couldn't focus on his video game. He still keeps saying that he loves me but he wants to be single but he can't cut her out of his life because he cheated on her before but he's still having sex with her and he doesn't care that I know.

Can't even tell my friends about it because I didn't listen to them or the voice in my head telling me to end it months ago.

I was really excited and it made me really happy that I was able to get one, so I expressed that on my instagram story. When I say really excited, I mean REALLY excited. It was a pin, which is one of my interests, that represented another of my interests. Those are my favorite kind.

Today I got a dm from an indie pin shop telling me the design was stolen and the object I was coveting was art theft which really hurts creators. I was shocked and ridiculously embarassed because of the amount of excitement I expressed over buying the pin. Like, I’m just as disgusted with myself as I am with the pin. I felt accused and I know I was in the wrong for propagating art theft, even if I didn’t mean it.

The person I bought the pin from
messaged me regarding my order and explained the situation. If we ordered the pins we are still receiving them and we should not take pictures of the pin if we are keeping it. It worded as if we must receive it because the order is already processed, but like we’re expected to throw it away or something. I feel cheated out of my money but I also feel like I am a thief too. Now I am going to have to have a taboo object I paid for that I would be too ashamed to display. It has ruined my happiness for pin collecting all together. I made an order of pins from a different creator that I love right after I ordered the first pin, but now I feel ashamed of those too, like my whole hobby is a lie and I should be ashamed for partaking in art theft.

I offered to the real creator of the design to buy her pins to make up for it, but I really already used up the spending allowance I gave to myself on the pins I have already purchased. Not to mention that the original design represents something completely different that I would not be comfortable displaying either. Then I would just be spending even more money on pins I could not display. I already feel so guilty any time I spend any money, now I will feel guilty whether I spend money or not.

Are there any tips for how to get over this guilt and shame? I feel responsible for making an impulse buy and not doing any research. I’m also ridiculously sad that this pin that I still find beautiful is so hideous. Even more, I feel like a complete fool for relaying how immensely happy my pin purchase had made me.

I started taking CBD oil, and took way too much of it on the first dose \(30mg\), at night with an entire Ambien. I slept OK that night and worked the next day, still with a decent amount of anxiety. I had read that it's better to take 5 drops 2x/day. So I did that the following day, along with an entire Ambien. Slept really well \(about 7hrs\), but had to get up early for work. I probably could have stayed asleep for hours, but duty called. Initially at work \(making deliveries\) I was nice and relaxed with NO anxiety. It literally disappeared overnight, and went from being wired from trying to stop worrying about worrying, to trying to stay awake. I noticed i had a constant urge to keep closing my eyes, almost narcoleptically so. I was also mentally slow and kind of even slurring speech a bit, forgetting things. It's like I'm trying to doze off while being awake. It's got me worked up now in a different way, as if something is wrong with me.

I read that CBD can have an effect on the uptake of certain pharmaceutical drugs. Is Ambien one of them, and how would it, or sleeping aids/narcotics in general be affected?

79,"Somebody I'm close to has some peculiar behaviors. They're about 60, have had a tough life (childhood abuse, life trauma), but things are relatively stable for them now.

The thing is, they seem to embellish whatever physical ailments they may have. I know they have aches &amp; pains that are real. My confusion is in how they selectively communicate they have an ailment, rather than managing the actual limitations of the ailment. They can carry on like normal, but then when in close proximity to others they'll 'turn it up a notch', giving their presence a performative quality. If it's a scratchy throat, a predictably-timed *cough cough* can be expected. If a sore back, when they approach others it will be with a back hunched over a couple extra degrees. If a sore knee, her encounters with others will include a quite considered and dramatic limp.

I'm not trying to judge their life experience or the coping mechanisms people develop, my problem is with the dishonesty about it. It's one thing when it's in front of me, and another when they're out in the world 'performing'. It's an (unhealthy) way of gaining attention, but if questioned about it they will carry into a long description of their ailment, fulfilling their desire to tell people about it. I see it plain as day but I don't acknowledge it or 'take the bait'. 

I'm vaguely familiar with Munchausen Syndrome, but to my knowledge they don't 'invent' ailments, only accentuate them. Others who know them have accused them of being a hypochondriac. I don't find them to be personally obsessive about their health, they just like to perform outwardly their condition.

Is my refusal to acknowledge their shows healthy? I do clearly convey my concern for their well-being occasionally, yet nowhere as often as they would likely prefer. I wish we could speak candidly about the performative nature of their aches &amp; pains but I think it could be too jarring for them or they may actually retreat into denial, which would be an even worse look that I don't want to provoke.
