1,"Hey guys i just made a discord server called 'Gamers Anonymous'. It's an 18+ peer mental health server that is video game themed! If you like to game, or talk about games AND also are looking for some mental health support. This is the place for you. This is a new server so we are still a small community and trying to learn how to do everything/ thanks! https://discord.gg/wh7TkrW",04Jul2018,2
2,"I mean that's understandable but at the same I have been through a lot of suffering and it pisses me off that they didn't put in more effort regardless if they said the right or wrong things, and regardless if I was moody and irritable. I mean I suffer with a mood disorder for gods sake, of course I'll act like that, not condoning it but you would think they would've shown more effort. Now that I'm succeeding and getting over my health issues I can see more clearly and see that they didn't really care too much as to what I  was going through, they just wanted me too succeed so they didn't have to resent me. I think my issues were just too much on them and in their eyes I was making them look bad. I feel their reason for wanting me to succeed came more from a place of satisfying their need to not feel embarrassed over their son. I keep saying they as if I'm talking about both of my parents but I'm talking solely about my dad. My dad is a hard ass, he's not emotionally available and he's very prideful. Anyone else been in the same boat? I don't want to be bitter towards in the long run but I literally just had this realization, well more so it's been unfolding for a couple of months. ",04Jul2018,7
3,"I officially decided to apply for disability with my Generalized anxiety, IBS, and depression and I’m reeeeeeeeeeeeally praying to whatever powerful being that is in charge of the universe to let me atleast have this! I have suffered long enough with my mind and if I can get this it will be one less thing to have to worry about! Whenever I think about work, or think about learning to drive, or socialize with people, or go anywhere in general my anxiety amplifies and always leaves me crying/shaking/depressed. If I can get this, I can continue on getting proper care for my health as I’m in no way ready to start working again. All I’m asking for is good vibes or any good voodoo to be casted upon me :,)! 

If you have any success stories or advice, please, you’re more than welcome to comment! 💜",04Jul2018,1
4,"Like tonight. I don't think I'd ever go through with it as I said in the OP, but it almost seems like I have two moods and no others sometimes. I'm either my biggest hypeman or my biggest critic and I very rarely find the in-between. About 2 months ago after a several month period of feeling extremely depressed and lethargic I suddenly felt full of motivation and hope and optimism. I started working on multiple projects and ideas and thinking of new things I wanted to work on next constantly, and I felt very hopeful about all of it and extremely motivated to keep it all up and keep working on and learning all these new things I was interested in. I still had somewhat regular periods of depression that seemed to come on randomly but never lasted more than a couple hours normally besides the occasional 1-2 day patch. 

But then in the last few weeks it all seemed to fade away, the excitement, the motivation, I stopped caring or having interest in most things again, started forgetting to eat sometimes until I'd been up like 12 hours or more, and the good moods and hope and optimism just began to fade again. There wasn't a particular reason it seemed to come on or why it seemed to fade away suddenly after a couple months of feeling so good and motivated, it just seemed to happen, and then the slightly suicidal, kinda intrusive thoughts started fading back in, the ones that say I should just end it now, that life isn't going to get better, that I'm not going to achieve any of my goals, they're almost like intrusive thoughts but sometimes I can wallow in them for hours and other times they just randomly pop into my head and another part of my brain instantly thinks ""Nah fuck that"" and tries to just get the thought gone. 

I don't think I would ever kill myself but I can't seem to stop having the thoughts about it when I have an extra depressed period, but I don't think I actually want to die, I think maybe sometimes I really just want to be clear of all the thoughts in my head. I tend to bottle things up too, so I know nobody ever notices anythings wrong with me, I'm always keeping up the appearances to the family as the guy constantly cracking jokes about all kinds of shit when inside it feels like part of my brain is just saying ""ay go drive of a bridge."" But I know they tend to ignore and neglect any issues I have and have since I was a kid so likely would in this scenario and I don't want to have to deal with that.

I'm not really sure what I expect to get from this post, just maybe some help or advice, I'd appreciate it. I don't want to go down the going to the doctor route if I can help it because I don't want to deal with my family, but sometimes it feels like the most important thing for me to learn is how to help myself inside. I just don't know how to deal with what goes on in my head and I just want to find some sort of peace with myself.",04Jul2018,1

6," I’m seriously worried for a friend right now. She’s barely sleeping daily and on top of that she has been having depression episodes recently. I’m afraid something might push her over the edge. I don’t know how to help her though. I feel like my words are not enough to make her feel better. The worst part is that I’m leaving for a real singles tour for a couple of weeks. That means I would be away from her. I don’t want her to feel alone without me around. With the recent events of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, my greatest fear is of her doing something to herself. How do I help my friend? She doesn’t want to see a psychologist and she’s not taking any medicine.",04Jul2018,1
7,"(20/f). In the past I’ve struggled a lot with social anxiety and depression although this is something I’ve worked on and don’t struggle with as much anymore. I am very hard on myself still and fixate a lot on the things I hate in myself. 

Because of this is often feel closed off to my emotions, thinking if I don’t talk about it or think about it it’s not there. This is something that’s really hard for me because I feel like it affects my relationships with friends and family a lot. 

If something bothers me I often over internalize how it makes me feel but can’t seem to vocalize that I’m upset to people or even bring up how I feel. This makes it really hard for me to get close to people because I usually get really awkward and uncomfortable with serious conversation and tend to shut down when I have to talk about things that are hard for me or too personal. 

my friends joke that I’m emotionless and cold hearted which really bothers me. How do I become more comfortable accepting how I feel and start to be more open with people I’m close to?

Trains of thought tangled in knots
And it won’t stop
It won’t stop
It won’t stop
Pain emanates from my core and leaks into my bloodstream until each and every inch of me writhes in agony

My body quakes as my soul struggles to free itself from this prison of flesh

I hold myself hostage here, with broken words caught in my throat

I watch myself from the outside as hot tears pool on my chin and my chewed fingernails rake my thighs

I miss me

9,"Understanding attachment theory (anxious/avoidant/secure) has gone a long way in explaining how I am in my most important relationships.

I tend to be on the anxious side of things and always am attracted to avoidants.   Even though I know the dynamics at play and I logically understand the psychological issues that are at play, I don’t seem to be able to stop and detach from the cycle.

I over do, over give, and over supply emotional support and my avoidant pushes back, closes down and cuts me off.   This invariably devastates me, crushes me completely.    The attachment trauma actually has physiological built in responses.   

So we play out the dance like we’re marionette puppets on a string.   Triggering each other constantly.   I push, they pull away, I react, and eventually we come back for another round.

It’s heartbreaking and unbelievable sad because underneath all the bullshit, there’s genuine love for each other.

I don’t know if knowing this stuff helps or hurts.   I wish I was stronger.  All I want to do is show love and feel like it’s seen and reciprocated.

10,"I tend to obsess over something bad thats happened to me or a problem in my life- I overthink it and can never get it out of my head.

11,"I've been through a lot. I don't want to leave an essay to not be read through. So here are bullet points kinda.
In short, I am so stuck right now, living day after day in my boyfriend's parents house, intestionally and physically sick, motivationless, feels like each day is repeating. No job, no degree, little ambition left, i feel so beaten. 

I was molested for 7 years by my grandfather.


Fostercare took us away upon his wife calling foster care on my mom's percription drug addiction and house was hoarder level. In hopes she'd get custody.


She did not was bounced around for 2 years in worse homes till my parents won custody back of 3 of us and  almost 1 million in debt.


Things were fine for a year, mom relapsed but family was pushed out of our lives and we didn't want to go back to fostercare so we lied a lot as kids.


House back to gross unclean huge 5 bedroom house.. couldn't have friends over. Kept my room and baby bros room clean, parts of kitchen and my personal bathroom.


I cook and help baby bro (7yrs junior) with homework, parents basically do bair min for him. We were close, loved him more like a son than brother.


Middle school my older brother started molesting me. Distressed I told a friend, she told her mom, child services got involved, I semi lied because at this point teacher took my journal out of my backpack pointed out grandfather and brother did it....and do I told her my grandfather molested not my brother. Didn't want to tear appart my family.


Cat had 4 kittens, best part of my middle school life. Cried when one died.


My dad didn't believe me (it was his dad) my great aunt confessed I was not the only child my grandfather did this to. Restraining order was placed. Dad wouldn't hug me for years and stopped being close. Afaid I'd accuse him too. My mom believed and tried to kill herself.


Come home she's covered in blood self inflicted. She lives bairly. Forced into rehab but stay with my parents.
High school I was known as the molested girl... In a small 300 kids total school, white wealthy... Lots of gossip. Raped by some one I thought was a friend.


A Cat we got from my brothers gf had 4 kittens, best part of my high school life. Cried when one died because I gave it to my crush, he let it outside and died. 


My own suicidal thoughts emerge. Older brother with anger issues gets his first girlfriend finally stops watching me and touching me in my sleep. I'm 15 then.


Mom's drugs get worse, dad's secrets come out. He looks at incest and animal porn, he makes me mom do things gross things with our pet dog for drugs. I see first hand... Dad is very wealthy successful aerospace engineer. Uses this to control her.


My baby brother knew very little deep gross sexual history of our family. My older brother, our parents, our grandfather .. He knew none of it.


Have a house fire, mom was high smoking on Oxygen. Everyone lives minior burns. Relocated my senior year same school till house repaired.


I moved out 18 with 1st bf from another school. Left home. Ended up in an abusive relationship, hit me. Told me porn was better than me. Lost all my confidence.


Mom died from a second house fire 3 years later, she was smoking on Oxygen again. Sustains bad injuries, almost dead, passes year later from drug overdose... The day of her Birthday ( still believe it was suicidal) from cardiac arrest. 8 days before my birthday, our birthdays were close. I drop out mid semester of college,never go back.

Dad remarried to a gold digger barely a year after mom died. Family just falls apart, no one helps each other, just avoidance. Boyfriends abuse progresses, physically and mentally, lose all family and friends connections. Left to feel worthless.


I leave bf after 6 years, find a friend move in with her and her husband. After year her husband becomes creeping on me, whole situation becomes bad.


Drunken baby bro tells me he was raped by a man, drunken me tells baby bro now 18. The horrors of our family... He becomes distant. I can't be there for him when he wants to die because he hates me for telling him. His world was shattered, rather believe im a liar. (No one wants to think their childhood was facade, or that your older brother or father are sexually Disturbed)


Got sick with mono and Lyme at once, my roommates were cruel... Between all the mess of my roommates new boyfriend moves me in with him.


Meant to be 1 month temporary with bf...Lost my waitressing job week after moving, struggling in web development learning. Health declining... Now been 6 months.


Have a decent man, he's living with parents and work has little hours at work for him. I'm 25 he's 26. He's good to me, kind, I'm his first GF, treats me well.


 I have no confidence, no dirrection, no idea what I'm doing, no clue how to adult neither does he. I feel stuck, like my life will never get better. I can't afford to laze around, stuck because I have no job ATM.  Can't find a job..medically and school wise I'm in debt, fearing I can't go back to college. I would be helpless without my boyfriend and I hate that, scared someone prettier could take it all away. How do I get confidence after all that? I'm sick as hell can't afford doctors, intestional pain, fatigue, swollen lymp nodes and painful peeing. Now I have depression. I feel absolutely overwhelmed, I've done lists, sticky notes and alarms. I just suck at being human. 

I wish every day someone who understands and knows how to get through this will come into my life and help me fix it. I tried self help, but my confidence and lack of skills are so shattered, no start is even comprehendable. Foresight is non existent.


Tdlr: I'm a child sex abuse victim, child of drug addict, ran away to an Abusive boyfriend, finally free of my past, lost and confused. Wishing I had someone to help me get on track. Go back to college and find a job. I regret so many things,hard to look forward to any future. 


I can't afford therapy here goes nothing. Someone give me any insight what I can do. I tried working out, ratting healthy, getting a good guy, making lists. Just stuck in a loop of self loathing and doing nothing. ",04Jul2018,5

I cleaned a lot, I did dishes, I went to the store, I took a shower, I pulled up the invisible fence flags in the yard so my husband can mow the lawn, I prepped food for our party tomorrow.

17,"I'm currently in a relationship (basically FWB) with this 33 year old man (I'm 40F), and he is basically the textbook ""bad boy jerk"" or whatever you want to call it. 

The sex is unreal, and unquestionably the  best I've ever had in my life. Virtually every single time perfect. And  he has the exact personality and style/charisma that I LOVE in a man  (dominant, aggressive, etc). He's extremely popular with pretty much  everyone and a real charmer.

1. I'm  worried because he has so much female attention that he won't pay any  attention to me and that I'm ""lesser"" than the other girls/women he  hooks up with. Almost every single we are together, he gets calls or  texts from other girls, sometimes multiple ones in the same night. I've  been trying to stand out to him in many ways, but I don't know if it's working.
2. I'm  worried because I feel like I'm a completely different person with him.  Like he says and does things that I would KILL other men for, but with him I just accept it and laugh.  
3. He  has a 19 year old girlfriend that he doesn't treat very well IMO. He also has three children that he doesn't provide for, and he lives where I  live but has no real job. It's pretty much known that he lives off of  girls giving him money. Things that would repulse me in a normal  situation, but I just ignore them now.
4. In  some ways, he is so wrong for me it's incredible, but in the other  ways he's so incredibly right. I feel like my mind and body are  screaming at me to do completely opposite things and it's driving me crazy.

I guess I don't understand why I'm so attracted to him, so willing to bend on things I would kill other men for (figuratively), and why I feel so desperate to get his attention and approval. I've done some things I'm not proud of to get his attention and approval, and I don't understand why I'm doing it.

Does anyone have any insight? Is it self-esteem related? I don't have much experience with this sort of thing.

My sister, who is turning 16 in two weeks, told me today that she has had several anxiety attacks and has seriously considered trying to kill herself. 

My parents know about all of this. They got information from her primary care physician on who they can contact to get her help and almost immediately threw it away. I offered to set up something for her — I’m 20 with about a 1000 in the bank and godamit this is worth spending money on — but she refused to let me help her. 

I don’t know what to do. I’v struggled with mental health stuff in the past too, but it was more related to motivation and apathy rather than active self harm, so almost everything i’ve learned is useless.

My parents are apart, so I switch back and forth from their houses, but I see my mom Monday-Next Wednesday, and my dad Wednesday-Monday. This is because my dad is only in mostly on the weekend. I care a lot about both of them, but I don't really get to see my dad a lot, and sometimes I am a jerk sometimes, symptoms of puberty. The thoughts have mostly been about how sad my parents must be, hitting middle age, and still working hard to pay their bills, wishing things were like they were when they were young. Sometimes, I also think about how I can betray my parents wishes, and get angry at them despite all they sacrificed for me. The thoughts follow a pattern, First I get my parents in mind, then I think about how depressing being there age is, than I get very upset that anyone, especially my parents would have to go through that. The thoughts are rare, at max I get them 2 times a week, but they are extremely depressing, to the point where I have teared up. Is this a normal behavior of could this be something else.

22,"Hello, I am hoping you all could help me. I am 19F in the US and have been dealing with a lot of childhood trauma and abuse from intimate relationships. I apologize for the novel ahead. I feel like this post became half venting half pleading for help. I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.

My grandparents were abusive. They never hit me because I was always ""good"" but did yell occasionally and always beat my cousins and my brother and sister a few times while I was around. My cousins got the bad end of the verbal shit too. My grandma and grandpa also fought A LOT and would get physical sometimes. It was really scary to witness as a kid. Because my parents grew up around this kinda thing, they're messed up. Really emotionally manipulative sometimes and my dad tends to lose his temper. They've also never hit me for the same reason as my grandparents. But both can be very nasty people. They can be really racist/sexist/homophobic and it really bothers me.

I was, what I believe is under the definition of sexually harassed, from ages 5-15 by a family member not much older than me. I have harbored a lot of guilt and disgust over what happened. I have never told the story in full to anyone because it's socially taboo and being basically the same age as my perpetrator feels like my experience isn't valid.  I have always felt conflicted because I never explicitly told him ""no"", just zoned out and let it happen even though I knew it was wrong. I was always uncomfortable but was afraid of him (he was stronger, had violent tendencies and is currently a really abusive P.O.S) so I was scared to ever reject him firmly. Sometimes I even said yes when I didn't want to so he would quit bothering me. I know that when we were younger children it was kind of ""normal"" due to curiosity about sex. We would play ""games"" like house and Tarzan/Jane but then he got really weird as we got older and kept touching me when I didn't want him to whenever he felt like it. Now that I am older it feels even more gross but I am also torn because I can be sympathetic towards the guy. His dad's an alcoholic who was barely around and mom is really physically abusive so I see why he is the way he is. That doesn't make it any better though.

My dad caught us together once and just yelled at me blaming me for everything. So it continued to happen and being yelled at made me too scared to tell my parents. My dad got mad frequently so I have always gotten anxious to the point of crying whenever I had to talk to him about anything. And my mom was the opposite. She'd get TOO emotional and invested, insistent that I could ALWAYS come to her but was so judgmental it made me never wanna go to her for anything either. I became really withdrawn and very anxious. I blocked out what happened for a long time but sometimes would get flashbacks and avoided where I was harassed for years. I locked myself away with my computer, never really interacting and always staying quiet. 

I was bullied a lot as a child which made me even more socially anxious/withdrawn. It really messed up my self esteem and I started to hate myself. I ate alone a lot of times and spent a lot of time reading by myself or just trying to avoid the bullies. My parents were the jock/cheerleader stereotype couple and those kinda kids were the ones who bullied so they never understood me and I kept everything bottled up. Telling me to just ""toughen up"" and not let the haters get to me was the worst fucking advice I had ever received. I was alone frequently which worsened my depression. At it's rock bottom I would cry myself to sleep and struggle to eat/shower/brush my teeth. I thought about dying a lot and harming myself but was always too scared to act on those thoughts. I lost my motivation and interest in things I had loved. Everything inside me felt dead. I have an compulsive personality so I often stress eat junky food or buy things I don't immediately need just to feel a little better during my depressive episodes.

I ended up somehow managing to get a girlfriend in high school but the relationship was toxic. She would ignore me for months, cheated multiple times, threatened to hit me/was negative verbally and is a compulsive liar. But I ""loved her"" so I stayed with all of that for 2 years. Any time I got tired and tried to leave she'd pull a sob story out her ass, we'd argue and then she would threatened to kill herself. It fucked me up really bad. I have really bad trust issues, attachment issues, and when I get into intimate relationships I think about how the person might just ignore me for months like she did and get really anxious.

Now currently my depression is hitting me hard. I've been triggered a lot. Had to go to this party for the guy who harassed me because we're family. It was overwhelming. I've felt like I've been losing my best friend because we don't really talk and she doesn't really put in as much effort as me to talk to me anymore. School has me worried because I'm lost and don't know if my career choice is smart. I don't have a job and have $12 to my name so food/water is a struggle. I lost motivation for all my hobbies and only just picked up a few again. I can't drive so travel is limited but I haven't been going out much. I went to a job interview Monday but that's it. All my friends are not in my state and are travelling, having the times of their lives, going out all while I'm stuck with no money alone. It sucks.

I spent all last week high, binge-watching videos and stuffing sugar in my face not taking care of myself. I've cried a lot in the last few days because the memories I repressed from being harassed are all coming back and upsetting me.  Now that I have quit running from it I know that these memories, and my behavior from my upbringing are messing me up and ruining my relationships with others so I want to get help. I kept putting it off so now I have no money to pay for it. Which I know is my fault. The whole reason for this post is that most of the advice is to look for a sliding scale/go through my insurance but my parents \*\*DO NOT\*\* believe in therapy. My dad yelled at my sister when she went to her school counselor and said we ""shouldn't tell other people our business"". My mom was also upset because she felt ""embarrassed"". They are ultra religious and think God is the answer to every problem so yeah. I need to avoid the charges showing up on their bill. 

I also don't know what I'm going to therapy for. When I looked into it the therapists all specialize in certain areas. So if I go for family issues but then my girlfriend comes up or being bullied are they ""qualified"" to let me talk about that or do we only focus on their specialty? My counselor was like you need to get to the ""root"" but I'm not sure what category the root is. If that makes sense.

Is there ANY way I can use my parents' insurance w/o their knowledge? and if not, are there are any resources or free support groups to look into I would really appreciate some recommendations. 

\*TL;DR: I grew up around abusive people and was harassed as a kid. Ended up in an abusive relationship for two years. Probably have depression, anxiety, and some form of C-PTSD. My parents are ultra religious and do not believe in therapy. I am poor and unemployed. How do I get into therapy or get help without their knowledge and without going into debt?\*",04Jul2018,1

The main reason why I am making this post is because my dad is trying to find me a new psychologist, and the funny thing is that I felt like I was finally starting to get somewhere despite being told that I'm probably getting depressed. But nope, I guess I'm back to square one again. Not that my dad is even going to get me a new psychologist either, I mean I've had to constantly nag about stuff in the past and then become the bad guy for nagging until the day before I need said item, for example I needed a graphing calculator for the SAT exam, and I had to keep reminding my dad to get the calculator. I know that you can't just throw away money just like that but he didn't get it for me until two days before the exam... And then a few days later I'm suddenly the bad guy for telling him to get the calculator constantly. For the record I just gave a reminder every day or two, it wasn't like I was nagging him every hour for the calculator.

As I mentioned before I apologize if this is extremely unorganized. I'm not all that great at typing how I'm feeling or even verbally...

The part that pisses me off is that my mom (who is on my side about this topic, but also lives probably a good 800 miles away from me) has told me about some of the texts that have been sent between her and my dad, and my dad doesn't even give a shit about this whole changing in psychologists, like she would tell him to put himself in my shoes, but he would shake it off and say how he doesn't think that way and isn't even trying to do what she says. This is even the first time this has happened where he doesn't even care about how I'm feeling about a situation, but it certainly doesn't make me feel any better. There are only three people that I feel that I can (almost) trust completely, those people being my mom, psychologist, and this one friend of mine who is honestly one of the greatest people I've ever met. Of course my friend and mom can't give professional advice and I doubt many people on this subreddit can, at least about this situation but it at least helps to talk I guess... But now I've pretty much been cut down to two people I can talk to, none of which I feel can get me out of this.

It's not even this situation that makes me feel like total shit all the time. Im a swimmer, and I used to absolutely love swimming. However I feel like I've realized how much I don't like being around my team and such and my dad makes swim a top priority for me. My coaches and teammates actually get mad at me for making a new best time in a swim meet, but they aren't like this towards anyone else. I just don't see the point in trying and setting goals for myself if people give me shit for it anyways. I get that this may be a case of trying to please everyone, but I'm just sick of the people I'm with for a chunk of my day hating me for what I do or who I am. I often keep my mouth shut during practices and meets and I'm given shit for that when I'm pretty sure no one would like me to talk to them in the first place. I've asked for a small break a while back and my dad refused to give me one, and here he is all ""I don't want you to get burned out of the sport"" when he pretty much already did that...

He's pretty much leeched the fun out of playing my piano as well as giving me a ton of guilt playing video games when that is pretty much the only thing that I still find some sort of interest in. He didn't get me a birthday present last year, and judging how he reacted about the graphing calculator I doubt hes giving me one this year... I remember I used to tell him just about everything that bothered me, but when all he tells me at this point is not to worry about something, or ""cut the crap"" or ""it's all in your head"" or some bullshit like that or try to manipulate me into doing something, ie swimming or give a false opinion on something I don't exactly trust him, especially considering the shit he's been giving me the last few months.

Even though everyone says I'm talented and smart and stuff like that I really don't believe it. Yeah, I skipped a grade, but I doubt colleges would be all ""oh, this guy skipped a grade, let's cut him some slack"" or something like that. Im not even that fast of a swimmer... yeah I guess I'm half decent but what good is half decent? I know it might be a bit of a jump from the stuff I was talking about earlier, but I honestly don't see myself getting anywhere in life, like I don't see myself getting into a good college, which is something I'd like to do... I don't see myself getting a girlfriend, I don't see myself getting a decent job, finding a hobby that I feel I can actually go somewhere in (my next door neighbor likes art such, and she was so good at it that she got no scholarship... but nothing I do I'm really good at so it just hurts to hear this stuff and have my dad shove this down my throat every once in while) and see myself even living past college if I even make it there... I haven't had a day where I haven't thought of hurting myself or being dead in a good 4 or 5 months now, and it certainly hasn't stopped. As maybe ""cliche"" as it sounds, I honestly just wish I was dead or something. I'm not sure how I would hurt or kill myself so I guess everyone could consider themselves lucky for that... Ive honestly realized that I care more about dying in a video game than I do about dying in real life. The only thing that still kind of keeps me going is that friend I mentioned earlier, she's honestly the main reason why I haven't done something to myself yet. Her, my mom, and psychologist are pretty much the only people I feel would care about me being dead. I'm trying my absolute hardest to keep going but I'm not exactly sure how long I can keep this up for. I'll shut up about this topic now, as I know it's not something that anyone wants to really hear from me. I apologize for that...

I'm not sure the best way to wrap this whole thing up. Certainly this isn't everything that isn't bothering me right now, ive definitely left a ton of stuff out, but it's already kinda late for me and I'm getting kind of tired. I'm not exactly sure what I'm asking for from this post... I don't know if it's advice that I'm looking for, or maybe just someone who cares, as bullshit as that may sound especially coming from the internet... I might delete it at some point if I feel like I really fucked up with this post, but I at least wanted to get these words out there just as a bit of a last resort.

If you did manage to read this whole thing, I just want to say thanks for taking the time to do so, as I feel like this was a lot so I'm sorry for shoving this all in your face. Seriously... I really mean it.

25,"Hello!

I hope you’re having a great night. Honestly: this is a long story so I’ll throw a TLDR at the end.

I’m looking for help at diagnosing and getting past my anger and lack of confidence.

This all started about 2 years ago, during my senior year of college. I’d done two internships for a Fortune 500 company and received great reviews. I was eagerly awaiting a job offer from them. When I hadn’t heard back for a while I contacted them only to find out that they had not recommended me for employment on grounds of being too “easy going”.  This shattered me. The job was going to be in the same city as my girlfriend and family and I’d worked for this company and built relationships for two years. Many of the folks I’d have worked for I would consider close friends. It hurt.

I proceeded to take another job but it didn’t feel right. I remember moving south and during the drive to said place I’d be living I felt nothing but guilt and sadness to be compromising so heavily. Of course, the distance didn’t work and my girlfriend of 3 years and I split. Due to stress and genuinely hating the work environment of that job I ended up leaving after about a year with the intention of going to graduate school.

After leaving the job, I moved home, and since then I’ve lived there. Beforehand I just felt like a piece of crap all of the time and like nobody liked me or thought I could do anything right, but now, the anger has started. I can hardly look at myself in the mirror without wanting to punch the face in it. I’ve pushed away my friends and family with my anger. I don’t know how to explain it, I was always an easy going guy and now, just two weeks ago, I was at dinner in public and snapped. Something on the menu changed and I threw my perfectly functional phone on the floor, shattered it, and stomped it to the ground before walking out without it.

Tonight I got a ticket in my car going 27 in a 25 and after the cop gave me the ticket I politely accepted it, left my car where it sat in a neighborhood, and just walked 5 miles home because I felt if I touched the car again I’d just get another ticket because I’m too much of an idiot to drive properly.

I’m honestly afraid at this point. I have no composure. I start graduate school in roughly a month at a dream school, Harvard, but I can hardly even go into public without having a panic attack.

Do I forgo my admission to the best school in my field to get my mental health back? Do I move out of this house ASAP? Do I need to seek professional health.

I’m honestly afraid I’ll harm my future beyond repair if I don’t get myself in line soon.

26,"Today, my children (and niece, nephew and mother) were in mortal danger.  And I felt nothing.  I wasn't there but heard about it immediately (10 minutes) after.  I felt/feel no fear or anxiety or anger.

I felt immediate panic the day I walked in on my youngest as a baby after he had pulled a blanket over his face and nearly suffocated but nothing on the ride in the ambulance or the three days of tests in the hospital.  That panicked, fearful feeling lasted all of 10 minutes.

I felt nothing while my stepfather was waiting for his heart procedure  and nothing when my mother was undergoing chemo.

I can't fear an interview or a meeting until I am about to walk into it (none of these hours or days or weeks of stress leading up to it).

I feel extreme anxiety from social situations but I don't know if that counts as fear and it only happens in the moment.  I also rarely feel excitement....almost never.  I don't feel depressed (though I suffered from depression as a teenager) and I generally drift through life feeling a sort of detached contentment.  But I do feel as though I am missing something as I see other people FEELING things more than me.  Sometimes it upsets my husband that I don't seem to have strong emotions.  I am nearly positive I have autism/aspergers (though as a woman living without health insurance in the USA I will probably never be diagnosed and what would be the point now that I'm gainfully employed in my thirties).  I only mention it because I thought that might be the cause but I can't find literature on it.  And my son is diagnosed with ASD but seems to feel excitement and fear so maybe not?  Everyone else in my family experiences what seems like a normal or high amount of fear or excitement so it doesn't seem to be a learned trait.

I know it sounds strange to want to feel fear but it seems inappropriate to not feel it in certain situations.  Also I believe that my lack of excitement is probably a facet of the same problem.  And it IS a problem when it causes me to feel disconnected and when it makes the people I love feel as though I am not invested.

Does anyone know what might cause this?  Are there medications that can help me feel more appropriate depth of emotions?  Would it be worth talking to a therapist considering I do not have health insurance and live in the USA?",04Jul2018,1
27,"— In March, my housemate (\~34) and I went on a trip to the US. (We're both Canadian.)

— While there, his personality changed over the course of a few days. He became much more extroverted and had seemingly boundless social energy.

— The ""new"" version of him persisted after we returned home. He claimed he could spend infinite time on any subject, diving deeper and deeper, and remember everything. He called this ""the real"" version of himself.

— In the past month or two, he started showing signs of OCD and paranoia. He told me that he had profound ideas that he didn't want to fall into the wrong hands. He demanded that people sit in particular spots and not move or else he couldn't finish his thoughts.

— One day, he crumpled to the floor, sobbing. Extreme anxiety and confusion — too many thoughts happening too fast. I took him to the walk-in clinic and he was prescribed Lorazepam three times daily.

— The Lorazepam seemed to help for a while, although I was away for a week or two during this time.

— Last week he came home one day and broke down again. He had driven to the clinic to get his prescription refilled but on the way back he had seen things that pushed him over the edge. He said he heard people saying lewd things, heard messages for him in music, and couldn't handle making eye contact with people.

— We went to the clinic again and this time he was prescribed Escitalopram once a day. The pharmacist said we should keep the Lorazepam for anxiety attacks. He was also referred by the doctor to Mental Health Services.

— Three times over the past few nights, he's come to my bedroom door in the middle of the night in a panic. His thoughts are confused, with wild connections that don't make any sense. He is noticing patterns of coincidences and ascribing terrible meaning to them. Each time he comes to my door this way, he ends up taking a Lorazepam and we sit and talk. After about 45-60 minutes he's still anxious and confused, but calm enough to try to go bed.

I'm not sure what to do. The Mental Health Services referral could take weeks, apparently. I'm starting to wonder if he was misdiagnosed — if they're trying to treat depression and anxiety, not whatever this is. Sometimes I feel talking to him is helping — we've talked about critically examining thoughts to see if they are false; we've done breathing techniques; I've tried to reassure him that he deserves the help... but often it's impossible to get through to him. I've run out of things to say, and I don't know if they'd help anyway. And I'm sorry to say this — especially sorry to you, friend, should you ever see this — but I'm finding myself scared sometimes, wondering if he's outside my bedroom door.",04Jul2018,1

29,"After six years of friendship, one of my closest friends began acting distant toward me and making passive-aggressive remarks at the beginning of this year, implying that I was a bad and inattentive friend. A huge trigger for my anxiety is the feeling that I'm not doing enough for the people around me, and these snide remarks - which would come out of nowhere - were really devastating to me. After two of the incidents I emailed her and explained in detail how hurtful her comments were to me - and in both cases she flatly denied that the remarks had been intended to hurt me and indicated that the reason for her comments was because she was hurt that I hadn't reached out to her in a long time. 

In the first case, I had just come back from a couple of weeks at home and another week with my girlfriend overseas with no cell service. Even though she didn't apologize in her email, I decided that the relationship was more important to me than being right, and started making more of an effort to see her. Over the next three months I made an extra effort to be present in her life - I took her to the theater (with a free ticket I got her), I went to every party and event she invited me to, I took her out for dinner for her birthday, and invited her to dinner with my parents when they were in town. At first things seemed okay, but gradually her responses to me over text became cold and distant, and in our face-to-face conversations things felt strained - partially because I felt myself on the defensive, scared that I was somehow deficient in my friendship and would soon be attacked for it. 

After a series of passive-aggressive remarks in text messages and over the phone (*""Hi! I'm just calling because I know* ***you*** *never will..."")* I confronted her again via email. I was not confrontational, I used *I feel* statements, and I laid out in plain English that while I loved her and wanted to help fix whatever was upsetting her, the language she was using was so hurtful to me that it was counterproductive. Again, she insisted that she hadn't been trying to hurt me. She was offended that I was offended at her remarks. She didn't understand how I could be offended at what she'd said, because she was just remarking on the truth: The fact that I didn't reach out to her very often and that it hurt her. 

As we discussed this over email, I pointed out all the things I'd been doing over the past few months to be present in her life. She acknowledged that I'd done the things, but would then seamlessly return to her thesis that I wasn't doing enough to be present in her life. She explained that her anxiety made her feel like all of her friends secretly hated her, and that feeling like she was losing me as a friend was driving her crazy, and that as someone who loved her I needed to be going above and beyond to allay her fears. Specifically, she said that she just wanted me to text her out of the blue every once and a while. 

I felt genuinely bad that I hadn't been present enough in her life, and assigned myself guilt for it - even though I knew I had been making an extra effort to be a friend to her. I began reexamining all of my other friendships, anxiously sending texts to friends I hadn't spoken to recently, driven by a fear that they too were secretly angry at me for abandoning them. It took a week before I looked back at my text history with my friend and saw that in the previous four weeks I had texted her out of the blue on five separate occasions - sending pictures, inviting her out with family, telling her I missed her and asking how she was doing - with short, chilly responses every time. 

She'd lied to me, and even though I knew that I had sent the messages *I trusted her word anyway.* This was such a shock to me that I emailed her that I needed to take a break from contact with her. Her response was outrage. After two months to collect my thoughts, I suggested that we both sit down with a therapist for a moderated discussion. I came in with my facts straight: She had violated my trust, and the only options were to either break off all contact for a year and try to pick up the pieces, or end the friendship entirely. 

But in our therapist's office, she was calm, charming, pleasant - making jokes and humorous asides and references to our past experiences, even as she continued to insist over the course of two hours that I had not been making an effort in our friendship and that I was misinterpreting all of her passive-aggressive slights. She was deeply sorry that she had brought up her concerns about the state of our friendship in a way that had been hurtful to me, but she went on to explain that for the entirety of our six-year friendship - during which time I had invited her to my hometown to stay with my family, traveled with her, finagled her a *Hamilton* ticket, shared every birthday, attended countless family events at her house - she had always doubted whether I actually cared about her as much as she cared about me. She explained that it was really hurtful to her that I'd needed to take a two-month break, and that this wouldn't have been such a big deal if I hadn't insisted on taking a long breather. 

In spite of everything I'd been through, I found myself agreeing with what she was saying. I found myself feeling foolish, like I'd blown everything out of proportion. What was I so upset about, anyway? Here she was, so friendly and self-effacing and witty, telling me how much I'd hurt her by taking a break - and I immediately felt bad for even *thinking* of wanting to take a yearlong break. The session ended with us pledging to get together for another session in a month, which she made clear would be an excruciatingly long and painful wait for her. 

The moment she left, I felt sick to my stomach. Once again, she'd lied to my face and I believed it. I felt trapped and powerless. The following day (today), I felt sick all day. I couldn't focus in work meetings. I sweated constantly. I experienced migraines. About three hours ago, I got on the phone with her and ended the friendship, telling her that we were both making each other miserable and this was the only way. 

I don't expect anyone to still be reading at this point, because this is a long and exhaustively detailed story about what was clearly an emotionally abusive relationship. Looking at it on paper now, it's obvious how toxic this was - and that's without accounting for the fact that this friendship was putting pressure on my relationship with my (wonderful) girlfriend, or the fact that my parents and all of my other friends have all been reassuring me that her behavior is beyond the pale and that I've done nothing wrong. 

And at the same time, her voice from our last phone call is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. She was so calm, and so very clearly *in pain*, even as she maintained that I had not been attentive enough to her needs and none of this would have happened if I hadn't taken a break from her. She asked if she could keep sending me new shoes on my birthday, as is our tradition, and I told her no. I'll never forget her voice as she said *Bye* for the last time. 

A throwaway post on Reddit is never going to capture what a beautiful thing we shared for such a long time. You don't know about the jokes we shared and the foods we loved, the movies we saw, the birthday party she threw for me where she got my favorite foods from all over town and arranged for one of my childhood friends to fly out and surprise me. You don't know that I had every expectation that her family would become my *de facto* family once my own parents passed away. Judged against the sheer volume of our history together, this seven months of *he said, she said* over text messages and snide remarks looks like a grain of dust, and a panicky voice inside my head whispers, *What did you do!? You threw all of that away because your feelings got hurt? You really couldn't send a couple extra text messages? What kind of person are you to hurt your friend like that?* 

I know I'll be okay. I'm surrounded by people who love me. My life is rich and full and wonderful. I have done the right thing for my emotional well-being, and it is arguably the hardest and most painful thing I have ever done. ",04Jul2018,6
30,"I'm sorry for the horrible disarray that this post is, I'm just writing as I'm thinking because I am worried.

I'm using a throwaway as my bf knows my main account, and I'm going to keep the details to a minimum because I know he browses this sub occasionally. Anything that would require me to give details I would request that you pm me rather than comment. We both live in the US.

Anyway, I'm in a long distance relationship (we are in contact almost constantly) with my bf and he has struggled with depression, ADHD, and possibly some other undiagnosed mental illeneses for several years. He is on meds for ADHD but nothing else. He has been doing ok for a while but recently he has been getting much worse. He has been self harming and binge drinking much more than usual and that's just what he has shown/told me.

I have been trying my best to be as supportive as possible of him, but it is hard being in an ldr as well as I am pretty much his only person to rely on for support. I have been trying to get him to see a therapist to help remedy that, but he says that he doesn't deserve the help. It's beginning to become very stressful for me because I worry about him so much on top of my own mental health issues that I have as well as just general life crap. And honestly, I've started to get frustrated that I can't help him, and I am not purposefully taking some of it out on him which is only making things worse.

Honestly, I'm just looking for any kind of help that I can offer him to give him another person or way to support himself. I am grateful for any advice you might give.",04Jul2018,3
31,"Let me preface this by saying this is probably going to be a lot of rambling. I'll start with the problem(s) at hand then give an overview of my background and symptoms. I do have an appointment scheduled with a new doctor, but its not for another month and this has really been weighing on my mind. I'd just like to hear others' opinions and experiences to see if they're at all similar to mine. 

I'm a 23 year old male. For the past 5 years or so, I've gradually developed some terrible anxiety-like symptoms that have really made it hard to succeed in life. I managed to graduate from a pretty decent college, but have essentially been unemployed for a year. I've felt paralyzed by over-analysis and just generally feel kind of hopeless at the moment. 

I first went to a psychiatrist on campus my sophomore year of college because of the predominantly social and performance type anxiety symptoms I was experiencing. He thought I just had an anxiety disorder, and so did the other psychiatrist I saw a couple years later back home in a different state. I've taken all sorts of medications:  SSRI's, benzos, buspirone, beta-blockers, but I just haven't significantly responded to any one of them. I've also tried a session of talk therapy and self-administered CBT workbooks, but they both felt useless to be honest. I don't believe I have the type of personality/mindset that is responsive to these methods.

Since none of these medications seem to be working for me, I'm starting to think I may have something else going on, perhaps even something that I've always had growing up but it didn't fully express itself until later on in life. I've been reading up a bit on disorders such as ADD/ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and high-functioning asperger/ASD, and I definitely seem to have a good amount of similar symptoms between each of them respectively. 

**Background:**

\-Early years to college

* Older parents (mother gave birth to me at 46 years old, and I apparently was not breathing upon delivery for a short while. Not sure how long that lasted but I obviously made it lol). I know there are some links between these things and mental disorders/autism so thought I'd bring it up.
* I was what my parents would describe as a ""runner"". I'd take off any chance I could get. A child leash was recommended to my parents multiple times. 
* These next two things have always been a big question mark for me because they seem like they were slightly significant issues but my parents always blow it off as if it were nothing. So first, I was particularly late in developing proper speech and had problems with simple syntax around preschool/kindergarten time. And throughout elementary school, I semi-regularly had to attend reading comprehension tutoring sessions. I remember there being only a few other kids with me at those, and I'm pretty sure they were there because they either had learning disabilities or really poor grades. 
* I've always had a close friend group and been a part of the rather ""popular"" circle throughout school/college, even being in a fraternity, but I can recall first feeling a little ""different"" from my peers around the middle school years. Like I totally acted and played the part of cool kid with lots of friends, but deep down I've always been quite introverted and needed alone time. It's like I strive for and desire to live an exciting, social life, but in reality I'm most comfortable being with myself doing what I want to do on my own terms.
* So I somehow got into a pretty good college, but once I'm there feel like the dumbest person in my major. I struggled hard in some classes, keeping my GPA afloat with easy non-major courses. I struggle real hard to pay attention in class. Mind is flying everywhere, can't focus on any single task on hand for too long. 

**The main symptoms:**

*Anxiety/Social-Anxiety*

\-Difficulty making/maintaining eye contact, over analyzing what to say/what i just said, having to plan what to say next, feeling like everyone is judging me. Rapid heart rate at times, fidgeting/hand tremors. Overall just major overthinking and ""paralysis by over-analysis"". 

*Indecisiveness*

\-Unable to make simple decisions. Spending hours trying to figure out what to eat. Overwhelmed by what to get at the grocery store. Spending a whole day researching some insignificant purchase I want to make.

\-Unable to decide on or stick with a career path. Constantly changing mind every month. 

\-Knowing I have to do something but continuously putting it off. 

*Obsessive Qualities*

\-Like I mentioned above, spending hours or a whole day researching something I want to purchase

\-Jumping from hobby to hobby every couple of months

\-Being extremely particular about food, like specific textures or refusing to eat leftovers. Random shit.

\-Substance Abuse: Smoked weed pretty regularly for about 4 years now. Has turned into a bit of a mental crutch.

*Emotional Instability*

\-Short temper with immediate family

\-Extremely fast and impatient driver. In the moment it's like I feel everyone is trying to slow me down on purpose or something. Stupid really.

\-Can go from feeling high-to-low with the flip of a switch

*Inattentiveness*

 \-Zoning out in the middle of a conversation, taring off because there's just too much information hitting me at once.

\-Daydreaming/unable to pay attention in class

\-Generally poor memory. Extremely forgetful of things like important dates (birthdays), remembering someones name, remembering the name of a store, song, or adjective, etc. 

Man I just want to know whats going on with me. I think if it were solely anxiety I'd have noticed a difference by now. I feel like there are so many possibilities out there and I'm just stressed out by it all. My brain is working too damn hard, I just want to relax.

 I know Reddit isn't the place to go to seek a diagnosis, but I just wanted to share my story before I go in next month. If you guys have any suggestions, ideas, whatever, I'd really appreciate. 

Thanks and happy 4th!",04Jul2018,6
32,"I've never been diagnosed for mental illness. But it's never stopped me from feeling fucking shit for a long time. I'm almost 22 but I remember turning 14 and things starting to get really hard. Really destructive thoughts, awful self esteem, hopelessness and a constant sense of worthlessness that would come and go. Sometimes I'd wake up in the morning and feel fine, other days I'd wake up and feel like offing myself. This feeling could last 15 minutes or weeks, and in some cases, months. It's awful.

I remember going to my mom twice, both times as a sort of quiet desperation. ""I really need help; I feel terrible"" and just a strong sense of needing support. I think she tried her best to help me but it always cracked down to it being my teenage hormones and that it would go away. I never went to her again about this, and haven't since. 

I had a lot of classmates in high school that I felt talked about their mental health like an accessory, for lack of a better word. They were the type of people to describe themselves at ""depressed"" whenever they felt slightly inconvenienced and I just felt a lot of resentment because it was so disrespectful to people who were actually depressed or anxious. I never wanted to be them, so I never felt like it was okay to self diagnose myself as such. 

Towards graduation it got better but I didn't do anything with it. It kind of just disappeared for most of 18-20 but I started seeing parts of it emerge once in a while. In the last 6 months, it's starting to take over my life. I've also had physical symptoms like difficulty breathing (chest tightness), feeling sick and a general nausea. My ECG was clear and I've never had a panic attack. 

Just recently, I signed myself for my university's free counselling services and started to see someone about this but it's slow progress. Honestly, I feel like there's nothing wrong with me - just that I'm weak-willed, insufficient and generally incapable of handling problems other people have to deal with. I can't validate my own problems because it doesn't feel like they exist, and that I'm just a generally shit human being. It would almost be easier for me to see a doctor and try and see what's wrong with me but part of me is terrified that I really am just an incapable, useless person who can't manage my own emotions. Writing this, I feel like I'm just asking for attention - but I just feel like I'm going fucking insane. 

tl;dr i don't believe my own issues are real and it's slowly wearing me into nothing ",04Jul2018,11

 Before all this she was saying how much she loved me for being his friend because she loves him and anyone hes good friends with, she said this all in front of him so no shes not a bad girlfriend for that, i just feel like im manipulating someone by saying that, and it really fucks with my head whenever i say things like that or get authoritative or bossy since i know i might be a narc and dont want to be that way, i dont really know if i am a narc since my last relationship didnt end well, mostly with me crying to the person i loved the most at the time to just please take me back and do some psycho shit like knock on their door at 2 am to just be next to them after a week of not seeing each other after we broke up and became ""friends"".

All the little lifestyle tips they suggest are things I do anyway, not that it matters. Their advice doesnt help when the voices inside my head start screaming, or when I reflexively punch something hard or hit myself to relieve sharp spikes in my anxiety   


I read the words of journalists and mental health trying to find words that might make sense of my thoughts and feelings. nothing works. I have just unintentionally distanced myself from emotions, and I just feel like a robot. But still, the mental illnesses keep piling up, I keep getting screened as positive for stuff but it doesnt matter. my friends say I have something and I should acknowledge it, okay how? what do I do? just scream it and then go back to being an emotionless drone? Psychiatrists actually diagnose me with something, okay fine is there a pill I can take to manage that, or are you going to just suggest more lifestyle tips that I am already trying to adhere to at the expense of my sanity from some other session.  


At this point I am just surviving, I stopped feeling invested in life years ago, I struggle to communicate with anyone, even those with similar mental illnesses or conditions, I have very few friends and very few prospects. Nothing helps, people just keep reciting cookie cutter lines at me like it could change a damn thing, but I guess they are doing their jobs, I am still here, for now.

47,"Looking for advice about dealing with non-supportive family members and anxiety meds.
  
Background: 20F, college student, USA
  
I’ve been thinking about starting a daily med for anxiety. I currently take Xanax as needed (lowest dosage, don’t remember the number), but I have a hard time making myself take it. I think I’d be better about taking something as a part of a routine, like when I brush my teeth or something. I have been considering going to my uni’s health center and talking to a doctor about it. 
  However, I’m really scared about going and actually getting more help. I can’t talk to my family about it because they will make comments about it and make me feel even worse. I told my mom I think I had anxiety about four years ago, and she laughed and told me it was phase. When I asked my mom go take me to get Xanax a year ago (I was scared and didn’t have anyone else to help at the time), she was legitimately freaked out I needed help with my mental health. The doctor told me I can switch to a daily med if I need to, and I told my mom that. She got so weird about it and tried to avoid the topic at the time, so I think she’ll think less of me if I bring it up now. 
  My mom and I have a weird relationship. She wants me to tell her everything, and while we are close, I hide a lot from her. If I tell her I need a different med, her reaction might trigger my anxiety, which is entirely counterproductive. Lately I’ve been thinking I have depression, but I haven’t been diagnosed for that yet. I can’t even begin to consider telling her that too. 
  This turned into more of a ramble, so my bad. I’m mostly looking for advice on how it feels to start taking a daily med, if they work, potential side effects, and what brands work best for you guys (if you’re willing to share). I’ve been doing my research but having a hard time narrowing down what I want to do. Advice on how to avoid and/or handle this topic with unsupportive family members is also appreciated.

Initially, I dismissed this as an English learner with a learning disability (as stated by the writer) not understanding how to write properly. However, after showing this paper to the folks over at r/EnglishLearning, it seems more likely that this was either a joke/troll (most likely) or a mental health episode (perhaps combined with learning disability and/or ESL). Here is the [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/EnglishLearning/comments/8vyivm/need_help_determining_if_document_was_written_by/) where I was given some advice. In that thread you'll also find my rough translation of it, as well as a better translation from a user in the comments

This is the last time I post here, I only need 20 more participants! 

To anyone who hasn't yet taken the survey, it is a short questionnaire (less than fifteen minutes).

The objective is to understand whether/how social status affects low mood (and possibly anxiety). My aim is to further understanding of how a person's social environment can mediate negative affect.

**I do warn that some of the questions involve assessing your levels of anxiety and low mood and a lot of questions refer to perception of social status and some people may find these distressing. Please make sure you only participate if you feel it will not affect you negatively to be asked such questions.**

People in all countries are welcome but If you're in the UK or are able to use UK Amazon vouchers from your country you have the chance to enter a draw for one out of fifteen £20 Amazon vouchers at the end of the survey.

The exact theory being tested is explained at the end of the survey to avoid biasing people's responses and **I will happily share the results once I've got them**. The data you provide is completely anonymous and cannot be traced back to you.

Thanks in advance, everyone! Here's a link:

Furthermore, a year ago if asked about mental health illnesses, I’d provide you with an ignorant, “suck it up,” response, but I’ve grown to realize it’s a serious issue plaguing the heads of many amazing, inspiring people. I’ve witnessed the severity of depression, ADHD, OCD, anxiety and so on in several college students. To take SOME bit of stress like financial concerns off their minds would mean the world to me.

I dreamed of moving to Los Angeles (did it) and now I dream of starting a scholarship fund.

I have always felt a bit envious of them but it peaked when my crush, whom I didn't have a relationship with due to the fact that I couldn't talk to him properly because of social anxiety (and never made eye contacts as I have autism too), started to date this girl who is the complete opposite of me, she is that socially active, extroverted person who made more friends within a day of being in this school than I did in nearly four years of being here. She has admirers in every corner, everyone thinks she is pretty and loves her (or it feels like everyone to me at least) and nevermind the fact that, you know, she is dating my crush. So this has had me project my feelings on other people as well. I saw another girl like this in a wedding a few days ago and I reflexively got the same vibe from her so I confirmed that I didn't like her at all without having even known her name or have ever spoken to her. The truth is I feel intimidated by them. I feel as if they are purposefully put on this earth to tease me. It has gotten to the point where I have begun to feel annoyed at my brother, another extroverted person, who has also made so many friends within the first few days of being in his school, and although we get along well I still sometimes get the same feeling from him.

When I left I got a good engineering job which is challenging, however now after two years I realise I may be missing something. All of my conversations are technical, I am no psychologist but I think I live to please others and make them happy hence studying hard and getting very good grades and I go out of my way to do things for others and love the comments back.

Before I start, keep in mind that i’m a 15 year old female.} First of all, depersonalization and derealization are not the same yet they are quite similar. Depersonalization is feeling disconnected or detached from yourself while derealization is feeling detached from your surroundings. I’ve personally struggled with this all my life and it’s something i’ve been diagnosed with by several counselors. I’m writing about this now because it’s starting to really get to me. Basically, it stems from childhood trauma-or any type of trauma I think- and happens as a way to cope. So for me, it stems from child molestation. I know, pretty serious. Not many people know about it and personally I hate talking about it. I only recently told my mother since i’ve been pretty scared to talk about it because my biological father was the one doing it. Thank God I have the most amazing and supportive mom and the world because she’s been here for me 24/7. I forgot to mention that when I was born my parents were not married so every other weekend I would have to go to my dads house. I don’t really remember everything that happened since my mind has blocked almost all of it out. Yet I do know that I would always beg my mom to let me stay home, like I would even make her take me to the hospital even when there wasn’t anything wrong with me only to stay away from him. I wont go into details, but I will say that he made me very uncomfortable. I hated being around him, and at the time I didn’t want to tell my mom in fear of what might happen. He would always bribe me with money, saying that if I would move in with him he’d buy me whatever I wanted. When I was 9, my mom got married and so we all moved up from texas to south carolina. Sadly, since i’ve kept quiet about it for so long, I haven’t been able to really live my life. Ive never kissed anyone, been in a relationship, I absolutely hate physical contact (even hugs), I have severe depression and anxiety, and I have this horrid depersonalization derealization disorder.

I have been seeking to get in with a psychologist or therapist but have had no success.  I'm sure its largely due to the July 4th holiday, but I began calling places on Thursday of last week (4 business days before the holiday).

I used my health insurance website to search for doctors and called them, I found that either their phone number was no longer in service (2 or 3 places), rang with no answer or voicemail (1 or 2 places), rang with a voicemail (3 or 4 places), or picked up and immediately hung up on me (1 place).  I then searched for those places websites and looked for ""make an appointment"" or ""contact us"" and sent messages to several (4 or 5 of the places I previously called).

I am hoping to address some issues that are not immediately urgent (I wouldn't say I am suicidal, but I have had intrusive thoughts pertaining to suicide, like ""what would happen if I killed myself"").  This lack of being able to contact any specialist is quite frustrating.  Also, I believe that several days ago, I was in a position to be very candid about my issues and I no longer feel that I want to be candid...something that I have found I am only really capable of for a short period of time (usually at the pit of a depressive episode) every few years (seemingly a 2 year cycle with peaks and valleys along the way).

Does anyone have better advice to finding a qualified professional?",04Jul2018,3
74,"I'll keep this short. I ended speaking with someone for about 30 minutes. After we spoke I felt a lot better. However, the agent said that they wanted to call to check on me today. He said they would call around 10am. I didn't get a call from them at that time. I got a call at 7:30am from a local number which I missed. The caller ID was some code, no name. They left an automated voice mail for me saying ""please call this department back at (the number that called and left voicemail). If you do not call back a police warrent will be issued for your arrest"". When I call the number is rings once then ends the call. So I can't get back to them. 

Now I'm concerned that the suicide prevention line is going to send police to to my house. I don't know what to do. Can they do that? I never gave them my exact address. Should I be worried about this or could the call and voicemail just be a spam coincidence? I'm really worried.",04Jul2018,1
75,"My sister recently lived on the other side of the planet with her BF in their house and seemed happy with a job. After breaking up with BF she quickly moved to new area and bought new house with new job. She struggled with everything and started to lose control before losing her job and relying on friends and neighbours to keep her company in her new place. BF parents were worried about her and called our parents who convinced her to fly back home to live with us because she had no job and couldn't afford to live in new house and pay mortgage. She has since sat on the couch watching TV for about 6 months.

My sister has had problems in the past with anxiety/depression etc. and dropped out of Uni because of it. I have also had similar problems and maybe she is assuming that because counselling solved my problems, of course I will try and get her to do it. Me and parents have tried to convince her that she needs some real help and she even went to a single counselling session but said she already knew everything they were telling her. She talks about nothing other than wanting to be back where she was and blames parents for bringing her back etc. Starting to put lots of pressure on parents who are also dealing with other things.

Any help would be great. Thanks.",04Jul2018,2
76,"Since two years i have been struggeling with depression, I finally found medication that works for me. So im feeling a lot Better.

I am doing lots of things I couldnt before; our house is clean, I am wearing make-up again and I actually answer text messages people send me.

The only thing that isnt going well yet it that I cant oversee a whole day, when I wake up at 9 I have done Some cleaning, laundry, unloaded the dishwasher and taken a bath. Then its between 12 and 1 and I dont know what to do with myself from that moment on. I am fine again at 5 because I can cook and my boyfriend gets home by 5.30 so we can eat and hang out. I could do more housework, but when I do too much I get tired and I Will not be able to do what I normally can the next day. I still dont like any of my hobbies enough to entertain myself with that in the meantime and watching tv is only fun for so long. 

Usually I end up going to bed at 1 and set an alarm for 4.30. Its a Nice nap, but I feel like I wouldnt need it if i had something useful to so with my time. 

Is there anyone who feels like this too, like a day is just to long for them? I dont neccesarily want to add more must-do’s since that would make my day busier and more ‘stressful’. But I would like to do something useful. Anyone who has solved this problem already and wants to share Some advice? 

thank you in advance! ",04Jul2018,12
77,"Just thought I'd mention that I am 12 in case it serves any significance.

My name is Joseph and my best friend is suicidal. Every night he texted me and we talk about one thing or another. It probably helps him feel less alone in the world, and he can discuss his private issues with me freely.
But he has severe depression. He is addicted to self harming, and his parents told him long ago to stop. But one day he left his phone at home. Turns out his parents knew his password and got onto his phone. In his notes they found suicide notes and in his Instagram and photos they found self harming photos. They weren't too happy, and forced him to pay for a haircut that he didn't want. He was bullied quite a lot for it, which definitely didn't help him at all. One day when I was walking home he randomly texted me: ""Bye""
He had attempted to kill himself but luckily he failed. Since then I've been trying to convince him that he will eventually recover from his suicidal thoughts and gradually become happier, but he is having none of it. He hasn't exactly had an easy life either. His friend faked suicide to ditch him, his grandmother and favourite rapper died on the same day (xxxtentacion) and he just thinks of himself as a burden to the world. Everyone I've sought help from just says to call 999 or something along those lines, but I feel it would do no good, and I don't have the guts anyway. 

I just don't want to be responsible for the suicide of my best friend because I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it.",04Jul2018,3

Also my English is bad and lot of this text will be chaotic af.
I've had enough, I don't think I will take my life any time soon but I just can't keep going like this. I almost messaged someone and talked with them but I don't want them to feel bad for me.
They all believe that I am a happy and funny guy, one of my classmates even told me I'm probably the funniest person he knows (one of the few compliment I've gotten and I still hold it dear to my heart). I am not. I may appear happy and funny but all of that is a facade that I put up for others every morning. It is exhausting but I feel terrible whenever my sadness slips onto the surface. 
Summer holiday started like five days ago in my country. I've discovered that without trying to look happy I get even worse, crying myself to sleep became daily routine and I can't even stand my favorite games and movies. I honestly feel like I need a hug and friend to talk to (right now I've got a pillow and Reddit) but I don't want to make anyone else feel bad.
I've had these unhappy feelings for like a year straight and at one point I even told my mom ( I'm 17 and still live with my parents) that I feel terrible inside and I don't think I can handle school anymore- she told me that everybody feels like that and I just need to push through it... If that's true than good job to everyone who is stronger than me.

I am religious and have my beliefs as to what happens after life but it’s just the uncertainty that scares me. It’s been affecting my everyday life and I haven’t been able I think straight. It’s a very bipolar experience. At some points I won’t be thinking about it that much, but at other points I’ll be hyperventilating and I’ll be horrified by my own thoughts. I’m not necessarily afraid of death, I’m just afraid of what comes after it. This has all come out of nowhere and I just would like to know if it’s normal or not. I don’t know if it’s a phase or not, but I really hope that it is. I would really appreciate any help that anyone could offer.",04Jul2018,4
81,"Had a long day of work today, and my mind is more exhausted then my body. In the past, I've always had a hard time focusing or I hyperfocus and sometimes I don't think enough or I over think. It doesn't help that I worry about screwing things up all the time, and when I do I get mad at myself for it. This isn't healthy at all, cause I'm pretty sure degrading myself over this has made not only that worse, but I feel depressed. I don't feel motivation to work hard or to go to work at all, I feel like it's pointless.

I had a suicidal thought today. I was thinking about how much time we dedicate to work compared to how much time we have to ourselves, how our jobs control and define us, how we will always be making money and losing half of it to the nessessities.

Oops I lost focus 

I just think all the time, I never really focus on what I'm doing. I can also be very clumsy. I'm often fatigued, that or I get tired easily. Im trying to decide what I want to do in the future as a career(18) but I'm finding that decision extremely stressful because I'm afraid of screwing it up and ending up a mindless sad drone grinding out money. 

I don't know what's wrong with me man, if I were to diagnose myself I'd say depression anxiety and ADHD, but I was tested for ADHD and i didn't have it, and I haven't been tested for depression or anxiety but I took this Goldberg test thing online and it told me moderate-severe depression.

86,"My entire life I've been a jumpy, anxious person. My mom used to call me a ""worrier"" when I was a little kid. I've gone through highs and lows with this my entire life and I am just so sick of it. I have a beautiful, caring, wonderful girlfriends, that I am absolutely terrified of losing. I constantly ask her if she is ok, if I'm  bothering her, if I'm upsetting her. I worry that I am not trying hard enough to keep her and I am taking her for granted if I leave the house and don't come back with flowers or a coffee from star bucks. I am certain she has doubts or seconds thoughts about being with me even after she has assured me she doesn't. And known of this is her fault, she has not encouraged any of this fear in me. It's gotten to the point that by far our biggest problem is my insecurity about our problems.  


And it's not limited to my relationship. If I see members of my family, my friends or coworkers looking  upset or mad, I immediately assume it's my fault. I start to convince myself that none of my friends really like me. As such I spend more than I can afford taking people out to restaurants and buying gifts and I feel terrible when i can't afford to. If I hear a car honking I assume it's towards me. I worry that certain thoughts or opinions make me a bad person so I try really hard to be liked by everyone. I feel guilty if I sleep in or relax too much, because I feel like I am always forgetting something I need to do. 

I've tried therapy and it does nothing, all it feels like is a forced attempt to make incredibly awkward conversation that goes nowhere. I'm on Anxiety meds but so far as i can tell they've had no effect.  I feel guitly for having these issues, because as a straight, white, cis-gender, middle class male I don't feel like I have a to ""complain"" or be miserable. I've never been molested. I've never been in a combat situation. The closest I've ever been to ""trauma"" in my life is an emotionally abusive relationship that lasted over 5 years. Prior to that I was raised in a house with a lot of fighting. My father traveled for work constantly and my mother would drink, take pills and go through episodes of mania and depression. 

Every once In a while I think abstractly about killing myself. I imagine flooring the gas in my car and letting it fly off a cliff, or laying down in a tub and cutting my wrists and just drifting off. I have never been serious about it, but the thoughts persist and there are days when they really seem a bit better than the alternative. 

So, rant over. I just had to get it out there, see if there is anyone else who's dealt with similar issues. Thanks for reading",04Jul2018,1

But lately I’ve found myself crying myself to sleep almost every night because I am not good enough and he deserves so much better.

My inner “self” is concerned I will die in my sleep because of my “six pack a night” two times a week.
When I go to sleep, the inner Demons are always saying “welp they’re dead this time..” “what an idiot. They’re going to choke on vomit and die” “oh no, if only they didn’t drink. Fall asleep, and she’s a goner. Too bad suicide ends in hell fire” “wow she tried so hard but a beer is going to KILL HER! She’ll choke on vomit! Her poor family..”
So I’m at an existential crisis every time I fall asleep. I try to stay awake to stay alive but I end up fading into unconsciousness. One beer or ten. And it’s horrible because the need for that beer is greater than dealing with my voices telling me I’m going to hell.
