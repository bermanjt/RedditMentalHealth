0,"As the title says, that's where I'm at.

I've so far been burned twice by therapists who didn't care to build a trust relationship before proceeding and thought that just by having a degree and me being willing to pay, meant I should ""trust"" them. Obviously, no. A third time, the therapist couldn't deal with a few facets of my past and we parted amicably, but it left me feeling like I had wasted a lot of time since I'd have to restart with someone else, *again*.

It's been a few years. I'm tired of doing all this alone, but being alone is better than being in a bad relationship... with a therapist. :)

The next time I try I want to be damn sure I know how to filter out ones that are more interested in having me toe their line / sit there and take my money, than listen and help me with the things I actually need help with.

Are there any magic keywords to use in databases to make the search easier?

Any characteristics I should look for?",13Aug2018,1,
1,"I don't recognise myself anymore. I see myself as more of a memory of somebody, like when you think of someone close to you who has passed away.
And I think I've been very sad for a long time because I never knew why I felt like this, at least until now.

I don't have that sense of belonging anymore, but not in terms of my house, or where I live. What I mean is I don't really feel at home in this world anymore. I haven't been sleeping well lately, so I like to sit outside and look at the stars. And this is the only time that I really feel a sense of homeliness, that I don't feel disconnected. 

I know it sounds silly but I think the reason the stars makes me feel at home is because that is where I'm meant to be. Like I'm home sick for a place I can't remember. It's as if my soul or whatever is ready to move on to its next destination in the universe, but I'm still here. I'm still alive.

That's what it is. I'm homesick, but for where for I'm not sure. All I know is it's somewhere far beyond where I am now.

I know how odd and cliche this must sound, but it's the only thing that makes sense in my head right now. I'm sorry for rambling, I just need to know if anybody out there understands. ",13Aug2018,11,
2,"I have had anxiety and have confirmed ADHD. I’m not treated for either right now. Anxiety has been causing me to be stressed out and I can’t enjoy trips with my family or beach days like I used to, due to the stress of people and changing environments, my body physically won’t let me enjoy it. I realized i have a pattern of being successful for three days-two weeks and then i crash hard. If i drink caffeine i can thrive for three days and then I’m sick and exhausted for the next day to a week. When i don’t drink caffeine I can do what I need to do (homework, assignments, yoga, walks, socializing) for two weeks and then crash. Does anyone else get that crazy exhaustion? I’m in grad school about to start an internship and can’t live like this anymore. I’m hoping it’s a mixture of my anxiety/adhd. I’m trying to see a psychiatrist ASAP and get on medications. I hate medications but I hate not being able to do anything either some days and wasting my life. I’ve succeeded on a medication before for 7 years and wish I could go back to that but my insurance doesn’t cover it because I’m a poor grad student. Hoping something will work for me. I’m watching TV and can’t even enjoy that. Just wanted to feel less alone and hear anyone else’s experience with anxiety/exhaustion!",13Aug2018,2,
3,"Just need to vent a little bit. It's been a hectic day...

I've been a long-time sufferer of clinical depression. Earlier this January I was hospitalized at the behest of my psychiatrist and was soon thereafter put on sertraline, which I've been consistently taking at 100mg for the past 5-6 months. Since June, however, I've noticed that some depressive symptoms have been insidiously creeping back into my life: random crying spells, inexplicably negative mood, etc., all of which have been very sporadic and relatively low-key, and therefore easily dismissed.

Everything reached boiling point this Sunday afternoon after my father walked in on me taking a shower. 

(Being a college student, I don't live with my parents anymore, but I left the US in May so I could spend my Summer vacation in my old childhood home)

Since I seem to be greeted by Buick-sized roaches each time I try to use my own bathroom, I've been taking all of my showers in my sister's bathroom for the past few days. My father, making his usual rounds around the house, thought the wind had somehow--without his hearing it--shut both my sister's door as well as the door leading up to the bathroom I was using, and took the liberty of opening up both (for whatever reason).

He comes across me standing in the shower, naked, and I frantically yell at him to shut the door.

Upon completing my shower and getting dressed, I meet him in the living room and demand to know why he felt the need to go into my sister's bedroom to open her bathroom door, without even bothering to knock first. I'm visibly upset and expect him to at least apologize. After all, I'm mortified, just as any 19-year-old girl would be if her dad were to suddenly walk in on her while she's in the nude.

Instead of an apology, I get anger and defensiveness. What was I doing taking a shower in my sister's bathroom in the first place? His temper flares up and he yells at me to shut the Hell up, loud enough for the whole house to hear what's going on. At that point, I just end the discussion and passively retreat to my bedroom. I feel utterly humiliated.

That humiliation quickly evolved into a profound feeling of anger I have seldom ever experienced in my life. My whole body was shaking. I felt so fucking degraded.

I reached into my drawer for my lighter and a cigarette, hoping that the rush of nicotine would at least calm me down a little. Impulsively, I grabbed my safety razor and headed for the upstairs balcony where I began to cut the skin on my left leg. 

Each cut was made slowly and purposefully. It felt so fucking good. So satisfying in a deep, sort of primal way. It definitely took the edge of my anger MUCH better than the cigarette did, though I couldn't stop sobbing and shaking until I took some Benadryl and forced myself to fall asleep. Before heading to bed, I took what was left of my medication and furiously flushed it down the toilet. Major fuck up on my part because I don't see my psych until September and the country I'm staying in currently doesn't have sertraline available anywhere.

I've since woken up and calmed down, though I feel especially numb. I think the gravity of what I've done to myself has yet to hit. Even when I was at my lowest and most suicidal, I never once considered self-mutilation as a possible outlet. It was a very disproportional reaction, I think, but the anger I felt was so exceptionally raw, that it scares me to think what else I might have done if I hadn't taken that razor to my skin in an effort to dampen my emotions.

10,"So, my mom passed away in 2013 (I was 18). I spent a year living with my dog in the house with her boyfriend before he wanted to sell the house and I had to move. I moved in with my aunt.

My mental health has gone all over the place for years and years... my stepmom passed away when I was 12 (she was closer to me than my real mom, at the time), and my aunt has since been at least emotionally abusive. When I first moved in, I moved into the basement (my sister and I both moved in, and there’s only three bedrooms, and my aunt had one of her two sons living at home still). My aunt used to specifically come down to the basement to stand in the doorway and yell at me. She used to treat my dog pretty shit (locked her in her room all day long, and id come home to that), etc. One day I came home after work and found out that the day care I worked at would be permanently closing, and I went to my room to cry because I loved my job, and she came downstairs, asked what was wrong, and yelled at me for being upset, because I had only worked there for a few months.
I got a new job at a hotel after, and after almost a year of being there, I became really close with my boss and her son. Her son and I were really interested in each other, so we tried to hang out a lot—when I would ask to hang out with him, she would yell at me and tell me how stupid I was and that my mom would be so disappointed in me. She dug up dirt on him and threw it in my face—I couldn’t handle the constant yelling and insults anymore, so I had to break it off with him. She continued to talk shit about his mom, though... but during all this, I had slowly started to discover she was talking to my boss’s husband... and down the line, I discovered that she was SLEEPING with my boss’ husband. For almost two years, I had to keep this from my boss—I didn’t know what to do.
I also used to get into huge fights with her, and on more than one occasion, I packed a bag and went to my uncle’s house—he talked me down, and I went back. Since the last time that happened, my aunt STILL won’t trust me anymore (I’ve brought up ‘I feel like you don’t trust me,’ thinking she’d say no I do or something, and she brings up the last time I walked out).
I don’t drink because I don’t care to. She has, in the past, found alcohol in the basement (I had moved out of the basement andinto one of the actual bedrooms by then, almost a year or two later, when my cousin was using that room as his hang out room) and she took a photo of t and posted it on Facebook and tagged myself and my cousin in it, saying “someone has some explaining to do.” I was already 21. I untagged myself and said “you of all people should know that I don’t drink.”
She also has taken photos of my bedroom and posted them on fb before because they were messy, trying to shame me into cleaning my room (I’m aware that I needed to clean my room, but life is too short to be absorbed with cleaning my room that no one ever sees... and I also get really overwhelmed because my bedroom is the size of a small walk-in closet. I’m surprised it fits a bed and a dresser in it.)
She can get really pissy at something and I’ve tried to leave the room before and she yells at me to get back in the living room, things like “You don’t have to leave” and shit likely that...
I’m 23 and a college graduate. I live at home so I can save up money to move—and I’m not 100% sure on where I want to live or where I want to work yet, so my plan is to move a year from now at the latest. 
Last summer, she told me I had to come home by 2am, because drunk people are more responsible getting home than I am. She also thinks I go out and drink.
This summer, she told me I’m 23, so I don’t have a curfew. But then, a few weeks later, yelled at me for coming home after 2, stating the same thing, and that if I’m not home by 2am, that I can sleep in my car because she’s locking the deadbolt (no one has a key to it, so I wouldn’t be able to get in). 

Because of all of this, the constant yelling at me for the past 4+ years, I get this rush of a panic every time she’s angry about something, and I’m frozen to my chair while she’s yelling st the computer because the wifi isn’t working, because I’m afraid of being yelled at again. I come home before 2am, because I don’t want to be yelled at again. I ask if a friend can come over, or if I can go to a friend’s house, because I don’t want to be yelled at again. I try not to leave the house unless she’s at work because I don’t want to be yelled at again—she used to text me all the time about where I was and who I was with, because she thought I was with a boy. I can’t date. I have to wake her up when I get home so she knows I’m home. If she finds something weird, she’ll make fun of me for it.

My boss and her husband have had a divorce now, and my aunt is no longer seeing him—she now has her own boyfriend (who is really good for her), and a lot of the yelling has stopped, but there’s still more than enough still there. She’s been a LOT nicer to me since the new boyfriend, but the damage is still done.

I tried to see a campus counselor about some of my issues (I’ve had friends abandon me, which has me constantly consumed my the thought of these people, crying daily... my dad had recently gotten in my face and screamed at me to get the fuck out of his house and never come back, while blocking me from getting my keys, so I wasn’t able to even leave until he was done screaming at me, etc). It seemed like all the counselor was interested in was if I was suicidal or not... I also described to him how I have these highs and lows, where some days I’m in a high and I am ABSOLUTELY FINE and I feel like I can take on the world, but other days in my lows, I don’t feel like moving, I think I am pathetic and I am worth next to nothing and I NEED HELP. He wasn’t concerned.

I know I’m in a toxic environment, and I know I should leave (it’s easier said than done). Should I find some kind of therapist? I felt like seeing someone was a waste of time after that counselor... the main thing I wanted from HIM was like... some kind of diagnosis or like a “you probably have this” but he basically told me I don’t have anything and I’m fine. I want to know what Ali have for the purpose of like... I know and have previously been diagnosed with ADHD, and I know how my brain works around THAT so I can figure out, how do I make this thing work with ADHD, you know? So I want to know, if I have _____, how do I do my everyday things while having that, or how do I cope, etc.
I also just want a little validation of like, this is at least some form of abuse, right? Emotional or verbal or whatever, that my aunt has been putting me through...",13Aug2018,1,

What I hate most is, is that I'm aware of what I'm doing but I don't want to act on these feelings but I become impulsive and it's hard to stop myself. And what hurts the most is, I know I'm hurting the one I love and I'm affecting their mental health as well. This is where the guilt sets in.

I am a horrible friend because I push everyone away and disappear for long periods of time which is becoming a frequent thing.

Reason is that every time I talk, it feels like I only bring negativity and highlight my problems of loneliness, clinical depression and being suicidal for the longest time. 
My online friends say that I don't but the self-conscious mind says otherwise.
I feel like a bother to people when I message them to say hello. Feeling like a bother even when I try to make the conversation about them. In my opinion, the best course of action is to stop bothering others from their life and just die already.
In a fucked up way, I want to feel needed and want someone to miss me. Perhaps I'm being too needy with wanting emotional comforts. I can't help it at times when I've been alone most of my life.

The nothingness IS that feeling that the rage and fear and unbearable sadness inside you cannot be expressed, cannot be shared. 

It is lonliness.

It is isolation.

It is the terrible dread that no matter what, you cannot be understood, you WILL not find connection, and NOTHING you do can break the barriers of your words, of your deeds, and of your mind.

I’ve always had very bad anxiety over really anything, but recently I’ve been very fixated on the possibility of having an std (particularly herpes). The chance of me having it is basically 0 seeing as I’ve never had sex, but I spend hours thinking about it and whenever I get razor burn or pimples on my lower half I have panic attacks and can’t sleep. I donated blood a couple months back and they test for some stds but not all (herpes which is why I’m so nervous).

I think I should get tested just to ease my anxiety, but it is quite expensive and I don’t want to do it in a way where my dad would find out because he wouldn’t believe me that I’m not having sex. I found a reliable test for $200 but now I’m thinking if it is actually worth it and what would I do if I did come up positive for something.

Also I don’t mean to mock anyone or stds :(

22,"I'm kinda at the end of my rope here, and I need some help because I can't tell for myself what's happening anymore. Here's the most background I'm comfortable giving out on the internet:

Beginning in my early teens, I began to be psychologically abused by my parents, and neglected emotionally, physically and sometimes medically. When my needs were met, I was guilted about it to the point of self-starvation and self-harm. I withdrew from peers, and attempted suicide.

I was hospitalized several times for my psychiatric problems, but solely, in my mind, because it would reflect poorly on my parent's careers if I committed suicide successfuly. My siblings were similarly treated. One wrote on the walls like in a movie to escape their thoughts, one, still very young, breaks their toys and curses at them. The other just cries.

In my late teens, I was finally diagnosed with Bipolar I, and began to be medicated to the point that I could think of things that didn't include a bullet in my head, and one thing stung hard:

I'm still fucked up, but I fought very hard to get to where I am today. One of the steps I had to take was enduring fights that sometimes lasted for literal nonstop days to get the treatment I needed, and I think that they may have tried getting revenge for that. During a psychiatric assessment I took in my teens, the report stated that I had extreme problems controlling my anger.

Except for one situation in my life that I regret deeply, I have never been an angry person. People have mentioned how laid back I am to me upon meeting me. I consciously try to see the best in people.

I know that this is just the internet. I know that you don't know me. But does it sound to you like they fucked with the results of the test because they were mad at me, or do you think I actually should talk to someone about anger? I really can't think of any time I've gotten genuinely upset at someone in the last... ever.

28,"…so, I feel like I come to Reddit too much for advice on my mental health, but it usually seems to help. Different perspectives and all that.

For a quick(ish) rundown, I have dealt with mental health issues for probably at least 15 years. Since puberty, pretty much (yay, fun times…). I was scared to get help, partially due to attempts in the past that either went poorly or simply brushed over the issue.

Recently I reached the point were I felt capable of seeking help, and I’ve been trying so many things over the last year and a half. I’ve changed doctors, seen a psychiatrist, seen 3 different therapists and I’m on my 6 attempted medication.

I don’t feel like I’m making any progress. I have probably made some progress. I mean, I am more accepting of my problems and can kind of talk about them. But other than that, it’s worse. I am somewhere between ‘self-employed’ and ‘unemployed’. I get really excited when I have days where I manage to cook and do laundry and a couple of chores.

I kind of feel like I’m making all the wrong decisions. I put off trying medications for quite a while because I didn’t want to end up in the overmedicated category. I finally decided to try it. Then I ended up changing doctors due to the cost, while simultaneously starting to see a psychiatrist to try a better approach to the medication. This probably nullified the reason for changing doctors (although I really like my new one, so there’s that). I'm on my third therapist, and I don't know how to tell how that's going.

Even with all these various individuals, I feel like I’m doing all the work. There’s no testing, little monitoring. I was the one to have to realize that I should make a tracking system, and I’m the only one who looks at it. I’m not even sure if I’ve been ‘diagnosed’ with anything other than depression and maybe anxiety (I'm assuming I was diagnosed with those...). Most of what I know about my problems is self-diagnosed at this point (gender identity issues, suspected Aspergers) and I don’t know if they are taking this into consideration or just brushing it off. Maybe I’m expecting too much out of these systems.

Of the medications I’ve tried, one wasn’t great and had uncomfortable side effects, two caused me to go into 2 month+ depressive episodes worse than anything I’ve been through before, and the others had side effects that ended with me not being on them for long. The last one was after they recommended I try the Genomind testing (and found out that SSRIs don’t work for me at all), and it has me feeling pretty put off of medications altogether (2+ months of the worst depression I’ve probably ever had). I’m on an anti-anxiety medication now because that was the better sounding option compared to another anti-depressant, and now I don’t know what that is doing as opposed to the effects of getting off of the antidepressant, which I suspect is the major cause of my improved mood.

I suppose that my main question is:

What should I do about doctors and medications? My GP doctor has expressed willingness to help me, but has also encouraged my seeing a psychiatrist due to their specialization. The situation with my psychiatrist feels… futile? I’ve seen two people there (due to a pregnancy) and they have both been empathetic and understanding. It still feels like going down a list of drugs to try, russian roulette style, and I’m feeling very wary of trying another antidepressant. I’m also wondering about if I should stick with the anti-anxiety medication or how to even measure the effects. I don’t want to be on a drug long term simply because it doesn’t make things worse when it may not be making things better.

I’ve considered trying over the counter supplements. I’m a bit nervous to ‘self-medicate’, but I might be able to coordinate through my GP for that. Or take any other advice she has (she is a direct primary care doctor, and I’m still trying to figure out how to best utilize this resource). I’ve looked at websites like Dominate Depression, which sounds like it is more personalized than a psychiatrist and cheaper.

I am at the point where I feel like any of the choices (staying with the psychiatrist, trying my GP or doing it myself) are the wrong decision. I don’t even know which direction to turn, so I was hoping to get some advice or shared experiences here. 

Thanks a lot for reading all of this, and thanks for any advice.",13Aug2018,1,
29,"Sometimes I have this really overwhelming desire to get extremely injured. The most common of these is that I will sometimes, when I am crossing a street, wish I could get hit by a car.

30,"My (26M) girlfriend (25F) of 3 years is struggling with crippling anxiety and stress. She is in tears multiple times a month, mostly from  struggling at work. This has been getting worse over the past 6 months. I  try to be as supportive as I know how to be, and I recognise that I  simply don't have the skills to help her to understand her emotions or  cope with the way she's feeling, she's unwilling/unable to talk to me  about the way she feels, which I can understand. A few weeks ago I was able to persuade her to speak to a doctor, which she did reluctantly and  had a positive experience. Unfortunately the doctor prescribed her  medication and fortunately recommended she speaks to a professional, and  gave her the information she needs to do so. However, she's refusing to  pursue further help, isn't taking any medication. I've suggested she  records a mood diary when she's feeling low, which I think will help her  in the long run, which she refuses to do. When I ask how she's progressing or anything about how she's feeling I  get shut out  completely, she then behaves as if I've verbally attacked her for  asking.  


She is is very functional, and if you didn't know you probably wouldn't suspect it. My concern is that this isn't getting any  better, and all I want is for her to feel better about herself and to be  happy in her life, she explains herself as being 'broken' which upsets me hugely.  


I just don't know what to do any more, and the more this resistance goes on it's beginning to impact my mental state. I  don't want to leave her, as I do love her and want the best for her, and I can't think of anything worse for her at this point in her life as  she loves me equally. My concern for her is overwhelming all of my other feelings and it's slowly depressing me.

I've been experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety for some time, and feel like it might finally be a good time to start doing something about it. I have no idea where to start though?

33,"Doctors say that his symptoms indicate schizophrenia. This is going to be a long post and I understand that many of you might not have the time to go through all of this and hence I will use bold font for the section in which I specifically talk about the issues that he has been facing. However for those who do, I feel like it would be helpful to provide some background. 

I am 26 y/o guy and my brother is 34. Both of us are from Mumbai, India. I moved abroad 4 years ago for my education and I've been living overseas since. My brother lives with my mom(53) and dad(63) in a small apartment in Mumbai.

Growing up, both of us went to the same school in Mumbai. Being elder to me, he was in higher grades and got out earlier.  I remember my brother to be a very cheerful and happy kid at that time. While he wasn't that great when it came to studies, he was an extremely well behaved student. I was kind of the opposite(good at studies but a troublemaker of sorts). I ended up being taught by some of the same teachers that had earlier taught my brother and they still remembered him(despite of the 8 year difference!). Since I was not among the most well behaved kids, I was told multiple times by several of my teachers that they found it extremely hard to believe that we were real brothers and that he was a million times better than me. When our school principal was about to retire, he wrote a letter to my brother appreciating him for being such a nice student(Worth mentioning as this was quite unusual). He had some really nice friends as well. During this period, the relationship between my dad and my brother wasn't that great since he was not getting good grades. For this reason, my dad often used to beat my brother up. My mom however, was sympathetic and used to side with him whenever conflicts occurred. 

Due to his lack of interest in studies, he struggled through college. He still had a good social life and had quite a few close friends that he hung out with on a regular basis. At that time when he was between 18 and 22, he developed sort of a passion for becoming a Radio Jockey. He used to record his own segments on the tape, took professional classes also once went live on air on a very popular radio station in our city.  However, this passion of his didn't last too long and his interest somehow faded away slowly. 

He somehow got done with his bachelor's and got hired at a call center, providing customer support to people overseas. His job required him to work night shifts. This time of his life wasn't that bad either since he had just started earning his own money and he could now buy some nice clothes and other stuff. My dad's relationship with him improved significantly and they both got along pretty well.

A small tangent from the original topic: My mother has also been struggling with her own mental issues from as early on as I can remember. She had a bad opinion of some my dad's relatives and this resulted in confrontations. Often times when things were going perfectly fine, my mom would dig up some event that had happened in the distant past in which one of these relatives had treated her poorly. She would then start abusing my dad. My parents used to regularly have such heated arguments and fights(they still do, but not as often). While he was between 23 and 28, my brother spent a lot of his free time with my mother and she used to give him detailed accounts of those past experiences in which she was mistreated by so many of her relatives. While I'm not really sure about whether those accounts were accurate or exaggerated, they did have an impact on my brother's view of the world. He slowly developed this belief that most people had bad intentions and wanted him to fail(Regardless to mention that my mother held a similar view). Also, during this period, he slowly started losing touch with his close friends(I'm sure this happens to a lot of us). While he did manage to make a few new friends his job, none of them were as meaningful and significant to him as his previous ones. 

**Until then, my brother had shown absolutely no signs of issues with his mental health. Around the age of 28, he started excessively and unreasonably worrying about his performance at his job. He often used to tell my mom that he was afraid he would soon be fired. He used to stressed out and cranky at home, often getting angry over small things. He changed his job several times.** 

**The day that we thought we might have to see a psychologist went something like this: My brother came home in the evening after going outside for a brief walk. The street in front of our apartment-building was under repair and some 'CAUTION' signs had been put up around it. He told us this was an indication that someone was trying to harm him. He wanted to run away from us so that we would be safe. We assured him that he had no reason to worry and took him to a psychologist who prescribed some drugs.** 

Around that time, I managed to secure admission into a really good university abroad and I moved away from my family. I thought that my brother's issues weren't that major and I believed he would recover from them in a short period. However, things got worse to a point that I never ever imagined them to reach. I've been having video calls with my family on a regular basis(every other day) every since I moved away and I noticed this gradual decline in my brothers mental health.  All of his friends got married, had kids and started raising their families while he struggled to maintain a steady job. This undeniably caused him a lot of depression. My parents did try to convince my brother on several occasions to get married(via a traditional Indian arranged marriage), however he wanted to stick around and wait for the right partner.

About a year ago, I took it upon myself to help my brother overcome his troubles and improve his life. Until then, I had been giving him general advice. However, I realized that he wasn't very good with figuring things out himself and I needed to give him detailed and specific steps to achieve something. I believed that it was important to separate him from my mother who had been feeding him with negative thoughts and so I came up with a simple plan: I told him to consider moving abroad for higher education. I told him that studying abroad will eventually help him secure a well paying job and this will lead to a significantly improved quality of life. I thus tried to bring meaning into his life by giving him something to aim for and he agreed with me to get onto this path. I helped him prepare for entrance tests. We used to have 1-2 hour video calls on weekends to solve math problems. However, he didn't take his studies very seriously and slacked off. Ultimately, he ended up doing very poorly in those exams and we concluded that it didn't make sense to apply anywhere with those scores. Seeing all of my efforts go to waste caused me a lot of frustration. I believe that he wasn't truly committed to making it happen and was taking things casually. I gave up my hopes in him and significantly reduced my interactions with him.

**Fast forward to today, my brother is 34, unmarried, has been jobless for almost a year and has been on and off treatment several times. He blames my parents, mainly my dad for his current situation. About 2-3 times a week, he gets into a fit of rage and starts abusing my dad. For example, a few weeks ago, he started yelling at my father to lend him some money for stock market trading. He has an abnormal sleep cycle and he usually stays up till 4am, watching TV shows. He has absolutely no friends and dislikes almost everyone. He seems to have lost trust in my parents and about a couple of months ago, declared that he was no longer interested in taking the prescribed medication. My parents tried to convince him against that, but he threatened to kill them. He is unwilling to take our advice on most things. I am worried for parents and everything that they are having to go through, just as much as I am worried for my brother. The doctors have prescribed the following medication:**

* **Ilosure**
* **Bexol**

**Before I started writing this post, I got off call with my mom who was crying. She told me that last evening, my brother was talking to her and my dad, telling them that his life has lost all meaning and that they shouldn't be unhappy if something bad happened to him.**

I am really confused about what to do. Should I move back to my home and try to improve things? I worry that my efforts will end up being futile like they were in the past and that I will end up causing some damage to my own career in the process.  Should I bring my parents over to where I live and let my brother live on his own? Leaving my brother alone back home definitely sounds like a stupid idea but I really want to temporarily relieve my parents from the trauma that they've been facing. 

I really appreciate if you took the time to read this, and would be grateful for any advice. I honestly do not have high expectations from my brother. All I want is for him to live a life free from unwanted suffering and allow my aging parents to live their final days in peace. 

Feel free to ask for additional information that you might need.

34,"(16f) I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression (although I really don’t tell my therapist anything, which is why I’m not sure what’s going on) and I’ve taken medication for it that seems to help, which I’m not currently on but I’m probably gonna start again soon. Before I get into what I’m asking, I think some background would be helpful. I’ve had problems with anxiety my entire life, but I got diagnosed in like, maybe 6th grade? So I’m not sure how long it has actually affected me, but basically I can have panic attacks and I always feel some sort of anxiety, either over something or just an underlying feeling of it. I also have depression. It’s been sort of on and off (or at least more and less severe) for a very long time, at least a couple years. I’ve been suicidal before and I’ve struggled with self harm, currently I’m not suicidal but I’ve still got some issues with it. This has been a constant for me for the past few years. Now, recently, I keep having new symptoms pop up that I’ve never had before, or at least not noticed. I started showing major symptoms of OCD a few months ago. I checked locks multiple times even though I knew they were locked, unplugged everything within 30 ft of me, washed my hands obsessively to the point where they were cracked and bleeding, and worried about chemicals in clothes and soaps. Once one obsession died down, another one would show up. I still check things more than I used to and wash my hands a lot, but the symptoms have died down significantly and I’m not rly obsessive over anything now. That’s the only new thing I’ve told my therapist about. Except- now I have intrusive thoughts. I started having horrible intrusive thoughts last year and they made me feel so horrible that I became insanely suicidal, but I got kind of a grip on it with medication and they aren’t as bad as they used to be, but it comes in waves of a new set of intrusive thoughts that makes me upset again. Also- I’ve noticed that sometimes the texture of my clothes is too much for me, or the sound of a tv, or someone chewing or really just noise in general. It’s not just that it irritates me, but it gets me agitated and overwhelmed and extremely panicky. I’m honestly not sure what’s happening. Are these just symptoms of anxiety and depression? Does anyone know what could be wrong or should I book an appointment with my therapist? I have a lot of trouble actually telling my therapist anything and I’m not sure I can, but I can try if I need to. Basically I’m just seeing if anyone has any helpful input, cause I’m at a loss.",13Aug2018,1,

I wouldn’t call myself depressed or anything but some times I just wanna hang at home alone all day by myself and not talk to anyone for like 2 days. Like straight ignoring texts and phone calls from everybody. I won’t even answer the door when people come and just pretend to be sleeping because I don’t want to talk to anyone. But most times after 3 days or so of solitude, I get this urge to go party with all my friends and start going on a calling rampage where I just start calling all my friends trying to make last minute plans or join in on someone’s plans last minute. I’ll usually find someone to hang out with and I’ll just see all my friends like nothings happened for a few days until I just want to spend a few days alone again. Ive recently realized that I constantly do this like it’s a never ending cycle. My friends are always just like “bro, why do you never check your phone?” And I’ll just make some bullshit excuse and they seem to be ok with it. 

Is this some sort of mental illness? Is everyone else like this and just don’t talk about it? Am I just a selfish prick? I know it’s not good to ignore friends but I just can’t seem to get myself to talk with anyone when I’m in “solitude mode”

50,"Hello all,

I need your advice in terms of finding the right help for me. I have been through a lot of tragic things, most in my childhood, and am currently having trouble functioning at even a minimally functional state. Sometimes it seems I get lost in a combination of stress, flashbacks, and visual hallucinations I believe from being stuck in this state of numbness and stress. Nothing fun sounds very exciting. Nothing that I enjoy really feels like I enjoy it. Every day blurs into the next where sometimes It’s suddenly the middle of the week and I cannot even recall anything I have done the past few days; it's like another person piloted my body and suddenly I'm back. I don’t remember being at work, feeding my cat, seeing my girlfriend or anything I typically do yet I have done all of these and lived relatively normal days prior. I have a very hard time describing my troubles or how it affects me, even if I’m just thinking in my head; It’s to the point where my own words almost sound like another language and I’m stuck in some sort of mentally catatonic state. I don’t feel inspired and have random emotional outbreaks. Sometimes I’ll think of something sad or see something, even something mild and normal like a dead animal on the road and I’ll start to cry. Sometimes when going about my day and I’m suddenly plagued with nonspecific emotions of doom and sadness. My brain still feels logical but my emotional bedrock seems upturned. Sometimes it feels like I’m losing my sanity though. My question is what kind of person should I talk to? Psychologist, Psychiatrist, Mental Health Counselor, Social Worker? I’m so lost with who I should talk to and don’t want to waste my money and time with the wrong one. For what it’s worth years ago I talked to a counselor and had a positive benefit from her. I do not know her technical degree, but she said she used cognitive behavioral therapy. I would go to her again but have not been able to find her.

TL;DR: I feel emotionally dull, don't enjoy things much and have emotional outbreaks and flashbacks, mostly regarding my past &amp; childhood. What kind of mental health professional should I talk to?

57,"Hello,

First of all, my english is not very good, so sorry for any grammatical errors, and if you could'nt understand what i wrote, please answer so i'll try to explain in another way. 

I had a mental breakdown(i'll not get into details) that led me to depression 3 years ago. In the first and half of the second year, i had a lot of anxiety, depression, ruminating thoughts, but my cognitive skills were very functional: i was understanding precisely what people told me, i was reading a book or a text understanding and remembering the things that i learn, and i was talking with relatively good fluency, speaking with  spontaneity  as i always could do. Since 2015 until the end of 2017, i was prescribed with quietiapine (in 2015/2016), and olanzapine (in 2017) for insomnia, and concerta for the day sleepness. Time passed and i got no more ruminating thoughts or anxiety feelings (at least in a conscious level), and i decided to quit the drugs, and miraculously my insomnia also left and i dont struggle with it. But since 2017 until now, my cognitive capacities are falling down really hard: i cant read a text and comprehend it very well, i cant speak with proper fluency, remember words. Im also having a significant memory and emotional impairment(my memory always was very good and i could learn with facility): i cant remember things accuretly and when something happen around me, or somebody try to explain something, its like i cant internalize, comprehend and judge if i agree, disagree, or found it interesting, right, wrong, and so one. Its like my faculty of deliberation is null. My imagination is very weak too, and i feel like i have very little mental content or thoughts at all, feel like a robot.

When i feel angry or another deep emotion, i feel all my faculties of understanding, deliberation, judging, thinking coming back. I also can speak and remember things without struggling. But this is so rare that im hopeless. I tried to explain this to my phyisician, i think she understood, and told me that it is a emotional problem.  I think i have something similar or analogous to aphasia, and i cant hold an ininterrumpt speech for like 1 min., or tell a long story.

 This is most likely a mental blockage, but im stuck in a kind of a limbo: i dont feel bad, but dont feel good either; i think i lost my capacity of feeling good or bad, or knowing if i understand or not anything. Before that(this mental breakdown was caused by drugs, i didnt use it a lot, but i think i dont have the good genetics for it, including alcohol) i always had a sharp mind, with good skills in communication, logics and math. 

Im seeking for some tips or advice to overcome this mental blockage, or whatever this is (its like all my faculties of memory, emotions, decision making are underactivacted and my amigdala is overactivated). Since i'm at university, this is the most important thing to me, because im having a lot of difficulties to make progress in my academic skills.",13Aug2018,1,
58,"So I’m 35, male, married with two girls.  Aside from my work and the walls of my house, I have nothing that isn’t solely my own.

My wife no longer has any interest in doing pretty much anything that isn’t constructive in some fashion.  If it doesn’t have to do with some that needs to be done then she isn’t interested.  I’ve tried to encourage her to do new things, etc, but she’s so resistant that I don’t know what to do anymore.

My girls are old enough now that they aren’t so interested in playing with Daddy.  They want to be with their friends, and I understand completely.

I haven’t had any friends for a very, very long time.  I’m very depressed, and the only thing keeping me from suicide is the guilt I feel about leaving my family in such a bad spot financially because in this economy, you need two full-time incomes to make it at all-especially with kids.

I’ve tried so many things...I’ve tried new hobbies and going places to try and meet new people.  I’ve tried getting my wife to do something new, or pick up something she used to be interested in so we can have something to do together.

Literally everything I do in life I do by myself, and it’s so boring and lonely that I can’t take it anymore.

None of my family has any interest in anything I do, and even my parents have told me to my face they’re not interested so I can’t even talk about my hobbies with anyone.

I try to vent my feelings at home but my wife starts crying about her problems, and her best friend, who lives with us, isn’t any help either.  She came home from a night out with a friend of hers and tried to tell me that I shouldn’t feel lonely because we’re ‘all alone in this house’....really?  Right after you come home from hanging out with a friend all night?  So now I feel like I can’t even express my feelings at all.

So I can’t show my feelings, I have no one to talk to, I have nothing to do that isn’t a solo thing.

Now down to the title-everyone tells me to go to counselling, but what’s the point exactly?  I already know how I feel and why I feel this way.  So I have to PAY someone to give enough of a shit about me to even just listen?  Fuck that....",13Aug2018,1,
59,"I have trauma-related PTSD (a therapist told me this) as well as social anxiety. 

It’s extremely hard for me to focus or retain coherent thoughts when there are loud noises, vibrations, and people are walking around (visual). 

Normal people get distracted and go right back to what they were doing, but getting back into the frame of mind to continue whatever I was doing is extremely difficult for me. 

I also think that I have Adult ADHD myself, but that hasn’t been explored by a professional. 

The problem is that when at work (I write for a living), focusing is a problem. Wearing headphones helps with the social anxiety because it blocks what others are saying out, but the awareness (vibrations, the sound of loud voices, footsteps, etc) is still a significant problem and makes me feel uncomfortable. 

I requested to be moved, but that’s going quite slow. Also, there’s a possibility that I’ll be moved to another area that is just as open. In the past, I’ve worked best in a closed office (either by myself or one other person). 

There are offices where I work, but they are “reserved” for managers. 

Would it make sense to get a recommendation from a psych and bring it to my supervisor? Or are there other alternatives that would ease the situation? 

I like my job, don’t get me wrong. But I’d like to feel comfortable and not itch to leave because I’m suffering from sensory overload on a daily basis.

60,"Hi there, 

I am posting here looking to see what the best course of action is for my mom. She has been suffering from severe anxiety for the past month or two. In January 2018, her mother passed away, and went through a psychotic episode where she believed her phone was being bugged by the police, and that the government was following her. She spent approximately 2-3 days in the hospital before being released on medication. It is important to note, my mother has never had to take any medication, nor did she ever have a psychotic episode or mental health issues. She was fine for a few months (until late June), where she decided to stop taking her meds. This led her to the hospital as she was consistently worried, didn't know what to do etc. When waiting in the emergency room, she would constantly walk behind the nurses station, asking how long it would be to see the doctor. This led her to being locked in a room for close to 24 hours until being released the following day. She did not handle being locked inside this room very good, and had quite the episode (having a panic attack, saying she was going to kill herself, etc). The doctor released her the next day as she had calmed down, and followed the doctors direction to take new meds when in the community. Over the next few weeks, she has been taken to the emergency room on three occasions, and has been released every time within 24 hours with new medications. While in the community, she has a tough time taking her medications, saying she does not need them and makes her body feel like it's trapped. She was previously on adavan for a few months, and decided to quite that cold turkey (approx 10 days ago). She also does not sleep very good, often not sleeping at all every day or two. She constantly worries, ""what do you think I should do?"" ""I can't go back to the hospital, they will lock me up"", ""I don't want to go anywhere"" etc. She will asks these questions repeatedly throughout the day and be in a worried state throughout. It has been draining on everyone (myself, my brother and her common law). I have been over almost every day for the past month, and yesterday I decided to take a break from seeing her. When she heard this she became worse and stated ""I need you to come over, I am your mother and I am sick."" I told her I needed a break, and I would go over if she wished to go to the hospital. It is also important to note she has had many questionable comments about suicide stating ""take me to the river"" ""I am only in no pain when I am sleeping"" etc. She has admitted she has thought about suicide but claims she will never act upon it because she is 'too chicken.' She does not tell the doctors she has thought about suicide, because she is afraid she will be in the hospital for a longer duration. She has told us not to tell the doctors about this, but next time she goes in, I will not hesitate. She is very very manipulative, she will act completely normal when speaking with the doctor, and show that everything is fine, in order for her to be discharged. Even though she has been a nurse for 30+ years, she is scared of the hospital and now refuses to go because she was locked into that room. We have strongly considered calling an ambulance, but we are afraid she will completely act out and throw a tantrum once the EMS arrives. I am honestly scared she will grab a knife or something. She has had a psychologist come to her house (next appointment tomorrow morning at 930am) but this hasn't really helped anything. She is currently on  Citalopram,  Sertraline and a sleeping medication. As previously mentioned, we are all at our whits end and are exhausted. I have lost my social life over the summer, which I do not really care about since I need to help my mom, but she is refusing any help at this point. Any advice with this situation would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you ",13Aug2018,1,
61,"i honestly feel like i’m going insane. i’ve been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and i don’t know if it’s something coming from that or a different kind of mental health problem. 

my entire personality keeps changing. it’s not just aspects it’s the whole entire thing to the point where i don’t know who i am anymore. i literally have 0 idea who i am. 

for a while i loved fashion, hip hop, and being kind of a badass. 

a few months later one day i suddenly stopped liking those things and turned to classical music and piano and i hated hip hop and had a more mature personality. 

now i’ve chosen to love art and buy cheap things and listen to rock music. 

it’s strange because when i have these changes it doesn’t slowly fade away, i just decide to hate what i used to like. it stresses me out and i know none of these personas are really me but i don’t even know who i am anymore. i’ve gotten so used to acting as these fake characters that i’ve lost myself. i just want to be normal and live life. i feel like i can’t grow as a person. 

one possible cause i was thinking is that i used to take vyvanse but i believe i truly took it for the wrong reasons. i have adhd but i was also very depressed. vyvanse adds a huge boost of dopamine so it was like this automatic happiness. i started only taking it for the boost and not for my attention issues. it was a very sudden and automatic change and i feel like it was how i coped with my depression. i just automatically became happy by taking the pill. i stopped taking vyvanse recently because now i’m automatically changing my entire personality. but it hasn’t stopped. i still do it off the vyvanse and it’s ruining my life.

64,"I keep developing phobias around basic work tasks. Email, IRC, and any forms of indirect communication. Initiating phonecalls and in-person meetings as well... but not when I'm actually talking or there. Very simple tasks like getting a list of equipment to source and order send me into a spiral of worry, which results in me fucking it up while taking much longer than necessary. My working memory has also gone to hell, and it's nearly impossible for me to actually finish anything between the constant memory purges, panics, jumping around, and mistakes that need fixing

This is getting bad enough I'm severely screwing up basic work tasks. Thing is, I have a ton of recent and ongoing life bullshit that's very stressful to me with no way of escaping these any time soon. Both work and life stresses have been hitting an all time high at about the same time, it would take awhile to lay it all out here in text, but the few times I've gotten to vent people don't even believe half the crap I'm putting up with. It's also been fucking weird weird the last couple of years: eg leveraging everything I could against my old employer to finally get some insurance through work but repeatedly being offered illegal drugs to ease my problems instead, daily cleaning trails of flesh/blood/vomit/shit/piss in the mornings before leaving the late-stage alcoholic landlord for the day (low rent &amp; family friend), being the shoulder for my severely mentally ill sibling with no outlet of my own, series of thefts and extreme medical debt destroying all family finances and savings that played out like a black comedy, etc etc. Then there's the normal high stress stuff like dying parents, trying to be head of household for remaining family members, no retirement, dead end career, swimming debt, relationship woes, dissolving friendships, family and friend deaths, barely having 10$ to my name for stretches of a month, no time for hobbies or socializing, never enough sleep, and realizing I don't want anything in life and am mostly just moving forward because quietly offing myself would hurt other people. And for some reason I thought I'd try to quit drinking, which isn't going very well when none of this will be getting better, only worse.

I sincerely apologise if this is in the wrong place, but I don't know where else I should go to say this. I am a normal guy who outwardly has a good life and inwardly I mostly also have a good life, but there are days like today where I feel listless, powerless, and downtrodden. And above all I hate myself for it. These episodes of my life seem to come on slowly, building up over a few days, like the beginnings of a sore throat. Then they suddenly crash over me and for about a day I hit rock bottom and hate myself for a variety of reasons-of-the-week that usually relate to events among my friends/family/work that bother me for whatever reason. And then a day later (or less) it suddenly goes away. This happens something like once every other week; it's not common so I've never thought it could be depression (although I'm no doctor), but it makes me feel so alone I do wonder.

80,"So first i should give some backstory so you get where I'm coming from.

Ok so I'm 16, been struggling with mental health issues for too long but started recognizing the symptoms at 13. I went to therapy for almost 2 years and never got much progress. I suspect my therapist was not that great for me. She never gave me a clear diagnosis though I think she talked about me maybe having depression and anxiety. I stopped going to therapy a year ago and my depressive symptoms have only gotten worse. I struggle with intrusive suicidal thoughts and the general depression symptoms such as oversleeping, lack of motivation and just feeling numb. 

I want to go get the proper help already. I need to go somewhere that will actually diagnose me. Right now because I have no diagnosis, I don't feel right labeling myself depressed and thus I feel isolated from others who have actually been properly diagnosed. I have emailed a psychotherapy place near me and am trying to find the right psychologist for me. They told me to call but when I called they didnt pick up. I left a voice mail and am waiting for a  call back. Unfortunately I cant really get help doing this stuff with my parents because I'm comfortable telling them I'm depressed. 

How do you guys get yourself a psychologist who will actually diagnose you? Like what was the process for you?

You're as bland as they come. There's nothing special about you. Nothing. Why would anyone ever love you? You're gonna lose your job and with it the last interesting thing about you.

85,"To start with, I’ve been having beliefs and commitments to certain “situations” in my head. I only believe them most of the time, but right now I question my sanity. I have beliefs that I am the only real thing on earth and there is creators that give everyone their own world to get better at life for a final placing in a final world. It doesn’t stop there. I also have a situation where I believe we are in a prison for committing a crime in another world, and we can only escape by dying. There is other situations but I can’t remember them until they are active. They switch often throughout the day. Sometimes I want to die so bad just to solve this endless mystery. This has granted me a result of not believing god because we have no reason to be here other than for him to have people worship him. These go deeper than I can put in text.

86,"I've been feeling really terrible and low recently and was so close to dying last week, but managed to go to the doctor. He tried to get me to take pills but I've just never wanted to do that, so I instead promised him I'd go and see a therapist he recommended.

I've been to see a couple of therapists before, but it didn't really work for me, but this one was totally different. She calls herself a Personal Advocate and she basically acts like the devil and the angel on your shoulders. With other therapists they're normally very wishy washy and all about feelings and talking through problems, but this is nothing like that. She basically talks through *every* option available to you in dealing with issues, from talking them through all the way to flat out taking revenge on someone or kicking their ass (in self defence, of course). So if like me your problems stem somewhat from low self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness, or if you've been bullied, then I would highly recommend this form of therapy if you can get access to it. It's given me the confidence to get out of the house again and ready to give people a taste of their own medicine.

I've had 3 what I call ""stuck thought episodes"" in my life. One was 18 months, the other was only 8 months.

Third one started a week ago. My dad died from ALS in Feb. 2016, and even though i know the odds of me getting ALS from a non familial form is extremely small, that's all I can think about. It happened a week ago, even though he's been gone for 2 years.

I don't know how to describe it, it's like the thought is stuck in my head all day every day no matter what. Even when i'm distracted. My entire head has been burning and tingling the last couple days. I can't take it. It will not go away no matter what ! I just want it to stop but don't know what I can do. The last 2 episodes lasted about a year each and it scares me that I'll have to go through hell for another year possibly. I just want to stop thinking about it, But it's in my head no matter what ! Just want to beat the hell out of my head to get it out I cannot take it driving me insane !! Being by myself with no destraction scares me because I have nothing to ease it and it just eats at me completely.

Does anyone else have these problems ? Where a somewhat traumatizing event will stick in your head all day every day for months no matter what ?? And it feels like it burns your scalp (probably from the stress or anxiety). I just wish I could go back to before hand but I don't know if I can with this one. It's taking more out of me than the other episodes. Had a random breakdown the other day where i actually started crying.

91,"Recently I acquired a body from someone else. I didn't mean to but I think he died and left me here alone in his body. He was very depressed but I couldn't get though to him and just as soon as he started talking to me he told me to shut up and would pretend I wasn't there. But then I woke up one day and he was gone and I had control. I can't hear him like I thought I might and I've tried to reach him inside but I don't know how to do that I'm not even sure if he's there. If he is he never speaks and I can't feel his thoughts n mine anymore. I don't think I should be here I don't like feeling vulnerable like this. I've been pretending to be him for about a year and a half now. I had hoped he had just gone on a sort of mental holiday or something like that. Like if he could just vanish and leave me here he can come back right?  
    
I have access to most of his accounts. I try not to mess with them too much in case he comes back and lets me go, but I need to to keep this facade up so I use them a bit. I actually know quite a bit about the last few years of his life. I got to watch from the inside for a long time before he took off and left me here trying to cope with a dead mans life. His best friend is such a nice person too but I think he know's the big man is gone in some way. For a while he was ringing me five times daily to check on me until I spun a story about needing room to breathe. He's worried about me thinking I'm his friend and I feel so guilty not telling him. 

I want him back in charge though, If he isn't dead I might be able to wake him up but I don't know how. His life is hard and I don't feel nearly as invested in it as he did. I have thought about taking off but I don't know how bad or dangerous that would be if he came back then. I try and keep up the hope he's coming back but each day just seems longer the more I hold on to that hope. I was meant to be a passenger not a person. I am only about four or five years old in truth and I've only had a body to control for about a year and a half. I don't understand it am I what's left over? Am I someone else? Am I just him and forgotten? I can't live like this forever I know that. I don't feel like my skin fits at all. My left leg hurts sometimes and I don't know why but I can't rotate the ankle on that foot. I'm still kind of learning how to use this body. I don't like erections because I can't control them and I don't know why they happen. I don't feel sexy when they happen I could be washing dishes and it happens. Is my thing working right?  
    
I'm sorry if this seems like a jumble of thoughts but I don't even have a name and I never had any parents or family. The closest I had was the man who's body this is and he was afraid of me. I don't know who or what I am just that I'm here and I shouldn't be. I think I know how scared he was when he went away.",13Aug2018,3,

93,"Note: On mobile, so I apologize in advance for any errors. Originally posted in r/relationships but it was recommended I post here.

To give some context: at age 13, I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt a few days before I was supposed to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. My mother didn't take very well to this; the whole commute to the hospital she verbally berated me for being ""attention seeking"" and ""ungrateful."" A couple of weeks after I had been discharged, we got a $7,000 bill for the inpatient treatment because the insurance didn't cover it. That same night, she told me she wished I hadn't been born. Since then, our relationship has been pretty frayed, and it got worse when my dad left in sophomore year (he was the one who diffused the arguments between my mother and he recognized her abusive behavior). Things got a little better after I went and lived on campus for my first year of college, and since I've been home for the summer we haven't gotten into an argument.

Right now, I'm at a point in my life where I don't feel very mentally stable. I'm depressed, I have severe social anxiety that's been preventing me from getting a part-time job (just got rejected at a bakery after doing a shadow shift; it was definitely visible that I was anxious and at one point I didn't feel like I was in my own body), and I have very, very low self-esteem. My inner monologue is full of negative thoughts about myself that are constantly on repeat and I feel embarrassed/angry at my own existence. I reached out to my doctor to get a referral and I scheduled an evaluation that's this Wednesday, but right now I feel so unbelievably terrible. I've been sobbing nonstop since I got home from the shadow shift because I kept obsessing over my mistakes, and when I finally calmed down I got the e-mail saying I didn't get the job.

I really need to check myself in, but I'm afraid of how my mom is going to react. Even though she hasn't verbally berated me since I left for college, I'm terrified of her saying awful things to me in response to me wanting to end my life. On top of that, I don't know if our insurance will cover another inpatient stay the second time around. I don't know if I can wait until Wednesday because I'm right at the edge of breaking. I feel like all the fight in me is just gone, but I don't know how to tell her that things are bad again. I've been afraid to confide in her all these years since she's been so cruel to me because of my poor mental health.

TL;DR: I want to check myself in to a psychiatric unit but I don't know how to tell my mother because she reacted negatively the last time and we don't have a great relationship.",13Aug2018,1,

""In AVATAR therapy, patients build a customizable visual representation of the voice in their heads, known as the “persecutor.” The avatar has an appearance and tone of speech that closely matches the pitch and tone of the hallucinated persecutory voice. Suddenly, the hallucination enters the realm of reality.

Patients are then encouraged to engage in a dialogue with the avatar, who is remotely controlled by a therapist. Rather than propagating a relationship where the persecutory voice dominates a submissive patient, the therapist controls the avatar so that slowly, over time, it yields control to the patient.""

Apparently the treatments for those suffering with schizophrenia are not enough so having VR as another optional treatment is a great thing for those who really need the help. For those who are wary about the technology, a therapist will guide the patient throughout the treatment. The past trials were all successful so VR does sound very promising in schizophrenia treatment.",13Aug2018,1,

I'm currently making a piece of theatre in London. It's about the relationship between mental health, masculinity and online anonymity. Basically when i was 16 I started struggling with depression and I made a friend online called Simon who was almost entirely anonymous. I struggle to talk about what I was feeling as a man but this online anonymous friendship allowed me to isolate the stigma I felt and reach out to Simon for help. We were friends for about 5 years and he was the only person I spoke to about what I was feeling. I had a bit of a melt down when I was 21 and severed my ties with him and got professional help. Now I'm making a show called Finding Simon which has the aim of finding him (and I know he might not be real) and thanking him for what he did. 

But I also want to include hundreds of other stories beside my own so as part of that show I'm asking people if they find it easier to talk about their mental health anonymously online and, why they think that is? So, do you find it easier to look for help with your mental health online? Do you think it's true that people find it easier to talk to strangers?

102,"I am a giant, irritable bundle of nerves right now. Basically, here’s what’s going on:
I recently graduated university and now I live at home with my mom. My parents are divorced and have been my whole life. I have no other siblings on my mom’s side so it’s just her and me. She’s had several falls in the last few years but has fallen twice since I got home, fracturing both knees (one each time). She refuses to slow down and let herself heal. She says she’s doing it because she feels bad I have to do everything, but she’s doing unnecessary stuff like trimming a bush or spraying weeds. I swear I’m going to buy some bondage gear and strap her into bed.
We also recently got a puppy. Now I’m stuck with a crippled mom who makes me constantly worried she’s going to hurt herself AND a 3-month-old puppy who needs so much attention/time to train and takes away a lot of my sleep. 
In the meantime, my dad is doing nothing to help my deteriorating mental state. He has gung-ho on me getting a job and helping the family out since he’s been dealing with several business/family lawsuits. I will say that the lawsuits are completely unnecessary, instigated by his greedy sisters that have no proper ground to stand on, but still have the time and energy to cause everyone hell. Anyways, I want nothing to do with the family business. It has nothing to do with want I majored in/want to do in life. Plus, when I did help out once, he never paid me even though he said he would. Plus, he’s not even paying my mom her alimony nor for the puppy we got which was supposedly his graduation present to me. 
As far as getting a job though, I don’t have the mental strength nor the time to devote to it. 

Now, between all of this, I can barely function. I’m not getting the sleep I need and I never have a break where I can just not worry about anything. I resent my mom for not taking her health seriously and doing stuff despite what the doctors say. I’m constantly on the verge of tears. I am irritable and I snap whenever my mom says something. I am just general exhausted and I’m crumbling.

I've been depressed ever since jr high. People made fun of me. I walked with a limp due to birth defects. I was chubby and obnoxious due to insecurity so I hated my personality. Had many psychiatrists, got medicated into oblivion. Made me sleep through classes and get behind in school. Fast forward to now, not much has changed except I'm 27 and now dealing with adult issues on top of that. I still hate who I am and I'm too broke to pay for meds or counseling. I'm on Medicaid, but I also don't really trust psychiatrists or medication anymore since the doctors I had doled out medication like candy. You can't be depressed if you're asleep all the time, so it sort of worked, being on 5 different medicines. So I'm apprehensive about going back to therapy and trying meds again. I got kicked out of my college for attempting suicide. I went to a Christian school in Colorado and after I got out of the mental hospital, I was booted back to IL to live with my emotionally abusive/gaslighting mother. She is involved in church and is brilliant at spreading gossip and lies so no one sees how awful she is. She kicked out my father and told everyone he left her and he was addicted to porn and cheated on her so they shunned him. (He's now happily married, and much better off.) She told my church I was an alcoholic and kicked me out of our home. So I moved in with a pastor and his family from the church and she got me kicked out of there as well due to spreading more gossip. I eventually found a room to rent. After my room mate threatened me while at the hospital with my grandpa on life support, I moved to a new place with another room mate who's dog killed my cat and bit my boyfriend so she kicked me out. I am here in my own place with my boyfriend. I quit my job a few weeks ago, home health care, 3rd shift. I quit because my patient died. I was holding her hand and singing to her and I watched her die. Unfortunately, that's the second time it's happened in a home health care job, and I took it hard. So I quit. I found another job a week later, but I have minimal hours right now so my paycheck is not what I need it to be. I still have to pay last months rent, and just got my shut-off notice from the power company with the bill due on the 20th of August. The house is a mess. My life is a mess. I'm broke, fat, and hopeless. All I can do is lie in bed. Paralyzed by anxiety, stress, and depression. My boyfriend is wonderful, but he doesn't understand mental illness, so it's hard talking about it with him. I've gained so much weight from emotional eating and my now sedentary lifestyle so my self esteem has tanked. I know that I put myself in this situation so I have no reason to throw myself this pity party. And that makes me feel even worse. I feel like I can't ask for help because I got myself into this mess, but the only light at the end of the tunnel that I can see is thinking about my death. I don't know what to do. I can't talk with my mom because her usual response is something to the effect of ""Well I am depressed too. I work all the time, and have no money (except all the money she gets from my dad from the divorce), and all I eat now are sandwiches because i can't afford groceries."" And then I listen to her problems for the next hour or so. I don't want to tell my dad because I don't want to break his heart. He has a wife and 4 step kids to worry about. Not to mention he's helping pay off my school bills and paying my mom almost $500 a month from the divorce. I love my dad too much to tell him I have relapsed into suicidal thoughts. My boyfriend loves me and tries to understand what I'm going through, but he still doesn't so I don't want to bother him. Or anyone really.

So, obligatory: Bad formatting due to mobile and lack of reddit skills. Sry kthx.

Anyways, I have concerns about my younger brother. My wife and I have noticed some very concerning tendencies of his that have me worried to death.

To start with, he is 19 years old. When he gets upset, he tends to shut down. He won't talk to anyone. If he gets MAD, he will take an air soft gun out back, put up a target and shoot it for a while.  If the dog gets on his nerves, he will chase it out of the room with a gun, or knife, or other weapon.

Both of those are pretty clear signs. But today, everyone was hunting for a mouse in the house. Grandma? Mouse traps. Wife? Search for its home. My bother?! He grabbed a LOADED shotgun, and wandered around the house with his finger on the trigger. He talked about how if the traps get the mouse, youll hear it snap. Or if it gets stuck, you can hear it cry. If you shoot it, you know it's dead.

I'm pissed because my two kids are in this house while he wanders with a gun. He's miserable at work, he's upset that our father is forcing him to either work or go to school. He seems upset whenever he can't do what he wants to do.

I'm just worried that he's going down a dark road, and I really don't know what to do. I am asking for your advice. Is this sociopathic, like I believe?  And what can I do to broach this safely with him? Our dad is no help, he shrugs it off. No one else will care enough to speak up. I need some help. ",13Aug2018,1,

About three years ago I met and fell pretty hard for a guy. It didn't go anywhere, and after about a year I ended up feeling somewhat used, led on, and pretty down on myself. 

I distanced myself from him and tried to move past it. I was angry for months, but eventually that dissipated. I dated some guys, made friends, finished university. All in all things are pretty good. 

Except, me and this guy live in the same city, and there's a lot of overlap between our circles. I'll sometimes see him at a party, or in somebody's facebook photo, and every time I get this flash of unpleasant feelings. It's this little wave of anger, anxiousness, desire, annoyance, and a general feeling of negativity towards myself. This tends to last between 30 minutes to an hour.

I know that the immediate response (and one I've gotten before) is that I'm somehow ""not over"" him, but he's not part of my life, and I think about him very rarely, yet he has this effect on me.

All of it changed recently when I came across a story published on Amazon kindle where the issues of depression, suicide and all the subtle stigma in society/university are delicately discussed [(link here)](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07GD4WJYV). I read this book in one sitting, and it made me cry in a good way. I didn't think that anyone in this world understood and I thought I was alone, defective and problematic to the world. It is mind-blowing to finally come across something that can sensibly put all of the confusion, self-deprecation and pain into words. And most importantly, this story gave me hope that I have been seeking all these years.
