0,"I've been thinking about enrolling in a therapy session (either in person or virtually i.e. Teladoc) however I'm a little concerned about the efficacy of it. 

I've been facing a lot of self-esteem (dealing with ugliness) and social anxiety (talking to girls, meeting new people issues and I need someone to talk to about these problems. Friends have been really reluctant to talk about my feelings and situations. 

From those who've had therapy sessions, did you find them more or less helpful than talking with a friend or did you find it to be a waste of time and money? Is there something a therapist/psychiatrist can do better than say some critical (albeit constructive) people in your life or perhaps on reddit?

2,"I am most likely being admitted back to an eating disorder unit late this week. My passion in life is art, I do art most of the day. The problem is, on the unit, we cannot have anything with metal, pencils, or pens. What kind of art supplies should I use for sketching? Most of my supplies are banned. I do however have a favorite set of highlighters/markers, but they have a plastic clip on one side of the caps. Do you guys think they would allow the markers with plastic clips ? Thank you for reading and please respond, art is everything to me and I don’t know how I will cope without it. ((or atleast my fav supplies, I should say))",28Feb2018,1
3,"Hey there. Thanks for checking this out. Today my doctor told me that I’ll be starting a new medicine called Lexapro. I’m already on Burpirone ( 5mg in the morning, 10mg at night). I’m not sure the dosage of Lexapro that I’ll be getting, but I’m a little nervous I’ll become dependent on this medicine. I’m sure it’s not a major medication, but my nerves are still there. I’m being put on it because recently I came to the conclusion that I’m depressed. Hopefully this will change that. Has anyone out there on or have been on Buspirone and Lexapro at the same time? If so, what were your experiences like? Did it seem to make you less depressed or happier over time?",28Feb2018,1

8,"Hello all. I have PTSD and major depression, and have had it for a while. Recently I had a major breakdown (mostly because of physical health issues) and ended up going to the hospital. I was going to be inpatient, but my PTSD is hospital related so it was decided i would be better not staying full time at a hospital. I start a partial hospitalization program tomorrow. I know it involves group therapy as well as individual sessions, but not a lot more than that. Anyone ever been to one? What’s it like? Did it help?

Every time i get into my friend’s car I flick the air vent on his car, which causes him to look at me like “how about you don’t”. You probably look at your phone and say that every time I over think or over react to the most minuscule thing.

Every time i get into my friends car i see the scratches my backpack has left of his dashboard and i just think of how i ruin everything nice that people do for me. Like the scars  i have left on you.

I have only gotten into my friends car a handful of times but i cherish those as they have been of true friends as I cherish your words as the were said with true love.

I have never gotten in my friends car, as the distance is great and crossing an ocean is as hard as it must have been waiting that summer that i never arrived.

When i ride my own car, I drive it recklessly but am afraid of damaging it, since its my Moms, and she worked hard so she could have it, but I knowing that still sabotage myself. I sometimes act like a child, a pussy.

11,"Crossposted because I think I might need as much advise as I can get 

&gt;I am 17 and I have what I would call an intermediate experiance with alchohol and have only been drunk I would say more than 4. but less than 15 times and have only been drinking for about 2 months.


 &gt;  I know its kinda the purpose of alcohol but it seems like only when im ""under the influence"" do I not have any of the seemingly constant worries I have. ""Everyone's having more fun than you, you cannot talk to girls, you are going to waste your teenage years, you will be forgotten like billions of other ceased consciousnesses"" etc.  Is this normal? Like I have anxiety but am afraid to tell my parents because I feel like they will see it as another reason to fight. I have already been diagnosed with ADHD and OCD, and my mom has those and anxiety, and my dads a high functioning alcoholic just like his mother,(he's the one who taught me that tequila doesn't leave a smell on your breath haha) so i don't know where I fit in on this. Like Monday was the first day I actually craved alcohol, it was all I could think about last block (period) that day. But for some reason when I got home, as soon as i saw my cat it went away.

&gt;I have on and off depression that is sparked by events like anxiety and my dad yelling at me. And I think I might have been moderatly depressed since elementary school. I often feel like emotionally monitone.

&gt;Is this a bad sign? The main reason im worried is mainly because I don't have a lot of money right now, and I don't want to waste it all. And my mom has been secretly ""about to divorce"" my dad as far as i can remember, I dont wanna be the straw that breaks the camels back.

13,"My post was removed from /r/relationships because they said it's more suited for this sub. Bf is 24, i am 29, relationship is roughly 8 months.

Hi guys. This sucks. I broke up with him last September due to a jealousy issue and he had a depressive meltdown. I urged him to seek help as he deserved to feel good. I made sure he wasn't going to hurt himself and I left. Later he had enrolled for health insurance and was taking steps to gettng help. Stupidly i went back with him. I asked him three weeks ago if he had found a doctor and he waffled which ended with ""well i have health insurance if something does happen.""

So basically he's going to wait until he attempts suicide to seek help.

His sister attempted on the 6th of February. Im scared for him.

He went into a depressive spiral where i sort of talked him down.

I can't do this though. Im not trained and even if i was im not objective. I could do some real damage by saying the wrong thing, and it would destroy me if i made the wrong call (is he ok or not, should i call a suicide hotline) and something happened to him. Not to mention i cannot tolerate his approach to mental health. I deal with my bipolar 1, and id never expect him to stick around with me untreated. Id never consciously do that to anyone.

There is some other stuff going on but this is the big one. Im scared to break up with him. I know what i want to say and i realize i am not responsible for his mental health, but im scared shitless that he will hurt himself.

Also his birthday is tomorrow. Fuck.

Does anyone have advice or reassurance for me in this situation? Im going to do it saturday because he has his closest friend over sunday.

15,"I just feel insane lately. I'm 23/m (United States, Minnesota) and whatever is happening to me is getting way worse and more frequent. I get insane euphoria and this ball in my chest and get uncontrollable surges of energy and make all these plans and my mind is running at 3,000 mph and then BAM something happens and i just spiral all the way down. Wanting to die, hoping I crash when driving, I hate everything about me, and just feel nothing. Lock myself in my room and avoid my roomates, not play Bass or Drums (which i know I LOVE) and has been a considerable part of my life, music IS my passion.

17,"It’s coming up on a year since my friend got shot and it’s really bothering me. She is still alive and i’m so thankful about that. I feel like it’s partly my fault and i struggle forgiving myself. It was a normal Thursday at school and i was talking to this girl and i have liked her for a few weeks and planned on telling her that day. Well the bell rang and as we were walking through the halls to leave she was walking out the back door and walk to the front of the school outside and i normally walk through the inside to get to the front. I wanted to ask her to walk with me so i could talk to her longer and whatnot. I got scared and couldn’t bring myself to ask her to come with me. So i told her good bye and went our separate ways. I got outside and heard several gunshots. I quickly found out it was her. I don’t know why i didn’t walk with her maybe it would have been me. Of course i didn’t know it was going to happen but it may not have been her if i just asked her. I think about this every single day and still can’t get over myself. I could have prevented her losing the ability to walk or even brush her hair. She’s gotten so much better and i’m so happy for her. I definitely don’t want to seem selfish but it doesn’t just affect one person.  If you actually read all of this, thank you.  I just needed to vent. ",28Feb2018,1
18,"I would say that it is safe for me to say I have social anxiety. I hate social situations, talking, and interacting with others. Honestly I have so much more fun while I am alone than with others. Even with my friends of 12 years, particularly with them actually. Recently I have begun to despise them. Everyone is always watching me and seeing what I will do. My 'close' friends will say stuff or do stuff to me to try and get a rise out of me for their amusement, and they are always upset with me when I push back or shout at them for this. The major issue is that I can't just stop hanging out them, for, as I am sure many of you will know, there is such a social stigma when you prefer to be alone than with others.

I do hate to sit here and just complain to you, but I need to get it out. I do think I may be autistic or have Asperger, or something. I keep on hearing me tell myself say things like, ""you're so fucking retarded"", ""why the hell would you do that, they'll just keep looking at you like that"", you're the one who is at fault"", and ""only some who is retarded would think that"" and many others. But other times it's reassuring and supportive giving me company when I need it. It tells me to fight back, ""don't let yourself be pushed around like that"", ""if you don't break his nose he won't stop"", ""I only want what is best"". Or just relentless harassment from many voices, and on rare occasions, if things are particularly bad, pushing suicide. I cant tell if i am making them up or not.  I isolate myself from others in short. Find solace in listening to music and art.

I have a vacation coming up where I will be spending a week with a couple friends i have had since 1st grade and I am terrified of this. I have already written out my prediction of what will happen and the point of this vacation. In short they will just be assholes to me while constantly asking me why I don't have a girlfriend.

Needless to say I get very anxious in any social situation and prefer to alone. I have no idea if I am autistic or what. I mean in grade school had many friends and was just like all the other kids which leads me to believe otherwise, and it was only this pass four years in high school that I have noticed I am certainly different from most people my age.

19,"I'm in a prison! 

I want so badly to just succinctly and clearly state ""the problem"" I'm having when I come to forums like this to vent. But my thinking is so hopelessly confused and blunted. I question and criticize every thought before it can grow, and my brain just seems cognitively limited in it's ability to hold cohesive, meaningful thoughts in my conscious mind so I can explore them and expand on them.

There are so many things that hurt, I never know where to begin.
I should be better than this by now. I should be happier, more confident.
Sometimes I think I've made some progress, but I'm just gutting it out day after day, on the verge of imploding or exploding. I'm rageful, sad, suicidal, raw, and tired, among other things.

The simplest things set me off.
I'm constantly triggered in to brutal runaway episodes of intense resentment, self loathing, fear, and obsessive ruminations of the countless times that other people have hurt me, and of all the ways in which I invite the abuse through my overly agreeable, fickle nature.

I've know I'm too agreeable, too self effacing, too fragile, too self absorbed for years, and yet I still find myself behaving in those ways most of the time.

That feeling of impotence is the worst part. I feel hurt by other people, but that wouldn't be so bad if I actually felt like I had the power to change, but on a deep level I feel that I don't because I've given my power away so consistently despite knowing how pissed off and sad it makes me when it happens.

Any attempts to be more assertive, more confident, usually leave me so deflated and I eventually relent and revert back to the old submissive behavior and the ""natural"" order is restored.
I really do try to be even tempered, mindful, and to make wise decisions, but it's so hard because my impulse is just to revert back to a mindless way of living and thinking because carrying the weight of mindful thought and action seems to much. But being mindless means I get pushed around constantly. I don't want to be pushed around but I'm terrified of invoking the ire of someone more powerful than me in some way and being harmed even worse than if I just make a pathetic show of being submissive before any conflict can arise.

GAH!!!! 

I go over and over this stuff in my head and it tortures me. Keeps me awake at night. The sense of powerlessness, of self loathing, of all the complicated stories I tell myself based on the years and years of painful experience.

Even my friends and family don't respect me.

I've been fighting like hell for self respect so I can retrain my subconscious mind and finally gain the respect of other people, but it's exhausting!

It means physically working very hard because I have to get my financial house in order, which means working hard at fighting through the hell of low self esteem and social anxiety with a healthy dose of paranoia. It means constantly forcing my mind to be ...mindful, instead of just letting it lazily go off track where I end up having a harder time anyway.

I want to have self respect but my mind won't even let me really feel that way for more than a second because it always brings up all of the memories of past failures, of current failed or awkward relationships. It constantly reminds me of how weird I am and how most people think I'm a joke. I can't let myself feel good because I'm so bumbling, nervous, and absent minded. How the hell can I get respect if I can't be a functioning member of any social group?

I feel stunted by my mind and my past, forever limited and stuck in self loathing, and worst of all, I feel like i deserve it. I feel like I deserve it because of the absent minded/stupid stuff I do consistently, like I deserve it because of how weird and socially awkward and weirdly agreeable I am.

25,"Hello ! I'm an engineering student, and I have my finals in a couple of days. I study out of state in a small town, so my family are hundreds of kilometers away from me.

Here's the problem. I haven't been able to concentrate on studying for the past few days, and I don't know why. I don't feel motivated to study. I either get distracted really easily, or I zone out while I'm studying. I've been procrastinating wayyyyy too much, and only be able to sleep at 5a.m. I assume it's some kind of escape mechanism that my brain does.

The thing is, it's the first time I'm feeling like this, and I can't point out what's making me feel this way. I do want to do well for my finals, but I can't seem to hold my concentration for more than 15 minutes. I haven't felt this demotivated to study before. My friends were talking about having a group study, but I kinda feel like I'm better off at my own pace..

About an hour ago my mom texted me asking how I was doing. I did told her that I was feeling lazy, and that I've been sleeping a lot. A few minutes later she texted me ""Are you okay ? You haven't texted in awhile"" and I just teared up and broke down. I haven't cried like that in a long time and what was going through my head were things that doubts myself. I began questioning if my brain is avoiding concentrating on studying because I suck at it and I don't cut it to be an engineer. Was I having a breakdown ?

To be honest, I'm happy with my grades. I'm nowhere near bad, but nowhere near excellent. It's good and I really want to push it up, but this attitude of mine: being lazy is really making me worried about myself.

I also had a break up about half a year ago, but I don't think that was what caused it.. I'm the kind who is often aware of my thoughts, and often tries to recognize what I'm feeling, or what I'm going through. I do know that I feel lonely (emotionally).

36,"Some days you might feel unaccomplished, unattractive, behind on your goals, unmotivated and unenthusiastic. First of all, this is completely ok. Life would be boring if everything always went to plan. The irony is we need these bad days in order to know what the good ones are, forgive yourself.
Here are 3 easy ways to start loving yourself more right now.

1. Reflect on your greatest memories and accomplishments

Set a timer for 10 minutes and list everything that ever made you feel alive throughout your entire life. Think about your oldest memories as a child, a teenager, a young adult and recent months. Think about places you’ve been, people you’ve met, challenges you conquered, the things you’ve learnt, things that have made you laugh until your stomach ached. Indulge in this practice and feel how it felt to have those experiences. Smile and give sincere thanks. That brings me to the next point.

2. Make gratitude a daily ritual

Gratitude has been scientifically proven to improve your emotional, physical and spiritual well being. This little beauty brings greater levels of optimism and heightened energy levels. It is even known to decrease stress, anxiety, depression and headaches. The list of scientific benefits go on and on, gratitude is just one superpower at our disposal that we have infinite amounts of.

We can be more grateful day to day and in any given moment at any given time. Brushing your teeth? Challenge yourself to mentally list everything you can possibly think of to be grateful for. At work? Speak up about every little thing you notice to be positive. At home? Find new compliments to show you adore your loved ones each day.

Make it your daily duty to notice the blessings around you each day and to speak of them proudly out loud. When done consistently you will notice people around you become more grateful for you too and you powerfully attract even more things to be grateful for into your life.

3. Update your story

No. I’m not talking about your Instagram or SnapChat story. I’m talking about the one you tell yourself about yourself every day whether you realise you’re doing it or not. We create our lives with the stories we tell ourselves. The negative self-talk that you can’t do this, or have that or go there needs to be replaced with a new story.

Take out a pen and paper and re-write your story. You can list things, draw or write in paragraphs, theres no right or wrong. Include the greatest qualities you want to have, be specific about accomplishments you want to achieve, what you want to be known for, who you want to serve and how you’ll give back. Consider all areas of your life, family, career, health and personal. This is who you are, this is your identity.

You can program your mind so this becomes your new story that you identify with not just consciously but subconsciously too. How? According to Napoleon Hill and Dr Steve Peters, there is power in repetition and we can program our brains for almost anything by repeating it 12 times daily. Make a commitment to yourself right now, commit to recharging your mind as often as you do your mobile. How? Affirm your new identity to yourself X12 per day until it over rides your old identity.

38,"I haven't felt positive emotions to anyone for a loooong time(or felt too little, I do not know). By positive emotions I mean love and attachment(like missing someone) I have always wanted to have these emotions after I read a book or watched a film or saw some couple holding hands hugging etc.

My possible ""love"" interactions had only been with my family and relatives of the family. I would run away from people who are trying to kiss me (I would even run away from my mother; I do not remember her doing anything bad to me, not even a slap)

Apart from that I have always wanted to have a girlfriend but never had any because I just did not go talk to a girl I found attractive, I was just a coward.

What comes to my mind to link this is probably my sensitivity, in my childhood where we live other boys would take my football ball and play with it themselves while excluding me from them, when I would try to leave they would destroy my ball or kick it so far that I can not reach(I live in a place called ""site"" where it is surrounded by walls and consists of apartments: like a community). They would also try to make me cry by saying mean things and excluding etc., I would cry in bursts violently. Then when I hit the adolescence age I discovered video-games, I would not leave home after that. I would just play for hours : 6-10 hours a day. Then as my ""masculine"" urges started to appear, I discovered porn : I fapped and fapped whatever. Also being in home and my father being a sugar addict also made me an obese over the years. I never got bad grades in my life tho, with a little effort I would easily pass my exams. I had friends in school but not where I lived. Also after I hit adolescence I had become the most girl-phobic(timid/shy) person I've known. That also made me close up the walls with the outside world, I played more and more video-games endlessly numbing all my thoughts and emotions.

I recently quit video-games, porn and unhealthy eating habits but an endless stream of negative thoughts I just ... I can't take it
I have been numbing my mind with video-games for the last 9-10 years now I don't know what to do in life.

I do not believe that I will ever be happy because I don't feel any sort of positive emotions. For example, I live with my parents I hadn't seen my mother for months(there is no family issues), when she saw me entering through the door, she just ran to me and tried to hug me while I felt nothing and kept my distance and then she asked ""do you feel nothing at all"", I shook my head. The only emotions I have been able to feel my entire life was Fear, sadness, anger, shame/shyness, hopelessness and such.

What do you think might be the case with me ? Withdrawal effects of my bad addictions ? Or years of hardcore/compulsive gaming destroyed my brain ? Or daily PMO ?

I can not afford to go to a psychiatrist or therapist, because I don't have money and going to college while living with my parents, also my father had been retired for the last 16 years, he won't spend any dime on these sort of things.",28Feb2018,4
39,"Hi, I am a 21 year old Man from Australia, I am currently seeing a psychologist for my anxiety and depression problems, But recently I asked my Psychologist, when I try to imagine a situation like, I played soccer (and was pretty good at it hue hue) I would imagine a situation where i'm in front of an open goal and I would kick a ball towards the goal and it would never go in, Like no matter how close i got to the goal even if I was up to the line on the goal, when I kicked the ball, it literally wouldn't go in, like there was a force field in front of it.

But when I said something like ""if this ball goes in i'm a piece of shit"", and it would go in. I know it sounds weird, it sounds like a small problem, but I never got why my mind did that, I also have problems focusing. could there be an underlying psychological problem, or add/adhd? I asked my psychologist about it, he said he wasn't sure, and sort of moved on, I find this tends to be a problem in my life. does anyone have any advice? Thanks :) ",28Feb2018,8
40,"I have never felt so lonely in my life. Yet, I’m completely surrounded by people I know and care about. 

To make a long story short, I feel like everyone that is important in my life, that I spend my days with, either already does or will soon no longer have the same impact or effect.

It started when I dropped out of school. I lost touch with many of my friends from school, and of the three that I kept in touch with, one lives 2 hours away, one lives 5 hours away, and the other is too busy to actually spend any time with. This was last spring.

In October of 2017, my parents announced they’re separating after 25 years together. They haven’t gone through with filing for a divorce yet, but they’ve been living separately since then. The holidays were depressing.

I’m the middle of three boys, always been close to my brothers. But my older brother, who still lives in town with my mother, works 3rd shift so I never see him. My younger brother lives an hour away and is in his senior year of an extremely difficult major, so I hardly get to see him.

I was very close with my aunt, my moms sister. But she’s recently gotten engaged and has her finance’s son, daughter in law, and their two children living with her. So I don’t get to see or talk to her much anymore. So it’s like my family isn’t the same and isn’t in my life like they were.

My relationship sucks, my boyfriend and I fight and bicker constantly and there’s so much distance there, but he used to work with me until he resigned. So I lost that time with him. He’s starting a new job soon, working a different shift, so we won’t have the same time at home.

We currently live with my best friend, I’ve known her literally my entire life. We’ve always worked or went to school together, and we’ve lived together for the past year. She worked with me up until she quit yesterday, and in April, she’s moving into a new apartment as am I. So I won’t have her like I do now.

Over the past year and a half, I’ve been developing a friendship with a guy I work with. About two weeks ago he told me that he and his boyfriend are moving to a new town, 45 minutes farther than my hour-long commute to work. Then he was fired on Monday. So I’m not going to have him in my life in the same way. 

I just feel so lonely. I have never felt so lonely yet still so surrounded by people I know and love. It’s honestly one of the most depressing things I’ve ever experienced. ",28Feb2018,1

I’m a 20 year old in my junior year of college working in the it department. I’ve noticed for a few years that feel as though I’m lacking drive in my life. 

This lack of drive or case of fatigue is making it hard to do things that are fun, carry out social interactions, and grind out my homework with my full attention.


Things to note:

I get plenty of sleep(8 hours)
I eat plenty of food
I keep busy, and don’t let myself sit around a bunch

Before I got a job and started taking my school seriously, I felt depressed, but I feel like that was just a symptom of the fatigue. Now that I’m so busy I don’t have time to think about being depressed, but the lack of energy still lingers.

I feel like this lack of energy is making life much more of a chore than it should be, and I would like to know if anyone has any scientific and medical advice that I could implement to cure or fix this.

TLDR; 18f sister gets a new serious diagnosis every week, and completely adopts the traits and symptoms of that mental illness after never having displayed them before. 


My (22) sister (18) was always the “perfect” child and I was always the problem child. About a year ago, she was off at her first and only year of boarding school as a senior, and everything changed. She started needing to fly home on the weekends because she was feeling depressed and suicidal. She kept kind of playing this role of being super depressed, but at the time we were all thinking, okay she’s 17, about to graduate high school, she’s just going through a hard time.

We got her home after graduation, started her in therapy, and everything basically went to shit. The very first time she went to this therapist, she walked out and told us she has “severe depression, anxiety disorder, and PTSD”. She comes out and tells us she was molested as a child.............. I’m never ever one to doubt someone’s claim of sexual assault, but we grew up together. My mom, dad and I have wracked our brains for the last 8 months and everyone is about 95% sure that never happened. She never displayed any signs of abuse growing up, she was completely healthy, normal development, no issues whatsoever. The way she describes this event, the person and the circumstance, just simply never existed or happened. I’m not discounting it 100% but........ we’re almost positive it’s a false memory.

Every week she goes to this therapist and comes home with a new diagnosis, and she is so into it. She tells all of her friends and all of Twitter how mentally ill she is, just really playing into the role. Every time she gets a new diagnosis, she looks it up on webmd and just completely adopts those new traits. She NEVER displayed those symptoms until she became diagnosed with them.

She clearly is thriving off of the attention her mental illness is giving her, tweeting about it and texting her friends about it every day, so we as a family kind of decide to stop babying her about it. Of course we’re still loving and supportive but we’re not catering to her every whim to accommodate her being “too ill” to do anything. Then, allegedly, she starts hearing voices. She starts hallucinating. Literally two days after her first “hallucination”, she sees her therapist and comes home diagnosed with schizophrenia.

This is just absolutely insane at this point. We pull her from that therapist and she starts seeing my psychiatrist, who is very level headed and I trust completely. He says something to her about her mood swings running in the family, and that these  “bipolar tendencies” are genetic. (I’m not sure on the wording here, I wasn’t at the meeting but my mom was very clear that he didn’t say that we were bipolar, just that we have bipolar type mood swings.) Again, she takes the diagnosis and runs with it. He also tells her that all of her other diagnosis’s were basically trash and that they had to start over with diagnosing. I don’t think she heard that part.

At this point, she believes she has severe depression, anxiety disorder, PTSD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. This all happened in just a few months, and we NEVER saw this in her before. 

She’s waaaayy too ill to do homework, go to school or look for a job, and how dare we even ask her to do those things when we know how sick she is. Of course, spending hours every day with her friends, going to the movies or the mall, hanging out doing whatever they want, is essential for her because if she can’t see her friends then she’ll kill herself. I recently tried to move my bedroom into the basement, and she freaked out because SHE wanted the basement, and said if she can’t have the basement she’ll kill herself. If she can’t take the car out at 1 AM, she’ll kill herself. If they turn off the WiFi at night, she’ll kill herself. If they don’t give her an allowance (why??????), she’ll kill herself. If she has to get a job, she’ll probably end up killing herself. 

She tells our psychiatrist that she’s suicidal, they send her to an inpatient facility for 10 days, we go to see her every day, yesterday she tells us that she also has borderline personality disorder. So that’s where we’re at now.

My mom and I are absolutely at our wits end. We just can’t believe that these medical professionals would diagnose her with these serious mental illnesses after speaking to her for half an hour. We also are sure that she’s not being truthful with them, and that she’s claiming or acting different at these appointments than she does at home, because if they knew her in her day to day life they would never say she has all these illnesses.

They’re keeping her inpatient now for at least another week. She’s convinced she has depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and BPD.  (The PTSD is gone at this point, she doesn’t even tell new doctors about the assault anymore, I think she favors hearing voices.) 

WHAT do we do? Seriously, what the hell is going on?

47,"I'm 25(f) years old and I live in america, for context. I'm a new mom of a wonderful 8 month old daughter, and I have the most amazing step daughters (9 &amp; 12 years), so I've been determined to recover by any means necessary so I can be the mom that I never had. 
My whole life, I've been in denial of the abuse I went through as a kid. My mentality was that I made it out alive, and there are plenty of people that have it worse. And why talk about it, no body wants to hear negative things, right? So I've always downplayed my issues in my head, and I couldn't understand why I was slowly breaking as a human. 
I recently found the r/cptsd sub and started reading it, just curious (i was a psychology major before I dropped out of college). Everything I read there hit home. I never gave it a thought that I might be suffering from untreated ptsd and what I went through was actual abuse. 


My real parents are addicted to drugs, so when CPS got involved, my mom's grandmother legally adopted me. 


She also had severe munchausen syndrome by proxy. From the age of 12 - 18 years old, she had me on more medication then I can count. A few that I remember off hand were klonapin, adderall, seroquel, ambien, geodon, lithium, and that's only a few. I have periods of my life that I simply don't remember. I would fall asleep in class. I would fall asleep midconversation. She also had me diagnosed with epilepsy and i never understood that one because I've never had a seizure in my life. I'm pretty sure I would know if I had one. (I've been to a LOT of concerts where they use a ton of flashing lights, I've also been a photographer for a pretty good number of years). But I honestly think she did that at the time, because I was 16, and asking about getting my drivers license. And she didn't want me to have one. (i never got one until I was 23). But I was a walking zombie, and everyone thought I was crazy as well, so I had no friends. She baker acted me over 15 times, I never knew why. She would tell the doctor I was a threat to myself, or I was threatening her, but that was never the truth. But no one ever looked into it because I was 'crazy' and I was on SSI, and all of those medications, so it must be legit, right? I tried telling my therapist what was going on at home, and I CLEARLY remember her telling me to my face that my mother was never capable of doing those things to me, because she adopted me and she loved me and she obviously did a lot of things for me. I ran away from home after that. I was trying to tell my therapist that right before therapy my adopted mom looked me in the face and told me that she wished I had died at birth, that I reminded her too much of my mom. 
I can remember when I was a little girl, maybe around 8 or 9 years old. Anytime she would get mad at me, she would slam her door so hard that overtime it knocked the fire alarm off of the wall (we lived in a mobile home). But when she would get mad at me, she would lock herself in her room for days at a time. Only coming out to get food. I can remember I would be crying at her door for over an hour, steadily apologizing. I would draw her letters, saying I'm sorry over and over and include little pictures on it and slide it under the door for her. Whenever she came out to get food I would see piles of them at the door, still untouched, and she would step on them on her way out the door. I promise that if you want to break a little girl's heart, that's the perfect way to do it.
It was never directly physical. Of course she would slap me, and push me against the walls or ground, but never hard enough to leave bruises or marks so I couldn't tell anyone. If we were in public and we messed up, she would pretend to hold my hand or arm in a loving manner, but she would actually be digging her very long nails into my skin. But I had a history of cutting so that report wouldn't be very believable either. I remember once she walked in on me cutting and she just stood there and said ""Do it, you won't."" and did nothing as I did. When I got raped, I tried to report it, and she told the officer that I was mentally ill and doing it for attention. So I got told I could be arrested for filing a false police report.    


It all ended when I was 18, because my benefits got cut. I was on SSI and got a $500 check a month in my name, that she cashed and I never saw. I also had medicaid for my insane amount of medicine that I had to ingest everyday. When I turned 18, that all ended because I was an adult. So she kicked me out! She told me I could come back if I appealed it and got back on ssi. I thought ""fuck that"" and figured living on the streets would be better than spending a minute in that house. I had just started dating a guy that lived an hour away, so I grabbed what I could and told him to pick me up and I moved directly in with him and his mom. It ended up being a shitty and dumb thing to do, because I didnt know him at all (we were only dating a month), we ended up being completely NOT compatible and i ended up being in a situation where I was stuck for awhile. (keep in mind, I had no license, no job experience, or anything, she kept me sheltered). I went through a long period of detox, because I had to quit the medicines that I was on cold turkey. I distinctly remember trying to fill ONE of the 5 prescriptions that I had to take daily, and just one of them (geodon iirc) was about $800 without insurance. So I had to quit cold turkey. Klonapin was one of them. I had been on that pill since I was 12. I thought I was dying. 
But I made it out. And now I'm 25, married to my best friend, and I have the family I lacked as a kid, and for the first time in my life I'm getting help for the abuse I went through as a kid. I think I might want to raise awareness for this type of abuse, I don't know where to even start, but I know when I was a kid I reached out to many people, and got turned away with them all saying that my mom was too nice to do anything that I was stating. I personally have friends who have had similar upbringings, and it goes untalked about and unnoticed TOO often.

49,"(cross post with r/BipolarReddit)

Starting in 2009 (age 17), I had increasingly awful depression, reaching a peak in late 2014 (age 22), when I checked myself into hospital for 5 days outpatient then 7 days inpatient. After this, my meds were switched from Paxil and Abilify to Effexor XR. In early 2017 (age 24), after gradually increasing the Effexor, I was bumped to 225mg a day. This sent me into a hypo manic episode for a week until I dropped it back to 150mg. My body couldn't keep up with my mind, I had no filter, and I did things without thinking.

This lead to my psych to change my diagnosis from Major Depressive Disorder to Bipolar Disorder Type 2, rapid cycling, as we believed that this wouldn't have happened if I didn't have bipolar, paired with how I had described my depressive episodes as wave-like/ebbing and growing for years. I added on lithium 300mg 2xday at this time.

Now I'm in a new state and have a new psych (age 25). I went to her last week for Rx refills and because I had the worst short-term depression in years. I couldn't work or even get out of bed for 5 days. She says the the Effexor Lithium combo seems to have helped with some issues (anxiety, bulimia, self-harm), but isn't doing enough for the depression. She upped my Lithium to 300mg 3xday and is seeing me March 13th. Her main issue is that I don't have any issues with sleep during my ""up"" periods. I sleep normally. When I'm depressed, I sleep a lot more and have trouble getting up in the morning.

What my issue is: If I don't have bipolar, what are the other possible disorders I could have? What runs similarly to bipolar but isn't? Is there such thing as cyclical depression? If I don't have bipolar, what the hell was that episode in early 2017? (I asked my new psych something like this when I saw her, but she didn't have an answer for me, just shrugged it off...) 

**I'm not asking that you diagnose me, just what is similar to bipolar**

59,"I'm very socially anxious. I'm a student living in shared housing and I haven't cooked any meal since about a month. I rarely leave my room when I know that there are people in the kitchen. I just sneak out to the supermarket and buy whatever junk food I can manage to eat in my room without being seen.

I constantly buy raw meat that I want to prepare but I just always end up wasting it as it exceeds past its use by date. Yesterday I was really sure that I'll finally cook a meal because I have nothing left to eat in my room but I didn't manage to make myself leave the room because I've heard people in the kitchen from the morning until the evening. All day. 

Because of that, I've decided to punish myself and today is even worse. Since I have no food left in my room, I haven't eaten all day (it's 18:00 at the time I'm writing my post) and I'm too anxious to even leave my house to buy any food because if a housemate sees me, he/she might comment on how long its been since I've been seen. It's stressful for me.

63,"Note: Throwaway account, excuse the poor formatting as I just want to get this off my chest. Tell me if this isn't the right place to post this.

I am a 17-year-old male who currently has no talents or hobbies whatsoever, and I have been depressed (more or less secretly) about this and beating myself up over it for the last several years. My parents tried to introduce me to activities when I was a young child such as swimming, gymnastics, rugby etc. and although I liked these things once I got there I was never talented in them and never enthusiastic when it came time to go to practices and once I found out, around seven or so, that I could quit these activities just by asking I did. I also never had one single friend until this year (and even that is still an issue) and used to suffer from Aspergers' Syndrome until I managed to resolve it by working through the issues more recently, but by doing so I have made this problem far worse by removing the blissful ignorance I once possessed. From eight until seventeen my computer was my only friend and source of entertainment; I whiled away all of my free time reading any random thing I found interesting on the internet and sometimes playing games. This was enough to entertain (and pacify) me and I was never motivated to do anything else. My veil of blissful ignorance was lifted by puberty, specifically, as strange as this may sound, by a pretty girl onto whom I developed a crush. Due to my Aspergers' Syndrome I never felt the need to make friends, but now I had other motivations, and I suddenly realised I had nothing to talk to people about. In addition, I suddenly became bitterly jealous when I found out that this girl, whom I thought was ""on my level"", was very talented at a number of things and had been doing them for years. That was when I started beating myself up over my past failures. So what caused this? Although it was I that quit all the activities my parents got me to do when I was young, they never educated me about the importance of them or why they wanted me to do them (which I believe I would have been smart enough to understand back then) and I can't help but feel that this is partially their fault as they were ""hands-off"" parents and seemingly completely gave up on raising a multitalented son when they were disheartened by me quitting the initial activities; activities that I might not have quit if they had educated me on the importance of not doing so. I also had a petrifying fear of asking for things from my parents for some reason, never being able to ask to try new things that I had an inkling of desire to try and never having the courage to complain about anything. I did some activities, most notably drama, as part of my old school's experimental curriculum, and although I liked these I still wasn't talented and was still only doing what the curriculum required whereas literally everybody else there was high-powered (or at least seemed that way) with one or more hobbies and a track record of extracurricular achievements. Two years ago when the self-thrashing started I tried to find extra-curricular sports and hobbies for a school extracurricular achievement program I signed up for in the hope of turning things around; my parents as expected were not helpful in the slightest and didn't take it too seriously, just providing me a starting point for research as if I was actually confident or motivated enough to find things myself without inspiration. I failed the program, and when I finally after years gained enough courage to speak my thoughts and broke down in tears confronting them about having not motivated me when I was younger, my dad got upset and apologised, saying that he had failed me in some ways, but my mother freaked out at me for making my dad upset and ordered me to apologise, which I did not because I still believe it was partially their fault, I know how they raised me, and it wasn't the right way for my kind of personality which they never fully understood.

Moving on, this year I decided to go to boarding school overseas and will be there next year as well, and this has genuinely helped me significantly by erasing the outdated reputation that I had still been tagged with in my old school despite efforts to change that; I have actual friends now, am quite well-known among students and people appreciate my personality. I have done American football and ski racing as sports so far, neither of which I had done before. I like football (although I'm not good at it I'm new and have definitely improved over the course of the season) and, especially, skiing, which has been the one sport I have truly loved and remained passionate about through all of my unmotivated years, but haven't had the chance to do regularly until now due to growing up in a hot country. If these problems can be resolved I aim to make that my ""signature"" sport or activity and although I am nowhere near the level of skill of other racers I am improving slowly.

However, although I was initially proud of myself for doing all this, sports are still something mandatory at my school and I still have no hobbies or achievements outside of this. The phenomenon of autoflagellation over this has returned because I still get very jealous of other people, almost every one of whom in this school is more accomplished than me extracurricularly especially when they endaggerate their abilities leading me to think that I am on their sort of level only to find out that they are excellent at everything they try, have multiple talents and are winning many awards. I would like to do drawing but have no opportunity to learn at the moment and whenever I try to get a pencil and paper and just practice the results are so awful that I just give up, and online tutorials suck. It is the same with piano which I managed to teach myself to the point of playing some simple songs one key at a time, but when I tried to get into chords and the bass line I hit a wall and have given that up at least for now as well.

Don't get me wrong; I genuinely want to have something to do other than use the computer all the time and am not doing this just to right past wrongs, elevate my status or be able to date girls without feeling bitter jealousy (those are MASSIVE reasons but not the only reasons). **In essence, my problem is that I will continue to excoriate myself for my lack of achievement and wasting my life until I can suss out someone or something onto which I can finally lay down the blame and move on.** Can you help me?

I'm sorry if it seems like I am only bashing my parents or if the tone of this essay is troll-like at all.

But all the advice is focused on ""irrational"" feelings of guilt (i.e. blaming yourself for things your not actually responsible for, blaming yourself because of hindsight even though you were doing the best at the time,...). But abusing animals/enjoying another beings fear is objectively a horrible thing.

Are there ways to deal with warranted feelings of guilt? Or is self-forgiveness inappropriate, since I would be letting myself off the hook for something having done something awful?

71,"The brain is an organ. We all know this. Just like the heart, lungs, liver, etc.


We cannot live without this organ. Again, obvious. But what most people fail to discern between the brain and everything else, is that the brain is what makes us aware of everything else. In that case, is it not possible that the brain could be making you think that it's functioning normally?


If you get a heart attack, you go to the cardiologist. There's no question, right? It's a ""duh"" type situation. But when the brain abnormally functions, ever-so-slightly, people don't attribute it to brain chemistry, and that's how some social outcasts are created and end up doing horrible, unspeakable things.


So, imagine a traumatic event that has triggered a mental illness in someone. It could be a romantic situation gone awry, a robbery, witnessing death, or a variety of other things. Now imagine someone getting hit with a bullet or a piece of shrapnel.


These two things, in my opinion, are exactly the same.


The physical trauma that you experience from a bullet is the same as the emotional trauma experienced from an event or emotionally stressful event that you've witnessed.


A bullet enters, and you experience severe trauma. Now imagine that the bullet is the triggering event (no pun intended), and the wound is your mental illness as a result. The gun that shot the bullet to cause that trauma are akin to your senses from which you've experienced this event and thus caused the wound.


When a bullet hits you but there is no exit wound, you usually go to the ER to get the bullet removed. If they can't remove the bullet because of complicated medical reasons, they give you meds to manage the pain, or treat the issue so you can at least function properly. If the bullet passes clean through, you still have to go to the doctor to get treated for your wound. If you let it heal by itself, it will leave a nasty scar and everyone will see it, even if you're so used to it that you don't notice it anymore.


If you witness an event that causes you mental distress, even if you think the event will pass right through your mind, you should still see a therapist or psychiatrist to evaluate that, because they deal with a million people with trauma, just like ER physicians deal with bullet wounds.


Now, I'm sure you can bite down on a belt and remove the bullet yourself, but do you really want to go through that? Also, you can fail miserably and be worse off than before. It's the same with sorting through your subconscious.


I believe that people have innate natures that gravitate naturally toward either positive or negative outlooks, so your brain could go either way once affected by an emotional stimulus. This can obviously change based on external stimuli, or ""nurture."" But if you leave these things unchecked for years, bad things can happen. 


Imagine if someone got shot in war, or got hit with shrapnel from a grenade, and came home but never got that piece removed because it didn't bother him much anymore. The piece of metal burrow deeper because new cells are being created on top of it, and eventually gets pushed deeper and deeper beneath the surface.


After years, you kinda know the bullet is there, but you can learn to live with it to a certain extent, as it burrows deeper and deeper and gets harder and harder to remove. Now, that 15 minute extraction surgery for bullet removal is now a 3 hour surgery needing anesthesia, all because you said, ""Eh, it doesn't hurt anymore.""


Now imagine that same scenario with the emotional trauma. Just because time passed and it's not a fresh wound anymore, does not mean that it's taken care of and that everything will eventually be alright. Maybe it will, but likely not. As years go by, the trauma buries itself deep within your subconscious until it's affecting the decisions you make on a daily basis without you even knowing it, like a survivor of a bullet wound that limps because the bullet is scraping against his femur, but it happened so gradually that he never noticed, and now he hobbles.


So what happens if you never take care of it? Eventually, the bullet may puncture a vital organ and kill you. How can that be similar to mental health? After years, the stress that is buried in our subconscious takes a toll on our physical health and sends bad signals to the body, causing physical symptoms like headaches, nausea, and after years, even cancer or similarly horrible diseases.


It all lines up, and if you can get someone - even one person - to listen to this analogy and get some help, then my three hours at work were very well spent.

77,"Hi guys, this is my first post here and would love to hear opinions on this.  I often think that my cleverness and ability to read people puts me into situations where I'm left with anger and hatred.

I've been in a relationship before where I could easily read when my ex was lying to me or trying to play mind games.  She would deny it fervently and I'd be left with an underlying anger, but force myself to think I was overreacting, only to catch her slip after some time had passed and find out my initial theories were correct that she was indeed lying.

I can pick up cues when co-workers are trying to make a subtle play to undermine me or outshine me, and I in turn have to get revenge or angrily compete with them.

I can tell if a housemate is passively-aggressively trying to send me a message, and I'm so outraged by their indirect approach that I will refuse to do whatever they wanted me to do until they say something directly. Or, that I'm so fed up that I call them out for their passive-aggressiveness.

My point is if I were, say - for a lack of a better word - simple, I would never have thought my ex was lying and we'd be happy.  I'd never have to compete with my coworkers and I'd be content with my job.  I would never realize the passive-aggressive messages my housemate is trying to send me and they would eventually take care of it on their own, while in my head, the house would be peaceful.

Now sometimes I'm wrong and I admit that at times I can be irrational and obsessive, but I'd say in general, I'm correct much more often than not when it comes to reading people like this.

Has anyone faced this problem as well? What is my issue here? And what can I do to just have more peace?",28Feb2018,5
78,"Sometimes it feels like I can't control my thoughts or emotions. Like if I get too stressed out I hear this... screaming in my head, or I'll feel tears welling up but it's not like I WANT to cry. It's like a reaction happening on it's own. My sleep goes between okay and WHY AM I AWAKE AT 3 IN THE MORNING I WANT TO GO BACK TO SLEEP NOW. 

I can't stress out too much or else I'll have another ""episode"" where I basically lose my ability to speak (still talking to doctors to figure that part out - apparently the blood vessels on one side of my head are thicker than usual and I also have a very tiny hole in my heart). A few years ago I didn't stress things nearly as much, but after moving out, losing a friend in a car accident and missing her funeral due to miscommunication, losing my grandmother and missing her funeral because of work, my car breaking down after I sunk too much goddamn money into it, and working a job I hate more and more every day... I'm 22 but I feel like I'm fucking 40.

I'm just... tired. I have my first therapy appointment next week, and I'm going to try to take up hiking and boxing for an outlet. I got a solid used car and I'm really trying to push through. I'm okay. I just needed to vent for a second.

86,"Hi, I don’t have much to explain right now, I feel too sad and shut down to write a lot. But I am feeling suicidal again after getting better and thinking more positively. It seems to often go up and down - of course, for practically all of the time, it’s down. My mind is very empty right now, which it has been for the last couple of months. This is one of the saddest parts to me because, even though in recent years I’ve really struggled with mental health, my mind has always been wild and buzzing. I feel like it has saved me all this time. I’m sad that the only beauty in my life is leaving me, all because I’m too emotionally attached to people in general. The confusion has turned into worthlessness. I’m just looking for some advice or support here. ",28Feb2018,13
87,"Just a passing thought. It is almost unbearable to be the friend, sister, daughter who no one can see is depressed. My friend said she had no idea because I don’t “come off as someone who would be depressed”. I don’t burden others with my feelings and emotions because I know we all struggle, but it doesn’t mean that I don’t fight this same fight everyday. I get up and go to work, I excel in university, not because it’s “easy” but because I refuse to let this demon take control of me. 
There was no real point to this,  I just needed to type it out. Check on your friends and family fellow Redditors, many times it’s the least likely person who’s struggling the most.",28Feb2018,3

89,"Hi, I recently consulted with a sleep psychiatrist to help address my sleep issues and he stated that I needed to address my anxiety and depression concerns to resolve my sleep issues.  I am in the process of looking for a therapist, but I was wondering how to move forward.  I always thought a psychiatrist would handle both the therapy and potential medication, but through talking to schedulers it seems like psychiatry (related to medication handling) and therapy are separate and I am given the choice to pursue one or the other.  Shouldn't they be joint affairs?  I am of the mindset that I should perhaps try therapy first and see if I that should resolve my issues first before pursuing medication.  Can anyone with experience chime in on how to approach this? ",28Feb2018,1
