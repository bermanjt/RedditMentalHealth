0,"I apologize, this is a long post, but I don’t know where to turn or what to do. I am seeing a therapist and she is implying that I don’t need therapy and doesn’t know why I am there.

I am high functioning, I work as a freelance developer which is a great pay compared to most people my age. I am going to college and get A’s and B’s with little or no study. I have my own studio in downtown and have hobbies: I play video games, piano and am taking some salsa classes. I have been going to the gym losing to lose get back in shape. From an outside perspective, I seem very successful, but I have a lot of baggage that drags me down. Most people with similar baggage tend to turn into addicts of throw themselves at an art. I threw myself into school and contribute my success mostly to doing the right thing because I refuse to give in or go down without fighting to the bitter end.



My background:

When I was very young, I was molested by someone in the family. I don’t remember any of it, but I remember the feeling that I was lying when I said it happened when I was talking to a therapist when I was young.

My mom and dad would argue a lot and got divorced. My mom’s boyfriends were abusive to her. I remember one who was chocking her and trying to push her out the window. He then broke a chair and kidnaped my younger, who was found later that day under a parked semi by police. I remember my mom once pointing a knife at me and that I was terrified of her when she was mad and would hide under my younger brother’s crib. I also remember being locked in the bedroom and once sneaking out the window to find her at a boyfriend’s apartment in the same apartment complex because I was hungry.

I was placed in foster care with my younger brother around the age of 6 or 8. I grew up in the system. While in the system I moved around a lot: I think about 8 times. Each time meant a new family and new school. None of the places I lived at allowed me to participate in school activities or socialize outside of school, so I had no real friends growing up. My mom has been in and out of my life as she would go to jail and rehab centers and I was only allowed to visit my dad for an hour every week. At one point I lived with my dad for about a year in a ghetto neighborhood, but I was skipping school and getting into trouble at school, so I was placed back in foster care.

One of the earlier foster homes was abusing my younger brother. I was always in trouble for things I didn’t do but was blamed for there and always doing writing assignments. I reported they were abusing him and then they said I was molesting their dog, so we were separated, and I was placed in a group home. Not long later they found out it was true and he was placed in closed adoption so we never had any contact since then.

The group home was awful. I describe it as the halfway point between jail and a mental hospital. I would have to ask to go from one room to the next and had no privacy or sense of agency. Staff would have to check on us showering to see if we are washing up, I had to go out with everyone else to events I hated like baseball games. Other people at the group home were very violent. Everyday someone had to be restrained and, on a few occasions, staff had to go to the hospital because of how violent the other kids can get. I was coerced into sex by a roommate threatening to break the only thing I had of my younger brothers and I was terrified of the dark and would cry and throw fits if they staff didn’t leave the hallway lights on. 

I was the best-behaved person there, I was never restrained and held the record for the most points anyone has ever gotten there. People typically stayed there for only 6 months, but I was there for 3 years. Perspective foster parents rejected me for things such as liking rap music and video games or for not liking sports. Because I was the best behaved, I never got rewarded or attention. Staff would let other kids stay up latter than they bed time, do craft projects with them to encourage them to continue being good. When I would ask to stay up an hour later than my bedtime they would refuse, and I would get in trouble if I persisted in asking.

I moved in with my dad after that which had its own problems. We lived in a ghetto and I was the only white person in my school. I was bullied by everyone in class, so my teacher had me put my desk in the corner. Out of school people would hit me with metal poles and our apartment was frequently broken into. We couldn’t pay for all the bills, so I couldn’t shower in the winter because the water was too cold. People threw raw eggs at me and they would freeze over before I got home, and they would do things like break our windows with rocks and cut the gas line to my dad’s car, so he couldn’t drive to work etc. I once walked around with someone in my class I had a crush on and her cousins drove by the house and shot at the house and later told me they don’t want to see me talking with her again. I started skipping school and getting into fights to fight off some of the bullying. After 5th grade I went to a middle school that wasn’t local by testing into their gifted program, but my bad behavior didn’t stop so I was placed back into the system.

My final foster parent during high school ended up being relatives from my mom’s side of the family. They took me in hoping that they can give me to my mom once she got herself together. She wasn’t able to and they didn’t get tenor at the university they thought. The accepted a position at another university and because I was turning 18 they gave me two months to move out. Under those circumstances I dropped out of high school and went to a community college to get financial aid and had to throw away everything I wanted to work towards just to keep a roof over my head.



Very recently:

I managed to get an associates and work as a web developer. I eventually started dating someone and we lived together for 5 years before I broke up with her. Towards the end of that relationship I realized I wasn’t happy with my life and wanted to work towards my original dreams and goals again. She didn’t like her job either so we both started going to school again and our relationship couldn’t handle all the pressure. I was working 60 hour weeks as a freelancer meaning no predictable hours and a my client was an asshole. I couldn’t drop him because I paid for all the bills except for her car and some of the food. I did most of the chores as well and when I tried to talk to her about her helping out more by either doing more chores or working more than 20 hours a week she gave me the ultimatum, so I took it.

I got my own place and now had the time and money to pursue old hobbies I gave up on like piano and ballroom dancing. I stood up to the asshole client and dropped him so I lost my main source of income. I entered a major depressive state that I hadn’t been in before. My ex and I discussed getting back together and they way she was treating me made me feel like I wasn’t good enough for her and brought back a lot of emotions.

One night I got drunk for the first time and she decided to come over for a fun bootycall. She had me smoke some weed and everything seemed fine at first. All of sudden I started crying and telling her how worthless I am and how she makes me feel that way and I would be better of dead. She decided she was going to call the mental hospital and suddenly, all the group home memories and everything came back and hit me like a break. I was terrified that I was going to be placed back in state care, be raped and never able to leave state care once I got in it. I grabbed her by the neck to threaten her and took her phone to prevent it from happening. After realizing I did something horrible I went out into the freeway entrance hoping to get run over. Needless to say, she wants nothing to do with me. My relationship with her is twice as long as any family I have every been with or friend I ever had so this is really hard to deal with.

I normally have always had difficulty sleeping, it would take me 2-4 hours to fall asleep. For a month after that night it was even worse. It was taking me about 8 hours to fall asleep and I would wake up sweating, heart racing a terrified, but I don’t know why. I have never had a dream or nightmare that I can recall in my entire life.
Fragmented memories have been coming back. I have been tempted to write or something but soon as I do I realize how blurry and fragmented they are. I have moved around so much I have a hard time knowing how old I was or what order things happened in. More importantly I have this never-ending feeling that I am forgetting something horrible and its going to come back to me any day and fuck me over.

My friend’s mom, who has been in an abusive relationship and is a nurse practitioner suggested that I probably have PTSD which is very common for people who grew up in the system and how have had similar things happen to them. She suggested I see a therapist which I started looking into the day after that night.



Current life:

Jump forward a few months to now, I have just meet my therapist for the second time and I don’t think she is going to help. I am not sure if I am doing it wrong, she is or if there is something else entirely I should be doing.

I mentioned my past briefly and talked about that night briefly. This pose goes more in depth that we talked about them. She doesn’t want to talk about them and wants to focus on the present and that we might talk about the past if there is some reason to think it is affecting the present. She has made a few comments and questions about if there is a court case about that night which there isn’t. I told her there isn’t, and I don’t think there will be but she keeps making comments on like “don’t worry that what you said isn’t on the goals sheet. We can still talk about other things but this way it won’t go on record so if there is a court case no one will know”.

At the first session she wanted me to state my issues, goals and how I will know when I am done with therapy. I honestly don’t know other than surface level things like have meaningful friendships and not feeling like shit so much. I know there is a strong correlation between the strength of my social circle and my mood, so she is really focused on that for the end of the first session. She wanted me to come up with ways to meet new friends.

At the second session I mentioned I started doing salsa classes. I also told her about other meetups I attend etc. but I still can’t seem to make friends and I don’t know why. After the night my ex told me that she thinks I am toxic, manic depressive and manipulative so I told her that and that I don’t know if I am. All she says is I don’t know and starts saying she doesn’t know why I am in therapy because I am already doing the things I need to do to make friends, so she asked again why I am there.

I tried to talk more about my past but giving her a tldr; on being molested, raped and in foster care etc. by saying these things have happened and she again mentioned she doesn’t want to focus on the past but the present and asked my why I am there.

She also pointed out that I was uncomfortable. I told her that I was, but I don’t really care about that if that means getting better. She wants me to ask people who don’t like me why they don’t like me. I am hesitant on this because my ex told me not to text her, and I don’t expect the people who stood me up for a first date would give an honest answer. She said I should ask the ballroom dance instructor which seems ridiculous. I told her that we have never talked, and my class Is between two classes with no breaks. I feel that it is inappropriate and any response he would give me wouldn’t be meaningful. On a surface level I get along with people just find.

I mentioned how I think my sleeping habits are abnormal. For my sleep I told her that it takes me hours to go to sleep and my heart starts betting fast and that even though it hurts to open my eyes because of how tired I am a cant sleep. Other times I feel rested, but I can remember seeing the time on the clock every 30-60 min for all but one or two hours from when I went to bed to when I woke up. I also mentioned sometimes waking up scared and covered in sweat. She asked if I have night terrors and I told her I don’t know. She responded saying she wouldn’t know either and asked if I have done a sleep study before. I told I did a sleep apnea test and know I don’t have sleep apnea and didn’t do a full sleep study test because that would cost thousands of dollars which I can’t afford. She suggested I talk with my primary care doctor again because my sleep habits are probably physical. I feel like this is a BS response to give and she is just avoiding everything I try to talk about.

Next, I mention my memory/sense of time is weird. I mentioned how I often can’t recall what I did or eat the day before or the morning of unless I stop and try to think about it for a long period of time. Sometimes the previous day feels like it was moths ago. I feel like my life is broken into phases based on where I live and my relationships. A previous phase can feel like a lifetime ago despite being only a few months ago.

I told her I have had therapy before while growing up in the system and told her I was once on medication while at the group home, but I don’t know what for or if it helped with anything. I mentioned the last therapist I had said I have high functioning depression and tried to emphasis that at times my therapist was just my case worker, the school counselor etc. and I mostly viewed it as a time to go to the library or play a video game instead of trying to open about things and that I didn’t really want to talk about things with them before but now things are different and I want to.

She is very focused on the present and the surface level issues. On the surface I am high functioning and doing what I need to do but deep down I feel like shit and that I am not normal or liked and I don’t know why. I remember I was really depressed for some of the days between the sessions and some nights I can’t sleep but the next day I usually can’t remember what exactly I what exactly. When in therapy my mind gets blank and its even harder to recall the vents of the previous days or weeks. She won’t initiate any conversation and puts it all on me to decide on goals and what to talk about, but I honestly don’t know where to start. I don’t want to outright say things like I think I have CPTSD or untreated RAD because I am worried that I might be wrong and mislead the direction of therapy and because I have a good memory on factual information I might mislead my self into thinking I have something and use similar terminology that I read when reading up on the subject.

I have only done talk therapy before. I know there are other kinds of therapy and because I am not in the system I don’t have to see this one person. I know my current therapist use to focus on drug and alcohol abuse, so I think she thinks that night was simply the result of me being an angry drunk.

What should I do? I want her to take more charge in the conversation and be more prying and have some opinion based on her knowledge of psychology to give me some sort of starting point or something. Should I write stuff like this and give it to her that way I don’t forget in session, see a different therapist or look for a whole different kind of therapy? I feel like I am being asked to describe the outside when I have only been in the cave. ",21Apr2018,6

I’m having a really hard time stopping so it can heal. Any good alternatives? The only thing that helps at times is keeping my hair in a ponytail (like at work) and deep-cleaning random things in my house, like scrubbing crevices in the bathroom that don’t usually get cleaned. ",21Apr2018,7
4,"**I'm trying to make this as clear, concise and organized as possible. Feel free to ask me to edit it, if it helps.**


TL;DR: My sister is mean, selfish, and treats our parents like crap. She belittles them and calls them transphobic. She picks at everything they say, and my parents definitely do not deserve it. My parents have always been accepting- they have stated that they love her no matter what- gay, trans, whatever. They love both of us endlessly. They give her money and pay her bills. She is heartless and recently sent my mom an email, telling her that she was trans and that they only needed to know because they'll have to pay for her testosterone soon. My sister has a history of threatening to kill herself in return for items (i.e. give me a new ipod or I'll kill myself), and so my mom is afraid that if we do not comply with her, she'll try to kill herself again. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but does not let us talk to her therapist so I don't know how true that is.


**BACKGROUND** (I think it should help explain her, sorry it's so long): Growing up, my sister always caused problems in the household. When she was very young, it started out with her having 'issues'. To start, she always had issues going to the bathroom. She was terrified of pooping, and would either hold it in to the point that they had to give her laxatives at age 6, or she would poop in a corner of her room and hide it. We discovered that she had encopresis when she was about 11 (she was not pooping in the toilet and instead hid it in her underwear, and would not change her underwear for weeks at a time). Fast forward to the teenage years, she was always the kind of kid who was attracted to risk. She tried a lot of drugs, hung out with boys a lot older than her, and hung out with 'bad' girls (sorry for the sexism- best way I can shortly explain it).


I am older, so when I went off to college things got bad. She told our parents she was suicidal and depressed. Our parents are amazing and jumped instantly to help her, and believed every word. We never got a long, but I started to become suspicious of whether or not she was really suicidal when she began to use it against my parents to get things she wanted. An ipod, tickets to a concert, she'd threaten to kill herself if she didn't get these things and my poor mom would give in, terrified of losing her daughter. 


This behavior still goes on. Now, in my mid twenties I started to realize that she had 'personality phases' that she would go through. Every teen tries to find themselves and tries different fads, but hers were always very extreme. From about 13-15, she went through a 'emo' phase, and her personality went with it. For years we never saw her smile (I seriously mean NEVER), she ditched all her old friends for 'scene' kids, and would only listen to screamo music. Then one day when she was 16, she decided to become more 'hippie-like'. Within one month, she threw out ALL of her black clothes, her music, her friends, everything. She replaced everything and every one. She dreaded her hair, smoked a lot of weed and did LSD and other drugs. Listened to Bob Marley, had brand new hippie friends. Her personality? She would 'act high' even when she wasn't. Always 'chilled out', smiled often, and one time I remember I was complaining to her about something and she said to me, ""You just gotta let go of the neggo vibes, man"". I looked at her like, Who are you?
This lasted until she was 18, where she then got a tattoo that said 'good, good vibes'. I thought nothing of this, seeing how the phase lasted for so long. I thought that was just her now. Then when she went to college- she did it again. Dropped all of her old friends, changed taste in music, complete personality change, everything. She became a 'social justice warrior', pretty much. A man hater. She would not listen to music sung by men because it enforced the patriarchy, she became lesbian, cut off all her hair, and would only hang out with other lesbians. She became offended at everything anyone said, and a few times even loudly cried in public because she was 'triggered' (using her words). Around this time she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD. We asked who her therapist was, she refused to tell us. She apparently takes medication but I've never seen it. I've never seen 'official diagnosis' paperwork or anything.


Around this time I started asking my long term friends if they noticed these wild changes in her personality. They agreed. Now my parents during all these have tried SO hard to be supportive. My mother and father both instantly supported her when she came out as a lesbian. They have always blindly supported us with everything we have ever done.


**FINALLY, MY PROBLEM**:: This 'social justice warrior' phase is still happening, so maybe I'm wrong and it's not just a phase. But my problem is that she treats my parents like utter SHIT and it's driving me crazy. She belittles them, yells at them, and constantly tells them that they're wrong. She talks about how 'men are shit' in front of my father, and sometimes refuses to speak to him or respond to him. We have two little cousins that were recently born, a boy and a girl. She refuses to hold, play with, or acknowledge the boy. One time- we have a ferrel cat living in the backyard- and my mother called the cat a 'he'. My sister lectured her about how she shouldn't assume the cat's gender. She always looks at them, smiles, shakes her head and sighs. It drives me crazy how much she belittles them.


Recently, I came home from my boyfriend's house to find my parents completely distraught. My mom told me to check my email- my mom had forwarded me an email that my sister sent to her. In this email, my sister came out to my parents as transgender... and told them that they 'needed to know because she'll be starting Testosterone soon and it'll show up on their insurance'. But what bothers me is HOW she did it. It was a long, incoherent ramble, with unfinished sentences and run on sentences. She could have written that email about anything, and it STILL would have not made any sense. I remember reading it and thinking that she had lost her mind. In it, she kept linking to youtube videos of people explaining what privilege is, how white people are 'scum' (we are all white), etc. In the end of the email my sister wrote: ""PS- can you send this to dad too? I dont have his email and dont want him using my old pronouns. thanx!""
My parents and I have spoken about this and we all said that we don't care if she is transgender, we will love her anyway. What we DONT like is how she treats us. She thinks we are transphobic monsters, but in reality all we do is give her love. She treats us like shit and I don't know what to do anymore. My parents have said what hurts them the most is that she wants them to pay for her car, help her with rent, and pay for the testosterone yet she treats them like garbage. My mom is afraid that if they refuse, she'll kill herself. What do I do?",21Apr2018,4

6,"What I am going to mention below is something that's been on my mind for years...everyday I cant help but to think about this. I have been told by close friends and others that I most likely have ASPD due to my actions and habits but I seriously doubt it...i dont know what else to think. But anyways here it goes...

As a highschool senior...I am absolutely frustrated. I'm barely passing HS, my goals of joining the Military or running a company seems pointless, I'm practically fucking losing my mind. I dont FEEL accomplished, I RARELY accomplished anything in HS. Whenever I see people with a job, high grades, going to clubs, I cant help but to see myself and think ""what the fuck??"" I have had a history of toxic relationships and friendships also. I'm seen by everyone as this Short-Tempered, Agressive, and Crazy individual. I walk everywhere with people who goes to the gym (I used to, but stopped since parents dont pay for it) and all I see is success, happiness, and genuine love and connections...I NEVER felt that. Like ever. It does bother me really.

Deep down, I'm ambitious. I love the idea of me being a forefront leader, being a pioneer in something big. Being known as an aggressive leader who will push forward and get rid of anything and anyone in the way. I can fantasize so much about power, I would want to use it to benefit me, to build a reputation that MY name can be heard! I grew up in a lower-medium class family, so I never had the luxury to do the things I wanted. As a child I felt humiliated, neglected, and abused. I dont know where else to go...I dont have that many friends worth telling this to, I'll only be seen as a fucking dictator...and maybe deep down I love being seen like that. Hell not alot of people know I'm into necrophilia, just because of the possessive aspect behind it. I just love being possessive.

In a nutshell, I want POWER, control, wealth, the ability to fucking get rid of whoever I want. I fantasize this everyday...and the worst part is, I rarely get attention...I want ALL eyes on me, for the better, to be seen in a positive light. I struggle with being able to connect with others I care about emotionally...it sucks.",21Apr2018,0

8,"I recently took myself to the ER for a psych eval because of a triggering event that was causing SI. The social worker told me that 9/10 times they would keep someone like me on an involuntary hold.  Very luckily, my mom took a week off work and said she felt safe supervising me. I do sort of have a history of depression, but was in denial that “severe depression” was what I was experiencing.... until I had this spiraling break down this week, that is.  

Anyway, I just went and saw a psychiatrist for the first time today. She prescribed Vistaril for anxiety and welbeutrin for depression. I tried them today and felt two things: my heart was *pounding* but I was very tired.  It did not feel good. 

Is this a normal combo of meds? 
If you take these, how does they impact you?
When do you take the meds? (I was given a lot of freedom to decide but feel like I need more direction...The only directions were (1) take at the same time every day (2) take the welbeutrin before 4pm bc it could keep me up)

10,"I’m a 22 year old guy (who’s a virgin who’s never had a girlfriend) and the MAIN thing I’m talking about is about women finding me attractive. So many girls/women have told me (yes, actually told me) that I am “UGLY AS FUCK!” I even posted my picture on some places online and tons of people told me that I am indeed that ugly. When do many people say the same thing, it has to mean something. Some girls, or women, say I’m kind of cute, some say I’m POTENTIALLY CUTE, or even a potential STUD. I was actually shocked that so many people told me I’m literally hideous, even though I expected it, I was just shocked that so many people actually said so.

This just further confirmed my (reality or delusional???) belief that the female human race as a whole thinks I’m ugly/unattractive. 

Even when people say that a good personality can win women over, they say there still has to be some physical attraction as well. Then there’s this thing about actual INTERCOURSE (as opposed to just blowjobs and other stuff) being the hardest thing for men to get from women, basically a woman will only have penis in vagina sex if she finds him physically attractive and stereotypically “masculine”. For all I know, these are lies, or women are not like this hive mind my brain and real people say they are. 

For all I know, I have been tricked into a false reality and my mind is feeding me lies and delusions, manifested by what people tell me (but why would SO MANY people lie to me? Why and how could so many people be mean to me and try to destroy me?)

If my beliefs are lies, why do so many people feed me these lies??? When such a large number of people agree on something it must be fact, right? 

My brain makes me feel a reality (to me it IS real) that I’m not even 100% sure is real, but that reality is that the human female race as a whole thinks I’m ugly and would never date or fuck me. 

On top of all of that, even if some woman was willing to go out with me, I could never be good enough for her. I’m not financially stable, I don’t drive (which is more important to women when you don’t live in certain major cities) and can’t live on my own yet (well financially unstable covers that), and I’m not too strong or healthy in general, this is all so important, isn’t it?

I also get these truly disturbing thoughts of women talking to me but then some guy comes and she goes with him to fuck him and leave me with my virginity.

Could I be seeing reality/the truth? Or could I have actually been tricked into a false reality with false beliefs????

Even before I started disconnecting from reality, I have been treated bad my whole life. I have spent my life socially isolated, even completely physically isolated for a couple of years, during that time I started to believing I was in a false reality like “The Matrix” or “The Truman Show”. Now I’m in civilization but struggling in it.

I don’t even know what I WANT to do in life, so I have no focus, I feel I need the basics out of the way first, which most people do as teens (lose virginity, date, parties, etc.). As of now, I feel there is no potential reward for any work I put into my life, I have nothing now, and there are already no guarantees in life, so I could work hard and still (and there are real life people like this) be a virgin in my 40s, or forever, be forever alone, be a complete lonely miserable loser who’s life is a completely wasted existence.

I went to therapy for the better part of last year, because I had some symptoms of post-thraumatic stress, anxiety and dissociation. My psychologist at the time (and a psychiatrist) told me that I was over adapted (because of my mom's suicide, 10 years ago), and we begun therapy without medication. 

The therapy went well until my therapist's mother died of cancer. When she died, he explained to me that he couldn't treat me anymore because my case was triggering for him, and he wasn't going to be able to help me. Of course I told him that I understood, and he told me he would refer me to another therapist. However, there where no appointments near in time, but I was ok at the time so I didn't stress out about it.

Forward to this summer. This summer was a very dark time for me. I experienced some intense shit in my relationship and started having anxiety attacks and I wanted to kill myself. I never got as far as trying but I planned it. This lasted for about a month, when I started to feel better and to this day I haven't had more anxiety attacks or suicide feelings. However, I've had my anxiety increased and sometimes I feel like I don't want to live (I don't want to kill myself, I'm just tired of getting and talking and stuff. It's not all the time, but some days I feel that way). 

I started therapy last week with a new therapist. She's nice and all but still a stranger to me. I told her about the anxiety attacks but didn't tell her about the suicide feelings. I don't exactly know why, I guess I felt insecure, like I was weak and overreacting when I felt that way. Didn't want to seem weak. I know it's dumb, she's my therapist after all, but it made me anxious. The thing is, I feel like those suicide feelings are important for my current situation (feeling like I'm too tired) and I think I should talk about it to my therapist, but I'm afraid because I didn't tell her about that on our first session, and she may think I'm making it up or I'm an attention seeker or sth like that. I don't really know, I just feel uncomfortable.",21Apr2018,1
14,"Not sure if this belongs here so if anyone knows a better sub for this, feel free to tell me

So i just started dating a girl a couple weeks ago and she mentioned she feels like a werewolf/is a werewolf. I was under the assumption that she was trying to be cute or was a furry or something like that.

So recently I had asked more about her music tastes, and she mentioned a genre called ""werewolf."" I had/have no idea what this was/is so I asked if it was a furry-kind-of-thing.

I might as well have told her that her and her whole family should die or something like that. To say she was infuriated was an understatement. She threatened to leave me if i ever talked about it like that again and was extremely offended. at the end of the conversation she told me to look this stuff up myself. 

So I have two questions, if anybody can answer either of them that would be great:
1. Is this symptomatic of some underlying mental disorder? if it helps, she has a service dog for depression.
2. What could i look up to help inform me of what she is talking about? I want to be sympathetic  and be able to understand her better but havent had much luck with google.",21Apr2018,2
15,"I'm 19 [F] and living with my 23 year old boyfriend of a year and a half. I love him more than anything but I keep fucking things up and making mistakes that if his close friends and family knew of, they would tell him he's crazy for staying with me and should leave. I don't know what is wrong with me but I know something isn't right as I don't want to be a bad person and through making these mistakes and putting him through shit, it also hurts me and sends me into a further depressive state.

I was diagnosed with mild depression a couple years back but it worsened to the point I would get these things I called ""depressive episodes"" which consisted of me either feeling numb and nothing at all or feeling like nothing mattered and I didn't care about anything or anyone and just wanted to self destruct. These 'episodes' could either last a couple hours or a few days to a week. 

6 months into my relationship I cheated on him with an ex after drinking a good bit and being high at the same time. I had an 'episode' and couldn't see at the time that my actions would hurt others as well as myself. Immediately after the deed was done, I went home and couldn't understand why I had done it at all. I felt (and still do to this day), ashamed, disgusted and hated myself even more. Obviously when my boyfriend found out, he broke up with me and I have never wanted to kill myself as much as I did that day. The only thing that stopped me was the possibility of seeing him again.

It was difficult to move past but we did and got back together. Fast forward a bit , I struggled with substance abuse. I was taking mdma and didn't see it as an issue as it wasn't something I did often until it brought on quite bad anxiety. I was feeling more depressed than I had been due to shit going on with my family and moving out from home, i wanted an escape for a little while so I got drunk at my friends and invited a guy (who at the time I thought was a good friend) over because he was saying he was bored and it would be good to catch up. I also thought he would end up hooking up with my other friend. We decided we were going to take mdma (just myself and my female friend). After taking the stuff all I can remember is snapping out of it and 'waking up' naked, in bed with my two friends who were still going at it. I went in for an hour long shower and then proceeded to have the worst panic attack I have ever had in my life. Because of shit that had happened before, I thought my boyfriend would leave me if I told him about it. I hid it from him, as well as hiding the fact I had taken mdma and then coke after that (he had asked me to stop and I had lied to him and gotten myself into a situation). He looked through my phone and found out what had happened and decided to stay with me because I couldn't remember it even happening and the guy who i thought was my friend had done this when he wasn't sober but not drunk and had done it to get back at me because when i was 16 i told him i didnt want to be anything more than friends. 

He has also found flirty messages on my phone that I have sent to other guys that I have no recollection of sending half of because I've been under the influence.

My boyfriend doesn't trust me and rightly so, I don't trust myself. I know who I want to be but I can't help being impulsive and making these shit decisions. It breaks my heart to see what i have put him through. He is too good for me and if it was one of my close friends in his shoes I would have told them to leave the relationship. I have convinced myself I am a bad person but my boyfriend thinks I am not and there is something more to it than that because he can't understand why I have hurt him so many times but sees I am remorseful and sees the pain it brings me because I honestly don't understand it myself. He thinks i may have BPD as the way i act seems to fit the description and wants me to go to the doctors to find out if I possibly do.

He has given me a 'last chance' kind of deal, I'm going to go into therapy again and try and sort my shit out but I am so worried he is going to leave me or im going to fuck up again.

If anyone has taken the time to read this, thank you. I just had to ven't and I don't really know what to do or what to believe bout myself. I don't know if I am just a shit person or something is actually wrong. ",21Apr2018,1
16,"Long story short my doctor things my sleep problems are my body exhibiting anxiety and I believe that the source of my anxiety is my husband's constant anger and blow ups at everyone and everything.

It's like when one little thing goes wrong it's like everything in the world sucks and he yells and I have to listen to this anger and try to make him feel better... It feels like my life revolves around making the world a better place for him.  

I love him more than anything in this world but it is not healthy for me to constantly worried about the next meltdown.

Example--one night after he'd had a few beers he couldn't get a video game to play so he got down about that, so then he tried to get it to play on the big tv and that wouldn't work so he was like ""why does everything suck all the time"" and he ranted and raved about this all night.  The constant anger spiral that night finally got to me and I cried and asked him to please let it go I can't take anymore that night---then he says ""i'm sorry for talking"" and ""I'm sorry for ruining your night.""  So then I feel even worse for saying anything about it.

Tonight we went to a sporting event, I had a wonderful time except our team lost.  Then we were stuck in major traffic for about an hour. He ranted and raved about how it sucked, how he'd never do that again, then he wanted food and they were only taking cash and so he was just angry the whole ride home.  I'm just yea it sucks but damn do we have to rant and rave about it for over an hour?

I am trying to create a new safe space for people to open up about their turbulent emotions, their traumas, their destructive behaviors without feeling embarrassed or feeling like they are a burden or feeling like no one will understand \-\- thus, ideally, creating a sort of domino\-like effect wherein people will feel more comfortable talking about such things instead of bottling them up &amp; letting them destroy them from the inside out.

My desire to start this movement has been brewing since childhood. I never met my grandfather, he committed suicide in his car with the exhaust fumes. In my pre\-teen years, my favorite uncle committed suicide by hanging himself in the barn at my grandma's house. In 2010, I attempted suicide by slicing my wrist, downing 30 Valiums with a bottle of red wine. In 2014, my best friend committed suicide by jumping off the 28th floor of an apartment building. In 2016, I was 5150'd for attempting suicide again by downing a cocktail of 32 painkillers.

I've always been a bit of a loner since I was very small &amp; prone to deep dark depression from the age of 14. So naturally, I've always resonated with/been drawn to other outcasts/loners &amp; really *felt* for them &amp; tried to make efforts to make them feel less alone. I've also always gravitated toward ""troubled"" souls, souls that've gone through some ***shiettt***, if you know what I mean \-\- because I could relate emotionally &amp; also because I wanted to be there for them &amp; help in any way I could.

&amp;.. apparently those parts about me haven't changed one bit! Except that nowadays, I want to help people more than ever before &amp; actually make it my career I guess you could say. &amp; not by getting a certificate or degree in therapy or anything like that, I want to start **my own damn thing**.

That morning, the police came in my apartment, along with a social worker and EMT's. They all said they felt like I was fine, but I still had to go to the hospital anyways. They did blood pressure tests, had me speak to more people, then had me in a waiting area where some other psych patients also were for like an hour, they made me empty my pockets and they patted me down and took some of my things and didn't allow me to leave like even a little bit of the hallway (which I really didn't like, it felt like they were treating me like a criminal) with a security guard watching, administered a urine test, and then I spoke with a doctor. About 20 minutes later, a family member came to check me out and I left. 

I told about this to my friend and they said this is not standard procedure and that I was supposed to have been placed in 3-day suicide watch or something. If this is true, how come I was able to leave early? Was it because they felt like nothing was wrong with me?",21Apr2018,3

Onto the post.

Quick Background: Been treated \(pretty succesfully\) for anxiety, depression and most recently ADHD. I'm currently on sertraline and matoride both of which seem to be working.  There's some minor issues like I think the matoride isn't as effective before. That's fine, though. Apparently stims level out over a while so it's only a minor thing.

The Wall:  

I've been doing everything right.

* I've been keeping a bullet journal so I don't forget appointments, keep track of habits and a regular schedule.
* I have a fairly regular sleep schedule, always 7\-8 hours a night.
* I take my meds at the same time consistently. 
* I run half an hour every day with my dog in the woods.
* I drink at least 1\-2 liters of water a day. 
* I eat healthily, only junk food is a single packet of crisps and a small chocolate a day. 
* I've cut down on coffee, don't smoke or do drugs or drink beyond maybe a cider once in a blue moon. 
* My family is supportive. My friends are supportive.
* I have creative outlets.

And I feel like fucking shit.

Currently I'm unemployed and job\-hunting. I'm fortunate enough to have a few months of savings and living with parents so it's not an urgent need to jump into any job, but one I can hopefully like and is related to my degree.

I have the time and tools to work on my portfolio, apply for jobs and spend time on hobbies. I've managed to re\-do my portfolio and CV and all that jazz. It's objectively decent. Like, the work is good but I don't really feel anything about it.

I don't know. I keep hitting this wall where nothing feels enough. I can't do anything that's like productive or even marginally satisfying. The most I feel capable of doing beyond the rote self care routines listed above is starting blankly into space. I'm struggling to connect to anything I make, like I just can't create or think even then I cannot watch TV or movies. All I can manage is listen to podcasts whilst doing anything to keep my hands busy. Mostly fidgeting and refreshing reddit.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

43,"First thanks for reviewing this. I appreciate your time and any thoughts you might have on this.   
Is there a name for a feeling that you have explained something to others before or even before it happens? This is hard to explain in itself but I get this feeling several times a week when I am doing something that I have clearly done it and explained it already to someone else. For some reason it feels like ""reporting back"" and the people/person I reported it back to is not an enemy or in a position over me they (?) just want to know what is behind the things I do. It's sometimes reporting something I would not divulge to others but not necessarily shameful. A quick example would be going to purchase something as a gift for someone and as I approach the item in the store I have a super clear memory that I had explained buying it and why I bought it to someone in the past. A thought will come into my head of the memory of reporting it ""I got this for him because I knew he liked toy cars"". When I get these I have tried to focus on who I am speaking to but within the memory it's almost like I am in a stupor and reporting to someone I can't see. This feeling is clearly a conversation that happened in the past though. Like I am experiencing something I already did and reported back. Often it's something where I have reported back something secret or quasi-shameful that I would not tell others. The memory of reporting it back to someone in the past before it happened is so real to me though. It's a form of deja vu I would think but I can't really research this as I can't define what this feeling would be called. Thanks for reading and for any suggestions you might have. ",21Apr2018,3

My spouse has had some major anxiety issues  that leads into bouts of paranoia and psychosis for the entire time we’ve been together.

I’ve accepted her social anxiety issues (we don’t really have much of a life because of it) it’s hard to accept her paranoia when it takes hold though. She has a trigger list of words that is 3 miles long(it used to only be about 10) but when she triggers she starts turning everything into negativity’s on herself, projects all her insecurities into herself and then applies it to everyone around her.

She doesn’t have auditory hallucinations, but she will mishear or misunderstand things said and then make it negative and then slide into a fit of fear and disparity. Before she finally got help and got on meds she was convinced she had died and was in hell, that I was trying to kill her or make her crazy. 

We got pregnant last year (our second) and she went off her meds in September. She was pretty balanced on her meds but would still have moments and everything was fine until around December.  

Since December there were 4 or 5 “breakdowns” that she had, that I was able to talk her out of eventually. One was at work(she is a contract merchandiser for local chains)which she shared that she believes that she has been put on a hit list to kill her and everyone was involved like a game. That issue caused her to go ahead and go on leave.

Fast forward to the birth. She went in for checkup and to err on the side of caution they induced her, birth went great and other than being a little small baby is awesome. 

2 days in to the stay she broke. Was rambling about things that were irrational or made no sense then went into she can’t take care of the baby, she’s no good for him etc. I got help, they couldn’t bring her out so we got sent to the er(she had self discharged but baby was still patient so they couldn’t do anything for her)

We sat in the er for close to 7 hours before an assessment could be done. She had ups and downs. At one point she came out of it completely and was totally lucid and with it. Talked about how bad of a “break” that was. We talked, I joked around made her laugh etc. nurse from nursery came to check on us and had said baby is fine, he’s being spoiled and loved. She broke the second she heated spoiled(that’s a bad word to her) and never came back out of it. Thought she was going to be killed. Then would think she is being put in jail. Kept saying what are they going to do with my organs.

She was admitted to the psych ward at the hospital. Visiting her every day. Yesterday was hard. She is so sick and lost. She is going on about god and she has to confess her sins (we are agnostic) she did confess a sin to one of the nurses... that she keeps a dirty house! To top it all off she still feels that they are trying to kill her, so getting meds in her to relax her and get her on the track to sanity is gonna be difficult. 

This may be rambling  nonsense but I’m close to losing myself as well. I have a newborn and an 11 year old. I’m worried about losing my job. If I didn’t have such awesome parents (who live next door to me and where me and the kids are staying now) I’d be in trouble 

I’m carrying a lot of guilt. I feel like her mental health was not handled well. She sees a nurse practitioner for her med refills etc and I feel like he whole situation was mishandled so poorly just taking her off her anti psychotic (zyprexxa and other stuff) and just giving her Zoloft. We had just recently gotten in to see a psychologist but wasn’t much could be done until baby comes.

I have never known someone personally who has lost a loved one so close, and now I feel like I should help in some way or another. What is unclear, still, is if help is even wanted in cases like this. And how subtle or ""aggressive"" should it be?

I can imagine someone in his situation is in an incredibly difficult emotional state. Usually I am quite good at really understanding the emotions someone experiences, but since the death of a close loved one is so powerful and sensitive, I wanted to get advice from people who know more than me.

Obviously everyone is different, but my thought process here is that getting advice from a large group can allow me to build a picture of what goes through ones mind after such an experience. For example: What do you feel during the weeks soon after? Do you just want to shut yourself out from the real world and only communicate with close family? When you are forced to return to reality and work/school how do you feel about social interactions? Are you more irritable? Do you have a clouded mind? Are you prone to snap?

And how would you want other people to interact with yourself? Do you actually appreciate condolences and sympathy? Or would you rather everything be as normal and push out all thoughts of grief during everyday life?

I really doubt I thought of everything and would certainly appreciate more ideas from people who have gone through a similar experience or helped someone else. Thank you for taking the time to read this and, hopefully, answer and help me out!",21Apr2018,1

- Terrible concentration, like, god awful concentration. So bad that I can't think or do anything, and have trouble speaking as a result of it sometimes. This also ties in with me having terrible short term memory, i.e. forgetting things after 10 seconds, and failing to do basic instructions.

- Haven't ever been happy- I've only ever felt an odd sense of euphoria/overconfidence sometimes which lasts between 20 minutes and an hour, and all the other time I either feel sad or feelingless. I also seem to be rather introverted. As a result of this, I'm always pessimistic and honestly think about killing myself every day. This also ties into me feeling very tired or faint almost all the time, as well as frequent headaches. I also sortof view the world in shades of grey.

- I occasionally have fake memories- memories of things which didn't happen. I sometimes (rarely) think my dreams are real.

- I sometimes hear voices (usually, whispering my name) every few days or so, can sometimes be two voices talking to each other so fast I cannot understand what they are saying. I also sometimes see odd lights, or feel invisible bugs crawling up my body.

- I can sometimes watch animals being tortured and not feel a thing. Sometimes, not always.

- I sometimes pace for up to an hour before doing certain things, usually absorbed in thinking about anything really.

- I have this feeling people know what I'm thinking, and I also believe (I cannot tell myself otherwise) that all my family and teachers are plotting (and actively trying) to deceive me and control my mind.

- When I think, I often think so fast I can't concentrate on anything or so slowly that doing anything is hard.

- I have intrusive thoughts, and often my thought process gets derailed which can cause problems, especially when doing tests. I had an intrusive thought as a train was coming that said ""NOW! Jump in front of the train!"" as I was waiting for a train. It wasn't a voice, and I even moved towards the edge of the platform... it was very confusing.

- I feel like the government, but more so tech companies are watch my every move, and people on reddit are as well (hence why I'm using an alt + tor). However I think this is correct as it has lots of evidence to support it.

- I have a lot of trouble conversing with people and sometimes act very strangely, however sometimes can paint a perfectly normal picture to people. I'm also very reclusive, and sometimes don't talk much or at all.

- Sub-average intelligence, taking a long time to figure out things and have some other problems relating to it as listed above.

58,"Hi

I am not 100% sure if this is the right place to post this, sorry if it's not.. Okay basically... this is my 6th or 7th account on Reddit and I keep deleting them.. it's all related but I have a problem i need help to overcome/stop it controlling my life before it's too late..

Ok. Here goes. It's really bad but I have an unhealthy fetish... basically I have this overwhelming desire to be eaten, either by other people (cannibalism) or by animals.. when i look in the mirror i just see a piece of meat to be eaten D:

I know it's sick but it's starting to affect me day to day. Please don't judge me D:

I basically really get pleasure from uploading pics of myself to the internet (including here) I even went to that cannibals subreddit to upload pics of myself ""showing off the meat"" and stuff. Ugh. Okay I am just going to say it, I masturbate like 10 times a day recently and it's getting out of hand.

I have been in contact with ""communities"" in the dark web that involve things you know? With people that actually would want to eat me.. which you know involves me being killed... i only just told my mother about this and she is basically terrified.

I have tried and tried to control it but i really just sometimes lose control and sooner or later i'm gonna end up dead in someone's belly and the sad/sick thing is that really fucking turns me on.

Please help me. What can I do? is there medication for this kind of stuff or anything? D:

Btw saying this on a public forum is terrifying to me but i have created this account SPECIFICALLY for this purpose so at least i have some anonymity (I hope).

59,"I want a 💯 % cure for my anhedonia and I want it to NEVER return because that was my life before. The ECT I did seems to have given me that only temporarily with windows here and there.

Unfortunately I cannot tolerate medication whatsoever. 1 week on Selegiline was enough to make me somewhat more anhedonic  and 1 day on Nortriptyline is enough to give me horrific restlessness that I cannot tolerate, and also emotionally numbs me which is very scary and panic inducing. SSRIs are a complete no-no. 

Anyways I also don't want to be on medication because I *want* the exact same brain I had prior to PT141 inducing all this. Else I don't see life worth living unless I can live it like before. That means high and fast cognition, normal moods, and most importantly absolutely 0 anhedonia. 

I have been to therapy and it does not stop the anhedonia from recurring whatsoever. There are no triggers. ECT  made me completely better but it didn't last and I only feel like half assed better most of the time with windows of feeling 80+%.

And I have quite bad anxiety over the anhedonia fluctuations. 

Ive tried Mindfulness therapy and sadly it also does not really work--my symptoms don't seem to get cured via observing my surroundings and breathing etc. 

TLDR: I want to be the SAME EXACT person as I was before with all the same proficiencies at school, work, social situations and I don't see life worth living unless I am that. How do I get to that? Therapy and meds both don't help. ECT helped only temporarily.

61,"This is going to be really hard to sum up but here goes so I never used to feel like this when I was younger but now almost every little thing annoys me or has some effect on me in some way. For example I work retail and I easily get annoyed/flustered at someone when someone asks me to throw their trash away or if someone’s tone is too assertive or if someone looks at me in a certain way, every little thing I would consider myself far too observant of pretty much things that the average person wouldn’t pay mind too. Everything ranging from a slight brush from someone walking past to someone walking too slow in front of me. I could be reading something and I become emotionally perturbed by it or even music effects me. Another thing which is kind of unrelated are my emotions as I get older my emotions are becoming more and more unstable and complex. For example I’ve cried or been upset about strangers deaths to the point of having full blown panic attacks (could be someone I read about in a newspaper or someone who I don’t know personally but I’ve had an encounter with) and I’ll think about it for days to weeks. I wont allow myself to get close to anyone because I become really attached to them whether it be platonically or romantically because I worry about them dying or something bad happening to them and it hurts so much when they leave my life for whatever reason this is why I remain cordial with mostly everyone. I get jealous when I see other people having fun, when I see couples or people making achievements in their lives I try to be happy for them but the jealously overpowers then feeling of happiness (actually it’s like a mixture of happiness and jealousy).I become very jealous in terms of looks too(very insecure).  I don’t want to be jealous but for some reason I am and I detest it. I become annoyed if I see someone else is annoyed or displaying a negative emotion it ruins my whole day, or if I see someone deliberately do something wrong on purpose it infuriates me. I feel guilty all the time even for something as small as killing an insect I feel a strong amount of guilt for.I feel like I have other people living inside me with different emotions and like someone else’s emotions are inside of me tbh it’s so eerie. Why am I like this? :( Too many emotions to handle. I’m very reserved and introverted and i could be having a normal conversation and someone says something very triggering and it agitated me to the point where I’ll think about it for days and it’ll make me feel indifferent towards that person I don’t really talk to anyone one because my emotions kick in and like to control my life. 

Sorry for the incohesiveness.  ",21Apr2018,2
62,"My STBX and I were married for two years, and I lived with her abroad. Although I didn't have family there, she and that home were my life.

We struggled especially in the second year of marriage, with some issues stemming from earlier on as well. These had to do with my distrust, verbal aggression, and depression/PTSD.

I became emotionally abusive, and there were a couple of shared physical altercations. Her anger exacerbated some of my issues, but only I'm responsible for my own actions.

At that time I was in therapy, but perhaps the right questions weren't being asked, I was unable to not only see the detriment of my actions, but also the cause.

By the time that I had requested couples therapy, and we had agreed to it, I could tell that her heart had shifted inward. That she was no longer in love with me.

We were unable to attend any sessions, the marriage dissolved before that. And she couldn't look at me the same, nor touch me anymore.

There were times in the past, when we would argue, that I'd wondered if I were still in love with her. I'd realized that outside our struggles, she was the kindest and most beautiful person that I had ever met.

Soon she had developed feelings for someone at her workplace, as well as a need to simply be in her own mind, her own life, for her own wellbeing—as it should have been since the outset.

But she was always caring for me. Now I fully realize the consequence of my personal and projected failings. She had been the first person in my life who truly loved me, without condition.

I'm not sure how to move on. My mind is stuck in regret, rumination, pain for having hurt someone so much that they would be compelled to abandon me and our relationship. And that they may carry their own personal trauma for the rest of their life.

Since meeting her, I haven't worked due to service connection for my mental health. I know that this hasn't helped. And I'm present living at my parents' home, until I can figure out what to do.

Moving forward is necessary, I know. But I cannot foresee myself living alone—I'm afraid of isolation, of quiet moments without familiar people around me. The thought of living with strangers has be paralyzed.

I made the mistake of visiting her social media some time ago, when our engagement and wedding photos appeared on my feed after she'd reactivated her account. She's moved on, painted the house that we once shared, seems happy and free.

To understand that space now, in retrospect, I comprehend that although I felt separated from my own country and loved ones, my home was never truly here. It was with her in that space.

It's gone. I cannot undo that. I cannot shift the situation nor compel someone to understand what's best for me, if it runs in conflict with their best interests.

And yet I can't move on. Therapy has helped only insofar as to reveal in me the depth of my issues that caused this to begin with. So the practical need is to get well for me.

This sadness won't relent, however. This regret. Guilt. Terrible weight of seeing someone whom I love so dearly, and fully, move on without me by their side—as our vows assured we would.

I had failed to uphold my end, for the necessary love and support. And now I'm unable to love and support myself enough to make sense of how to handle this all. The pain isn't subsiding; it's getting worse.

It's as though I never existed at all.",21Apr2018,3
63,"I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Generalized Anxiety, and Major Depressive Disorder after a medical complication with my ACL reconstruction that left me in the hospital for 3 months. I bled out on the table and nearly died from a reaction to the morphine. I remember the nurse asking me if I was in pain, and I said yes, so she gave me a small amount of morphine and left. This lead to me going in to tachycardia and I don’t remember after that.  I know that my mom said the defibrillators had to be used. That was almost 3 years ago. I went to counseling and got prescribed medication. Lately I have been noticing some strange things. I have actually notice this since the surgery, but never knew how to word it, so here it goes. I live with my fiancé. When we go to bed, I am fine, but if I wake up and he isn’t next to me I get really sad. Really depressed I guess you could say and anxious. I know he is in the other room watching tv, but I feel alone. It isn’t just with him either. When my mom would take care of me after my surgery, the same thing would happen. She was not the best caretaker and would promise me she would watch me (because I was afraid I would die in my sleep), but I would wake up and she would be gone. She would only come to visit me once a day to let me use the restroom and eat. Then I would be alone the rest of the day (I didn’t live with my fiancé at the time). I realized that she did not give me a secure comfort, so I might have attachment issues. But my question is, what is causing me to feel so upset when I wake up alone? I know I am not alone, but because I did not wake up and see anyone, I panic. Is it because of the inconsistencies with my mom after surgery? Is it my PTSD? I just wanted to get to the bottom of it, to stop it because I can’t keep waking up feeling like I am alone and depressed and panicking.  I am going back to my therapist to discuss it, I just wanted to see if anyone else experienced this or knew a better way to explain it.",21Apr2018,2

65,"I am determined to get to the bottom of what is wrong with me, I don't really know how to convey this, so here is a list of things I do that are worrying, I am very self-aware of these traits. Sometimes my mom and dad call me a narcissist, I think I might have anger issues or bipolar disorder or some shit. My dad is very, very physically abusive if that makes any difference. I used to have childhood anorexia. I am a 16 y/o girl.

-Explosive around Family, if Parents do something/say something that upsets me, I become really angry and verbally abusive.

-Really different in social situations then I am at home, I am really violently angry and stressed at home. But with my friends at school, I just flip that off. I don't get angry with people who aren't my family and am described as ""very chill"" 

-Depressive episodes, some weeks or days I don't shower and don't do much, I kinda just lie on my bed and watch youtube and contemplate my life.

-I often have sleepless nights or stay up until ungodly hours.

-In addition to these depressive episodes, I cry a lot during them and just generally get really stressed and angry. I think I cry out of frustration though, not sadness. These tears are usually about something I am worried about in the future or frustrated about within the present moment.

-Despite being mostly chill around my friends, I notice I attract a lot of overemotional/clingy friends and I end up getting really secretly annoyed by them and can kinda be bitchy to them sometimes
-Gets annoyed easily

-I sometimes lie about really trivial things, especially at home, not to people outside of home.

-I am very emotionally detached, I don't experience many feelings and I don't really have much attachment to anyone.

- I have a lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms

- I kind of just do what I want to do and I don't care if anyone else hates it, I just do what I need for myself initially.

- I am very blunt and honest, I can be an asshole at times.

All in all, what is wrong with me? I know there is something wrong. I need help, I need to fix it. I can't get a therapist because my parents are against the idea and they think Jesus will fix all of my problems.

66,"Okay so this is complicated. 
Ever since I was little I’d have “hallucinations”. (In quotes because I’m not really sure what they are and hallucinations is the closest word that I could find). I’d feel like I was being tossed around the room or that I was being cut in half. 
When I talked to my therapist about it she said they weren’t real hallucinations but something else. However she wouldn’t tell me what they really were.

My mood changes are more frequent and intense than what my doctor suggested could be possible. My emotions and mood can change 10 times in a minute. I'm not even exaggerating. I have debilitating social/general anxiety and a big dislike (disgust even) of people. Sometimes I feel nothing, even when I should, even when I'm not in shock or whatever. Like funerals, they do nothing to me at all. Crying people, having to let go of someone I liked etc. I feel nothing. Maybe even boredom. I also cannot love. I've never had a crush on someone, never had a boyfriend/girlfriend, never had a kiss or sex. And I don't even want to. Its weird, but it doesn't bother me. I can love animals though. I also have homicidal and suicidal thoughts a lot, but I'm not violent at all. I've been told that BPD is usually diagnosed in the late teens? But I have been feeling like I do for as long as I remember, probably from about 8 years old.
