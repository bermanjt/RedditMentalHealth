0,"I will try to recall everything that has happened with my mother so far. My mom has really gone off the deep end in the past few days. She thinks people are watching her and breaking into our apartment when we're asleep stealing our stuff and spiking our food with chemicals. Last night she woke me up several times. First she wanted to take my temperature because I felt warmer than usual, then she woke me up claiming she saw a red dot on my hand. The other times were just her saying how frustrated she is with people stalking her. My mom has health problems and can't work so she never leaves the apartment so how could she have anybody stalking her? A few months ago she said she saw an alien walk through the wall and growl at her and shouted at it and it shrunk. Then she said she saw a different one but in her dreams and it called her ""friend"" but she heard this in the real world and it woke her up. Next was an alien going after me while I was in the living room with huge feet. I never see or hear any of this stuff. The final incident is an alien watching me while I was asleep. All this comes from her I never heard or seen any alien in the apartment. I believe my poor mother suffers from severe paranoia or some other form of mental illness. She asked me to download an app that detects radiation because she says her body gets hot for no reason and claims it to be radiation leaks somewhere in our apartment. The app actually detected high levels from the microwave and asked me to throw it away. She wears tinfoil around her sometimes no joke and please don't think this is funny, my mom is literally falling apart right in front of me. She also says the people living around us are paid by the government or some other force to keep an eye on her. Last week she yelled at someone from the window thinking they were talking about her. The same day she peeked out the window and saw a helicopter and said it was watching us. Today she said somebody pricked her with a needle while she was asleep and believes the needle was tipped with some sort of disease.  There's also too many things that has happened for me to remember but I will say this. She didn't have the easiest life growing up, she was constantly bullied at school and at home by my grandfather. He's been dead for almost 10 years but continues to talk about how bad of a parent he was to her almost everyday. Maybe this has something to do with it? Also she thinks some guy she dated 25 years ago is the one doing all of this to her. He cheated on her and i'm guessing she really loved him so it devastated her. I have already told my mom that I believe what she is telling me but I also said that she sees and hears stuff that isn't actually there. All of this is very draining she gets very angry with me if I don't believe her. Please help if I don't know if I should call a mental institute or what. ",09Aug2018,1,
1,"I just started my second year of high school and I’m feeling extremely stressed and hopeless and like I won’t be able to get through this. When I think about school, I cry and my limbs get so heavy and I feel like I’m suffocating. I have never felt this way about anything in my life before. I have cried almost every night since school has started up again and the constant demand of 3+ hours of homework a night leaves me feeling depressed and honestly suicidal. I am so stressed about making good grades so that I will be able to get into a good college but I’m worried that I won’t make it to the end of high school. I would never kill myself but the thought has entered my mind before I instantly get rid of the absurd idea because I know I have more to live for but I just can’t seem to see the bigger picture to my life. I know I need to just focus on getting through this year of school and getting the best grades that I can achieve for myself but I’m afraid that my mental health is declining and I don’t want it to have an impact on my future. This post is kind of going no where but I guess I’m just asking for advice on what to do and how to get through it...",09Aug2018,2,
2,"I feel like my mind is just always somewhere else.  I can be talking to someone and halfway into a conversation I just start forgetting what was just said.  Not because I'm bored or uninterested per se.  But almost like literally everything is boring and uninteresting. I've been to a few psychiatrists/psychologists- some said I have anxiety and some said ADD and some said depression.  I've tried medication for anxiety, but that made me hit a daily low point of depression, and ADD medication made my anxiety spiral out of control until I raged like a maniac.... 

 I also have trouble actually accomplishing anything.  I happen to be fairly smart and capable, so I can get things at work done really quickly and easily.  My last couple of bosses have said that they almost don't know what to do with me because I finish everything so fast and its all done right.  But I can't help but feel like if I were able to use my brain like I know I am capable of doing, I wouldn't be at a job where I'm barely scraping by financially and I'm bored out of my mind most of the time.  Honestly, I'm not trying to act like I am hyper intelligent or brag.  Really what I do now is mostly internet research and inserting client-specific information into a generic form that is already created.  But the type of nose-to-the-grindstone work that I feel like I crave is exactly the kind of work that I feel like I can't focus on enough to do. I grew up wanting to be a lawyer or a teacher- both of which you need to think on your toes for.   I also can't find motivation to do really simple things most days.  I'm working on that slowly- things like washing the dishes or putting away laundry. But more often than not I push it to the next day.   I'm basically at the point of being able to scrape by as a functional human by doing the bare minimum, but I know that I'm meant to live for more than the bare minimum.  I look at this and see that I'm not cripplingly depressed or anxious or add, but i feel like there are aspects of the lot of them and I don't know how to solve all 3 without medication making the other 2 a million times worse.  In any case, I can't keep spending money on psychiatrists because... like I said- I'm barely scraping by.

This turned into more of a rant than I guess I meant it to. But does anyone else experience this type of.... fog? What has helped you?",09Aug2018,2,

When I was younger (4 or 5), I was sleeping with my dad in my parent's room (mom was at work I think) and he groped my breast. He was asleep, and did not do it purposefully. I think he woke up and moved his hand away? I forgot about this until a while ago, but now it's been an intrusive thought that pops in randomly and it is very annoying. How can I get rid of this intrusive thought? If it is considered an intrusive thought. Thank you. My relationship with my dad is fine right now and I love him, it's just this keeps popping into my mind and then I feel weird.

6,"Looking for some insight and advice if anyone is willing to give it. 

So I’ve always had mental health problems, but I’ve always had a good hold of reality, my sense of self and my direction in life - even if I am miserable for a lot of the time, I still know where I’m going in life and never double guessed it - I’ve always been proud of that too, it’s what’s been holding me together. 

I went off to a festival over the weekend and when I came home I completely broke down. Been crying for days. I feel completely devastated to be back in my life right now - at that festival I experienced happiness, people who loved me, and a long needed break from an extremely busy summer. Upon coming home I feel absolutely gutted. I feel as though my life is horrible, I don’t want to go to med school anymore even though I’ve just spend 4 months studying for the acceptance test! I don’t want to go back to university, I don’t want to live in my city anymore - all I want to do is move away to a new town and start a new life. I’ve had that post festival depression before, but this is unbelievable- it’s like I’ve had my eyes opened to how nice life can be, then had it grasped away right in front of my eyes. 

Has anyone felt anything like this? I almost feel like I see the reality of my life clearer now, and as I start to lose this feeling I’m not getting used to my old life I’m just becoming numb to the reality of what it is. I know I’ve had some bad mental health issues in the last four years at uni. suicidal thoughts for two years and even self-mutilation for a few month more recently, so there is something wrong - I’ve never been able to take that seriously though, for some reason even though I see scars down my arm I still can’t bring myself to believe I’m actually depressed or something., but ever since coming back I’ve realized just how fucked up that really is. 

Last year was kinda similar, when I got back I cried for a week, but I just thought it was because I took a few too many drugs, this time however I was extremely careful - even hardly drank. I know comparing my life to that of the festival is irrational - life isn’t a festival and it never will be. But I just don’t understand how horrible it all suddenly seems. I’ve done so many amazing things and worked so hard through the school year, but mentally I just keep getting sicker and sicker. 

Have I been deluding myself? Is it possible that maybe those mental health issues I’ve had are actually stemming from me pushing myself too hard, thinking I’m going after what I want, when I’m really just replacing happiness with reward from a relentless urge to push myself every day from a never satiated need to prove to myself that I’m not worthless. Could it be possible this is truely a wake up call, or am I just a little sad that I cant have that much fun more often, maybe I’m just blowing this out of proportion - has anyone else been here, how to do you cope? 

Your Advice would be so much appreciated. ",09Aug2018,1,

10,"I am recovering from what I suppose would be called a nervous breakdown. I am a full time student under a lot of stress and recently lost my job due to a build up of anger and depression. 

I thought with the lack of job I could really push myself through summer classes but I just crumbled. I spent 2 years prior to this going through depressive episodes off and on. Bouts of crying for reasons I don't fully understand. General sense of emptiness. Episodes of rage at myself or others or situations beyond my control. 

I saw counselors for a while but they didn't seem to want to touch certain aspects of how I was feeling. When I mentioned medication or my mood swings they said they could refer me to a specialist but that this wasn't generally in their area of expertise. I can't afford insurance and, since I'm married, make ""too much"" money for the state funded plans. I used to take medication and that was cool. I stopped for reasons that are too stupid and trivial to get into. 

Basically I just blew everything off. I dropped out of summer semester, stopped looking for a job, quit doing anything and everything that made me the least bit queasy. I asked the last counselor I saw to please put me on my meds and she said she couldn't do that (not the right kind of doctor) and then asked me why I was upset. I was upset because I felt like I was dying. All I could think about was death. I wondered what it was like, feared it, obsessed over it, thought about suicide, and was afraid I was dying of some terminal illness. I cried for hours, stopped sleeping, kept pacing around, I was obsessed with the idea of my hair falling out. 

I don't really know what's going on with me. Sometimes I'm scared I'm not going to make it. Sometimes I remember how resilient and resourceful I am. Through all of this, I just want to know what's wrong with me so that I can go about fixing it. I have been able to talk myself off of so many ledges but this one seems especially persistent.

11,"Hi there.. So... I generally suck at these types of things. I'm crap at asking for help, and I can't do that *opening up* thing. In fact, I'm usually on the other side of this, helping other people with advice and discovering truths about myself along the way.. But I guess I'm tired of discussing my problems with myself for once. I don't do this often, so prepare for a lot.

I guess let me start with my predicament. I am a 23 yr old, non-traditional, transfer student transferring from a small-town community college to a prestigious, well-renowned Liberal Arts University. It was an obstacle in itself getting myself motivated enough to apply and get accepted. I've always had the capacity, I know that. I know what I'm capable of, but sometimes I talk myself out of that.. I can convince myself rather easily that I'm worthless and that's something I've always struggled with and never found a reason for. 

I met with my advisor today, and I just got some weird vibes. I felt rushed, so I couldn't even grasp the situation I found myself in entirely. But in 30 minutes I could grasp these three realities... 

1) I'm considered an out-of-state student despiting living here for the last 10 years, due to 3 months of Sophomore high school (for which I was never accredited anyways) at a high school out of state (That's what you get for trying to reconnect with a POS father)

2) Transfer students get the short stick at University, including class availability, housing options, and more! Meaning I get last pick on everything.

3) Some of my classes won't transfer, meaning I would be here longer than 2 years which isn't only undesireable.. it's probably not even possible

I'm putting myself through school. I have a great financial aid package, but I am not receiving support from a single family member, friend, or organization. I am paying for everything, out my very own pocket. Loans and all. 

I was relying on a new low-income grant program to cover costs, and now that I'm qualified as out of state I can't receive that grant. There is no way to appeal the out-of-state classification, I've basically already done that. 

So.... here I am. Hopeful college transfer who just quit his full-time job of 2 years to get into a prestigious university. Signed a lease and everything yayy!!! 

Now.. costs are up, classes are gone, and I'm stuck to pick between two useless majors instead of what I actually want to do. I also feel like my advisors and so-called ""peer supports"" are judging me behind my back (although that could be the self-diagnosed social anxiety kicking in).

I guess I just feel cheated already, and classes haven't even started. Yet, I have a lease to uphold starting later this month. I am living there whether I like it or not, so there's no backing out now. All of this on top of my family, social, and daily life, which just isn't good guys...

Before I quit for school, I was coming home from work and doing nothing but smoking weed, playing video games, and watching tv. Typical 23-yr old sure, but I've never been a typical kid. I don't want to be, so this drives me nuts when I do this. And I battle myself over it over and over until I drive myself nuts. Then I grew numb to that routine. So that ""dull, nondescriptive"" funk.. I guess I just described it the best I can.

As for the family.. Jesus where do I start. My brother sexually assaulted me as a child, my mother slept with my best friend, my father and I don't even talk, and my grandfather whom we all loved just died last month. We barely talk about, or have talked about any of this with anyone.. and even when I bring this shti up to a therapist (which I don't see often) it's like they won't touch it with a 10-foot pole or something. So... not good.

I don't have a social life.. so there's that covered. I have one friend. I shit you not, one friend. The brother of the friend my mother slept with. And even he is an arrogant, blissfully disrespectful dolt. 

I guess right now... with my last hope of University education slowing falling apart before my eyes.. I don't even know what to do, or what to say. I'm fucking lost. I have no compass anymore. I don't even know what I want to study anymore.

I'm a fully-functional pyschosomatic ingrate and I feel like I'll never make another human connection again. I feel like everything I've worked towards is falling apart. I feel like I've been thrusted into this world with no fucking guidebook, and everyone else expects me to do the impossible. I feel like the unwanted asset. I feel like I'm very depressed... 

I know this is a lot, and I'm not really asking for advice or anything. But I guess I just needed to write it down somewhere. I'm not suicidal, I could never do that... really I couldnt. But the thought has crossed my mind wayy to many times lately, and I don't think I have anyone left I can trust to tell that too. So here I am. ",09Aug2018,2,

Hi i'm 18. I was diagnosed with OCD as a child, and I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder as an older teen. I grew up in an environment that was open minded and understanding of mental illness, and (probably not always a positive thing) a mom who was a psych major for a good part of my life, so I took from her a small interest and love for psychology. I was aware of symptoms well before I started to truly worry about having schizophrenia. I'm not worried I will develop it in the future, no- I'm worried i'm developing it now or already have.

I find myself pretty capable of self introspection, thus awareness, and I have an understanding of mental health enough to keep myself rational. In fact, keeping myself rational can primarily be attributed to seeing my symptoms as medical and addressing it so. 

Here is some back story about my symptoms and experiences of what I worry to be schizophrenia:

*At 14 I was hospitalized multiple times as I was taken by panic attacks where I'd wheeze and cry in the corner. And I was, in retrospect, very delusional. It's dark to me but for instance I thought this creature from a dream I had watched me, and I believed he was something embedded in my subconscious- another part of me that wasnt me- who made me think bad things. I was hospitalized on day after a night where I sat in my room terrified thinking that the shadows my laptop charger light had cast wanted to hurt me, and due to OCD I had intrusive thoughts that made me believe I was dangerous(I was not). I would stay up 2-3 days straight because when night came I was scared and felt awake in a nightmare. I would coop into my room unable to open my door because what was on the other side of it. I also had weird immature delusions like: worried people I knew online actually knew me in person and knew who I was, but they all conspired against me and my internet life. This is also when I started to ""think I heard a voice."" It was much different from the voices I hear now as in it wasnt completely there. Like... thinking you left the faucet on because you THINK you hear it but it could just be another noise. I also began to have sleep paralysis around this time.

*Voices have developed at a steady rate over the past few years. From what I described above, to- well I actually made a list i'll copy and paste:
2014:
-Not actually hearing things but ""feeling"" like i had and trying to listen
-The only real hallucinations I had vividly happened when I was drifting off. Something like ""AH!"" or ""how was your day honey?""

2015: 
-Not actually hearing just like 2014
-Drifting off hallucinations becoming nightly, rather than on occasion, and more clear. Many nights it was hard to sleep through.

2016:
-Same as 2015
-But started hearing my name be called more than average
-Nearing end of 2016 I would hear random voices saying things that had to do with the day and often in the voices of people I socialized with. Only when I was alone. Could range from mind interruptions to a storm cloud.
-Hard to read or type/write because ""they"" would read after me or interrupt me reading

2017:
-Drifting off voices get so bad I struggle to sleep through them. Even if i'm not actually falling asleep theyd still happen as I had my eyes closed and tried.
-Starts happening in public rather than alone. In class or in the hall at school I would hear them say something.
-It started to become about what i'm doing. Ie: ""Is that your pencil?"" when I picked up my pencil from the ground
- My name being called still
-Always a storm cloud when i'm home alone after socializing
-Some things start to get mean and personal
-Some things scare me

2018:
-All the above
-More frequent 
-Could have up to two and a half weeks of it happening every day
-More annoying now

*The middle to end of 2017 and this year I suddenly got this onset of visual illusions and hallucinations, as you can call them. It started with the walls breathing or paintings swirling for hours so vividly like it was a part of reality. To faces in portraits contorting and changing expressions. To a 2d shadow of a tentical rising from behind a poster and ""licking"" the wall. And, as most people do, I see people standing in the corner of my eye but it's not the same as before. It's common. Daily. I would say 3 times a day I see a shadow of a man somewhere and when I look I make sense of it.

*The terror. Especially now- just terror. I have lived the past 3 or so days with the feeling as if someone jump scared me but that initial feeling of ""AHH OH GOD"" is there. Example: Last night I was drifting off to try to sleep but struggling as usual. I had the lights off- all of them (i'm very scared of the dark) then I felt the terror for no reason and attributed it to the corner of my room where I feel like something is there. And I jumped up in just fucking terror and sprinted to my door and swung it open and sprinted to the hall light breathing heavy like a little kid who thinks they saw a ghost.

*My mind feels weird. There was a certain day where if I use this as an example it can work well to show: I was out with friends. I felt like my head was in a bubble and I felt disconnected like I was in a dream and like my friends were not real in a way(I've felt that a couple times). I felt so disconnected and like I was in a bubble that I struggled to hear? Hear people talk. Also My mind felt like it was a cloud and swollen and I was scared. I caught myself but I had this weird belief a bug or poison had gotten in through my ear. I tried hard to remember how it could have gotten their. Its intention? To burrow inside and strip me of awareness and intelligence. I saw myself declining because of this bug and was scared- the  an hour into contemplation I was like ""that makes no sense."" Days later I brought it up to a friend to help rationalize me because I still worried. He was bewildered that i logically considered this possibility. Also this day I had a weird experience. Friends went to Wendy's. Each got a drink. Get to the car with my drink and suddenly I have 2 drinks. I get scared and confused ""why do I have your drink"" my friends look at me and laugh. Then they seem to realize i'm scared ""you cant be serious?"" It turns out my friend handed me his drink and I forgot seconds after our entire conversation. It was like ""Here hold this"" ""Okay, sure since you cant do it yourself dumbass- hey, how did I get two drinks?""

THERE IS SO MUCH MORE but I am tired and don't feel like using words. In fact words have been harder to use. I'm scared of having schizophrenia and my main reason to fear this is how it has developed over time and how it has gotten worse 

Also with my words it shows in my writing. I'm a writer and love it. 

Here is my writing from a few months ago:

""...I am to dance bedeviled 
As my heart is dear and shrill,
I am, to love, deep and depraved
Encumbered with temptation and will,
I heed not the harshness of the blurry field...

...I am, to love deep and engraved
As my heart is clear and still,
I do dance bedevilled 
As a winged diablo that flies to her,
I do claim my once lull words 
That I wrought with leery language in awe for her.""

""I endure the loneliest human pain;
As a stone wall from afar who aches
As the rose thorns writhe in between my cracks and quakes,
As jasmine flicks in a wind too far away,
As orchids curl above the farthest pond and shimmer in the day.

I await the most tender human fate;
To spin with another daubed in hues of pink,
To flutter with another with flowers and petals at our feet,
To pick away our thorns and caress where others could not reach,
To drink nectar together when our lips quake when they meet.""

The last thing I wrote and finished. A few days ago when that weird day happened(an entire poem actually)

The Flies

I cannot write, and I am scared.
Broken sentences wrap my head in fog,
and the fog seeps into the hall,
and shadows rise from the floor-
white. Legs bent and slender-
He swipes past the doorway with long claws.
Broken and unfilled inkwells in space-
Black is a vibrant light full of shades of eyes and
long limbs and tall shadeskulkers.

I feel my head has leaked, and I am lost.
Bleeding without blood my brain comes out,
and the bubble around my head is a blister,
and i feel people stuck in my ear canal-
clawing. like static and want to scream-
Dreaming ongoing inside out and dream.
Fuck! My heart and brain matter tangled-
Words are gnats and I am a paralyzed corpse and
I cannot catch them when I rot still.

I cannot find words, and I am scared.
Writing is a vinegar trap,
and the vinegar trap is rancid genius,
and the smell keeps the words in place-
Align. The gnats and eat them whole-
buzzing. But they are buzzing and in my ears and
I melt languid, rot-
The flies are stuck inside and they buzz in my ears and
I feel static in my head when I lay here or convulse and melt.

I feel stuck, and I buzz.
Zzzt. -are skulkers and stones,
and stones tile my head with vacancy,
and I am scared days that may come-
Empty. Zzt - can’t think zzt, zzt,-
Droning. Long droning flies at my heart and
my mind melts, I’m afraid-
The flies and I a corpse and in my ears -zzt-
One day they will eat-
Zzzzzzzzt-
all
    of me
and I am scared.

See, I think art is a huge look into the psyche but

I dont know the point of this. I am trying to get an appointment with my psychiatrist as my state has been too hard to handle but venting like this helps and I wonder what others think.

Is it valid of me to worry? A lot of people believe schizophrenics are unaware and vapid and yeah I get reassurance in that because i'm not unaware- but I think it's a stupid stigma.

While they have always been introverted/pessimistic, i have noticed these traits becoming more pronounced since college. Some increasingly odd behaviours include: 

-Cut off all friends and acquaintances.
- Claim that all the classmates in the grad program are spying on them/ conspiring against them in some way
- Accused me and our other sibling of being “evil” or “bullies” out of the blue. 
- Switched email addresses and phones because of fear they were compromised by hackers/tapped lines
- Thought someone was paying rent for them (when in actuality it was just a credit for overpaying on rent previously). 
- Changes conversation topics rapidly. Sometimes I’ll wake up to a long string of totally unconnected texts across various platforms (Facebook, snap, phone messages, etc)

Given that I don’t live nearby and they are extremely sensitive to perceived criticism, I’m not sure what to do. They are sort of self aware but the behaviour seems to be getting worse. Suggestions of therapy have not gone over that well. The school environment sounds like it is a poor fit but they have already delayed graduation and leaving would mean 30k+ of sunk cost. plus, I don’t even know if leaving would help or just accelerate the downward spiral. My parents are also super worried. Any thoughts would be appreciated. ",09Aug2018,2,
19,"My fiancé and I are fighting constantly (and not wedding fighting, like true relationship issues fighting) and my parents are supporting my brothers abusive relationship behaviors and my job is shit and I just feel like I can't handle it all. I'm slipping back into my dark place, I can feel it. I'm not motivated to do anything which is an early sign for me. I just want to run away because I already feel so alone and forget everyone.

20,"I have suffered with depression, possibly bipolar disorder or a personality disorder. Nonetheless I can’t afford therapy anymore and the older I get the worse it seems to be. My parents are not apart of my mental health support system. I feel like I’m loosing my boyfriend. It’s very scary to be in a relationship where you feel helpless (him) and I feel I annoy him with my issues. I used to turn to social media with these little cries of help so someone, anyone would talk to me and I didn’t have to burden my family with my depression but am fearing someone will either take it as me not being serious or someone being too serious and notifying someone wrongly about my mental health (a quick background: I was put into a mental hospital for 4 days and it has really scared me to be open about my thoughts - I am not a suicidal person but it’s always been a “well what if it was easier” thing, I couldn’t go through with it anyhow). 

I guess my question is what do I do with myself? I feel like the more I repress the worse my panic / depressive episodes are. I call them episodes; I feel myself spiraling down and I can’t do anything about it, watch myself freak out, and then dissociate if they’re super bad). I feel I’m running out of people to go to. I feel I’m almost, like,  scaring people or something rather with my honesty about my feelings / mental state. ",09Aug2018,2,
21,"My sleep has been disturbed ever since I was 15 or 16. I’m 22 now. I can’t find anything online that’s similar to what happens a few nights a month. Sometimes it happens frequently, like two nights in a row, and then it won’t happen for weeks. It starts when I fall asleep normally. About an hour into sleep, I think that I wake up, take a look around my room, and see something disturbing usually walking towards me or staring at me. I’ve seen tall dark figures, women that look dead by my bedside, a girl that looked like my little sister, and oddly a black cat. Everything that I see is in vivid detail, right in my room. I can make out faces, and even the eyes and hair of the black cat. After I see whatever it is, I scream and run right out of my room. I don’t seem to “wake up” after. I end up out of my room, panting, or wake up my parents from screaming. I remember every detail, it’s different than waking up from a nightmare. Maybe it’s sleep paralysis, but I’ve always been able to move and seem to be awake every time.

Even my best friend, who I was best friends with for 12+ years, doesn’t contact me unless I contact her first. I’m starting to feel like there’s something wrong with me or something. I enjoy time with my bf but I feel extremely awkward around his friends, and I’m very shy and introverted so I just don’t say anything and I just go along with whatever they want to do, even if it’s something I don’t want to do because I’m too shy to speak up. I’m seriously so tired of being this way. Just insecure about my appearance, anxious all the time, stressed out, and feeling like nobody likes me or wants me around. I’m not trying to make people feel sorry for me, this is just how I’ve been feeling lately and I have nobody to talk to. I haven’t had a friend in so long. I haven’t hung out with a friend for months without it feeling awkward or like they don’t want to actually be around me. It’s becoming extremely painful, it would just be nice to have somebody to talk to that really understands.

24,"Sometimes I wonder if I’m just a complete mess. I sometimes feel like everything I think is just my brain playing things out like a movie role. I’ve cast myself as normal. I go through life acting the way I think normal people act. My goals and aspirations are what they are because of this belief that those are the things that motivate normal people. Is it a need for acceptance? Why do I feel so inauthentic? Why do I crave normalcy? Why do I believe it exists? Why do I feel like my life is an act? Sometimes I’m afraid I’m making all the mistakes. I feel gullible. I feel easily tricked. But, I also feel wildly manipulative. Those archetypal men of history always say things like a man needs to live by a code. I want to live by a code. I’d love a code. I think I’m looking for a code. I’ve always been looking. But believing in any one code feels dangerous and naive and shortsighted and dumb. A commitment to a stringent anything seems weak and under informed. Sometimes I’m scared I feel nothing. Sometimes I feel a numbness that’s very lonely. Sometimes I’m scared of saying or writing thoughts in case they’re too terrible to hear or see, and once they’re out in the universe they can’t be unheard or unseen. I guess that means I believe my thoughts and words have meaning. I know they can have impact. I’m scared to voice my fears sometimes. I’m scared to admit them. I’m scared I’m not a good enough man for the person I love. I’m scared of failing in my relationship. I’m scared I’m a fraud. I’m a used car of a man. Courtship courtesies as airfresheners to hide the smell of 30 years of filth, a coat of paint to hide the rust underneath. Kindness feels inauthentic when it’s attached to wanting to impress. Does that make me a fraud. In those moments I didn’t feel like a fraud. It’s only looking back that I feel the fakeness, the desperation attached to gestures. Why aren’t I as nice now? Why aren’t I as good a listener as before? I want to be better. I want to not be a cliche. But, being a cliche is the epitome of normalcy, which I think I crave. Sometimes I’m scared I crave nothing at all. I have fleeting ideals. They’re not truly ideals if they come and go so quickly. I’m overly emotional and sensitive, but at the same time so unaware of what my emotions mean. The pragmatist in me sees the chemistry at work. The romantic in me sees some sort of spirituality to my thoughts. The analyst in me sees all of this talk and self diagnosis as some sort of self-centered ego stroking. A mental masturbation of my own intellect and self awareness. I’m proud of how self aware I think I am. That probably means I’m less self aware than I think I am. I wish enlightenment was real. I’m not Doubting Thomas, and I don’t need proof of some greater life mystery. I just want to not feel so empty and fake. Raised the type of Christian that prayed at every dinner, churched every Sunday, went to Jesus summer sleep away camp, vacation bible school, youth group, mission trips. That as code felt right. I speak of religion now as if it’s a lower level delusion that people allow themselves to settle into because the benefits outweigh the need for realness. I don’t know if I really believe it’s a delusion, but it feels like an intelligent way to frame it. It’s certainly a code to live by. Religion is mocked by people that don’t feel religious. I don’t agree with everything the church does, but I understand the church is a human construct trying to answer unanswerable questions. The made up parts don’t mean there aren’t also very very valuable parts. I used to pray in my bed and feel close to god. I thought I had something figured out that no one else did. I talked to god like I talked to a friend. I’d call him dude in my prayers, and thought I was being respectful because I thought god would want me to be comfortable around him and would want to be treated like a friend. I remember crying tears of joy in those prayers. I remember crying confused tears of a sad scared happiness; like I was too fortunate. I was scared that I didn’t deserve it. What does it mean to deserve something really? Who decides that? I sometimes wish I could go back to praying that way. That would require a moritorium on those religion-is-a-shared-delusion-we-allow-ourselves thoughts. I don’t know if I can stop that. Has that train already left? If I dive back into prayer, am I just submitting to a delusion? Is that so bad? Maybe it’s not submitting to a delusion. Maybe it’s a tool or a tactic used to help my own mental health. Maybe having faith, even in an unknown with more questions than answers, can be a good thing for the human mind...and spirit. Romance and spirituality are so tied in my mind. They both feel amorphous, and enormous, and all encompassing, but completely baffling. Things that are baffling feel fake. Why do I see things that way? Why is uncertainty met with inauthenticity? Maybe I only feel fake because I feel uncertain. I always envy people that are strangely passionate about a singular thing. I envy those people that dedicate their whole life to one goal or achievement or purpose. But that just brings me back to the thought that any life led by too strict a code is too inflexible to be right. What is right? What does it mean to be right? Does such a thing exist besides as a concept? And who judges that rightness? I’m writing in circular ideas now. It’s probably time I go to sleep. ",09Aug2018,2,

This is a supremely important topic that’s rarely written about in a non-sensationalistic way: [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/opinion/self-harm-cutting-teenagers.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/opinion/self-harm-cutting-teenagers.html)",09Aug2018,3,
30,"Some backstory: My little sister is my best friend in the world. We’re 3 years apart. 
We were raised for the most part by my mother - wonderfully strong independent woman who did a fantastic job of keeping us ignorant of the challenges of single parenting.
I had some pretty extreme rebellious years when I was in high school and she was in jr. high. The shitty things I did during that time in my life are actually a big part of who I am now in the sense that I made mistakes that I learned from - My mom and I have developed a fantastic relationship since I moved out at 19 but my sister told me later that those years fucked with her. 
My sister and I have always been close, but we really became friends shortly after I stopped having roommates.
I think it’s safe to say I’ve had a consistently stronger relationship with our father than she has. I’m not sure why exactly. Maybe because I got to experience more of his better years. They split while my mom was pregnant with my sis. We would spend weekends at his house sporadically throughout our childhood. He’s an alcoholic. He’s so wise but is rarely capable of applying that wisdom to his own circumstance. I can appreciate the good times and distance myself from the bad. 

The point: while I’ve had some issues in the past with anxiety, self control, motivation/setting realistic expectations for myself etc. I’m happy with myself, my life, my abilities. I believe mental health is a combination of genetic and acquired traits. While I have no way of knowing for sure I think that my sister was dealt the shittier hand and probably has a harder time than I did/do overcoming obstacles. She tends to get overwhelmed/depressed and then she comes up with a really unattainable solution that (not a for lack of trying) fails and then she gets more overwhelmed/depressed. Rinse repeat. 

Recently, It seems like things are getting worse. I recognize some of the things she’s going through. She comes over often and I can always tell when she’s feeling down. I try to engage her and redirect because that’s what I would want if I was feeling down. If that doesn’t work (sometimes it does) I ask if she wants to talk and I listen. Sometimes talking it out helps but when it’s bad it’s usually just crying and like hopelessness so I try to get her to identify the causes of her feelings, and then to identify potential actionable and reasonable steps to resolution, again because these are things that have helped me in the past. And then because I don’t know what else to do I’ll share similar experiences and talk through what I did and what I would have done and what I learned. Sometimes I suggest that it might help to talk to a professional. In general I just try to be supportive and helpful without being like pushy? Sometimes she responds positively but more and more she breaks down again as soon as I’m done talking. And almost exclusively she never actually takes any steps to improve - or if she does they’re always very unlikely to succeed like it’s all or nothing.
TLDR: It’s too long because I’m not actually capable of succinctness. ",09Aug2018,1,

40,"Hi guys.  I’m 21 and I’ve had mental health issues since I was like 14.  I’ve had several different diagnoses in the past (depression, ADD, generalized anxiety) and have tried many of the medications commonly prescribed for each.  I think I’m on my 7th therapist.  boo hoo my life is so hard

Anyway, the point is, I have strong addictive tendencies.  I will do anything I can get my hands on when I get low.  I have had problems with substances that in theory aren’t supposed to be super addictive, such as benadryl and ambien, and even abused LSD (and analogues) for a while.  I have only tried benzos a few times and at small doses, but I enjoy the feeling immensely so I know that isn’t an option for me.

The past couple of years, I’ve been able to chill it the fuck out a little bit and now I only smoke weed.  But I do it every day, and sometimes multiple times a day.  I have gained weight which is just awesome - not to mention how much fucking money I am spending.  It is holding me back, but I’m terrified to stop.  I have done horrible shitty things in the past when I was clean/sober for more than a few days.  I also have awful scary thoughts when I stop, most notably about self harm, suicide, and accidentally hitting animals while driving.

It’s not fun to smoke, and it hasn’t been fun for years, but this is the thing you can do every day that won’t kill you.  I need to quit because I want to move in with my significant other who doesn’t do any drugs.  But I also don’t want to end up doing some junkie shit like root through his dog’s meds or spend my rent or something.  I love him, and he deserves better, and I really don’t want to ruin this.

I don’t know what to do.  I am physically healthy, but I constantly feel like I am in a lot of distress or pain.  I have never had any significant trauma other than a couple of losses, and I have friends and a family that love me.

41,"I don't think my psychotherapist is being ethical. I tried searching for a subreddit where I can find out whether my therapist is really being unethical or not. So far even after weeks and posting on /r/findareddit I still could not find such a subreddit. So I am posting it here. If anyone knows a more appropriate subreddit please link it in the comments. 

Anyways I live in Bangladesh. I am a man in my late twenties and for the past decade I have been suffering from OCD Depression and Social Anxiety. I have been in and out of therapy due to financial difficulties but nonetheless I have went to hundreds of psychotherapy sessions which wasn't cheap at all. 

There are some things that I have seen among most therapists here and I don't think that these were ethical. I currently go to a psychologist with whom I am doing therapy for the past 4 years plus, I think. Here are a few things that I think might be unethical: 

* He refuses to listen to my problems with my Dad unless my Dad is in our presence: My Dad has issues of the ""domestic"" nature. I won't go into the details here. I have tried talking about this to the psychologist but he says that he won't listen to these unless my Dad is present in front of me. However, once my Dad is actually present and I start with the minor issues, the psychologist says things that in turn encourages my Dad to be more abusive at home. 
* He is rude: He always, continously has this angry/rude facial expression and often when he gets a phone he insultingly says ""Get out of the room, I am talking"" (at least that's a rough translation). This is for no reason. 
* He refuses to consider another point of view and imposes his views: He has told me and my Dad that I should not be allowed to talk with foreign therapists since they would lead me astray. The example he gave was that, if a woman has a fear of having her thighs getting seen than a Western therapist would say that its not a problem. Meaning, that since ethics and morality is cultural than a Western therapist would lead a person of our culture astray. He also gets angry if you fail to *pray peace* after talking about religion. Basically pray peace is an honorific that must be said after you talk about holy issues. Like holy people, holy books etc. Like saying *The Holy Book,* instead of *Book* only. Basically, if you don't revere the religion like you should, he gets angry. I never insult any religion or beliefs but nonetheless if you don't practice or revere like you are supposed to it angers him. It goes without saying he is very religious. He also says that having a girlfriend is bad. In fact, I have seen this subtle imposing of religious pressure among all the other therapists as well. He also moves away from talking about things like LGBT or anything near it. 
* He has a habit of victim-blaming: He never says things like, what they did was wrong. Instead he says, you must have done something that caused the problem. 

The above are a few issues of contention that I can think off the top of my head now. I can't change therapists since it takes 10 sessions to talk about one problem. And I don't have one problem I have 30-40 problems. By the time an issue is talked about fully, I might find a therapist who I find is no longer being helpful or unethical. Changing him would mean starting again. This would cost, time, money, mental stress and there is no hope of finding benefit in the end. 

Therefore, I just want to know whether any of the points above is unethical or not, along with the reasons. Can someone answer it for me? ",09Aug2018,7,

This time there was no set cut off. The hours are flexible, I work about 10 hours a week and most of it is remote. There have been a lot of changes since the last time I worked for them. They do require meetings sometimes and more communication during the day than I thought. It was not like this 4 years ago, and I was not keen on the changes when I came on board. It's interfered with my day job and my ability to focus. At night I'm so tired I can only log in 1-2 hours a night, and my weekends are spent organizing my errands/chores around. when I can work.

This week I threw in the towel for the per diem gig. I just don't have the stamina to do both and I'm not as good at multitasking as I used to be. Both jobs are very cerebral and frankly I can't focus on a computer for 10-12 hours a day. They are very understanding and know I work f/t in another dept. The mgr even said I can ""quit if it's too much"". 

I tried, I really tried. I feel like a failure for not being able to do both, but I'm just so burnt out. I just want to enjoy my evenings and weekends without having to have work dictate it (and a job that's not my day job to boot).",09Aug2018,1,

Both of us are kinda screwed up from past relationships (mental and physical abuse) she suffers from PTSD and Stockholm Syndrome as well as Depression and Anxiety, Myself I suffer from Separation Anxiety specifically and Depression. She promised me that the two of us together would be able to get the help we needed and she would put in her full effort into getting better. I personally have been making good progress I feel but she hasn't done ANYTHING other than get back to working. ""I just wanna focus on making this money"" is all she keeps telling me.

I want to just throw my hands up and quit and break it off sometimes but I also fear that loneliness and going back to the feeling of not wanting to get out of bed because it hurts so much.

51,"Hey there. This is going to be a fairly long post, so bear with me.

&amp;nbsp;

First, a little bit of an introduction about myself. I'm 21 years old, graduated from university very recently and I live in an arab country in Africa. I really like to learn, and I frequently to this day learn about new things all the time. Sometimes this is through online courses, sometimes reading, or sometimes outside that scope (my latest ""big"" thing that I learned was learning how to play on a musical instrument). I generally am not interested in something for very long except for learning new things.

&amp;nbsp;

A year ago, I was in a very bad mental state, because I was extremely stressed about work and in my mind no work = I'm a failure. This is because the year before it I could not get any training/internship except one that I didn't really want, after a lot of effort and mental fatigue. I did not have any summer courses and the holiday was just panicking about the future because I had no idea what to do back then. It was *not* a good holiday.

&amp;nbsp;

Today, a year later, things have changed a bit. I'm mentally much better (though that may be subject to change). I no longer treat being successful in work as being successful in my life (for example, being a decent person, trying to not be an asshole, etc.). I have separated the two. A week or so ago, I had finished a pass or fail training as an instructor in a place. I failed, and that didn't bother me. I was actually very happy I got rid from the stress of the training, and when the rejection came a few days later I wasn't bothered as I expect the worst and from being rejected so many times 2 years ago I'm desensitized to it. But I learnt something important about myself from that experience.

&amp;nbsp;

Before the training, I thought I wanted to be an instructor. The job above was for teaching English which I didn't want very much, but I still enjoy instruction nevertheless or so I thought at least. But after the training I was very happy I was done with it that I didn't care I was rejected or accepted. This is before actually starting the job, so it got me thinking: Do I actually want this career? I'm not sure anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

The thing is, being an instructor was the only lead I have, but it seems I'm not interested in it. But it goes beyond that. Right now, I'm extremely unmotivated to even apply to a job because I don't want to bother with applying and searching, just to get a job I don't really care about. **It is very important to note here that my attitude generally about life is nothing really matters.**

But from here the problem *really* start to surface. I don't care about getting a job I don't like because if I don't find motivation in it, it doesn't benefit me much otherwise. Money? I don't care. I'm fine with wearing simple clothes, using an old laptop, having no smartphone, eating at home to save instead of outside (I receive an allowance and I spend it however I want). This is not because my family is poor; in fact I'd say we are above average in my country. I don't even consider marrying an option because a) I'm antagonistic and vegan, both of which are extremely rare in my county and b) I don't think there's anybody who I want to live the rest of my life with. Prestige? Never gave a shit about that stuff. 

&amp;nbsp;

What I want to say is, it seems very unlikely at the moment that I'd get satisfied from a job. That's a problem because nothing a job would give me would motivate me because I'd be living exactly the same ""meh"" life with an added component of pointless stuff. In this scenario I'd gladly welcome death. I had a lot of suicidal thoughts last year, but I'm not suicidal right now. That may or may not change, I don't really know.

&amp;nbsp;

I believe what I said above is confusing a bit but I can't put it in a better way unfortunately. So, my perspective is:

&amp;nbsp;

Everything is meaningless. Things are slowly going downhill, and that may become very bad after a year or two, assuming nothing gets changed. But what is going to change? I'm not motivated to change anything (job wise) and if I don't try, it's extremely unlikely anything will change.

&amp;nbsp;

So I'd like to ask: What do you think? Is it possible I am depressed? Am I just plain lazy and there's nothing else? Do I need to go to a psychiatrist? (I've dove before with little progress done, but I don't mind going to someone different) Something else? Please let me know, I'm open to all kinds of thoughts.

&amp;nbsp;

P.s. I don't think the problem is being lazy, because I'm lazy in everything else. I don't procrastinate, I stick to my exercising plan 90%+ of weeks even though sometimes I dread exercising but I push myself.",09Aug2018,1,

53,"“I saw with my anger long enough until she told me that her real name was grief.”

I stumbled across this quote on Instagram and it has resonated with me. As a therapist, I encounter a multitude of people on a daily basis— each with their own, unique set of struggles, diagnoses, and a varying degree of severity. What I have come to realize through my work, and the processing of my own childhood trauma, is this: we do not like to sit with grief. we label sadness and pain as negative emotions. The moment we begin to feel these, we do everything in our power to rid ourselves of the hurt. 

Anger is a cover-up for sadness. A defense mechanism, if you will. Grief and sadness make us feel vulnerable and weak, so we must switch that to anger—an emotion making us appear strong and powerful. This is a catch-22. 

See, the very action we take to defend ourselves actually creates even more distress and agony. Now, not only are we hurting, but we are pretending. Putting on a mask for the world, and perhaps even for our own self. We are denying our experience that led to the sadness and minimizing its importance. 

Sure, sadness and pain is uncomfortable. It doesn’t feel good. But when we suppress it...burying it deep inside... the more it becomes engrained in us. My advice here is to become comfortable with being uncomfortable.

When that sadness arises, allow yourself to sit with it for a bit. Don’t dwell on it for days, as this solves nothing and can spiral us down a damaging path of self-sabotage and depression, but sit with it. Sit with that pain for 5, 15, 30 minutes. Allow yourself to acknowledge how you feel. 

After you acknowledge and identify it, say it to yourself “I feel....” then reflect on WHY you feel this way.

Say it to yourself, “I feel...... because......”

Then, give yourself grace. Recognize that grief, sadness, pain, etc. are a part of life. It is OKAY to feel these things. VALIDATE that how you feel matters and is justified.

But after you acknowledge the what’s and why’s of your emotions, and validate them, make a choice— dwell or accept it and move forward.

Do yourself a favor. Allow yourself the grace to feel sad and be uncomfortable, then make the choice to heal. to find gratitude. to seek out happiness. 



Acknowledge it. Validate it. Sit with it. Choose to make the effort to heal. ",09Aug2018,4,
54,"Honestly I'm not sure where to start, as I usually hate writing too much and prefer talking personally. To introduce myself, I'm a recent high school graduate who is feeling honestly irritated. but honestly with so much going on, I'm not sure if I am. My reason for having a mental breakdown is because i genuinely missed having that feeling of control and being able to prove myself constantly. But with childhood Trauma/Bullying, I've always felt that trust and feelings are for the weak. I have always been a logical and organized person. 

For some reason my past mistakes where I felt weak or I WAS weak, pisses me off. One family member pointed it out and said that I never defended myself as a child until highschool. High school I was incredibly social with those close to me, but always lost my temper and constantly tried to prove myself. I got into so much trouble in school, sometimes I did it because I loved getting attention. Now that it's the summer, I've been having a mental breakdown because I feel the more I'm closed off from the world, the weaker I am. Its pathetic. I don't tolerate weaknesses, even within myself. I am all for envisioning a future for myself in which I gain absolute power. I'm not sure how to encounter this or if this is some mental disorder, Its been consistent in my life, I would always remember past troubles and get angry and irritated, and usually I would feel the need to control EVERYTHING because i deserve it.",09Aug2018,2,

59,"I don't know why I'm like this. I haven't celebrated Christmas since I was a child. I don't find anything about it at all appealing or fun. I can tolerate the occasional Christmas party for the sake of my family and friends, but I'd much prefer to never have to look at a Christmas tree or a pile of gifts ever again. My husband loves Christmas, so he puts up lights and a tiny tree, but I can't stand to look at them. Something about it just makes me irrationally angry. I work in the music department of a university, and in the past few days our directors have started to discuss holiday concerts. Hearing the Christmas music they're playing and discussing literally makes me want to vomit.

I wasn't like this when I was a kid, because yay presents and time off from school. I didn't *like* Christmas as a child, it was just easier to tolerate because of the perks. It meant nothing to me. Now that I'm an adult I can't find any reason to even pretend I'm not a massive Scrooge. I worked in a department store for nearly ten years, and every year we'd start playing the same 10 Christmas songs on a loop all day every day, on the first day of November. I started wearing earplugs when I could get away with it because the noise made me want to break things and smash my head against the wall. I nearly got fired for refusing to wear a Santa hat every day for two months straight. 

In the last few years things have been getting worse. Anything related to Christmas makes me so irrationally angry that I can't function. Throughout the entire holiday season I'm angry and depressed. I can't eat, I can't sleep. I can barely drag myself out of my house because I know there will be Christmas decorations and music everywhere. It's completely disrupting my life and I know the blind fury I feel at the mention of anything Christmas related isn't healthy. I have high blood pressure to begin with, and I'm concerned that Christmas might actually kill me one day. I never know what will trigger a rage. I can push through the music and all the crowds shopping in the grocery store and think I'm fine, and then on my way out I see a Santa Claus and I just see red. It makes me want to be violent. I want to scream and hurt myself and others. I wish I wasn't like this. I wish I could enjoy Christmas like a normal person and not look like a broody edgelord shitting on what's supposed to be the best time of the year.

I don't have anger issues throughout the rest of the year. I am not a violent person. I have struggled with depression my entire life, but I'm much better now than I've ever been. I don't know what causes me to feel this way. I think part of my anger comes from knowing that this makes me an outsider. When I tell people I don't celebrate Christmas I just get rudely told to ""Get over it"". A few people have been kind enough to ask if I'm Jewish or something, but for the most part I just get made to feel like I'm a freak. I know I'm strange, but I don't know *why.*

I know I should probably seek professional help. I don't even know why I'm posting this, except I suppose I just wanted a place to vent. If you took the time to read all my crap then thank you, and if you have any suggestions at all I'm certainly open to hearing them.",09Aug2018,3,

63,"I get 1-5 panic attacks a day. These are luckily usually very brief, only lasting a 1-3 minutes. But on rare occasions, they last for hours and keep me up until 5AM. They always come without warning and strangely seem to happen the most when I am relaxed. 

I have had two very traumatic experiences. 

The gas line in my car blew up while I was driving one day without me knowing, I felt the gaseous fumes pulling me into unconsciousness as I was behind the wheel. I was told it was a miracle the car didn't flat out explode killing me instantly. I always play music or drive with someone to distract me, because I keep getting flashes of me almost dying that day if I let my mind wander, the scent of gasoline triggers my anxiety. 

The second one is where my neighbor's house caught on fire during a natural disaster. She didn't have a smoke detector and she woke up to being burned alive. The storm kept me up all night and I crashed. Three hours later I was woken up, I looked outside and I will never forget what I saw. The entire world was red as far as I could see in every direction, it looked like I woke up in hell. Flames up to 20 feet tall. My neighbor's roof was sitting my front lawn and our porch came crashing down due to the damage from the storm. I had insomnia for about a year, I was afraid to sleep because I felt like something really bad would happen while I was asleep.

I have not been evaluated for PTSD. Most of my panic attacks have no seeming trigger but some are from trauma. Social interaction triggers more extreme panic attacks, like group gatherings.

I think this is due to years of conflict with each other.

2) Terrified of step ladders

3) Terrified of hurting a pregnant coworker.

68,"Anger is a serious issue for many people and the reason so many struggle with it is because they struggle to contain and control their emotion and so it controls them.

However, I also believe that your emotion can benefit you if you can use it productively. Many struggle with anger because they cannot cope with personal circumstance, but at the same time, that anger can be used to drive them to get out of that circumstance.

69,"So, i'm depressed. Not the cutesy tumblr self diagnosed shit - I have a clinically diagnosed personality disorder and all the fun comorbid issues that come with it. I have been in cognitive behavioral therapy for years now - 6 i believe - and have been medicated for just as long. In fact, recently, i've been told to back off my medication.
 Life is going pretty well for me. I have my own apartment, a family who loves me, a mom who is my best friend, younger siblings who don't hate me, 3 beautiful dogs. I was accepted into three separate programs at an incredible and prestigous research university and chose a masters program that aligns exactly with my life's dream of being a for-path. I own lots of nice stuff and am attached to it, but i dont consider any of it my reason for living or anything. And i'm doing everything i'm supposed to do. I walk and take the stairs and am looking at more excercises that are apartment appropriate. I eat but not over eat and am trying to be healthier - no junkfood, more fresh food. I get along with my lab partners. I talk to my mom. I talk to my gaming group and online friends. I curate hobbies like cooking and art. I take care of plants to replace caring for my dogs and siblings. I journal when i feel it is really necessary. I watch movies and read when i need comfort. I compliment and tip people and try to at least pretend to be confident, even small talk and interactions with strangers and classmates and service people everyday. I've been trying new things, new foods, regular interactions with new people, new schedule types.
Basically, I do all of the good person things you're supposed to do when your brain is a treacherous piece of shit. And its not enough. My body hurts, i feel lonely and disgusting and pathetic, i'm still obese, i still get migraines, i can't sleep, i have crying jags out of nowhere, i can't focus, i'm having panic attacks regularly for the first time in 6 years. I don't understand. I honestly feel like i'm trying my hardest and i'm just exhausted. Is my hardest not good enough? I don't know what to do better. 
 I'm trying to balance school and home and social and self care and everyone says self care is the most important but it feels like i'm stuck running in place like a 60s cartoon.
 I can't enjoy anything. I watch a movie and spend the rest of the night feeling guilty and punishing myself for not studying. I study and feel awful when i don't sleep enough or still answer a question wrong. I try to make something - i cook and i feel guilty for anyfood that's not healthy as hell, i craft and feel like i'm wasting time, i try to do something light and relaxing like coloring and feel like i'm not contributing to my future or making something that i've promised to a friend. I try to play a video game, spend the whole time panicking that i'm being too loud. I try to clean and just get overwhelmed. Same thing when i try to study. I can't drive without breathing funny. I oversleep my alarms, take too many naps, and then can't fall asleep at night. I'm miserable. And i've been miserable for years now. Sometimes it'll seem better. Like my hard work is actually paying off. And then it just doesn't. 
I recognize logically that i've improved. I recognize objectively that my life is amazing and there is literally no reason for me to feel this way. But i feel unaccomplished and awful. 
And everyday i try to implement improvements. Grounding, meditation, time off social media, time away from food, showering, reading. Fuck, i'm even looking up yoga techniques and using scented oils. But everytime i wake up too late to do stretches, or i feel fat and sore after standing in lab or climbing stairs, or i feel sad out of nowhere and have to lie, or i fall asleep and miss an appointment - it sets me back. A lot. 
I thought it was the deaths in my family, but its been months and i have shit to do now. I thought it was my medication being too high, but its been adjusted. I thought it was stress from moving, but i havent had any logistical or financial issues. Im actually being more social now than i had been for months. So i have to conclude that its me. And i don't understand. The get up off your ass and do it method works for my lecture notes but that’s it  - it doesn’t improve my grades, it doesn't improve my productivity in terms of quality, and it most definitely doesn't make me feel any less like laying in a corner high off my tits until I die a slow and painful death. I don't even really feel suicidal or wanna be perfect anymore, i just want to actually feel a positive emotion for more than 10 seconds without immediatedly drowning in guilt and frustration. 
I'd ask my mom but she's got her own shit to deal with. I'd ask a friend but i only have one i feel remotely comfortable really talking with and i've never even actually met him. I'd talk to my therapist but technically i'm between them - my psychiatrist is supposed to have referred me to a new one in my new place of residence but if that's gone through, no one's told me and that was a week to a week and a half ago and my counselor told me to wait on that until looking for new. She said to call her when i was settled in but i figure that's just a polite thing people say. And aside from that, she was so hopeful that i'd make friends and feel more confident on my own and i don't want to dissapoint her. I don't know what to do.

I have no power anymore, I can't go on like this. 

I am attracted to girls aged 11-14. Hebehilia, so prepubescent to pubescent girls. I want to love them and be loved by them. So no, I am not a rapist nor a molester or whatever. That doesn't give me anything. I want sexual acceptance from girls from that age group. I believe this stems from a deep insecurity with girls, because back then I would show my sexuality openly (as any normal human does) and was called a pervert and excluded, mobbed and was just the nerd/pervert/genius everyone picked on. I just wanted to be loved and to love back. 

But now it's too late. Society forbids me to follow my passion and my heart. Nothing I will ever do in my entire life can possibly give me what I am so deeply longing for. And I know that. No love in my life. And what is life without love? Whenever I see happy people it breaks my heart and i just want to cry and fall into an endless cry that never ends, becomes monotonous and finally disappears together with me into nothingness. Just end it. This is only suffering. Knowing what you need to feel that bliss all the others are allowed to feel, but you just can't get it. But you're smart enough to create in your mind a glimpse of what could be. You know the love you could give. Which makes it even worse.

Whatever I am going to do I will not be happy. The moments of laughter and happiness are merely moments of forgetting. And then I always get sad again because I remember.

My parents say the light in her eyes seems to have somewhat disappeared. I want to help her. They need me to help them. 
But I'm not sure I can. I am a successful person. I have an MD degree, I'm doing my residency. I just moved town and it was the best thing I could have done for myself. But last Saturday I spent an hour awake in bed, because I got anxiety from the fear of being alone for the rest of my life. I fell in love twice last year and two times I gave it all I had and two times I got my heart broken. 
After I moved, and some time when by I thought I was fine and stronger. But then I started talking to this girl, and we got along and went out a few times. I thought things were going well and I was starting to like her.. But then she told me she has still a thing with her ex. I had to cut the ties. She hasn't texted me since. 
I spent one hour in bed last Saturday thinking whether I did the right thing, almost overcome by the anxiety of being alone. 
And now I have to go home. To see my family. To help them. But I'm not sure I can anymore. The fear of pain, of fighting, of everything.. I'm not sure if I can take it. I love them, more than anything in the world...",09Aug2018,3,
73,"I have recently experienced several deeply disturbing events, where I saw and heard things I know didn't happen. Two people running into my room and leaving, a loud scream, two people fighting next to me. I'd like to say that I was dreaming but if I was I never noticed the transition from wakefulness to sleep and vice-versa. Each event felt real, as real as anything I've ever experienced but I know none of it happened.",09Aug2018,2,
74,"I believe I have perhaps permanently destroyed who I am as a person due to depression or something like it. Over the years, without thinking (or caring) of the consequences, I have drifted away from every friend I've ever had and every family member I've ever been close with other than my parents. Most recently with my last closest friend, I cannot get myself to believe that they care about me and that they are not lying to me. It's been incredibly drawn out and gradual with everyone else... but I feel like I've reached a point where there's no where to really go from here. I feel very isolated and alienated and still don't really desire any social interaction yet my rational mind is screaming ""What is wrong? You were not always like this"".

I've also avoided school for the past 3 years and feel I'm at a point it's too late. No motivation, no confidence, no direction and intense anxiety regarding the future. 

I do not know how to live anymore. I sit around and do nothing. I distract my mind with games and endless scrolling. I am alone and I feel as though I've lost my personhood. I really never thought it'd get this bad.

75,I’ve been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder in the past and I have a codependency problem and just broke up with my boyfriend. I feel like I’m literally choking almost all the time and I am burping so much which makes me feel better. I’m never hungry and it always seems like there’s an air bubble in my GI system. I also got treated for GERD with omeprazole but I think it’s anxiety. I’ve never actually thrown up but sometimes I’ve felt like it. This has been happening for a couple months. What does this sound like to you,09Aug2018,1,
76,"Hi, after years, I finally made an appointment with a therapist to get some help. She seems really nice through email, but I'm really nervous. What can I expect? Is there anything that would be helpful to do ahead of time?",09Aug2018,1,
77,"So recently I came to the realisation that the feeling I sometimes experience is a panic attack. The physiological effects check out. However I don't have it when Im in stressful or social situations, its always when Im alone. I started thinking what could have caused it and it tends to happen when I feel like I finished all my projects or when Im not doing any progress on it. So any free time I have I start looking for projects (mostly in form of writing poetry/designing games). That would be fine but I get really invested in them at the expense of eating /sleeping. And when I get to my 'real life stuff' Im exausted. But without it - panic attacks. What to do to break this cycle? ",09Aug2018,1,
78,"Ok I'm not gonna tell you my age because im afraid you won't take my seriously, but I promise you I am between 14 - 18... I don't even know were to start, but I am just a ball of sadness and fear. I have anxiety really bad, but in the past year or so it has gotten better. I'm scared of the paranormal. Ghost, curses, spells, demons, God and pretty much anything along those lines. I worry about EVERYTHING! Mostly about the way people feel about me. Everyone in my life tells me I need to stop talking bad about myself and be positive. Some people say I'm doing it for attention but I'm not! It's how I feel... My mom died in January, and I live with my grandpa, sister, cousin and my cousins 2 kids. My cousin and my sister are really mean to me. Always yelling at me. And I often catch myself being a dick to them, and sometimes my loving grandfather. My grandpa is the most caring, loving man I've ever known, but sometimes he just gets on my nerves and I just snap. My mom was a very good mom but she kept me and my sister home all the time. We were homeschooled and were not aloud to have contract with any of our extended family. WE WERE ALWAYS HOME!!! And that is the reason why I'm so anti social. I can't stand being around people. Actually I day dream about talking to other people and hanging out with them, but when I actually do it I just sit there and don't say a word. I can't stand being around others... I honestly don't know what to think of myself. I have seriously thought about killing myself and even tested out different methods with at the time no intentions of actually doing it yet. But that was a few months ago. When I'm at home I sit in my room all day and do nothing but lay on my bed. I go to my therapist every two weeks. I think that I think way to much because all I have is time... Part of me thinks I need to go stay at a mental hospital for a little while and get some help there, and the other part of me says that it would be to extreme. I'm scared to ask my papa about it or anyone beacse they will probably think the same thing. Can y'all please tell me what I should do?? (P.S. I'm a dude and I'm straight)",09Aug2018,1,

81,"I've been prescribed rexulti which is considered an antipsychotic. I feel embarrassed and shamed about this. I know I shouldn't but it goes back to my upbringing. 

I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. I have tried at least 5 medications and nothing has helped my anxiety, I have gotten little relief with my depression. 

I am currently taking wellbutrin, doxepin, rexulti and propranolol. I feel embarrassed about needing all of this medication. My nurse practitioner said she believes my MDD is resistant to treatment. I am glad she is not giving up on me but it is so intimidating.",09Aug2018,1,

83,"Hi, I'm a 21 y/o guy. I've never had a girlfriend, held hands, or kissed a girl. Honestly, that's my fault for being so short on self-esteem and social skills. I don't know whether I'm ugly or good looking as nobody as ever commented on my looks and I don't get close enough to anyone for them to actually tell me how I look, lol. Regardless, I feel like a lost cause and I think I'm probably going to remain in this situation until the day I die.

I've noticed myself exhibiting odd behaviour when it comes to seeing relationships between fictional characters in various mediums. I don't get *as* jealous or upset when I see couples in real life, although I do start to feel a slight resentment towards myself for being so incapable of socialising with women. 

I'll give you an example, I was playing a video game and it slowly begins to build up sexual tension between the protagonist and his female love interest. By the end of the game, they get together. But I just had this overwhelming urge to put the controller down and stop playing. Like, why am I so jealous of fictional characters? Similarly, say I'm watching a movie with a similar character arc between a male and a female, I'll also get jealous and want to stop watching. Movies and games are no longer things to help me unwind in my downtime, instead I'm more preoccupied with two fictional characters hooking up, I honestly don't understand myself.

I do feel that if I actually did had a girlfriend, these feelings would go away, as they feel like a taunting reminder of my lack of love. I want to end my post by saying that I'm not an incel or anything and I hope that comes across by the way I worded my post. I fully blame myself for  my shortcomings and nobody else. I feel that this crippling loneliness is having an adverse effect on my mental health and well-being however.

84,"This is my first post. I am hoping for some input on possible cognitive impairment. My husband suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the age of 12. He is now 38. In the past 6-12 months his memory has gotten so much worse. He is going next week for cognitive impairment testing.  
Can anyone shed some light on what tests it involves because we were told it takes 10 hours. Anyone had them or care for someone in the same position as he is in right now?

85,"Hey

My psych want to put me on risperdal because my circular/obsessive thoughts can't stop and I am days with my mind busy on the same subject while awake.

I only read horror stories about APs, and I am afraid that once I start risperdal, I will never be the same. I fear anhedonia, I fear that the way they will treat my ocd will be like making me a zombie... and I fear that while on then, my creative and logical part will go downhill.

Can anyone here share experiences of antipsychotic use?",09Aug2018,1,

87,"I have no normal state of being. 

I'm either at a super low point where I: hate myself, I think I'm disgusting, don't go outside, don't talk or see anyone, don't shower, overeat/binge, compulsively pick at my skin, think about death and how I will eventually die but I could also just die at any moment, ect. 

Or I'm at a super high point where I: love myself, think I'm extremely attractive, stare at myself in the mirror because I love my face, talk to people, leave my house, eat a little but not too much and still feel nice and lean, feel amazing, go for a run, take care of myself, ect. But the thing is that even in these moments, I have thoughts of impending doom. The fact that I could die at this very moment. I will die one day. And it's done. It's over. Fuck. 

I'm also super obsessive or have addictive tendencies or something. If I like someone/date someone, I will be obsessed with them until the next person comes along. Even if we've broken up. Even if it's been years. Same with habits. When I get into one unhealthy habit, I can't break it until I can replace it with another unhealthy habit. 

I'm also a perfectionist. And the fact that I can't be the best/look the best, as in the best in the world, bothers me. It's so weird because it's so extreme. 

I've gone to therapists, but it's just me talking and feeling bad about myself. All I want is a diagnosis. I just want them to tell me what mental problems I have so that I can get medicated or find what's worked with other people. 

I can't live my life like this. Because when I really die I'm going to regret thinking about all this when I could have been living my life. I'm scared for that day. I don't know what to do. Should I go to a different therapist? Should I just learn to live with whatever I have?",09Aug2018,1,

89,"i don't know what to do with my life anymore, i live in a poor country, i lived abroad for some time but now i'm stuck in this place and there is nothing i can do about it, back then i didn't care but now it's hard for me to try and live a normal life, i just can't stand most people here, they're vulgar, dirty, dishonest, people here literally shit/pee on the streets and feel proud about stealing things, leaving is all i ever talk about, all i ever think about so forgive me if im skipping some details, i always have arguments with my family, i don't really have any good friends and there aren't any good universities i'd like to join, they're all delapidated and just not good, i tried becoming a pilot but i ended up failing a psychological test so now i have to wait like a month and a half to go back to the clinic and have another go at that.

they suggested that i see a psychologist and so i did, this new psychologist had me go to a psychiatrist and now i'm being medicated, all that medicine has done is make me more sensible, i cry more often and feel way more empathy towards others.

my psychologist tells me that some of my problems are inferiority complex, lack of joy, depressive personality, obssesive compulsive dissorder (sry if they're not the correct terms, english isn't my first language) and that most of my opinions are polarizing.

i can't help but to feel inferior every time i compare myself to pretty much anyone i knew in the first world, wages here are so low it's pathetic, i can't afford anything nice and the country just sucks as a whole, i usually say that this place is empty, nothing trendy ever happens here.

criminality is high and i can't even go out with my phone and feel safe.

i even feel cold in my house, our windows suck and air goes trough them so it gets freacking cold.

i tend to wash my hands a lot but that's because the kitchen in my house is awfuly dirty, it doesn't look that bad in the day but if you go there at 3-4 am you'll see that the place is full of tiny roaches, sometimes i even see them on the fridge.

also, the water/pressure here is just awful, 4/7 times i have to throw buckets of water to the toilet becasue it will usually not be strong enough to flush my shit,  also the water stinks and it's not drinkable.

im just stating things that have happened to me but i genuenly don't know what should i do, i hate my life and think about killing myself every day, i often have anxiety attacks at 7-9 pm and feel dispair, i just walk in circles for hours on a room without going out or talking to anyone.

the only reason i wanted to become a pilot is because i wanted to make money but it seems like i won't be able to do that, my mother is a professional but she doesn't make 300 usd a month, she can't get me an iphone, she can't get me a ps4, i can't have any nice things, minimum wages here are so low it's insulting, i'd feel happy working overtime in the first world, i've spent many afternoons watching real estate investment videos and stuff like that, most people here are poor so there isn't a big business or anything like that here.

nobody here gets it because they all accept this place and refuse to change, i've talked to my psychologist many times but i don't think i've changed one bit, she's even told me that i'm right about 80% of what i say, life quality here is extremely low.

about the inferiority complex, the people i knew in the first world were better than me, they were better educated, they can make more money by working part time than my mother can with a degree and a full time job, they get to have nice things and go to a nice university, they get to have nice clothes and nice discounts and promotions for all sorts of things, i don't get any of that here, if i have to work more in order to get less, am i not inferior? i'm just trying to use logic.

also i don't feel any joy, like almost never, i compare everything to how things were in the first world so i'm annoyed most of the time, the most exciting thing to happen in my daily life is when a new episode of some show i'm watching comes out, sometimes i'll just go to sleep and wake up feeling miserable and wishing that i could sleep until something happened that allowed me to leave.

i do have a father but he's an asshole who refuses to give me any child support money, i do get some because his employers know that he has to pay me but he's only giving me a third of the stablished amount and he also owes me like 8 years of child support, i tried talking to him but he straight up told me that he didn't want to pay me.

also, when i was a kid he told me to throw a rock at a kid who was bothering me, the guy is a fucking animal who refuses to be peaceful.

i'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense, i don't have anyone who can listen to me and to be honest, it wouldn't matter, everyone's gotten bored of me and i'm still here, i'll be miserable until i can leave, i could try to do something with my father's money but idk when will he pay me, he legally owes that amount so he has to pay or go to jail but the process might take years in order to get to that scenario.

again i'm sorry if i'm not making a lot of sense, i just had a horrible day and i've thought of posting here a couple of times but i've always shied (shy) away, i tried looking for help on the internet but i just found a lot of websites that help americans or europeans, i found a number for my country but they're not available 24/7 and they'd just tell me to suck it up and deal with it like most people do.",09Aug2018,1,
