0,"I just kind of want to get this off my chest.

I usually love life. I'm a happy, energetic person usually. I'm passionate about my hobbies, friends, and work. Usually.

But these last two years at college have been really hard for me. I would study all day, only taking breaks to hang out with friends, but I'm an introvert. I love my friends, but they just leave me feeling drained. I looked forward to going back to my hobbies during break, but I can't find the joy in them I used to. My writing used to fill me with life. I can't find the motivation to write anymore. I wake up in the morning thinking that I don't want to exist, which is strange because I know life is good, but it's like nothing can give me happiness anymore.

Sometimes I'm able to say to myself, ""No, I enjoy this,"" and I feel good for a bit, but it's like that fades away and I'm just left feeling empty. I feel panicky, like I'm in a do or die situation, even though nothing is wrong. But I never let that stop me. When I have things with my friends lined up, I get annoyed because I haven't had a day to myself. When I have a day to myself, I get annoyed because I'm not with my friends. I just feel miserable. Everything in my life is can't, and even when I'm on a date and with friends and should be happy, I'm not.

But at the same time, I get up for work. I'm functioning. I have an active social and romantic life. I do wonder that if there's something wrong with me, if working too much is a symptom. Sometimes it feels like work is the only time I'm happy. 

I keep thinking I need to try harder to be happy, but every step just leaves me feeling empty. ",21Dec2018,1

I'm handling my severe depression and various anxiety disorders fairly well. I'm diagnosed with ADHD too, but stimulants were terribly ineffective for me. By fairly well I mean I'm not missing work and can keep up appearances. Basic hygiene is met and I'm getting at least some of what I need to do done. I'm no longer actively suicidal. I'm still pretty spacey, my attention span is just nonexistent.

Going forward with my life, I'm finding that I have very little motivation and ability to truly manage my life. I'm also generally avoidant or just lazy; if it's hard or stressful I can't even bring myself to start it. Everything I've neglected when I was worse is so overwhelming and I don't know how to start, so I just avoid it. These issues were masked when my mental state was worse but now that I'm doing better, it's apparent that I'm not well adjusted.  


Is there therapy/coaching/personal assistant/literally anything that can help with creating systems to effectively run my life? To do lists don't help as much as they used to, I'm finally using a calendar effectively but that's about it. I'm just overwhelmed with work and home and interpersonal relationships.

I'm aware I'm definitely still depressed and anxious, but I feel I'm at the point that getting my life under control would be a more effective antidepressant than targeted therapy. I feel silly even asking. There are millions of time management ideas out there (Pomodoro timer, integrated calendars, bullet journaling, etc.), but they either don't work for me or I go back to my old ways. I want to change but don't know how.",21Dec2018,1

Now they don't talk to me anymore and basically stopped being my friends because im a drop out, they basically look down on me as well. I think i should just find new friends when i restart school again. But is it justified for them to be like this towards me?

I also constay feel as though someone is behind me when I'm walking. I often feel that I'm being watched through my phone by men, who are also spying/ tracking everything that I go on, on my phone. I have a severe fear of the number 6, I can't even watch that channel on tv even tho something I enjoy is on there.

I just need to vent. I feel like I can’t even form a complete thought. I can’t sort through any feelings. It’s all muddled. I can’t figure out what is what in my head, I feel so indecisive.

8,"As I am going on day 2 without my meds due to a screw up at the VA (did not ship my refill, then mail was lost, had to reship, do not have the freedom to just drive the 45 minutes to get a temp script on work days) I would just like to remind anyone who may be like me and occasionally just forget or more closely to my case, not do it if it's not convenient. 

Life is busy enough without mental health issues, and it is often for some of us all too easy to miss a day or two here and there. 

Yesterday I couldn't bring myself to brush my teeth before bed, something that 2 days before I was cherishing thw victory of doing so both am and pm foe the past 28 days. This morning instead of waking up before work and showering, as I told myself I would because I was too 'tired' to last night, I hit the snooze several times and was very nearly late to work.

Be kind to yourselves but also do the things necessary to take care of yourselves, even as small as they may seem.

I like this song. I’ve been playing it a lot. I like the music of it but I’m not sure how to feel about the lyrics. I guess it’s kind of... triggering? It’s very relatable and that kind of scares me because the song ends with the protagonist presumably killing himself. I also think about how it could be seen as romanticizing self-harm. But then how is it so different from someone telling their personal tale of trama? I honestly do not know. What do you guys think? 

Lyrics pasted below because yay you dont have to look it up now :) /tw implied 

“I tried it once before but I didn't get too far
I felt a lot of pain but it didn't stop my heart
And all I really wanted was someone to give a little fuck
But I waited there forever and nobody even looked up

I tried it once before and I think I might a messed up
I struggled with the veins and I guess I didn't bleed enough
But maybe I'm alive because I didn't really wanna die
But nothing very special ever happens in my life

Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be

I tried it like before and this time I made a deep cut
I thought about my friends and the way I didn't give enough
And I should a told my mother 'mom, I love you' like a good son
But this life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one

Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be, yeah

I tried it once again and I think I might black out
I should a left a letter but I had nothing to write about
My blood is all around me, I get dizzy if I stand up
The cutting part was easy but regretting it is so fucked

Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be

I tried it once again and I think I went too far
The man that I was meant to be
I cut a little deeper and the pressure stopped my heart
The man that I was meant to be
I couldn't tell my mother that I love her, I'm a bad son
This life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one”

I work for my dad’s business.). Needless to say, my dad is completely ignorant of mental disorders because he put me in sales. He says I just need to “work harder” to overcome my depression and quietness. I’m a 27 year old male.

14,"My family circumstances have been semi bad for me growing up. My older brother is almost 5 years older then me and didn't inherit the mental health problems I did from my Mum (untreated bipolar or manic depression) and Dad (anxiety).

&amp;#x200B;

Mum also put my older brother in a position where he was forced into playing a father role to me too as my Dad would work late nights at the bakery thus was always absent most of the time. Then to make it worse Dad was always shy around me and My brother and never really gave us any advice or communicated like a Dad should instead he just tried to condition us to listen to our Mum who has narcissistic traits on top of her untreated bipolar.

&amp;#x200B;

He has known about my suicide attempts, my addiction problems but never once out of shame or something went out and organised me help. Even when I asked for help or support his response was yeah what do you want me to do? Like as if it was a chore etc...Then other times him and his wife will attack me and say that I was stupid for trying to commit suicide or they go everyone has depression so what blah blah.  I never get any calls or texts asking how my mental health is yet I always try and communicate with them. Maybe it is because I am the younger and the not so successful one who has created trouble for himself intentionally because you know depression and anxiety gets you to do more positive then bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is quite interesting though as he has done nothing but use me for his operating business where he thought he could get away with paying me nothing for months or even 2 years then put debt onto me also which I am paying off.  Then on top of this I always see his 6 kids frequently and do some much for them a few days a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know now his hands are tied but I refer to the past and now. It is beyond unfair that a person who struggles with chronic depression and anxiety gets put down for it sometimes yet all they do is help.

17,"Let me preface this by saying I KNOW the stigma Im dealing with is false and I would never look down on anyone who has required hospitalization for their mental health before. It’s a very important service that is often needed to keep people alive and well. 

Ive always dealt with some suicidal ideation when shit gets real but it’s only gotten to an actual tipping point two or three times in my life (and none this year up until now).  I had an episode last week where I attempted but not in a way that required hospitalization and was corrected in seconds. Due to really hitting stride in therapy I actually told my therapist what happened and he asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. I immediately said no. My boyfriend also asked if he needed to take me to the hospital. I said no. I later had a major panic attack while driving and had to pull over and my main repeating thought was that they were going to put me in the hospital.

Its been a week and the suicidal thoughts are still there but Im in no danger of acting on them. Im in control. My therapist has asked if Id like to start seeing them twice a week now instead of once and Im having the same reaction as I did to being asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. Im freaking out and feel “crazy”. Ive been told Im not stepping backwards, just plateauing in my progress but then why the sudden change in how often I need to see my therapist? 

I think Im dealing with some internalized stigma because only “crazy” people have to be hospitalized. I KNOW thats not correct and I KNOW it’s a damaging thought but every time I think about how now I have to do check-ins with my therapist and the suggestions of twice a week instead of once, the thought is taking over that Im crazy, Im selfish, Im insane, I should be put away.

Any advice on how to negate these damaging thoughts? To fight that internalized stigma? I know these suggestions are coming from a place of wanting to make sure Im safe but I just cant seem to frame it that way. 

TL;DR Hospitalization was suggested and internalized stigma is eating away at me and making me panic even though I KNOW the thought/stigma is untrue.",21Dec2018,1

Kind of like that feeling you get in your head if you hit something so hard it sort of makes your head bounce off the surface (I don't really know if I'm explaining it right).

20,"I had just had a panic attack. 

I cried so hard. Harder than I have in a long time. First panic attack in awhile too. I thought things were getting better. I was 2 months or so free from the streak of panic that swept me for months and caused me to have an episode maybe once or twice or three times a week. But this was like all of it wrapped up into an episode that only truthfully lasted maybe a half an hour? 

It was odd. Different. Normally, I begin to panic, lose control, hyperventilate, and then my husband has to help me calm down. I become aware and am hit with a wave of complete exhaustion and a throbbing headache. But this time...this time it all happened at once. The hysterical crying and yelling. So hard my throat hurt. The difficulty breathing. It was so bad I choked on a sharp breath and fell to the floor. Even hit my head in the process. Then, I laid there. Alone. And somehow eventually the tears stopped. My breathing slowed. I got up and put myself into pajamas and then to bed. 

While I’m not proud of letting it get to a point of an attack, I’m proud I picked myself up from it. To me, that’s still an improvement. 

Disclaimer: While I’m mostly conscious, I still feel off. I’m sorry if this post doesn’t make any sense...I’m just alone and felt like I needed to tell someone. ",21Dec2018,1
21,"I've been feeling uncomfortable existing and suicidal for so long that it just feels like a part of my personality now. I don't even know if I have a personality other than depressed/anxious at this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel (and haven't felt) comfortable around most people, even my immediate family at this point. Somehow I've had a boyfriend for 8 years and he's pretty much the only person I feel at all comfortable around anymore. I feel terrible that he's had to go through all of this with me and I'm not really sure why he'd want to be around such a negative person, but he's still here.

&amp;#x200B;

I accidentally made friends at my last job, so I ended up quitting a few months ago. It was really stupid to just do that, but I had just gotten some money from selling some old belongings so I would be ok being jobless for a month or two (fortunately I was able to get a new, but lower-paying job a couple weeks later. They were really desperate for workers). I had been at my old job for a few years. I felt so bad about turning down coworkers' offers to hang out all the time, and I didn't like having to see them so often at work. I just sort of shut down when I have to be around people too much, and it gets even more difficult for me to talk to them. My mind goes blank, and I can barely even think. I can respond to really basic questions like ""how are you?"" but then I can't do much more than that. 

&amp;#x200B;

If my mind hasn't gone blank then I'm usually overanalyzing my behavior to try to avoid doing something that would seem weird/uncomfortable to other people. I think I end up coming across as being incredibly uncomfortable though, and then that makes other people feel uncomfortable. Which is ""good"" because then they won't want to talk to me/be around me and I can't hurt them further (it's not actually good, I know). It mostly just makes me feel terrible because the last thing I actually want to do is make people feel uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I just feel like it would be better if I were dead. I'm tired of making people feel uncomfortable or that I don't like them or people thinking I'm a stuck up bitch or really rude instead of just incredibly shy/awkward. All I'm really good at is just taking up space and getting in people's way. I'm not even living my life for myself, there's nothing more that I want out of this. None of the positive things in my life are enough to make it worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to kill myself before, but my boyfriend got home earlier than I was expecting and got me to the hospital. I couldn't do it again though. I can't hurt my family/boyfriend like that. I can't let them experience this pain that I've felt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to get help in the past, but nothing has really worked out for me yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen three different psychiatrists and received diagnoses of depression and GAD. Although, I think I've actually been suffering from social anxiety or avoidant personality disorder, which probably opened up the door for depression to join in, but all of the psychiatrists completely ignored my concerns about this or I just didn't explain my symptoms well enough (probably the latter now that I think about it).

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried six different antidepressants. I took them every day just like I was supposed to. None of them really helped, they just made my brain feel foggy and made my hands shakier than before. Some also caused increased sweating, which ended up making my anxiety worse (I was embarrassed about people noticing how sweaty I was, and worried that they would say something about it or I would make them feel uncomfortable).

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen four different therapists over the past few years, and I don't feel like therapy has been helpful at all for me yet. I feel like it made everything worse. All four therapists seemed like very kind, gentle, and understanding people, but I just couldn't do it. It was just another social event to dread every week. I didn't want to let them down like I always end up doing to people. I couldn't connect with them and got more uncomfortable being around them over time, just like I do with everyone else.

I know you probably didn't see similar cases as yourselves. Not many of us per communities.
The psychiatrists that are experienced with such cases as yourselves, doesn't know this because they don't care.
They don't know that the messages you are seeing from each specific musics or movies or books are identical messages.

As a person who went through what you are experiencing, I can tell you this.

You are not delusional.

Messages of people who went through what you are going through is what you are seeing.

The progress of what you are experiencing is adjustment to our society that has certain rules.

Messages from members of our society that shares same rules that you haven't realized of but experienced.

Brain on Fire is what you are going through.

The process can last short as days to long as decades.

The things you say to other people are obviously sounds delusional because they don't know the knowledge you gained of from the experience.

There are atleast few millions of us that went through what you are going through.

Of course the messages are being seen all over the place.

Members of our society they know as New World Order, are sending out inspirational messages through all media.

Most people just think they are music or movie or book, while you can pick up their messages from all of them.

Progress of receiving enlightenment is what you are going through.

Despite of many patients who told psychiatrists in regards of the Truth you know the name of from the experience, you are marked as delusional patient only for purpose of keeping their jobs as psychiatrists. 

If they truly tried to help, they would have noticed the messages are ""identical"" among patients.

Let me give you example why New World Order is connected with mental illness.


The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. ""Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does."" They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted.

Aldous Huxley in his book Brave New World.
See that name of the book?
Big hint right there.

Our perfect adjustment to our society through enlightenment.

Without a fuss among them.
Such like Katy Perry or Lady Gaga.

Certain rules we learned from experience that many of you probably don't even know how to express in words.

Do not speak of the Truth.
Reason their human voices are silenced.

It's currently 12:05 am, and I'm supposed to be alseep, but I'm not.

I've been thinking for a while. And I don't want to be sad all the time. Or apathetic. Or angry. But a lot of things have been pushing me in those directions lately.

I keep trying to convince myself that I'll find peace, but coping gives me a temporary high where I don't have to think about anything until I do. Then the high is over. Then I have to either face my problems or hurt myself trying to avoid them.

I think the only reason I'm alive right now is because I have goals.

I want to become an actor. Which might sound dumb, but I'm passionate for so many arts. I connect with them. And often at times I think art is the only thing I can truly lean onto. It's funny too, because I've developed an anxiety for showing my face. I don't feel worthy enough to exist at times. Like there's always better people, or someone who'll look down on me.

I don't really have ""family"". I have people I'm stuck with and attached to, but I don't think they love me like family. I don't have a chosen family. Or maybe I do, but I'm too scared to believe I'm actually loved by others. People lie.

I'm not happy.
And I'm not really sad or angry.

I just feel indifferent. Aside from my passions..

I want to change the world, and I want to be someone because right now I don't feel like a person. I feel like a tool. Or a robot.

Im impulsive sometimes, or lazy in others. Everything either makes me sad or happy.

I feel insane.

My family chalks it up to hormones. Or being ""female"". 

I told them I've felt very indifferent for a long time. I can't tell them I'm not a woman.
I'm scared to do anything around them, and now the ""daughter/sister"" place I have feels more like a role than anything.

It hurts me. And I want to tell someone, but I can't because I have to function in life. 

I'm sorry hah. I just needed to vent or whatever.

I really want to go to therapy. But my parent's refuse to think anything is wrong..because apparently something has to be wrong in order for you to get help.

  I’m already antisocial, an introvert and homebody so getting into these situations would be slim at the moment. This honestly has more to do with abusive relationships than anything.

44,"So I'll just copy and paste what I wrote in my journal. Apologies for the length, but I really need some help. Hopefully most of it will make sense;

So It’s been about a year since this nightmare episode of anxiety and depression. I took meds which seemed to have helped (though I’m not sure if it’s just a placebo or not, because I pretty much feel the same way I did before all the anxiety. I don’t feel much happier. But whatever, thats another story.

I’ve been seeing someone new recently. She’s really cool, and we really get along. But after a few dates which went really well, she told me she just wanted something casual, which really broke my heart, because I FINALLY had a connection with someone. So we decided to part ways, but we were both bummed because we both seemed to like each other. But she kept texting me, saying how she misses me and wanted to see me, though she felt guilty. I agreed, because I thought that maybe she’d change her mind if she got to know me a little better. It’s been a few weeks, we see each other maybe once a week because she has a busy schedule, which is fine by me. We have unprotected sex, which really is a great thing for me because I can never really orgasm while wearing a condom. She cooked me dinner. The other day, she invited me to come to a cabin in the woods next week with all her closest friends and her brother and sister in law. It sounded fun. We spent the other night in bed, had sex a few times, and I left her apartment really happy. The thought of being a few hours away at the cabin gave me some anxiety, but nothing bad. But I was really nervous that I’d end up getting there and having a panic attack.

The other day, I woke up and was a little on edge. A little anxious. It didn’t last long, but I still felt on edge all day. It happened again yesterday morning, but the anxiety went away. I chose not to smoke weed last night because I was nervous that it’d trigger bad anxiety. It got me thinking about what this girl wanted now. She treats me like I’m more than just a fuck friend, but I was scared of bringing it up, because I didn’t want to push her away. I just want some security, I want to know that if I open myself up for someone and let them in, that I’m not gonna get hurt if she feels differently.

This morning I felt a little anxious when I woke up, but went back to sleep and woke up feeling a little better. I still felt down. I felt alone. I started getting these weird cold chills I was getting last year when I was in the thick of my anxiety. I texted a crisis line, but all they did was give me articles about breathing exercises and stuff. That could potentially help me when I’m having an anxiety attack, but it’s this baseline anxiety. It’s like I’m on the edge of a knife. I’m waiting to tip over the edge into an anxiety attack. I just don’t know how to fix this, and I feel so alone in it. I called her and explained to her that maybe going to the cabin wouldn’t be a good idea for me. She understood. I opened up a little about my anxiety and other stuff. We even talked about us. But she said she’s just a little nervous about getting into something serious. She tends to be the ‘fixer’ in the relationship, and she doesn’t want do that again. She’s in a good place in her life. I feel like I’m slipping into a not so good place again, and I’m worried that she thinks I’ll rely on her. I’m worried I rely on her. The thought of being alone again fills me with an immense anxious sadness. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I ruined it. I feel she probably feels uneasy about being with me now. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this. My therapist is away, and I’m only seeing him on January 16th. I have like a week off next week, and the thought fills me with dread. I’ll be alone that whole time. I won’t have anything to do. I’ll get anxious. It could spiral out of control. I feel like I can’t talk to my best friend because she seems to reductive about everything. I just want someone to hold me and tell me everything will be okay. I feel like I need someone to talk to, but I have nobody.

47,"For about a eight months now, i've been not caring about anything that happens in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

As a little backstory, I was diagnosed with moderate to severe ADHD when I was 14. I've always been a shy kid, and had trouble making friends in high school. I've always suspected I have a form of social anxiety, because I've always been hesitant to say much when meeting new people out of the fear of being judged. This partly plays into my question, as these symptoms have been present since high school.

&amp;#x200B;

To elaborate a little, I finished my first year of college last May, and decided to take an extra semester off after summer due to money reasons. In my first year of college, I met tons of new people and made tons of new friends that I loved being around, and would usually socialize 3+ hours a day. In the period I took off of college, I've kept little to no contact with any friends I made during college (even my best friend, whom I basically spent multiple hours every day with at college last year). I haven't been keeping up with any of the group-chats I'm included in, and haven't really been talking to any other friends I made at college. I have, however, visited them once, and a group of my friends also came down to where I'm living right now to visit me once.

&amp;#x200B;

Its not that I don't enjoy socializing; I love being in the presence of people I trust and like talking to, but I just don't understand why I don't feel the need to keep in touch with anyone at all. It may partly be the social anxiety, as I am kind of ""nervous"" (if you can call it that) to say anything in a group chat or what not, but I don't know. Also, everything that has happened in the last year has been kind of ""numb"" to me. I don't really care about it, whether it be getting a promotion or losing 5 pounds of fat or what not. Obviously those are things I should feel happy about, but honestly I just feel indifferent about them, like I could care less if they happened or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I do not believe I am depressed. I have a positive outlook on life, and surprisingly rarely ever cry or even feel sad for that matter. I have motivation to do things I care about (e.x. working out, practicing basketball, making money). I know this is a long post, and I've tried to explain my situation as intricately as possible. If you're going through the same thing or have any comments, let me know, I'd like to hear.",21Dec2018,1

49,"My 19 y/o younger sister is bipolar and 'borderline' asperger, currently on meds. She has really low self-esteem and shrieks whenever she is annoyed (like a child), she even pulled my mom's hair when she got angry the other day.

My family is trying to get her into a college... and it's been a real struggle. Since she has such low self-esteem, she wants to get into the most prestigious top colleges, when in fact her school grades have never been good (Like grades B or C student). When we suggest applying for lower-tier colleges then transfering to a better one later, she gets into a full rage mode cos she thinks lower-tier schools are really bad and we are understimating her abilities which hurts her pride and that ruins her studying etc etc. 

The problem is that the college entrance is exam is only held annually in my country, so she has tried twice already and her grades are too low to apply to any good schools. 

Her low self-esteem seems to affect her life decisions a lot... she falls in love with any semi-decent guy who gives her attentions, she now wants go on a diet to become a fitting model or work in a club (cos they are 'cool'), and has plans to start a business that she has no background knowledge on whatsoever. 

I wanted her get some cognitive behavioral therapy but it's not available in my country :( Therapy didn't do much either. 

And latest update, she started again on her rants about getting into top colleges because randos on the internet say bad stuff about low-tier colleges. So I told her that comments on internet can be very biased so don't believe everything there, and also think it is good to have plan B and C in case something you want doesn't work out. Now she is texting 30+ messages on how I was totally supported by my parents and that I think I'm better than her?

We talk for a couple of hours at a time during those moments and I usually manage to talk her down and calm herself. This is all mostly about money, family and relationships. She has an anxiety disorder and has medication for that. But here are the problems:

\- It doesn't seem she's taking my advice.

\- She's not taking her medication.

\- I can't physically check on her because she lives on another continent.

\- Her boyfriend can't help much either because he's on another continent too.

\- She doesn't sleep properly because of the timezone difference between her and her boyfriend, and refuses to sleep properly.

\- She seems to be having these breakdowns every single day.

\- It's become really exhausting for me trying to talk her out of breakdowns each day of the week, only to have to do it again the next day.

\- Her boyfriend stays in calls with her till she falls asleep because it calms her, but he stays for hours at a time because sometimes she wakes up with nightmares and is pissed that he didn't stay, which is unfair to him.

52,"Ok so basically ever since I was very little (earliest memories of it I was probably around 6 or 7) I’ve had these weird moments of disassociation.

Everything in my life would feel totally ridiculous and fake, and I wouldn’t be able to fathom the idea that I was a real person. My body and my life felt like it belonged to someone else, or like I was watching it on tv. I would get stuck in this loop of (pretty distressing) thought, and nothing I would do could get me out of it. I had to wait for it to pass.

It didn’t happen for the least few years, but just yesterday when I was sitting in front of my mirror doing my makeup it happened again!! I could barely recognize myself. Again, I just had to wait for it to pass.

I've had therapists suggest quitting my job with nothing else lined up because it's emotionally unfulfilling and kicking my trans sibling out on the street because it stresses me out that he's too codependent. Thing is even if any of the above was a good idea I'd still be depressed af because my depression is hereditary. SSRIs aren't an option either because they trigger my anxiety.

For example, I've been stuck on the concept of corruption/loss of innocence for several months now. Even though thinking about it creates a lot of anxiety and discomfort due to events from my past, I can't help but mentally survey every idea I've thought up about it dozens, if not hundreds, of times every day.

I feel like, at this point, these types of obsessions have completely divided me from the real world. I'm not living my life. I'm just floating on by while thinking about an old deified house, a girl, or corruption for the n^th time today. There's no relief.",21Dec2018,1

I never cared about status or what people think about me but when I was in high school, I was fixated on being popular, I tried to be something I wasn't and was constantly bullied by my peers. I had dreams and aspirations but it was genuinely crushed emotionally. I even stole candy, cum and drinks to give out for free to people so people would like me. Flash forward to now and I'm18, homeless, only 125 bucks and no job because I can't keep a job anywhere and I have episodes of aniexty, depression and I switch moods constantly. Sometimes I think about killing myself and other times I think about getting a gun and killing others, although I wouldn't act on the latter. I'm self destructive, not focused/lazy, I lie about the slightest things, narcissistic yet feel shitty about myself, I have no direction in life and I feel like I'm in a dream, like this shouldn't be my life, I shouldn't be in this direction and how I could have done better all the time. I can't keep relationships because I don't feel I'm good enough for anybody. Sometimes I get so attached its obsessive and other times I can't give a shit about the person.

I have been drinking before work, during work, after work, and basically every second that I'm not asleep. I'm in a constant state of tipsy and have been for about a month now. I know that I should actually consider inpatient because I might need it at this point.

But for some reason, I just want to keep drinking myself to death. I don't care if I ruin my life. I don't care if I'm alone forever. About a month ago, I just stopped caring about anything. The only reason I am doing IOP is because my therapist was being really pushy and I can't say no to her without feeling guilty.

- started being really stressed out and was seeking ways to be peaceful. 
-never any history of mental issues 
-the rock in the family someone who we knew would be there. Self proclaimed “strong person”
-started forgetting small things
-started not being able to get decent sleep and told me he was having panic attacks in the middle of the night “but  [he’s] okay”
- started having lots of long calls at odd hours with his parents 
-started writing long notes on what he was feeling. Seemed suicidial in nature to those who read it. 
- posted Facebook post to tell all of his family to leave him alone during the Christmas holiday and not to call him, citing he wanted to focus on me and the kids. Completely abnormal. 
- started having long long vague conversations about how he was feeling and it was like he was on loop talking about the same thing different ways. 
- claimed he just wanted to get to the end of a busy work week then enjoy his 2 week vacation and give me and the kids the best Christmas ever and go out with a bang. 
- finally after a long explosive talk where he said I and others were gaslighting him to make him feel suicidal that I finally put my foot down and moved to kick him out. I asked if he wanted to go to a hospital and get help. He says yes
- take him to hospital and as we pull in the driveway he admitted he was going to kill him self. 
- tells the intake nurses the same thing. 
-they take him in and transfer him to a specialized place in the middle of the night. 


- now he’s calling me multiple times a day. His voice is childlike and he’s hallucinating and losing track of how long he’s been in there. He’s asking me to take him home, to bring him a Dr Pepper, to go out to sushi with him, to asking me if I’m pregnant or had a miscarriage.  I visited the first day but with no family in town and im not able to  take the kids with me and frankly he’s scaring the SHIT out of me I had his friend go last night and tonight his dad arrives from across the country to see him next.

So, this happened in March 2017. I was out with three of my friends for dinner, when this really bad stomach ache struck me. Now as is the case with friends, they started pulling my leg about it (associating it with taking a dump). 

As it turned out, that ache was the start of a year long battle with a stomach issue that led to me having to take a break from college. During this period, I was generally just recovering at home and wasn't really going out a lot. So I have developed some social anxiety, but it is fairly manageable (touchwood).

Unfortunately, for some reason this anxiety gets worse when I'm meeting those 3 particular friends. Most of the time when I'm going out with those 3 guys, my stomach starts getting really tight and weird, sometimes even leading to going to the toilet just as I'm about to leave. This does not happen when I'm going out alone or with family. It does not even happen when I'm meeting any one of those 3 guys. But the particular setting of meeting those 3 guys seems to make things worse.

I just wanted to know if this is just heightened social anxiety around these 3? Or is there an element of PTSD involved? I don't wanna stop hanging out with them as they are my closest friends, so any help would be much appreciated.",21Dec2018,1

for the past 2-3 years, every now and again, i would go through phases where it was a lot harder for me to eat or i wouldnt want to, but it never got out of hand until a couple weeks ago. I have been extremely depressed because of my living situation, boredom, and loneliness, and about a month ago my appetite left me again.

i stopped eating for a few days, had a borderline if not psychotic episode, then went to visit family for a week during thanksgiving. I ate pretty normally that week partially because i didnt want my family worrying about me and also because i was much happier spending time with them, but i still wasnt feeling like myself. when i got home though i stopped eating again a few days later

A month ago was the first time i stopped feeling hungry at all after not eating. My cognitive skills feel almost nonexistent. Basic tasks take me much longer to do and i cant think clearly. i get headaches, i dry heave, im irritable and ive been crying and having panic attacks almost every day, which has been unusual for me. This timing couldnt be worse because i just got a job, i have to start drivers ed soon, and feel like i can barely function enough even to do the things i normally enjoy. I have a bunch of other health problems that already impact my day to day living enough. 

I just want to feel normal again, i never WANTED to stop eating in the first place, but every time i open the pantry i just stare because the mere thought of having to put food in my mouth and chew it and swallow it feels disgusting. 

TL;DR: I just got a job and responsibilities are piling up, ive been struggling to eat for a month and its starting to really affect my health/cognitive functioning/wellbeing in general. 

Im mad and upset with myself i let it get to this point. I feel so lost and i dont know how to deal with this. If im really starving how long will it take for me to feel normal after i start eating regularly again? How do i force myself to start eating again?

102,"Over the past few months, I’ve been feeling a serious lack of motivation and energy for a lot of things I used to enjoy. I went from having maybe 2 or 3 days a month where I’d feel really sad or withdrawn, to around 7 or 8. I really enjoy practicing the guitar and reading, as well as texting friends, but I’ve lost a lot of the energy to do a lot of these things. My grades were pretty good, As and Bs, even in my AP classes, but recently, especially nearing the end of the semester, they’ve been slipping. I haven’t sat down and done any substantial homework in a long time, not like I used to almost every day just a few months ago. My room’s a lot dirtier and clothes are always strewn all over the place because it’s just so difficult to get out of bed and bother to clean them. I’ve been feeling really apathetic about a lot of things, and I sometimes find myself crying alone in my room.

I want to talk about some things that have happened; 2018 has been a very rough year for me and my family. Without getting into anything too personal, after the passing of a family member we’ve been having financial difficulties, so I haven’t been able to pursue some of my interests in music as much, and food is difficult to come by. I’ve had issues with anxiety, nothing serious but occasional anxiety attacks and difficulty in social situations for the past year now that’s been getting worse. A situation with a girl I had a massive crush and still think about from time to time not being interested in me led to me losing a best friend of about 3 years, serving to worsen my situation emotionally. I haven’t been feeling happy in a very long time, and major accomplishments like losing weight and winning competitions feel very empty to me. My mind has danced around suicide, but it’s not an idea I take seriously; I want to have a fulfilling life, but I lack the energy to try. I have been thinking about talking to a counselor for some help. 

It might be worth mentioning that I often sit alone in my room and daydream, for hours at a time. They usually consist of intimate (non-sexual) situations with people. I don’t really feel the need to be in a relationship, but I feel like I spend a lot of time romanticizing people and relationships in my head and it’s not healthy.

I don’t want to call it depression, because it’s only been happening for 2 or 3 months, and I often feel fine, just tired and a little withdrawn. From what I hear it’s often chronic. Talking to my older sister, who’s in college has been a big help, but I still feel stuck. Writing this post is making me tear up, because I really feel like life has played me a bad hand of cards.

However, whenever comments are made about me it goes along the lines of “beautiful and smart.” It’s wonderful to hear, but that specific compliment is thrown in my direction only when people are searching for something nice to say to me. It is the single compliment I receive. On birthday texts, smart and beautiful. When I got broken up with, he assured me I was still smart and beautiful.

Other then this I feel like I cant feel, like I get into real dark moods and i cant feel anything but then on the other hand I get over emotional and I can lose my shit. It's all super confusing. I'm also really good at lieing to myself and others it's only small lies but I cant help it I'm so good at it I believe my own lies and they become apart of my reality. 

My friend last night made me realise something was wrong with me I don't know maybe theres not but I'm worried and I feel like I'm losing sight of who I am.

110,"For the past 2 years I’ve been dizzy, and in the past 3 months it’s been getting worse. It almost feels like my mind and consciousness is numbed down and I can’t be myself anymore. I’m scared.. the past 2 weeks I’ve been losing my balance, and each day I’m getting more and more depressed and people are starting to avoid me. The past month I haven’t been able to look people in the eyes. What’s wrongs with me? I wasn’t always like this?! I’m really contemplating killing myself soon if it keeps getting worse. I’ve already talked to my friends and family about it but they just say I’m over thinking everything. But my life and perception is really spinning out of control. It seems like everyone is doing life for me and making decisions for me and I respond with one word answers. I’m a piece of shit.

Please.. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m about ready to just let my life go on auto pilot (even though that’s how I’ve felt for the past 2 years) for the next couple months and just not do anything with my life. Just let my mind collapse. ",21Dec2018,1
111,"After a mental break a few years ago I moved in with my brother in a major U.S city. I was on a couple prescription pills and these made me have no concern for others feelings. They also made me feel manic and eat very little. I made all kinds of friends and tried tons of drugs. I moved back home after a while because I was put on new meds that made me lethargic and anti-social. 
Ever since then I’ve had a hard time keeping friends and communicating. I drink heavily, and I avoid people at all costs. I miss who I was in that city. 
Today my friend texted me saying “san francisco ‘’my name’ was my favorite”.  He sent me some pictures of myself from back then that i’d lost a while ago. 
It made me so sad and sick looking at these old pictures of myself. I was beautiful, I looked happy. I was skinny, wanted back then. Now i’m overweight, an alcoholic, dealing with ptsd. I can’t imagine going on living like this. Wishing I was in the past.

112,"Hey. Let me begin with an introduction.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 20 year old guy from Europe. Ever since I was a little kid in the first grade of elementary school, I remember being shy. Trouble and hesitation joining the conversation due to overthinking most of the time about negative outcomes I might experience if my input isn't perceived well. I guess I needed affirmation. During my school years, in some particular cases people would suggest I'm not the most attractive kid there was, and I'd be the type to laugh it off, but going home... stuff like that corrupted my mind little by little. I found playing games to be a great safe-space of sorts, and so my extreme seclusion begun. From 5th grade (1-8 elementary) I have spent my time in precisely this order, go to school, once I arrive home, sit on my PC and play whatever. I never went out with a group of friends... I never even had a group of friends I've experienced life with... For 8-9 years now I've had 0 friends. Sure, acquaintances here and there briefly, but not a single friend... not a single memory, nothing. Always kept thinking, you know... let me get to high school, then I'll turn it around. So there we are, high school. Extreme anxiety waves fortified by now degraded self-image and general sense of self worth, I was nothing short of a punching bag for everybody, even the lowest ""ranked"" people that attended the school could take a dig at me and I'd be defenseless, stuck in my own warped reality... It's funny, what 8-9 years of minimal interaction can do to a person. After graduating school, surprise, I have not once met up with a high school buddy (2 years now) so, that's 2 years of home alone. Did a get a job though, going there everyday I noticed that with each successive day in a social surrounding I grew more and more confident and expressive, sure, the warped perceptions were still there, but they were slowly beginning to lose the battle.  Now that I've quit the job due to unrelated reasons, and in the transition zone trying to find another one... one thing bothers me. I used to say, after that... after this, I'll turn it around and be happy and do things I'll regret later, as any young person should... but with each day I grow older and nothing changes. Even at work, that I was at, I just couldn't make friends... all it ever was familiars. Do I have to re-learn how to interact with people... no. I know I have it, there is this blockade of warped perception of me (as physical so lingual as in not ever being sure what to say... essentially overthinking) I think I'll finally throw the towel... I have a problem, and I don't know how to solve it. How to get rid of this anxiety in the back of my head ruining my life day in... day out. So ambitious, yet so burdened... so far, my life is taking a self-destructive route and I don't know how to turn the ship around. If you can suggest anything to me, please. Because I can't keep saying I know, I know... because do I really? ",21Dec2018,1
113,"How do I come to terms with unintelligent decisions I made due to extreme duress and mental illness? I somehow managed to graduate college but I truly wish I had dropped out so I could go back. Now it's too late. I used to love school and learning and I feel like I was robbed of my final year to hone my knowledge, meet friends with my major, and make any connections with professors. I went from a previously straight A student to just barely graduating because of untreated PTSD. I was delusional for a long time that things weren't as bad as they were and that things would magically be okay somehow if I pretended I was okay, to the point where I was even still trying to apply for grad school because I had wanted to so bad for so long. Then the delusion shattered and my life fell apart. Now I still can't even read a book because my cognitive faculties have been destroyed and I don't know how to move forward. I feel like if I was put into an academic environment again it would help me regain some of my cognitive function but I have no way to do that now because I already have my undergraduate degree and it would be foolish to apply for a Master's in my current state when I don't remember anything I learned from school and don't even know if I am capable of learning anymore. I have forced myself to work as much as I can but I keep having more breakdowns. I have spent thousands on ""snake oil"" treatments out of pure desperation and hopelessness and I feel so pathetic and ashamed. I know I am supposed to accept the past because it is unchanging, but I don't know how to move forward and I feel so hopeless. I feel like my brain has been broken and I grieve for the person I used to be",21Dec2018,1
114,"Something that I've been asked a couple of times during treatment assessments and suchlike is ""Do you have hallucinations?"", to which I've always said no.  

But it occured to me tonight, how would I know if I'm just hallucinating things that could be entirely normal?  

I've never seen a unicorn or an alien in the garden or talking furniture, but would I know if someone walking by isn't real? Or a bird or animal outside, like a rabbit I saw? Or a fly I'm trying to chase out of the window? Or other incredibly dull things like that.  

Is this a possibility or are hallucinations always something completely obvious? ",21Dec2018,1
115,"Someone has hurt me real bad that I cannot ever have any relationship with that person ever. What if we just cannot forgive someone in this life despite our best wishes? 

Can we truly move on and heal so as to not let the hurt affect anymore. I don't want any scars to remain because I don't think I deserve it. ",21Dec2018,1

117,"Everyone assumes that I'm managing things somehow. I'm lying and saying that I'm going to my seminars and lectures, but I'm missing most of them, only tackling 4 of my courses somehow. 

If I were to tell anyone how shitty and sad and depressed I feel, like someone in my family or my two friends, they'd say something like ""Okay you might feel like shit but you have to do something to get better. I don't even see you trying💁"" or it'd sound something like ""but you're not doing anything! How can you even feel overwhelmed and shitty when all you're doing is sit in front of your laptop!""

So I'm keeping this little secret all to myself because I'm afraid of being judged and not being understood. I'm sorry, I'm just not strong enough. I'm sorry, but there's just no hope and motivation and energy in me to do anything or to plan my future. I'm not expecting to make it til 21. So yeah...no need to plan ahead. 

I just gotta pretend long enough. ",21Dec2018,1
118,"I’m really struggling at the moment and my ‘Christmas’ with family etc., officially starts tomorrow and I want to try and remain calm, but I’m incredibly anxious and feel out of control with the festive period, then my birthday, then new year looming over me. So, just wondering if anyone has any tips on remaining calm and safe over the holidays? Thanks ",21Dec2018,1
119,Got together with my highschool friends today (I’m a college freshman) and I barely  contributed to conversation at all? I was just smiling and nodding and laughing along...I just never have anything anymore to talk about. I’m a music major but have basically lost all my passion for playing the violin and just don’t really care anymore. I’m really irritable at my parents and just want to be alone all the time. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. ,21Dec2018,1
120,"Long time bipolar/borderline (hopefully getting a proper diagnosis early next year) depression/anxiety sufferer. 

I dunno if my mind is playing tricks on me but whenever I look at anything for longer than 2 seconds, it begins to go wavy/morph slightly, like whatever I'm looking at is breathing, similar to the very early signs of tripping on shrooms. I've taken shrooms like 4 or 5 times and microdosed (last dose was like 3-4 weeks ago), haven't taken a big amount for like 8 months.

Should I be concerned? I've noticed this for a few weeks but sort of pushed it to the back of my mind. If I don't move my eyes around constantly, stuff just goes all morphy and wavy, and looks like stuff is moving apart from each other. 

Am I just being dramatic? It's not scary or anything, but it doesn't seem right. Thanks.",21Dec2018,1
