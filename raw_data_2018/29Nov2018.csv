0,"Growing up, I thought my childhood was normal.

Doesn’t everyone’s dad deal?

Doesn’t everyone get taken on those deals?

Doesn’t everyone have to entertain addicts while their dad ‘gets the stuff?’ When I realised just how different my life was, I kept it to myself.

For the longest time, I bottled it all up inside as a defence mechanism. 

This was a double edged sword. I survived school (minimal bullying and judgement), but I didn’t have many true connections - how could I when I wasn’t open about myself?

Now I am managing the recovery process. Talking to therapists as well as online with you all, has helped me to find people with similar pastels and life circumstances.

I have learnt that I’m not alone, and I’m telling you now that neither are you.

Thank you to you all.

1,"so I'm not getting into detail because its way too much to type and I don't think I could even find the right words to describe the shit I've been going through. I've had so much happen to me throughout my life and shit just gets worse all the time. it's one set back after another. today I got some bad news and it's just gotten me to a point where I feel this is all completely unbearable. I can no longer handle the anxiety and pain that I feel. it's physically unbearable. I'm crawling in my skin with hopelessness and I genuinely just feel so fucked with stress and anxiety and sadness that I just need out of my body. I need to escape. I can't tolerate feeling this way anymore. I seriously just can't. I feel like I'm about to explode, but all I can do is sit here staring at nothing. I need this to be over, NOW. if I wasn't such a baby and if I wasn't so worried about upsetting my mother, i would seriously just kill myself. that's the only thing I can think of to make any of this better. it's the only way out. the only other thing I can think of is to get black out drunk or to do a bunch of drugs until I can't feel this anymore. I just need this to stop. how the fuck to escape my body without killing myself",29Nov2018,1

3,"Someone that I know on social media posted that we all need to reach out to those in trouble after she tried to commit suicide. This wasn’t her first attempt. I agreed with her, and I did reach out especially since I have severe depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD

I empathized, related, and offered to listen in case she ever needs to vent. She didn’t even look at my message, and now she’s back on social media posting about meeting up with people.

It’s totally cool if she didn’t want help from me since she and I aren’t friends. We are acquaintances at best, and I met her through a class I took last year. We have interacted and talked several times. But idk, I just find it a bit...not sure what the right word is. It just rubs me the wrong way

I’ve also seen this from other people. I’m in a local group on Facebook to find like minded people and hang out and make new friends. I see posts all the time about how they’re lonely and want friends. I’ve reached out to a few and invited them to come to events with my friends, and they simply don’t respond

Are they just seeking attention or validation? ",29Nov2018,1
4,"Often I feel stuck and can't bring myself to move or do anything, and I am wondering what this is and if anyone has experienced this. For example, it will be time for me to take my lunch break at work, and I just cannot move from my desk, so I spend my whole lunch hour just hoping to go to lunch, and never actually going.

  
For example, I will need to go to the grocery store, and I just cannot bring myself to move, and I start counting minutes like ""if I leave now, the grocery store is 15 min away, and it closes in 40 minutes, so I only have 25 minutes to shop."" and 5 minutes later, ""if I leave now, 15 minute walk, closes in 35 minutes, only 20 minutes to shop"" and keep doing that until there's no time left.  


What is this? Has anyone felt it? What do you do?",29Nov2018,1
5,"To start, as a little preface, I used to be suicidal, and made two attempts on my own life. After the second one, I voluntarily admitted myself to a hospital to get help. That was 2 years ago, and after a week in the hospital, about 6 months of therapy, and medication, I got the help I needed. 

These past couple of weeks have taken a huge toll on me. The troubles of life, and just how unsure the future, left me feeling like I did all that time ago. I was building up a lot of negative emotion, and had my first non ironic thought about suicide since I went to the hospital. 

Knowing what I know now, and remembering what my lovely therapist taught me, I talked to someone about it. Before I left work today, I went up to one of coworkers, gave her a hug, and just started crying. She, having dealt with a lot that I have as well, stayed with me, and comforted me as I wept. 

After my tears dried, I remembered why I was so depressed 2 years ago. I NEVER showed my emotions, or cried. I felt goddamn fantastic after I got done crying. 

The point to why I'm sharing my story is to remind you, encase you needed it, that it is okay to cry, and to talk to somebody about how you feel. I'm certain all you lovely people know that already, and I did too, I just forgot I did tell today.

P.S. 
Paige, if you happen to be reading this, thank you so much. ❤️",29Nov2018,1
6,"I am only 19, almost 20 years old, and I am too scared and depressed about my future. A huge reason why I believe it is important to vote and be engaged in politics. But sometimes, its just to sad to think about.

I live in America and I worry about the healthcare system, and all those people not being treated for their illnesses as well as the fatalities due to not having enough money. I get sad that some billionaires don’t even donate an atom of their wealth to those in need. I get sad that people who are too sick or ill can’t go to school or get their dreams fulfilled. It makes me feel guilty that I can’t help.

With healthcare system and global warming, I am also anxious about money in case of emergencies. Bless those who lost their homes to the California wildfires. Bless everyone who are refugees, have been involved with ICE or have dealt with trauma that is still fresh. 

I just want to think about the good things in life. Technology, games and volunteer/donation organizations keep me going. I just want more hope that the future for me and everyone will be okay but it feels bleak considering the debt people have due to college, healthcare, and etc. Also maintaining a social and family life too. I just feel like life is too hard for me and my guilt and sadness for others make me weak. ",29Nov2018,1
7,"I'm at war with my own mind. There is so much to type, i thinknots fitting tonstary with my back story.

When i was only 2 years old, my mom had cheated on my dad, and they got divorced. I was taken to live with my mom and the guy she cheated on mt dad with. Now get this. I remeber times when my mom and dad where still together, but the time my mom and this guy where together, i can't remeber a thing. But I do know he tried to falsely accused my dad of sexually abusing me by taking pictures. I'm wondering if it was him. To this day, I'm still so reluctant to be sexual or show off my body in any way.

Well, after that guy, my mom moved on to a new one. This one is my first brothers father. Well, this guy, he is a narcissist. So when he didn't know how to handle my anger issues and adhd, when i would get sent home from school, he would lock me in my room all day and night. No food. No water. And i would have to scream to use the bathroom. He would lavish me with gifts, then as punishment, take them all away at once, leaving me with nothing but a bed and a dresser of clothes. Once I was lucky and he left a tote bin! This lasted until I was 7 years old and said I wanted to live with my dad.

After I moved out, it took my mom two years to divorce him. Burnt also took me until I was 10 years old to reach 40 pounds, the weight I had to be to get out of my car seat. It didn't help that, my step mom, while my dad had married shortly before I moved in, had put me on medicine that made me not want to eat.

This, this is the woman that I spent ten years with. My step mom. She always made me feel like I was never doing things correctly or good enough. That I was stupid. Annoying. Worthless. Always to blame. fact, she always blamed me for her marital problems. She would tell me to calm down, when I was simply trying to express that i was happy or excited. If i showed or told her about how i felt, she would make me feel like my emotions where all my fault. Then, there where my fears. I peed the bed till I was 9 because I was scared to go downstairs, passed her room. I was scared of bugs, and she would push me through spider webs. She would keep me away from people as much as possible, so I grew to fear interaction.

Now, today. I see figures out of the corners of my eyes. I am always angry. With a mixture of sad. I dont feel like myself some times. I need helpxhelp because I can't control it.",29Nov2018,1

15,"26yo M, in Northern Ireland. 

I have suffered severe depression for years and been on and off antidepressants. I've been diagnosed with what's called a 'functioning suicidal' which is where I am regularly wanting to kill myself but at exactly the same time I'm also aware that it's a fleeting feeling and that I know it's not the solution for me.

However since March I was made redundant from what I thought was a secure job. I have recently gotten back into work about and month and a half ago (finally) but it's a temp job working nights.

The isolation and financial worries over the past year has been really really hard on me, during the redundancy I spent all day alone and saw my partner for only a few hours each night and now I work nights with a lot of people who don't talk to me, I feel even more isolated.

I've been extremely lonely this year and I've tried taking myself off of Citalopram because I don't feel they are benefiting me in any way.

The thoughts of killing myself are getting darker and darker and I'm finding it harder to cope and not action on them.

It's exhausting being awake and alone all the time with only my thoughts to keep me company. It's draining and I just don't feel comfortable or even content anymore. 

I see all my friends whom I would have been previously quite close to all hanging out and being happy and running around together and my partner gets to spend her days (albeit in work) surrounded by friends our at the weekends with her friends. 

I feel like I've been forgotten about, like no one understands the way I'm feeling or should even care. No one contacts me or messages me just to see how I am. I am sitting in my car at 1.30am on my lunch break almost crying  while everyone else lives their lives or is spending their nights sleeping.

I don't know who to talk to or even how to talk to someone and even begin trying to explain the fuckery going on in my head.

I didn't know exactly what to say I've just been spewing whatever comes to my head. I guess I'm reaching out for something, I don't know what but I guess I am. ",29Nov2018,1

17,"sorry if the writing sucks and if this is boring, it's really not that exciting i just think its whack what happened, 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, so i haven't really talk about how i felt about this to many people, but around 3 weeks ago i was involuntarily admitted into a psych ward,  and it sucked.  I am a first year psychology major (lol) and I've felt depressed and a bit suicidal for the lat 4 ish years.  Tbh it really is not anything serious,  i have never tried to or considered killing myself, and the depression isn't crippling.  SO i decided to go to my college's mental health services thing one week for an evaluation and the lady said i should be fine with probably one session of therapy a week and should maybe start some antidepressants.  The next week i come in for a second evaluation by another lady, and i tell her the same exact stuff.  I told her i did not plan on committing suicide or would ever do it, but that it was a kind of annoying thought i would have occasionally.  She asked me if i were to kill myself how i would it,  i like really did not want to answer, but i said ODing on pills because it seemed easy and painless.  The next things that happened sucked hard and tbh i dont remember it super clearly, but she starts talking about hospitalization and stuff and then eventually says that i have to go to a hospital's psych ward for like 2 days (i ended up staying for 5).  I was obviously pretty distressed and started crying like pretty hard and begged her not to send me there because i had classes and stuff, and i didn't want my parents to know or anything, but she said something about how she couldn't be sure i wouldn't kill myself, even though i literally told her i would never do it,  she was pretty uncaring throughout the whole thing.  So she signs some papers and stuff and then calls the POLICE to take me to the hospital, they patted me down in the hallway which was super lame and they brought me to an ambulance that took me to the hospital,  when i got there all my stuff was taken away and i was pretty much put in a emergency room bed for two days instead of going to the psych ward straight away for some reason,  it was around this time i told my parents where i was,  they obviously freaked out so yeah.  I passed the time in the ER by watching cartoons and staring at the wall which was pretty awful but it was ok i guess. after two days in the ER i went up to the psych ward and i kid you not, they literally did NOTHING  there.  There was around 30ish patients with 4 nurses, 2 doctors and 2 social workers,  the days consisted of getting your vitals taken every few hours, meeting with a doctor for 15 minutes, meeting with a social worker for 15 minutes, going to a group therapy thing for 20 minutes and then lying in bed or walking around the halls for the rest of the day, there was a room with a TV but it was always playing sports so.  i was suppose to leave after 2 days but they decided to keep me for 1 more day because they wanted me to do a phone evaluation with a therapy place before i left,  there never was a phone evaluation and one of the cool nurses told me thats not really a reason to keep me there because i could have just called the place once i've left myself.  I ended up leaving the next day without actually doing anything significant.  Now that i've left i could say that i am not better at all, and i'm pretty sure i'm a lot worse, i now have a lot of random anxiety pangs, i haven't gone to therapy in a while because tbh i'm kind of scared, and i missed a ton of work and pretty much failed two tests because of the whole week of classes i missed.  Also i got the bill for the stay and it was $10,000 which is fantastic.  Idk i can't help but feel like it was a scam, they kept me for way over the time they said they would, and also another guy i met there was suppose to stay for 2 days too but they kept him for 7.  It just feels so shady to me and some people i've talk to about it said its the school covering it's ass because if someone were to kill themselves it'll make the school look bad, and by sending them to the hospital they can make some money (part of the $10,000 is paid to the school) , i dont know. can y'all tell me what your think? because idk bruh",29Nov2018,1

I actually script our sex sessions. I live in my head, a lot. So I like to make what's in my head a reality. I tell them what to say/do , how to say it/do it, when to say it/do it, how to respond, how to touch me, etc.

i have suffered from chronic idiopathic insomnia and a normally not too bad case of GAD since childhood. i’ve recently been struggling with a TMJ dysfunction (nasty jaw bone shit) that’s making it almost impossible for me to sleep at all. this has made my anxiety crippling and made me extremely acutely depressed, irrational and volatile. 

but more importantly. between depression and my stupid fuckin jaw i really can’t eat much and have lost a lot of weight. i wasn’t massively heavy before. a bit overweight but nothing you’d even really notice. now i’m on my way to being p thin and am losing weight really fast. while i am a woman, i’ve never really fallen into the traps of worrying too much about that stuff and i was always really glad. problem is now, when i look in the mirror i see a big ol fat piece of shit. 

is this a result of some really severe depression that will lessen as the depression eases off a bit? is that a thing that happens? or is this something else that’s sprung up while i’m vulnerable that i have to deal with now?

22,"I went through college, even my masters. That makes me feel like I should be able to function, but I did everything I needed to do when I could do it, and procrastinated when I couldn't.

When I started hearing voices, dissociating, and having debilitating panic attacks (one of which landed me in the hospital), my husband agreed that I might need to quit. I tried to do things here and there to make money, but I literally can't force myself to do anything super productive. We live near an airport and every time a plane flies over the house I panic b/c I think there's a nuke coming.

I also “plan” in my head what I want to say to someone, but most of the time I don’t end up saying it.

32,"Long story short, I’ve always been a person prone to anxiety (I worry a lot, I’m a perfectionist, etc). I would personally say that I definitely had anxiety but consider my mental health to be otherwise good. I’ve never been to see any sort of mental health professional. Recently in the last month I’ve suddenly started having panic attacks - in the summer I was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect that is relatively stable but requires monitoring but other than that I haven’t really had anything that would add new stress in my life. The first attack happened about a month ago and consisted of severe feeling that I was dying, dizziness, tunnel vision, nausea, etc. I ended up getting a full cardiac work up and all was completely normal. Today I had another similar episode. These attacks seem to come out of no where, and it’s very terrifying when it happens. My husband tries to help but it understandably causes him stress to see me so unwell. 

My question is to other people who experience this - what did you do to help when you experience the attacks? Has anything helped you to prevent the attacks? I really don’t want my new normal to be experiencing these on a regular basis.. thanks! ",29Nov2018,1
33,"1.) I have murderous thoughts. I guess this doesn't really matter, since I've heard it's normal to a certain extent; as long as I don't follow through on the thoughts. I still find it a little odd that I'm thinking about killing someone, but that's besides the point. 

2.) I find myself superior to the others around me. I make fun of people; sometimes it's to make myself feel better for being such a shitty person, or I simply just do it without reasoning. I know there's always someone better than me, and that makes me frustrated. I want to be the best at everything. I have a fear of bad grades, I have a fear of people thinking my outfit is disgusting or the fact that I'm too loud when I talk. I only care about certain people's opinions. The opinions of people who are lower than me mean absolutely nothing. I accept criticism from people who I find to be worth my time; people I like. Getting people down and making them upset fuels me. I like it when they feel the urge to hurt themselves because of my words.

3.) I have a short temper. If someone pisses me off, I immediately snap back. I know I should be thinking about what I say before I actually speak it or type it out, but I do it impulsively. I end up hurting them more than they hurt me. I don't usually feel bad, because I think they deserve it. In conclusion, I get irritated very quickly.

4.) I notice how bad I am at talking about something other than myself. I just,, have so many things to say about myself. I can speak to my friend about them, but I'll soon turn the conversation towards me and make it about myself. Sometimes I can't help it, and it simply just happens without me noticing. I love the conversation to be about me, really.

I know I should be getting professional help, but speaking to my parents is going to be difficult. That's why I'm asking the Internet.",29Nov2018,1

&gt; Well, I need the rent money on the first!

“Wait... I heard most companies or businesses let you choose which day you pay your bills...”

&gt; I don’t give a fuck what you heard. Rent is due on the first!

“Right, some random guy said rent is due on the first so it must be so!”

47,"For as long as I can remember, waking up has always been a struggle for me. It’s not that I’m a heavy sleeper and I can’t get up, it’s that I *won’t* get up. It doesn’t happen when I wake up in the morning, it’s only when I’ve fallen asleep late at night somewhere and someone tries to wake me up before I can fully fall asleep. It takes a long time for loved ones to wake me up, but when it’s friends or people I’m not very close with, I wake up easily most of the time. When I do finally wake up, though, it’s terrible. I’m very irritable, petty, demeaning, and have gotten physical one time. I already have a bit of anger issues as well, and this can be seen in my immediate family. My mom, brother, and sister are all like this but none have gotten violent before. 

The one time I was physical was with my now ex girlfriend. I fell asleep in her dorm, and as a 6’7” 250 pound guy, I took up all of the space of her bed, so she no longer had a bed to sleep in and needed me to get up. She spent almost 20 minutes trying to get me up, starting with just asking, then yelling, and shaking me, then as the time passed, she starting hitting, slapping, and pinching me. She finally woke me up when she poured a cup of water on my back, and when I got up, I shoved her against the wall, then tried to leave and she tried to keep me there to apologize and make sure I didn’t leave angry, but I just shoved her away from the door again and said “Goodnight, bitch”. When I’m tired or just waking up, it’s not me. I’m a completely different person. The worst part is I’m aware of my surroundings while people are trying to wake me up, but it’s just I can’t make myself wake up or come-to.

She’s talked to her mom about it and her mom told her I was abusive and I feel like she’s right. How do I work towards stopping this behavior?

49,"Hello, I normally don't post anything. I normally just lurk around on reddit and share funny posts with my wife. I really  need to let this out and am I  need of advice, because I am clueless as to what to do next and how to go about it. Anyway I'm in my early 30s , from South Carolina, married with 2 children. I have a twin brother that I love more than anything. I know it may seem awful to some but my twin brother comes first in my life, even my wife and children. 

Just to try to help you understand one of many reasons I feel the way I do about him. For starters, I owe him my life....literally. Early in our careers (2007) as electricians we worked on a job together as electrician helpers. This job was doing all the electrical installations in a new K-12 school being built. The day I will never forget and got my second chance in life started with me laying on top of a new science lab wiring up a 240VAC exhaust fan. My brother standing at the base of this extension ladder prepared to hand me anything I needed. I was in the process of stripping the neutral being fed from the panel, which was down the hall at least 100 feet away from where I was working, when I heard my foreman shout from down the hall ""I'm closing the breaker""! Before i could respond the neutral grabbed ahold of me and did NOT want to let go. I've been careless before and got ""popped"" by a hot wire with 120VAC load. You shake that off after a few mins. This was something else and in that moment I knew it. I remember trying to snatch my hand way from the wire with no luck at all. I tried to scream but couldn't. I was paralyzed and quickly came to terms that this was it for me. My luck finally ran out. This wasn't a ""pop"" that you shake off, this was what every electrician fears....full on-totally fucked electrocution.

My feet were hanging off the edge of the top of the science lab with the extension ladder inches away. When the circuit closed, my entire  body started to shake violently causing my feet to knock again the ladder giving my  brother instant confirmation that I wasn't having a good time. He quickly climbed the ladder, grabbed my pants and pulled me off the exposed wire. Before I could thank him I rolled over and puked. I'm sure you can imagine the verbal thrashing my foreman received soon later. So now you understand a little at least.

Me and my twin were recently reunited about 4 months ago. He lived in California for 6 years working a job he loved. Obviously it got to a point that he was tired of missing home and I did what I had to do to make sure he got here. While he lived in California he got married, getting divorced, come out as gay ,which I support and never changed the way I viewed him as my brother or as a man. There's absolutely nothing he could do to change that. The only thing that I was upset about when he came out as gay is that I wasn't the first to know, he told mom first. He lived on California around a year openly gay and seemed comfortable and happy most of the time until he had a mental breakdown. He had a lot on him....pressure from his high demand job where mistakes cost millions, going through a divorce, being away from home and lost of other things. 

He called me one day calling what I would call uncontrollably. He finally broke and I knew it. I knew it before he called. I sensed it. Not to get sidetracked but you may think I'm crazy but we have always been able to sense when the other is in emotional distress, even being 2,000+ miles between us. Let's just say we always knew when we were about to receive a call and to be prepared to give support no matter what. With that being said, when I answered that call from him, the first this he said was ""I want to come home"". That's all I needed to hear. I loaned him the money to make the trip back home. 

When he finally got here, I felt complete. I felt like I had balance in my life again. He lives with me and my family and I would love to keep it that way. I was able to help get him a fulltime job with the company I work for. I see him everyday now and that makes me so happy it brings me to tears typing this sentence.

Finally to the point of this post. Thanks for hanging on this far. Late one evening after work me and him were winding down sitting on my livingroom couch talking. Not sure what brought it up but I remember saying that I can't remember hardly anything before the age 11. He said that he remembers a lot from our childhood and it wasn't a pleasant one for him. He revealed some events that were dark and disturbing. Things that I never could have imagined possible. These things have been keeping me up at night since. 

I remember visiting him in the hospital when we were kids but only that one time. 3 things that I find disrupting about this is that 1 he was there as a mental patient for a year, 2 I don't remember my brother not being there or going to school alone for a whole year, 3 I've never thought to ask why he was there. It seemed like my mind blocked out that curiousity for some reason I can't understand. 

What do I do??? I must have repressed memories because 11 years is a lot that I can't remember. I have a problem with that. However, I'm terrified to discover what repressed memories could be hidden away. I feel like I need to know what I'm repressing at the risk of a mental breakdown. I need help. I need to know where to start. Any advice would be most appreciated.",29Nov2018,1

I’m not sure I chose the right career path but honestly I can’t think of another one that would suit me. I just feel useless. Recently I’ve been having some pretty dark thoughts about death...I’m not suicidal and would never kill myself but sometimes I think about dying and how life would just be easier if I didn’t exist because everything just seems so hard. Is that a normal feeling to have or should I seek help?

I’m also on Lupron to treat a condition called endometriosis, and apparently that has side effects of severe depression and suicidal ideations, so I’m not sure if that’s contributing. My doctor prescribed me oxycodone before I went on Lupron because I was having terrible cramps and I still have some leftover, but I asked my dad to hold onto them because I was having thoughts of abusing them (because they made me feel good and, again, I didn’t really care about what happened to me).

51,"Hey everyone, as the title suggests I am have a question about my emotions. Firstly I’ll state that I have Bipolar 2, social anxiety, ADHD and (possibly) Aspergers. And married with two kids. 

I am finding myself having somewhat selective emotions. I can have emotions for my family, close friends and the like but I have a hard time registering anything else on an emotional level. I can see the situation should evoke emotion, recognise that it could be a problem, give honest and sincere help/advice but I FEEL basically nothing. 

A weird example is this. My uncle is dying and I feel nothing for him. He did contribute largely to my current mental state, which could explain that. But I don’t feel anger towards him, not even pity or happiness at him dying. On the flip side of that, when my mother in law died (who i got along with) I didn’t feel anything then either. 

It is not a problem as such but I’m starting to find it a little odd. I don’t have clear memories of my childhood or teens but I think I could feel emotions. Maybe. 

I know it might be the possible Aspergers but there are people and situations where I do feel emotions. But having said that sometimes I feel like I don’t feel as much as I should. Except anger. I probably feel that one too much. 

So do people think? Is it due to one or more of my bouquet of illnesses? Do you think it’s possibly something else? Or am I just emotionally stunted? Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. ",29Nov2018,1
52,"A couple years ago, my friend drank while home alone one night, to forget the terror of the police in her house the week prior when she had come dangerously close to a suicide attempt. About half an hour and half a bottle of vodka later, she found some caffeine pills and sleeping pills, and downed them all. She was found on the side of the road with no pulse, and rushed to the hospital, thankfully, waking up after being in a coma for a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

And she told me this while smiling. Laughing, in fact. She told me about how as soon as she woke up from her coma, she deliriously asked about her audition for a music program, and how her parents had to reassure her over and over that they rescheduled it. She said to me, amid hysterical laughter over the phone ""the only direction I can possibly go from here is up... and you know you've hit rock bottom when you've literally died! ...  and even though I don't remember that night, it totally makes sense I was stupid enough to think the caffeine pills and sleeping pills would cancel each other out? Like.. god! Even crazy \[insert her name\] is a dumbass."" And the whole thing was just so absurd! I'll admit, I didn't know how to react, so I laughed with her. Perhaps dark humor is an underrated coping mechanism.

I'd like to tell you her life is perfect right now, that she's not fighting an uphill battle, but it's just not the case. She struggles with mental disorders everyday... but she's slowly moving upward.

58,"So I've had a passion for music ever since I was around 9-10 years of age. I'm currently in college, I went in my first semester to start majoring in music and took a music fundamentals course which went successfully.

&amp;#x200B;

I did poorly in my music theory class the next semester, due to partly laziness and being too focused on the state of a friendship at the time. So I failed the class. They only offer the theory course during fall, so I took about 2 years off from anything music related (with the exception of an elementary piano class) and focused on general ed courses instead. I didn't take it the next fall because of my course load and I was heavily debating my decision to study music at the time. Then next year came, which is now, interest in music reinvigorated and I took that course again. It's going decent, the thing is I'm also taking a piano enrichment course. As a final assignment, the students have to perform a recital. One solo, and one duet. We had to pick partners (my partner was designated to me because everyone else already had a partner and I never make an effort to converse with anyone in my class). I always do things last minute, I have a severe procrastination issue. So when it came time to showcase the duet to our instructor, to the discomfort of my partner along with mine, she ordered us in front of all the class to go practice because we told her we never practiced this together before. Throughout my life I had debilitating social anxiety, so of course, being in front of crowds...not an ideal way to spend my time. It has been a long time since I have been in front of that many people having to perform something.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I dropped the course on the last acceptable date to drop it, about 15 or so days until that recital event. It's gonna be in a few days now. I emailed the instructor about my decision, saying I would rather not do a mediocre job, and that my heart isn't in it. Understandably, in her reply, she was confused. Said my decision did not make any sense, since I made it this far in the semester. I've not replied back, because I literally don't know what to say. What I have to lose from this, is in exchange of an A, B, or C grade, I get a waived sign on my record, and most likely, the respect of my instructor. It was very stupid of me, I knew this was coming, so I could've just dropped this course sooner and saved some people the confusion. I wasn't prepared to thrust myself into a crowd of 100 like that. I didn't want to put myself at risk for failure and embarrassment. That's my motive behind the decision.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s the longest that anything’s ever stuck to be honest. But like everything else, it’s started to fade. This fog has been following me around, I get really bad anxiety any time I’m about to open my mouth to someone, self confidence has dropped considerably, and I can’t kick this fucking idea that I’m not ok. That it’s never going to be ok because something bigger and badder than last time is gonna come around and tear down the barricade I made for when shit hits the fan. I was prescribed vyvanse and adderal for a while. Been off it for about a year now. I don’t really want to go back on meds because I’d rather get to the core of what’s going on with me and have it stick as opposed to relying on a pill that will change my psyche for 8 hours. Brass tax..... am I just fucked? Is the only option to see a therapist for the rest of my fucking life? What do you guys do to stay afloat? Anything that’s stuck instead of fading out like everything else?

60,"So I'm on seroquel and cymbalta. Doctors agreed that because of the seroquel I've put on weight, but I can't stop my meds or change them until maybe February.

I had a surgery that messed up my lower back and coccyx. I can no longer perform situps or put too much pressure on my tailbone and I also have sacroiliac joint dysfunction. I'm unable to run or bike... plus, no vehicle so I'm limited to body weight exercises and walking.

Does anyone have any suggestions? I'm going to start walking my puppy about 2 miles a day starting tomorrow and basic stretches I performed during training when I was younger.

61,"hey everyone this is my first time posting on reddit so idk if anyone will even see this.
for those who do, hello, i’m clinically depressed and it’s been getting significantly worse these past two months. 

i’ve been feeling so lonely and exhausted recently and i thought i was doing okay with coping bc winter is always really hard for me (trauma happening around that time of the year), but last night i just crashed and burned. 
i’m really scared of what i could do to myself, i feel like i no longer have anything to live for now more than ever.

anyway if any of you sees this i just need someone to tell me it might be okay in the end. i know this is a pathetic cry for help but i just don’t know who to turn to, i feel so ashamed to talk irl.

i live in Paris by the way, i know a couple resources for psychiatrist etc. i might go to the hospital tonight. if you happen to know something/someone it’d be nice to share.

i don’t want to die but it just feels so hard",29Nov2018,1

63,"I have a real problem on my hands. A close family friend of mine is struggling a lot with mental health issues and unresolved grief from the death of someone close to him. He has been seeing a therapist for a long time  weekly or twice a month but both me and his family didn't really notice any progress.

I have been in therapy since I was a teenager and this friend of mine is new to the mental health world.

I went in to see the therapist once for support and was pretty shocked at what I saw. The therapist talked a lot about her friends and husband during the session. After we left my friend said, ""See, she isn't like a normal therapist, what's why I like her so much! It's just like going in to a friend and talking."" He also told me that if she retired he would not see anyone else. From what I understand he started seeing the therapist during a very dark time and found comfort in having someone outside of his social group to talk to.

I noticed some other red flags as time went on. One time a family member of his suggested that I call the therapist, something that I thought probably didn't make any sense because of course she couldn't talk about a client even if I had gone in with him. When she called me back she confirmed this but divulged information about seeing the family member privately which I am pretty sure is a violation, and spent some time talking to me and getting close to crossing patient confidentiality boundaries instead of just, ""I can't share that information, you'll have to speak to your friend to set this up"".

The friend also showed me a personal card designed by therapist and was eager to explain the meaning of the artwork on the card as it related to the therapist's personal life. Even worse, I found that the therapist had given him her old hard drive. It had no files on it when he got it but it's possible she didn't wipe it cleanly and someone could have gotten data off of it, maybe even protected data on her clients. In addition a hard drive is a valuable gift, not just a card or a small token, and not related to the therapeutic relationship.

I also know that he texts the therapist, and I am pretty sure it's not just to manage the schedule but also personal stuff, along with emails to each other that may not always be therapy related.

This seems like a classic case of transference that is really setting this friend back. If I ever reported the therapist I'm sure the friend would never talk to me again and see this as manipulative. I have considered reporting her when either of them move on instead but I am concerned a lot of his issues are being fueled by this inappropriate relationship.  For example he will often return to me or his family and claim that he ""checked with highly trained medical professionals"" (i.e. this therapist) to tell us that we're wrong or misinformed. An example of this was a diagnosis he'd been thinking about and grappling with for some time and that we had encouraged him (and probably pushed him too hard in the process, sadly) to look into. At first he was open to the idea but then he doubled down suddenly. We found out later that his therapist said she ""didn't think he had it"" casually, without giving a formal diagnosis or evaluation, which she actually isn't licensed to do for this condition.

I know this may seem meddlesome or manipulative and he's an adult and can make his own choices but me and his family have watched him go downhill for years after not processing or grieving for the death of this person close to him. We feel so helpless especially having gone through appropriate/ethical mental health care ourselves and seeing how this is not only helping him but fueling a lot of his issues. Does anyone have any thoughts on what to do?

He will be going with me to a psychiatrist finally some time this month but doesn't seem to be taking it seriously and is untrusting. I'm hoping that during that process I could help encourage him to start seeing a therapist at the same clinic, by selling it as a cost, convenience, or ""compliance"" benefit. It would be great if this could coincide with his current therapist moving on from him but I don't think I can bring myself to file a complaint until after they terminate their relationship, and even then I fear that she would divulge this to my friend (as I can't make an anonymous complaint, and I'm sure she would know it was me in any case), shattering his trust forever.",29Nov2018,1
64,"I know that I have some mental health issues. I also know I need to see someone and possibly need medication.
However, my work is a bit of an issue when it comes to, at the very least, scheduling.

I work out of town frequently and I have a lot of time off. I know there are options for affordable counseling in my area, but sometimes I'm gone anywhere from 4 weeks to 3 months. Because of this, I haven't found anyone who will see me. Over the phone is something I'd try, but it makes me kind of anxious.

I understand that have big gaps in a schedule makes things hard, but I feel my mental health is just getting worse with time.

66,"I'm 19, and have grown up mostly in the situation of a little brother to my older brother under our two parents. For a few years, i was a middle child while my nephew, just under a decade younger, lived with us. 
I feel like i just use and use and never give anything to the family. I'm nothing, a disappointment, just using them up. A few years ago, my brother graduated and the church i used to attend with them had a graduation event for that year with speeches and food and everything. 

I sat there watching my parents cry happy tears over my brother's achievement. by the time i graduated, we had a  new pastor and a new graduation event. less of an event and more just a normal service where we had some tables recognizing the achievement. 

No tears from my parents. no grandiose sense that my achievement means anything close to my brother's. Surely others feel the same.     ",29Nov2018,1
67,"By and large, I’m quite a successful free-spirited person who is confident and independent. I have a wealth of supportive people in my life, a successful career with many opportunities, I’m debt free and have decent savings, I get along well with almost anyone and my body is fit and able so that almost nothing on this world holds me back. I’m not ambitious, I’m not particularly charismatic and I don’t have any goals. I’m pretty lucky to have all I have for someone who hasn’t ever aspired to be much more than ‘normal’. For the most part, I’ve achieved that, at least in a superficial sense. I appear jovial and confident and those things are part of me but there’s a lot more lurking beneath the surface. 

I’ve had PTSD for years. It affects some aspects of my life more than others. Most people can’t tell. Some perceptive people pick up on it after a while, but for the most part I’ve been happy enough to bury it and get on with life. 

I kind of knew but never really acknowledged that you too have experienced a lot of trauma and also likely have PTSD. It’s never nice to acknowledge or think about because it’s too painful and not pragmatic in day-to-day life. No one wants PTSD and most of us never willingly admit we’re traumatised let alone get any help for it. 

Traumatised people end up traumatising more people and so the cycle continues. I understand now why you didn’t want to live for so many years. Life is so painful with trauma. I managed to find a way on my own to put my trauma into remission and had an 8 month reprieve from the pain. I literally felt like the luckiest person I knew. I felt confident, adventurous and so grateful to be alive. I knew it wouldn’t last forever but I appreciated it for every day it lasted. I felt like ‘me’ again. I would go so far as saying it’s better than any feeling I’ve ever had. I felt so empowered and free. But like all good things, it didn’t last. It couldn’t last because I hadn’t actually dealt with the trauma - my old triggers didn’t hurt me anymore, but there were deeper triggers that still laid dormant, waiting to send me spiralling again. I didn’t even know they existed. 

I won’t bore you with the details of my triggers, but I will say, that I became a monster. It took me days to realise I was sabotaging good things in my life, acting out of character, disregarding my values and making terrible decisions. I’d never acted like that before. Afterwards, the only emotions I could connect with were extreme guilt and sadness. A mix of passive and very active suicidal thoughts consumed my every waking thought. The pain was too much and the thought of going through years of trauma yet again terrified me. 

I’ll never be glad that I have trauma or that I let it hurt innocent people, but luckily for me, my downward spiral became stilted by my all-consuming guilt and for the first time I realised I needed to talk about my trauma and tell my family and friends why it existed. I think I’ve inadvertently scared a lot of people, though that wasn’t my intention. I guess I’d never told them sooner because I couldn’t say out loud why I was traumatised and why I’d had insomnia for so many years. I was scared to re-live it. I was also afraid of being judged. In actuality, no one judged me. Everyone has rallied around me. I also found a psychologist who specialises in trauma treatment and I booked sessions with him. It took me hurting an innocent person to realise that trauma still existed in me and when I came face to face with it, I saw how truly ugly it was. I saw a figurative monster in me. I never knew I was capable of acting so rashly or causing so much damage. I lament that I haven’t sought treatment sooner because hurting other people is so against my values. These are the consequences of my inaction and fear. 

I don’t know what it’s like to perceive the world through your mind’s eye, what you feel inside or what it’s like to be you, but I know you have feelings and that without effective trauma focussed therapy, trauma is likely affecting your life or lying somewhere below the surface of your happy exterior. 

You suffered trauma before I ever met you; many traumas in fact. I don’t know how you managed to function at the time but you did in a lot of ways. Your trauma impacted on the way you felt about being alive and how you viewed yourself. Consequently it also eventually had a profound impact on me. I recall many nights that you would self-harm and plot your death - you’d often show me/tell me in the morning. For many months I lived in fear that I’d wake up and find you dead. Eventually I stopped sleeping and I still have insomnia to this day. Sometimes I still dream you’ve committed suicide. I’m relieved to wake up and realise it was just a dream. Thankfully I don’t have those dreams much anymore but my brain still says it’s too risky to sleep. I have many associated fears that I won’t go into. 

I bear you no grudge and I’m glad you’re still alive. I’m not even sure if you remember the things I mentioned and I regret that they have never left my mind. I wish I didn’t remember but I do. I know my trauma comes very directly from the way you managed your trauma. I know how to successfully end my life after years of dealing with suicide in my career. I’m very confident I could do it tonight if I wanted to in an effective manner. But my mother recently said, “If you do it, then you’ll pass on to me the same trauma you’re suffering”. She wasn’t trying to guilt me; she was telling me an obvious truth. Trauma unresolved, leads to more trauma, and more trauma, and the cycle never ends. It ruins lives. 

Truthfully, I feel tremendous guilt and shame over my trauma and I hope against hope that I will be free of this monster for good. I don’t want to hurt anymore and I don’t want to hurt anyone else. It has to stop, but it has to stop the right way, not by suicide. 

The message I want you to get from all of this is that, trauma can lie dormant but it never goes without proper, evidence based therapy with a skilled and caring clinician. I know I’m lucky that I have a good job and can afford the best therapists, but I’d settle for an adequate and compassionate therapist if I didn’t have the money. Trauma work is better than no trauma work. 

I strongly encourage you to get trauma focussed therapy, EMDR or something because no matter how many people love us, or how at peace with our life we are, the trauma sits waiting for the right conditions to consume us again. It can end lives. It’s destructive and unnecessary. Therapy is painful and scary but regardless, I feel pain and fear when I hurt people with my unresolved trauma. No more, not with me anyway.

Please just read this. Don’t read into it. Just read the words. Don’t feel bad for anything you unintentionally did to negatively impact my life. I know you never meant to traumatise me with your desire to die. I know what trauma is like and I do not want you to feel any of the guilt I’ve felt. I hope you remember enough of our old relationship that you recall that what I’m saying is true and I have no intention to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just want to get better. I hope you find a way to deal with the traumas you’ve suffered as well. My heart grieves for you for all you’ve been through. You’ve been through a hell of a lot more than me or most others. 

Additionally, I only have one more request; that you do not contact me. I’m not better yet, and any contact from you whether it’s kind, indifferent or cruel all has the same effect on me every single time. Some hurts run too deep. I don’t harbour any grudge against you and I only wish you the very best in life. I only hope you consider the things I’ve discussed. Life is shorter than I ever truly realised. Time is always running against us.",29Nov2018,1
68,"I've already cancelled 2 times already. I'm scared that they'll dismiss my problems as ""normal teenage issues"" or they'll be all, ""You're not even depressed, why the hell did you even come here?""   
If i hadn't been referred to a therapist i don't think i'd even ask my parents to make the appointment in the first place. The night i was referred, i had 2 really bad panic attacks where i thought i was gonna die. On the 2nd one i woke up at 4am and i was genuinely convinced that i was gonna die from a heart attack and begged my parents to drive me to the hospital. Obviously everything was fine but when they were checking up on me they noticed my self-harm scars, referred me to my GP and from there on my GP ""diagnosed"" me with depression. I'm not taking that diagnosis seriously at all though because i suck at explaining my emotions and they have to diagnose you with something anyway in order to actually refer you to a therapist, even if its not accurate.   


Plus even when i think for a moment that i really do have something going on, i remind myself that there's people who've been through so much worse than me anyway. A few weeks ago i found out that one of my acquaintances has tried to commit suicide many times. We aren't that close but it still fucked me up for a few days. I felt like a fucking retard for making dumb jokes about depression/suicide when I've never even tried to commit suicide.   


And is it bad i actually want to be diagnosed with depression? (a real diagnosis not a bullshit one just to get me to a therapist) I want to be told for once, that it's not my fault that im like this; that this dysfunctional piece of shit isn't ""who i am"", it's just a mental illness.

From my experiences, basically every friend group does this in some way or another. Perhaps as a way of checking each other's status. How do people ever really know where to draw the line? Or if trustworthiness is quantifiable on one side of that line or another?

Imagine one friend who is entirely too overly sensitive, and another who doesn't seem to give a shit about anything. Isn't it possible that the over sensitive person has pent up anger towards others that he simply hides inside? Conversely, with the person who doesn't give a shit, isn't it possible that he does care but acts it off as if he doesn't, only to hold a secret grudge?

Anyway, I'm finding that my sense of humor isn't palpable to some people and I think I'm just struggling to ""tone it down a bit.""

83,"Do not read this post if you have any serious mental health problems. Who knows what effect this post could have on you. The last thing I want is for other mentally suspectable people here to begin thinking they are possessed as well or something along those lines.   


I'll try to make this as clear as I can.  I did something around 2 years ago that triggered the heck out of my mental illness to create this delusion and it has destroyed my peace of mind and is wrecking havoc on my life. I can find almost nothing on this sort of thing but there IS documentation of it so I know helpful information must exist somewhere. I need help finding information on dealing with delusions of being possessed and haunted so I can deal with this. 

It all started one night when I was in the kitchen after I had done something that I thought was really religiously bad. Something that I had done on purpose for the extremely stupid reason of trying to see if that would provoke any sort of religious consequence. Because at the time I was having trouble believing in the religion I wanted to be apart of.  However I completely forgot about this later. 

 Later in the kitchen many hours later I was daydreaming and suddenly out of nowhere against my will in my minds eye came this scary looking woman with black hair. She had this bat out of hell about to lose her mind expression on her face with these crazy eyes just looking at me. I was reasonably disturbed but ultimately thought nothing of it as the imagination itself can be a crazy thing at times and do weird things and decided to try and continue daydreaming about whatever I was dreaming about before. 

She came back. Again and again. She was like this intrusive thought I couldn't control just coming back into my minds eye over and over again. It's like my mind would look at any place I was and then create an imaginary scene of her appearing wherever I was looking to ""get me"".  I went upstairs feeling a sense of dread and anxiety and for the first time in almost 10 years and relapsed into seeing distinct scary faces behind my eyelids if I closed my eyes.   
This intrusive thought usually involves her lunging at me as if she's lost her mind and is screaming out of her mind as if the only reason she exists is to kill me as brutally and horrifically as possible.

85,"Hello all. So, long story short, I relapsed and binge drank (15 beers in a 10 hour span) earlier this month and had intense anxiety the next day, which combined with my GAD and health anxiety, made me think I had given myself brain damage. 

This irrational thought would have normally gone away with time, but this time something happened that poured gasoline on the fire.

The week after the binge I experienced some intense brain fog. I felt disconnected, which was likely due to the intense stress and anxiety I was feeling, but I also experienced some new symptoms that I’ve never had before - like difficulty concentrating at work, difficulty focusing on reading, reading words and getting them mixed up in my head with other similar words, and difficulty thinking of words to say in conversations. 

While I’ve read that cognitive issues like that are symptoms of anxiety and depression, because of my health anxiety, I still keep thinking maybe I do have brain damage even though the rational side of my mind knows I don’t. 

I’m past the worst of the symptoms I was experiencing as a result of the binge/relapse. All that’s left is a flatness, a sense of emptiness, which I’m praying lifts soon because it’s incredibly distressing. I’m trying to keep it together for my family and work but something just isn’t right, it’s like when you have a small pebble in your shoe, it’s a small thing but you notice it constantly. 

Anyway, the main purpose of my post is to ask if anybody else out there has had cognitive issues, especially if they’re identical or similar to mine, as a result of anxiety or depression.

Yet I can't help but feel like shit often. I doubt myself, I'm insecure and I think almost everyone around me is better than me. I feel like I lack female attention since the only girl I'll talk to in real weekly is my friend's girlfriend and she's like a sister to me. I've known her for 5 years now. I have no clue how on earth to find a girlfriend in real life. I'm 21, 6ft and have a normal body. Nothing really to complain about besides being lonely and having no girl to do anything with or really talk to. Surely being lonely doesn't feel like this?

87,"Tl;dr - need some advice on how to deal with someone having a psychotic episode and how to deal with my own mental health  in the process

Background: Almost 6 months ago, I met someone online, we instantly hit it off and entered into a fwb situation. Things were great for the first, maybe, 2 months and I feel like his behaviour changed and he was starting to lose interest. I brought it up, he said he wasn't. There's another fwb he has that he confided in me he has feelings for - ouch, I have feelings for him. About 6 weeks ago, he said he was feeling like he's cheating on either of us when he sleeps with the other, so he called off the benefits part with both of us.

Shortly after that all happened, he got injured at work and we didn't see each other for almost two weeks. That was hard, especially with all the uncertainty with things between us. Since then, things have been a bit strained between us.

We talked a couple of days ago and I mentioned that things still weren't good between us and he said he didn't like that I was still hurting.

I saw him last night and the second I walk in the door, he starts going on about how he was going back to how he was and ""shutting down unnecessary parts"" of himself. I asked for some further clarification and he said he's going back to being fueled by hatred, that I would notice him becoming more cold.

That was absolutely devastating, as cold is really the opposite of what I need from him right now. I  need his attention and affection right now to make things better and I'm interpreting what he said to mean that he's not going to give me that at all. I've been falling deeper and deeper into depression already with the hurt that's been caused and it's breaking me even further that I feel like he won't do anything to make it right.

I'm also extremely worried about him. He's said that the last time he was like this, he tried to kill himself and subsequently spent years like this. He feels like this is how to make himself stronger, but I feel like he's going to destroy himself.

How do I help him without completely destroying myself in the process?

&amp;#x200B;

Lifting the Fog:

*There were melodies, the type with pianos, harps and little dustings of romantic guitar fingerpicking. The sun shined on my skin and blinded me; but it was warm, it was inviting, hopeful. Everything you ever hope for it to be, you don't care that you're blinded because you fall so hard that you don't even need to see, you believe that it's guiding you somewhere that can only be beautiful. How could the sun be anything but beautiful? Everything is okay.*

*Then you actually hear the melodies for what they are. Noise drowning out the truth; it's not piano, harp, romantic fingerpicking. It's lies, screams, cries and pain covered up with a face convincing you that you deserve it. The sun isn't warm, it's cold and it has left you stranded on the sidewalk wondering what you did wrong. The sun blinded you at first because it didn't want you to see. It wanted to keep you warm, keep you smiling, keep your eyes from seeing what was really there; and what was really there didn't want to guide you somewhere beautiful. It wanted to break you into so many pieces you can't even begin to pick them up because you can't even remember where to start; what you were beforehand. All you know is what your head tells you, and your head has been poisoned to tell you nothing good.*

*You are left exposed, left with nothing but memories that you can't even sort good to bad, because everything is tainted. Tainted. You're tainted, you're disgusting, you're not worthy of anything. You can't even trust your own thoughts. Are they even your thoughts anymore? You're now just a product of heartache and heartbreak.*

*You are left bruised and scarred from a battle you were never going to win. You couldn't even gather the strength to fight because you were shot down before you could start. It took you hours, days, weeks to muster up the energy, the confidence, the stupidity to entertain fighting back. Then you open your mouth and nothing comes out. You are left with no weapons in your arsenal, so you just lay low and hope that if you absorb the pain, you'll get numb enough that it won't hurt anymore. Sometimes, if you're lucky, it does. Other times, you take it all in, you look up and you see lips moving, hands gesturing, body shaking... and you ask yourself how you got here. You wonder what you did so wrong. Could you have ever done anything so wrong to deserve this. You gave yourself so purely and you were rewarded with this. Having to watch as someone strips away everything you held dear to you, lays out in front of you everything you hated about yourself and reinforces those flaws, makes you so distorted that you don't recognize yourself in the mirror. You look down at the punishment marks from where you made a mistake and you were rewarded accordingly, you look down and you cry to yourself because you can’t distinguish anymore whether you actually did do something wrong, or just something wrong in their eyes.*

*You are the shadow of yourself. You're trailing behind, stuck in the darkness, you try to sneak out to look at the light but it burns. You don't know what the real world is anymore because you have existed in this for long enough that it has become your reality.*

*You get to a point where you are watching from above, pushing and pulling at the self that is below and begging for you to wake up and see the truth. But, you can't because you've convinced yourself and they've convinced you that you don't deserve anything else. That they do love you, that things will be okay. Every action of affection, every apology, every smile keeps you in that darkness just a little longer.*

&amp;#x200B;

So, I got diagnosed with most of my mental health issues later on in life than most (I assume), but got a bunch of acronyms that were incredibly scary to me.  BPD, NPD, ASPD, OCPD, PDD, GAD, ADHD, and so on, but the two most shocking to me were ASPD and NPD, with the scariest being BPD because of some of the stories I had heard or read about.  In my research on all of the above, I got to looking at them all and I slowly came to the realization that I could have been (and could still be) a very different person were it not for some of my disorders ""cancelling"" others out, or making it harder to follow the impulses.

&amp;#x200B;

I could very easily be the ""typical"" ASPD/sociopath were it not for my BPD; as it stands I still have some pretty strong ASPD tendencies, though the BPD and GAD tend to make me actually feel some sort of emotion about my actions later.  Usually it's not regret or empathy about what I'd done, but worry/anxiety about who I might lose if people found out or found out I didn't really care.  Add to that my fairly high capacity for logic and reasoning, and the Anxiety ""saves"" me, because I think about the last time I did something like what I want to do now, or reason through it instead of just impulsively acting on it RIGHT NOW.  

&amp;#x200B;

But, there are things about me that somewhat scare me.  For instance, I really wanted to be a sniper in the military, one because I'm a good shot and two because I really wanted to just be the ""instrument of death"" for some people.  I don't hunt deer because I like the meat, in fact I rather despise the taste of venison, but I LOVE the action of \*killing\* the deer; I had an accident while hunting a few years ago and killed something I shouldn't have.  I was very upset about it, but not because I had killed something -- I actually was proud of the shots I had taken and how goddamn good they were and that the thing was dead.  What I was upset about is my friends and family seeing me as lesser than what I wanted them to and what I saw myself as.  I couldn't give two shits that the animal was dead.  As a kid I did things out of sheer curiosity that others would find very disturbing and troubling; I learned from those, and reactions I saw around me from similar incidents on the news or TV, and got smarter about them.   Thanks to the ADHD, I can usually visualize things and ""act"" on them in my head instead of in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

I've planned out, in fairly detailed fashion, ""violent crimes"" and how to actually get away with them.  For obvious reasons I didn't write or document any of them, but I have them still and can think up new ones with very little effort, so little it scares me.  I have never been to jail, never been arrested; hell, I've only had 2 traffic tickets in my 25-40 years here, so by most definitions I follow the rules and abide by the law (OCPD), but god dammit do I not want to.  I know that I \*need\* to in order to stick around and not wind up in jail, so my friends and family won't leave me (BPD).  It may sound silly, but it's a daily struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always identified with the ""darker""- or villain-type characters from stories and movies, from things like Darth Vader or Darth Maul in Star Wars to the Fallen Angels from the bible (even though I'm not a religious person).  I've always felt like there's something incredibly different, much darker under my surface and I've just been waiting for it to one day show up.  I think the thing that's kept it away for so long is some of my other disorders and my ability to reason through most things in a flash (thanks again ADHD!), but sooner or later I'm afraid the darkness is going to ""break out"" and there will be virtually nothing that will stop it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I could be, and still can be, a very different person were I to ""take away"" some of the disorders that moreso control my life at the moment.  I'm just afraid to find out what kind of person that would leave...",29Nov2018,1

95,"[TR: Self-harm]




I had a history of self-harming in high school. Nothing too serious, just a few shallow scratches that does not bleed much and scratching my arm till it burns - but they do left scars. But my brain does not comprehend it as self-harm, and I was really conflicted on asking a counselor for it, cause ""maybe they'll just brush it off, maybe it's just me trying to imitate being depressed."" I was just really confused about it all at that time, combined with the feeling that I need validation about my problems. I did manage to stop self-harming by the end of high school.

Now I am in university, and I felt really stressed and low in confidence a month ago. Knowing my history of self-harm, I booked a session with a university provided counsellor to address my issues before it become worse.

The mechanism for the booking system is : enter your profile, and then they will contact you through phone - which sounds bad enough to those who do not wish to answer phone calls. 

I did booked it, and I switched off my phone for a while so they contacted me through email saying they couldn't reach me through phone and asked to call them back. I replied asking if I could contact them through email. They said yes, and they told me they were only available two weeks from that day onwards, and to make a decision ASAP as sessions are going to be filled fast.

Maybe it was just me, but I felt that was a bit cold - like corporate-sent emails. But I decided to give it a try. I chose a session about three weeks from that day.

I went to the counselling session. It went okay, I guess - and the counsellor asked if I would like her to refer me to a psychiatrist for my potential social anxiety disorder, as she 'can not diagnose or anything'. I said okay.

So a week later I went to the Clinic at the university for the referral - and apparently they just set me up with a 'family doctor', and the doctor would talk to me, ask questions, and then write a referral letter for the psychiatrist. Okay, that's odd, but maybe that's the procedure. I don't mind.

And so two weeks later I went back to the clinic for the appointment with the psychiatrist. The appointment was on 9.30 a.m. Nurse told me to wait, as the psychiatrist was seeing another patient at that moment. I obliged. 

I waited for an hour. She asked me questions, and then typed on her macbook. At one point she asked me something and I took some time to answer - and when I answered she said, 'Oh sorry, what did I ask again? It's been too long I already forgot what I asked.' Okay, people do that sometimes - I also do that. But that's quite odd. 

Towards the end of the session, she asked as per usual, 'Do you have a history of self-harm?' I thought about how I should answer this - as I was not cutting, and it was more of a scratching - but it did bleed and left scars. I mumbled, 'Umm..-' and she asked again, with a tone, 'Do you have a history of self-harm?' I said I did scratch myself before. And she said, oh, okay. 

She said she didn't understand why my counsellor referred me to her, as I do not need psychiatric treatment, and would need psychological treatment more. Well, I said that my counsellor stated that she can not diagnose me. And she thought that's odd. I do know that I would not need to see her anymore, because I do not need psychiatric treatment.

I do not know what to think of these encounters, really. I just felt that I opened myself up to these people, but I do not think that counselling is the best option for me. I kept thinking to cancel the next appointment with the counsellor. Any thoughts about this?",29Nov2018,1
96,"First time poster here. Wondering if any of you are prone to ruts like I feel like I am. I find that I get into the same habits and eventually get mildly depressed, even when things are going great on paper. 

I am in my mid-30s, highly educated, good job, newly-wed this year. I own a modest house in a decent neighborhood, have a dog I love, and a baby due in late January that I couldn't be more excited for (though not Pollyanna about the realities of that). I have a supportive family and a great life partner. I love where I live and most aspects of my life. I am in good health and getting better since becoming a vegetarian and quitting smoking 2 years ago and working out every day on my lunch break.  

However, I find that the day in and day out of it all gets me down. The same commute, living the same life everyday, same meals, same people, gets monotonous. I mean, after a day of work, the last thing I feel like doing is going out and trying to have fun. I'm new to my state (3 and a half years), 2500 miles from family, and live in a metro with about 2 million people on the west coast with lots of music and food and drink, but not much of it interests me anymore. Friendships are few and far between as it feels like everyone I know around my age is starting new families and is just living their own lives. I've tried the Meetup app, but I just haven't had any luck finding folks I like. So I just go to work and come home every day. 

On the weekends, my now wife and I would go out for dinner or go for a hike, but she is pregnant now and we don't do that much these days as she's not able to climb like she used to and we're trying to save money. 

I sometimes miss the days when I was a teenager or in my early 20s, didn't have any money, but would jump in a car and do a road trip at the drop of a hat. I'd sit in coffee shops listening to open mic nights and go out to bars and see live music. I miss parties with close friends, even if laid back backyard bonfires. I wouldn't want to give up what I have, but it would be amazing if life now could have some of that old flair. But I can't help but think, on the other hand, that those are kid things and selfish. Especially with a new baby on the way (lawd knows I'm going to be busy with that and wish for these down times I have now).

99,"I've been medicated on various drugs ever since I was 12. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I am now 24.

I'm currently on Risperidone 2mg, and Mirtazapine 15mg. About 7 months ago I got off of Cymbalta. My goal was to get off all of my medications. I just wanted to be drug-free and live my life free from all drugs.

In October, I tried to get off Risperidone. I went from 2mg down to 1mg with guidance from my psychiatrist. She said it was a bad idea but that it was my decision. I was so excited to finally being med free! But then, as soon as I started. It was EXTREMELY painful. I thought I was going insane, things just felt very scary and uncomfortable. I was going through bits of psychosis. NOTHING felt good or made me happy. Listening to music was painful. Being with my friends was painful. I just couldn't handle it. I called my psychiatrist and she said it wasn't withdrawal but rather the depression coming back. I only lasted a little over a week and went back on the Risperidone.

I talked to my therapist, and he said I wasn't ready to come off of Risperidone. He said it helps me focus. I was put on it at age 18 to help with depression.

Then November comes around. I hang out with my best friend, and I just didn't feel good. I didn't feel happy or excited being with him. I just felt miserable and it just wasn't fun or enjoyable. If I wasn't feeling good, then he probably wasn't either, right? I haven't heard from him since and it's been about a month.

And then, around two weeks ago, my symptoms got even worse. I went to New Orleans with my mother and I just couldn't stop crying. I was in extreme pain. I just couldn't feel happy and nothing felt good. Even having two beers didn't help on Bourbon street. I felt so miserable. Also, I started having a giant pain in my chest that was constant and wouldn't go away. It was anxiety.

And then finally, on Thanksgiving, my symptoms reached their peak. I was in A LOT of pain. Nothing felt good. I felt horrible and sick and in pain. I kept waking up in the morning with intense anxiety, fear, and impending doom. It was very painful waking up. I felt horrible and nothing felt good or made me happy. Even going to the mall with my family felt horrible. I was in so much pain. I thought about suicide constantly. I felt so horrifically bad I thought about going to the emergency room. It was just this immense pain of nothing feeling good.

I couldn't focus at all. All I could do was sit and watch TV.

It sort of felt like the time I got off the Risperidone.

I never felt pain like this before. Is this depression? Jesus, I've been medicated so long I've never felt depression like this before. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and just feeling INTENSE feelings of despair and sadness and just couldn't fall back asleep.

It was a very painful Thanksgiving.

I just had enough and just decided I couldn't go on like this. So I started taking Zoloft 50mg which was prescribed to me. And in about three days, A LOT of the pain went away. The pain in my chest went away. I just feel overall a lot better.

Right now, I just have a lot of anxiety and uneasiness. I don't feel quite like myself.

I noticed that a lot of my pain and worries just went away. I just feel a lot of relief and better. I sort of feel like my old self again.

But this happiness isn't real, is it? Do these drugs help me be myself or is this just not really who I am?

So, do I need drugs just to be happy? Is that really who I am? Do I have a chemical imbalance? Was I born with depression and anxiety or something?

I'm going to keep taking Zoloft. Both my friends and family said I didn't need these drugs and thought I was normal. My best friend said I just needed diet and exercise and said I wasn't going to find the answers in therapy.

I feel very, very nervous and uncomfortable right now. I just feel very uneasy and scared of everything right now. I just don't want to do anything really except stay home and watch TV

I feel like I don't even know who I am. My therapist says I wouldn't have graduated college or high school if it weren't for the medication.

Does it sound like I'm going to be medicated forever? Am I going to be on drugs forever just in order to live my life?

I have been dealing with social anxiety and depression for years. I have coped with it as best I could, worked and did my best all throughout being in an emotionally/verbally abusive relationship.  I ended that a year and a half ago which was making me worse but left me with no social outlet. My functioning has got so bad since that ended though, I used to function better in it. The past year and a half It got so bad especially when there were so many family issues I couldn't escape from.  My mother was forced to move house and my fathers solicitor has paid off her solicitor so she doesn't have any money until she sign divorce papers,  those divorce papers means she gets nothing.  I have been trying to deal with all my stuff,  help my mother out, be there for her emotionally, look after an epileptic dog,  disabled cat.  Staying as strong as I could at the time.  All the while living off savings, and avoiding going out dealing with my social anxiety etc...

She said you need to get a job and all my problems would be solved.  I asked her to give me a letter stating I couldn't collect the payment of 100 Euro a week the past 2 months because of social anxiety, the social office said they would happily pay me for this since I went down and signed on but never collected due to a panic attack every time I would see someone.

She refused even though she is fully aware of my situation,  when I started crying saying I have no money,  she  told me to go to a company that deal with people with depression,  wrote the name on a sticky note,  stuck it to the side of the desk I was on saying ""here you go"".  I felt so humiliated.  I was there baring my soul needing her help and she acted like I was joking or something. I feel so offended,  the medication she put me on effexor xr doesn't work, am constantly drowsy,  no motivation, wake up feeling tired and lasts all day, she then said would you take more,  as if that is going to solve my problems. 

I came out of the doctor feeling worse than I went in,  and getting no letter that I needed.  I am in Europe by the way. I want to work but that's not feasible right now, with chronic pain,  antidepressant making me a drowsy mess,  and panic attacks around people, when I told her this she goes,  well I see you getting better soon.

111,"So here's the thing. I just moved away from my family's home a couple of weeks go. After highschool got a full time job and just kept it instead of going to college, stayed for 2 years. I didn't spend pretty much any of that money. The situation changed and I don't have that job anymore. 

Now I'm on my own, with way more money I need, renting a beautiful house on the nice part of town. Being more social than ever. Exercising fairly regularly, and i could keep going for a year if I really wanted to.

I'm supposed to take this free time to figure out what the hell do I wanna do. You know, with life. And I guess that's were the problem is. I have no idea. I'been conflicted about this since highschool. But because of my struggle with mental illness back then, I didn't really looked this far ahead. I mean, sure, college was the plan. I had a thing that I would say when asked about college. But I never meant it. I had other stuff in mind back then.
Then with a full time job, didn't really stopped to think to much about what I like. I was really comfortable living a mindless routine because I was finally functional.

What I'm saying is that I've been successfully postponing a serious existential crisis for years and is finally knocking my door.
I could go to college, I could get a job, I could just start persuing a hobby, if a had one. But what's the point?
I just don't feel passion for anything at all. And i know how it sounds silly. But I guess I'm desesperante forma advice before the reality of this fully hits me.

I would guess existential crisis are something relatively common on these communities but I'm not sure. I appreciate any type of advice.

123,"New to this sub, so feel free to let me know if this has been done before.

I am very glad people are open to discuss mental health challenges in a more real and honest way. I think it is helpful. As someone who struggles with my own, I know it has helped me to not feel excluded as a human being.

However, I have trouble sometimes telling the difference between whether someone (unprofessional setting)  really cares about mental health support or they are just saying it to seem heroic. 

For example, I have a cousin who lets everyone know that people should be open about their feelings and if anyone feels suicidal they should reach out to community and/or professionals. It always sounded good to me. Earlier this month her older brother ended up committing suicide. It was really hard for me to talk about this until now, so I am leaving out the details. 

My question is how is that advocating to help those with mental health challenges? I know her brother reached out to her several times beforehand and he even called me saying she wasn’t willing to talk about it or was busy/dismissive. I was racked with guilt when I found out he passed away, but she always would say that she tried her best to help him. 

How can we help people like this? He was seeing a therapist and he tried to reach out. What hope is there for people struggling with suicidal issues? ",29Nov2018,1

125,"hey. I’m 21, female and basically in the worst place (mentally) I’ve been so far in my life. As a kid, from the age of 6, I had really low moods and dark thoughts. The world just seemed strange to me... I seemed strange to me! Lol. I was always a bright kid, but a pretty troubled kid too. I wondered what was the point of being alive and had a hard time adjusting to school and ‘loving’ people properly. For a while, people were just empty vessels to me. I was a bright kid and finished primary/secondary school with awesome grades, but I had a lot of problems in school. Self harm, substance abuse and I became sexually active at a very young age. I always felt like I was running from something. There was like this impending doom over my head. 


As I got older, it only got worse. My anxiety turned into frequent panic attacks and delusional thoughts of things that just weren’t true. It felt like I was trapped behind my eyes. To this day, I find it really hard to understand what is real and what is going on? If that makes sense. 


I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13. I’ve been on sertraline and various anti depressants since I was 17. 


I currently have been out of work for 2 years due to suicidal thoughts and extreme isolation and depression. I just don’t care anymore and have become very detached from my family and cut off most of my friends. I struggle to leave the house and process things properly...I have pretty dark thoughts about causing harm to myself and particular people around me. 


I’ve been through some stuff that I won’t share on here, but I feel some of that said stuff is the reason behind some of my mental health issues. But, I’ve felt this way for as long as I can remember, so maybe it’s just me as a person? 


I’ve attended counselling but usually end up quitting due to feeling I’m not making process or I can’t bring myself to go again.


I sometimes feel I may have aspergers. I read it’s harder to diagnose aspergers in women, but the symptoms and traits of
really did stand out to me. It also said Asperger women sometimes develop a personality disorder as a way of trying to cope with feeling different and the thoughts they have. 


Can someone comment on this? Whether it’s about the stuff I’ve mentioned or from their own personal experience? 
I just want to feel less alone than I do right now... I’m in a pretty dark place and just unsure of what to do at this point. I’m young and I know I have my own good qualities and achievements, and that one day I can hopefully make sense of the Past and myself and move on... but sometimes I just don’t know what the fuck is going on

127,"Okay so here it goes, I am 17 years old and currently studying 3 A-Levels. I'd say overall life has treated me pretty well and this issue i'm facing is more or less me complaining about a **want**, not a **need** but its really been on my mind recently and I've started to feel rather down over the whole ordeal. Throughout my teen years my luck with girls hasn't been great, majority of the time I'm led on just to be dropped for 'someone better'. I ***never*** go for girls who I feel are 'out of my league' as I know they go for the guys who are dicks and personally I feel i'm far from that. Quite often I take a long break between talking to girls because I normally feel emotionally drained when the last girl turns me down. But what did it for me was today. **BACKSTORY:** This girl who I used to be fairly good friends with back when we were 15 (we slowly distanced ourselves without knowing) started talking to me again a few months ago. The past few months had been great *it was like we never stopped being friends* although this time it was different, it was more or less a romantic relationship that had been formed over time and before people say I was in the friend zone, I wasn't, she would never speak to me about other guys at most she told me how she's never even been with anyone as things just go wrong for her as well. Daily conversations, daily late night phone calls, going out for meals together we were practically dating.

**PRESENT:** I was ready to make it serious with her, I confessed my attraction towards her and at first she didn't believe me then once I had convinced her she just gave me an ambiguous answer of 'hmm', I didn't know what to take from that. Today rolled around and her best friend came up to me to talk to me albeit I knew what was coming, it was all too familiar, but I let her speak to me anyway. She gave me a heads up and her exact words were ""Don't waste your time with her, she's using you as a back up essentially, she has someone else in mind but she'll go to you if it doesn't work with her 'first choice"" her friend then also told me that girl said I was her 'Last resort'. Upon hearing this my heart sunk,  I felt lost, a feeling I'm all too familiar with. I thanked her and then proceeded to leave school and go home completely disregarding the fact that I had 3 more lessons. I went home and just sat on my bed for a good 3 hours, did nothing, said nothing, spoke to nobody. Bare in mind I don't have anyone to speak to, literally all of my friends are in serious relationships and kind of seem to want nothing to do with me anymore. I just don't know what to do I'm definitely avoiding communication with any girl for a long time as I just can't deal with this shit anymore. I just felt I needed to get this off of my chest and find some guidance. Thank you for reading this &lt;3",29Nov2018,1
128,"Just some background on my illnesses/what I suffer from:

*  Diagnosed with ADD in kindergarten, put on Ritalin, stopped taking it around 2nd or 3rd grade, somehow coped for many years without drugs/therapy.  I want to get evaluated again, but I have been advised to wait a bit because of my next point.

*  I've been depressed and suffering from anxiety almost as long as I can remember.  In 2010, I started taking anti-depressants prescribed by my regular doctor.  I started talking with a therapist last year and seeing a NP that specializes in psychiatry and I'm being treated for MDD/GAD currently.


Background, I'll try to keep it brief:

*  In 2013 or so, I felt like my mental health started taking a turn for the worse.  Because of this, I felt like my work at my employer at the time took a hit and the relationship between my boss and I became more strained.  

*  In 2016, I was offered a job at a different company doing the same sort of work.  I was offered the job by a different supervisor I had while working at the job mentioned above.  I took it because the pay/benefits were better, the relationship with my boss and after 13 years at the same place, a change was probably a good thing.

*  Over the next year, I struggled.  I think part of it was the expectations of my boss that I thought I could trust because I worked for her before and another part of it was of depression/anxiety/ADD.  I also had fallen into some bad habits as well.  Shortly after my year anniversary at the company I got canned for ""poor performance.""

*  Just to note:  I feel like the job(s) I was doing up to this point required an insane amount of ""attention to detail.""  So, I don't know how I spent 14 years doing it in the first place.  Also, it didn't necessarily line up with my long term career goals or education.

*  It took me roughly 6 months to find a job and I ended up having to settle for something less than ideal. Obviously, this did not help things at all.

*  I was going down a similar road at this new employer, wasn't feeling great about things/life in general so my performance was not up to par and I was called out on it.  

* I had set myself up with a therapist/NP at a practice once this started happening.

*  I eventually felt so bad that I checked myself into the ER.  They ended up letting me go after a bit but they referred me to a ""partial hospital"" program.  I took two weeks off to do this because it was basically a 9:30-3pm daily program.  For various reasons, this made me feel a lot better and in two weeks I almost felt like a new person.

*  Within 2-3 months I got an interview at a better place for a good job.  It was more in line with my career goals.  So far, I have kicked ass - had my first official review and I'm basically doing ""better than average/expectations.""

Now on to the question(s)....

I feel like I betrayed my boss that fired me because she probably went out on a limb to hire me.  I feel like apologizing and letting her know I had personal issues or something.  You know, like in AA where one admits their wrongs and tries to right them (not that I'm trying to beg for my job back, I am happy where I am).  But at the least I figure I could possibly salvage a reference or something?

What do y'all think?
