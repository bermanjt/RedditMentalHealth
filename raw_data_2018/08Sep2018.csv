0,"So I’ve been seeing this guy for a really long time but he recently notified me that he thinks I spend too much time with him which is true because I sleepover at his place every day. So in an effort to give him some space I’m spending today alone but I’m having awful anxiety about being alone. I can’t focus on anything because I just keep thinking about how alone and empty I feel. I just keep thinking about how I wish I was with him. I was fine earlier in the day because I hung out with my friends but the second I was alone again I felt awful. 

I realized I do this even when I’m not in a relationship with someone. I always make sure I’m with someone when I do something. Studying? With a friend. Go to the bathroom? With a friend. Get food? With a friend. Go to the gym? With a friend. I realized that I actually refuse to do something unless I’m with a person. I can’t stop crying right now because I feel so utterly alone and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I just wish I could feel happy about myself without constantly needing someone by my side. It’s not healthy for me or the people in my life. ",08Sep2018,1

I know they’re supposed to help and after 6 years of struggling silently I know this is the point I’ve been waiting for. The beginning to a solution. Problem is I’m afraid to take them. I’m afraid of what could happen. I’m afraid somehow it won’t help and I could end up worse than before.

6,"**TL;DR** Title, when taken as prescribed - if you don't know what benzodiazepines are: think Xanax.  

I'm looking into benzodiazepines as a treatment for times when I find myself in a feedback loop that has lead to self harm in the past. I've been unable to deescalate myself with resorting to taking opioids which I know is a dangerous solution, but it stops me from doing even stupider things to myself. 


I'm seeing new people about my mental health soon enough but if new methods of talk therapy or deescalation don't work for me I may end up benzodiazepines as a last resort. 

So I wanted to know what peoples experiences is with these drugs when they're taken as needed for anxiety.

7,"I’ve had issues with depression but I like to think of myself as someone who is high functioning. But the past two days something has been off with me. I didn’t really have an appetite and I’ve slept for longer periods of time. I tried to shake it off and just studied for awhile. For a bit, I felt stable and content. I was able to turn it into positive energy. Then today I felt extremely tired with no specific mood. I slept for a long time and then proceeded to take another nap three hours later. Once I got up I went outside to just sit out in the open , hoping it would change my mood. 
 
I thought to myself that the weather was perfect and it just looked so peaceful and calm. And for whatever reason, I just kept thinking that it would be so nice to end my life. I would feel calm and I would have 0 worries. I’m the type of person who has tendencies to have suicidal thoughts but I am so positive I would never act on it. I just feel like absolute shit for thinking something like that. I’ve been seeing a therapist to help me change the way that I think and I’m honestly trying so hard...

Thats at least one of the reasons I feel bad I know. I have sleep apnea but I’ve been treating that for over a year. My doctor has done a bunch of tests, but he says my over sleeping is probably depression. But my depression is partly caused by starvation and dehydration because of my over sleeping. 

I recently realized that’s probably why we thought no antidepressants were working. Starvation and dehydration I mean. I’ve probably not been taking care of myself for a long time. this oversleeping started 3 years ago and just around the beginning of the year or so I started not feeling hunger or thirst most of the time?

I have this overwhelming need to start fires now. It isn't a case of ""oh, I just want attention and I'm just literally playing with fire"". Nobody but one person knows about it. My family has no idea. I burn safely in my room (my favorite thing to burn is paper towels and paper) in a tin and I have candles to mask the odor of the smoke. I get urges every few hours, and they get strong sometimes. They can be triggered by stress or by just nothing in particular. Sometimes, I just have to go start a fire or else I get very anxious and very irritated. I have a long history of Mental Illness including impulse control problems.

15,"How broken is our society? 
that people feel they have no choice but to numb themselves, and kill themselves from the inside out, just to find some kind of relief from the world we live in. 

How broken are our hearts? 
every time another body is found and we have to close our eyes as the tears stream down our face and we say “gone too soon.” 

How broken are our souls? 
that we have forgotten how to connect to one another, to truly reach out and connect to another living breathing human being. 
Not through a text, not through a phone call, but actually sat down face to face and looked them in the eye and asked them if they’re okay. 

How broken is our thought process? 
we shame those who live with depression, with addiction, with anxiety disorders, with any kind of mental health issue. 
And no I did not say “struggles with” because that’s part of the problem. 
Of course it’s a struggle to keep living when you would rather die, but saying someone “struggles with” the demons they are fighting, is to imply that they are weak, when in fact these people are some of the strongest you will ever meet. 

How broken is our world? 
that some have found themselves so miserable, they feel they would be better off leaving, rather then living through another day here. 

We can no longer afford to live the way we have been living. 

We cannot live in fear of talking about death, depression, suicide, addiction, relapse, pain, hopelessness, of fear itself. 

I talk to children every day who have told me they think about death, they think about dying, they think about ‘what if I didn’t have to be here anymore?’ 

We have to start creating a world where people actually want to stay alive in it. 

We have to remember that we are only here for an instant, and one day in an instant it will all be gone. 

We have to start looking around us and realizing that others are dying to feel the love we have to give, but we have to be brave enough to let down our walls, our preconceived notions, our biases, our inhibitions - 

put all of that aside and please realize that none of us have the right answers, but we can hold each other as we look for them together. ",08Sep2018,3
16,"This is going to be a bit of a rant, so just prepare yourselves, and I apologize in advance if it doesn't sound completely coherent. 

I am currently a senior in high school who is taking five AP classes, applying to colleges, and spending time on various extracurricular commitments. Since Freshman Year, I've made it my mission to be a high-achieving, hard-working student and person, and for the past three years I can confidently say I've succeeded in what I set out to do. I've taken difficult classes, gotten very high grades across the board, performed in the top percentiles on standardized tests, and continued to challenge myself outside of school in music, track and field, and other activities. Last year, in particular, I decided to try my absolute hardest at everything I possibly could, in order to unleash my full potential during my crucial Junior Year, and I met and in some ways exceeded even my own very high expectations. 

So one would think that I would be all set right now; that I have zilch to complain about, and future successes to look forward to. But that's not the case whatsoever. Instead, I feel like I'm completely losing my mind. See, things started to go downhill toward the end of last year. I was pushing myself pretty much as hard as I could throughout the year, and I became progressively more and more burnt-out, until by the end of the year I felt completely exhausted with school in general. This is also when my mind started getting cloudier, my memory spottier, and my cognitive abilities generally took a hit. I thought the mental break I would get when the summer arrived would solve all my problems. Suffice it to say, it did not. Because I didn't have much else planned for the summer, I took on a lifeguarding job at the local Six Flags for about five weeks, after which I did a homestay in Paris for two weeks. The lifeguarding job turned out to be much more stressful than I imagined, and this is the point where my general anxiety began to set in. Lifeguarding combined two distinct sources of stress and anxiety for me: the stress of the responsibility of the job itself, particularly the fact that there was nearly zero room for error, and the social anxiety that came with interacting with large crowds and my coworkers all day. So after five weeks had passed, I was relieved to quit, as I expected my Paris experience to be far more enjoyable and relaxing, even if it was a tad frightening simply because I had never done anything quite like it before. But although I overall loved the time I spent in Paris, it also seemed to heighten and accentuate my anxiety. Even when there wasn't anything in particular to trigger my anxiety, I noticed it always lurking there in the background, forcing me into saying and doing awkward things and making stupid little errors left and right. And as I prepared to face the beginning of senior year, things only got worse, and that's where I am now. My memory has become atrocious. My head feels like it's filled with a thick and impenetrable haze 24/7. Even simple cognitive functions are now a struggle for me. In fact, it seems as if my brain can't even process reality properly anymore; it's like I intuitively know exactly what's going on, how to act, how to solve problems, how to converse with others, etc., but once I try to actually do it, my mind completely blanks out. That's not an exaggeration, either. It feels as if my mind is utterly devoid of thoughts, and when I try to think of something, I am hit with an unbearable anxiety about not being able to process it, or I obsessively recheck basic pieces of information over and over again in my head. For example, if faced with a basic arithmetic operation, I'll compulsively redo it numerous times, which I realize must be an OCD response caused by anxiety. Expressing my thoughts coherently, even in my mind, has become an uphill battle. Just typing this post right now requires a significant amount of effort—except perhaps ""effort"" is the wrong word, because my brain seems unable to even exert itself—and I can't even be bothered to try to organize it intelligently like I used to do out of mere habit. I've now developed a most unsettling fear about performing even the most rudimentary tasks; like I'll literally be afraid, totally irrationally, that I'll forget how to speak English, because I actually am forgetting tons of tidbits of information that I used to recall effortlessly. Whenever I go to think of something, even if it's something that used to occur to me involuntarily, my mind just totally blanks out. 

I really don't know what I'm supposed to do about this, because I'll be applying early decision/action to (very competitive) colleges soon, which I think makes perfect sense due to my achievements so far, and I'll of course have to keep up high grades in difficult classes to give myself a chance in the application process, both because colleges check some Senior Year grades, and because I need to make all my past efforts worth it. Plus, I'm about to turn 18, and I realize I have to assume quite a lot of new responsibilities in stride, including living more or less independently pretty soon. But I'm not sure how I'm supposed to do this, because it appears that my brain has given up on me. I WANT to continue to succeed, I WANT to develop my social skills, I WANT to become an interesting, fleshed-out, fully functional adult, but my cognitive function has just out-and-out crashed, and I can't pull my thoughts from out of the abyss they're stuck in. It's gotten to the extent where I'll observe other people just acting completely normally and I'll be intimidated simply because their brains are still working properly, and they don't have trouble remembering things, expressing themselves, or taking on day-to-day challenges like I now do. It seems I've undergone a complete reversal: last year, I felt I proved my intelligence was something impressive, and showed I could persevere through challenges that others balked at. Now I feel I can barely do anything, and shy away from even the most trivial tasks. I don't know if I've developed an anxiety disorder that's just blocking me from doing essentially everything, or whether I overwhelmed my brain last year and need a break for it to begin working again. My experience of life is beginning to seem strange, alien, and frightening, and my brain feels as if it has nothing left in it. Unless I can go full auto-pilot, then I find just functioning throughout the day to be a major mental struggle, and that's more terrifying than anything I've ever experienced. I actually don't know what I think any more about anything, because I can't even think about it. I'm having trouble forming opinions, or even reacting to things, because my brain just can't handle it. I get the overbearing sense that I'm being dissolved internally, and before I know it my brain will just shut off.  All I know is that if this period of cognitive dormancy continues, then a very, very rough road lies ahead. It's all just so surreal and lifeless and sickening. I want my brain and my life back. Please offer any advice you can to help me get back into shape ASAP, be it rest, medication, professional help, brain exercises, or literally anything else. I need to snap out of this, because it's the most horrible state I've ever been in, and I really don't have time to waste. 

Thanks in advance for all your suggestions, and sorry for the disjointed mental health narrative. ",08Sep2018,2
17,"Hi, i’m an artist who’s in her last year of high school right now. I am someone who is very set on my career and insuring success with what i love, so i ended up switching out of my current school so i could go to a better, well recognized school that will give me better opportunities for university and college (they have a program where many people get scholarships, etc). So last year I was extremely set on getting into said school, i put a lot of stress on myself when auditioning and later on, i was happy to see i got in!

Problem now is that it’s not what i expected. It’s in the city (which i’m not used to), so people are colder? Or maybe that’s just what i think because no one talks to me, they ignore me, they all already have their own friend groups and i’m so paranoid that everyone FUCKING hates me. Throughout the Summer i was having a lot of difficulty with depression and bad self esteem. Now it seems i am having lots of social anxiety as well. And I am a naturally very outgoing and extroverted person, back at my old school i have so many friends that i can joke around with and be myself around. I have always taken pride in my confidence. Now it’s so different, it’s so isolating, no one will talk to me.... i don’t know what i am doing wrong.... what i am doing to make people hate me. 

All of my friends and family say to wait, or focus on my studies... but my mental health has turned to complete shit. i genuinely hate myself, i’m stressed about university/grades/other life problems...... i just feel so hopeless. i feel like i’m falling apart and no one can understand. they all think i’m over exaggerating, but they can’t see all the shit that is going on in my head. 

My summer life was so depressing and miserable, i thought it would end once i got busy with school. now everything is so much worse. i feel so hopeless. i’ve already tried a few therapists and the experience has been bad.... i unload all my feelings to them (usually i’m sobbing).... i have a hard time trusting people enough to open up to them.... so when both therapists didn’t give me any help whatsoever, and they couldn’t understand where i was coming from at all...... it made me feel so much worse. 

I don’t know what to do, i feel like i’m slowly descending into a downward spiral...this is just me complaining and having a pity party... but any advice or comments would help....... thanks &lt;3

19,"29 live at home with my parents. Can't move out because I can't take care of myself. I've never had I real job and I live in the country. I have no car of my own. At what point do I just accept that I'll never be a functional person. 

I could probably live a somewhat normal life if I didn't live in the middle of nowhere and had some basic assistance. If I had a girlfriend or something and lived with her, I could probably almost be a functional person. The problem is no one gives a shit about me. You don't get friends or a girlfriend because you need them. You get those things by already being successful, attractive and generally having your life together. You meet other people by already living in an urban area and not in rural Ontario. It's like money: the rich have many opportunities to make more money, and people who aren't failures at life are the ones that get to avail themselves of opportunities to better their life. If you've failed at life like I have, there is no opportunity to better it. No one wants to associate with a failure. 

The only people who get live a decent life are those who already have it. If you're like me, there is no opportunity to improve your own circumstances and you cannot improve them just by virtue that they are already shit. 

It's totally pointless. The primary reason I don't kill myself is because there people out there worse than me that are still allowed to live. Pretty much everyone is an asshole and ridicules me for reaching out. Killing myself while they're allowed to continue living would be a gross injustice. If I could find a way to track down and kill various people that I've interacted with on reddit, I would do it. I'm garbage, but these people are so much worse.

27,"Hey, friends!

I’ll try to keep this short but I’d like to give some background info as a preface. I’m a 23 y/o white male, I’ve had issues with depression and anxiety since around 6th grade. Both of my parents have bipolar and I was treated as bipolar since age 16 (although even at the time I thought it was a premature diagnosis). I’m prescribed bipolar medications, an anti depressant, and an anti psychotic.

In 8th grade I went through a trauma, after which I was constantly afraid that what I was experiencing wasn’t real. It’s a difficult phenomenon to explain, but “feeling like what’s happening isn’t real,” is the best way I can describe it. This feeling went away for years but has recently come back.

I wanted to ask if “derealization” is the correct term for that feeling, if it’s not uncommon for bipolar patients to experience it, and what coping mechanisms can be used, if any. It’s a terrifying feeling and it often causes panic attacks. I’ve been able to cope with bipolar and depression because it’s been a constant since I was relatively young. But this panicking and the feeling of things not being real seem inescapable, and other than taking my prescribed clonazepam, I have no idea what to do when the feeling of derealization occurs.

My family's having an issue with one chronically mentally ill family member. We support them as much as we humanly can, but it's not enough and they can't seem to support themselves. The old folks are exhausted and out of money and I'm facing a future of taking care of this family member for decades to come - While I care about them, they're an adult, they *should* be able to take care of themselves but don't, and their particular quirks are very hurtful.

Hey /mentalhealth. My friend and I had a super long talk about her nearly 5 year problem with social anxiety.

So basically, she's been afraid to do nearly anything because she may either mess up, or just doesn't have the motivation/willpower to do it. She said she wants to go out and be more social/do stuff etc, but doesn't do it. She said she really doesn't know.

But from what I can tell, I think she's just lazy. But I'm sure there's something I don't know. If she was just lazy she wouldn't have told me something as serious as this.

She's also told me that she knows shes wasting time being cooped in her room watching Youtube videos, and told me with tears that she doesn't know what to do. Honestly was a little lost there - the thing to do is to do something productive. I'm sure she knows this, but isn't doing it for whatever reason; I suspect its fear/being scared.

What should I do? I don't want her to be like this forever.

33,"Hi, for about 2-3 years I've been dealing with something that I can't really seem to root out. It started when I graduated to my freshman year, I got into the school I wanted and also graduated with honors, but didn't really feel satisfied, or well, I didn't really feel anything at all. That's when I first became aware of my complete apathy to almost everything, nothing excites me, the closest resemblance of ""feeling"" is either when I feel pain or when I react to something instinctively, like for example when something is ""funny"" I smile, not because it's funny but because it's expected, same when things are sad. Now, I'm not lacking in empathy or such, I clearly see where the line is and I consider myself rather respectful and caring for others, but at the same time I push everyone away. As for my body image, it isn't bad, but sometimes everything just seems so.. foreign?

As you might gather, I'm pretty confused and I know that this doesn't replace visiting a professional, but has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know of a condition or something that resemble this?

36,"I had a thought this morning, about how people with mental illnesses are treating with much more judgement than caring, as it *should* be for mental *health*.

I mean, you don't hear someone with a Bi-Polar husband or cousin or what not, asking them how they are and carefully talk to the other family members about how he cannot function on consistent times and carefully halt him when he wants to for instance, go on an extreme shopping spree as I saw as one of the potential parameters of Bi-Polar disorder. Correct me if I'm wrong, but do not sway off-topic please.  
Today, there is more of a judgmental attitude. ""You have Autism? You suck at communicating. Someone did something bad to you? You probably interpreted it wrong"", instead of ""Someone did something bad to you? Hey, let me help you with that situation so you process it better, hmm?"".

I as a person who was *diagnosed* as Autistic, have a serious problem accepting the diagnosis because it's extremely judgmental, even with my experience in treatments. One therapist said that because it SEEMS! to them that I have Autism (we require a psychiatrist's diagnosis AND a psychologist's diagnosis and I only have the former), they told me they think I should not trust my intuition. That is not only judgmental, but it's also pre-judgmental which is a WHOLE lot worse! Perhaps, even illegal!

Oh, and don't get me started on my presumption that were my mother not to choose to see me as weak or flawed all the time, she wouldn't be slipping me the idea of Autism in the first place, AS SAID BY HER! Now I find it hard to believe she is my mother.

I thought I'd try do something about it. In this day and age the internet is a good tool. So I joined some groups and found some good people. I also joined a local games group. I also contacted some other old friends to go play music with.

But it hasn't really worked. I still feel this empty feeling. I feel bored. I feel disinterested. I have hobbies, and a loving family.

I have three kids and I get on with my wife well. There is nothing missing in that department. 

I feel like I'm floating. Everything is hazy. This has been the case for as long as I can remember. But it all come to head, I stopped sleeping. Then came the complete loss of appetite, and the crippling anxiety. 

At this point I had to tell my wife. I couldn't concentrate on anything. I'm not interested in anything. All I want to do is walk. In one day I walked 4miles around my office alone.

47,"After a while of holding my feelings in I finally told my husband that I think our marriage is going downhill and that I feel myself distancing myself from him.

We’re currently living overseas because of my husband’s affiliation with the military and got married not long ago.

We’ve had a rocky relationship from the very beginning and never got the opportunity to do couples therapy before we got married.

Lately I’ve just been feeling really lonely even when my husband’s present. There are certain things that have been done prior to our marriage that have truly scarred me and lost my trust in him. I was able to brush these insecurities off when we got married, but  those problems I feel like are resurfacing again.

I find myself looking through his messages a lot and he doesn’t like that. We had a big fight the other night because he changed his password randomly so I changed it back to see if he was hiding anything. I lied about doing so and he found out that it wasn’t true and that’s how I told him about how I felt.

I’m at a loss as to what to do now. We’ve concluded that we’re going to do couple’s therapy whenever they have availability to see us both. We WANT to work this relationship out. But I’m not sure as to when we’ll know that we have fully and truly moved on from our issues. I’m also with struggling with staying happy in the moment of us being together while we try to work our issues out. Just today we just tried to go on a date and throughout the day I couldn’t help but cry every now and then because of the reality of where our relationship is right now.

I don’t really get the chance to open up to many people about this. I’ve done that previously before we got married and I felt like that was personally involving people into our relationship and it ended up souring a lot of my ties with them individually because my husband and I are still together. This is kind of my last cry to help because I really only am comfortable talking to my therapist since she has no personal relations to me, but the time in between our upcoming sessions are so far I feel like I can’t wait that long all the time to have the chance to talk to someone about this.

51,"Hi everyone,

I was diagnosed with bi polar disorder and depression 8 years ago. Mental illness runs in my family. My great grandfather killed his wife with an axe in Poland, my grandpa had a mental breakdown (schizophrenia) and had to stop working, and my mom is so depressed she lost her job and can’t work in a social setting anymore. I’ve struggled with mental illness my whole life. Never felt like I fit in, I was always afraid to look people in the eye and of any social interaction. The past 5 years I’ve spiraled out of control. I’ve had suicidal thoughts, so much anxiety that I couldn’t leave the house, got so depressed that I feel numb.  

BUT GOOD NEWS, I’m learning how to cope with mental illness through positive outlets and I just wanted to share.

1) positive affirmations work. Make a list of positive affirmations and read them to yourself every morning before you go on social media. This helps reprogram your mind.

My list looks something like this:
- I’m a good person
- I know my worth and my worth is great
- I am worthy of abundance 
- i am beautiful 
- I am kind 
- I love to laugh
- I am good enough 
- I am the best songwriter in the world 
- I am the best producer in the world
Etc etc

These are things we should already know about ourselves but that we forget over time because this life is so grueling. We forget just how amazing and beautiful we truly are. Wake up every morning and say something nice about yourself. DO THIS EVERY MORNING OR IT WONT WORK. After about a month, you will see Changes in your life. You have to think of this world as energy and the law of attraction. The energy you put out there is the energy the universe will give you back. If you start saying positive things about yourself and building yourself up, then the universe will put events in your life that reciprocate that. 

2) BOXING - is in my opinion the best sport to deal with mental illness. There’s something about hitting someone and getting hit in the face that is so damn therapeutic. It’s magic. It doesn’t matter if you’re young, old, female or male, boxing will help you. Besides getting you in the best shape of your life, it will teach you how to get hit down and get back up. An essential part of life because let’s face it: life never stops kicking you down. All we can do is learn how to rise up from the shittiest of situations.

3) read these books as they have helped me tremendously:
- “You are a badass”
- “the secret”
- “the subtle art of not giving a fuck”

Two of these books can be purchased at target.
 
Hopefully this helps some of you as it has helped me get of the darkest times of my life. You’re not alone

My question about repressed memories... I have no recollection of sexual trauma. And I think maybe since I was exposed to stories as a child, maybe I am dealing with a sort of second-hand trauma? I don’t know. I just know that I don’t enjoy PIV sex much, and oral sex just brings up a lot of bad emotions in me and it freaks me out. And I have had several VIVID memories of me being raped by strangers or people I know. I have no sexual desire with people. I’m not particularly attracted to men or women. Though aesthetically, I prefer women. 

My mom has had an abusive past. She was raised in the foster system and has experienced severe abuse of each kind. But she received counselling at a young age and can cope well enough - she maybe was mildly emotionally abusive growing up, but that’s not what I want to focus on right now. 

My mom has always been open about her upbringing as my siblings and I grew up. I knew about her sexual trauma (though she wouldn’t share grotesque details, thankfully). 

I remember always sympathizing with victims and feeling like a victim all my life. I’ve been dealing with chronic depression my entire life, with the earliest memory of suicidal impulses being when I was ~5 years old. 

Considering my sexual experiences, my dreams, my severe chronic depression (which I believe is actually bipolar II but I’m waiting to talk to a psychiatrist to hear what they say... don’t want to self-diagnose), and my graphic nightmares about sexual abuse... is it reasonable to think that this just stems from me sympathizing with my mom’s experiences or perhaps I am dealing with trauma that I don’t remember?

I recently graduated high school but due to a combination of factors I postponed college until fall 2019. So right now I just take some core classes at a local community college (not a full course load). I was working through the spring/summer but the place I worked at is closing down so I don’t really have a job right now. I guess the point is that I have a lot of free time. I don’t really have friends and only ever hang out with one person so when I’m not doing school stuff I mostly just chill out, read, play video games, etc. Anyways my family has started giving me grief  staying in my room and not spending time with them, etc. Because I have so much free time and never interact or whatever

The situation got worse when my mom started up this long conversation yesterday, talking about more or less the same things. Normally I just try to avoid conflict at all costs, agree, apologize, try and fix it but this clearly wasn’t working and I ended up “spilling” and telling her that I just don’t really care about the family and that I would rather be completely alone.

It’s not that I don’t like my family members, it’s just that I’ve always kind of seen them more like acquaintances I guess. I don’t remember ever feeling something special when spending time with family members, which apparently isn’t normal for them. My original parents are separated and remarried, both pairs with kids of their own so I have a pretty large family but all that’s really there is apathy. I guess you could chalk this up to being a teenager but it seemed like my mom was pretty upset and she sent me one of those cryptic “I love you very much” texts later that night so something is definitely wrong.

The first red flag was when I forgot the name of the stop I was suppose to get off at, the second was when I started hallucinating, the voices started whispering to me, they told me to walk in front of a speeding car straight off the bus. For some bizarre reason I lost all autonomy of my body and started walking onto the street. if it hadn't been for the buss driver stopping me I would probably be dead right now.

The very next day I had a weird psychedelic experience involving a TV game show, The voices in my head started telling me the answers to the questions, and the strange thing is the majority of them were factually correct, that is despite me not actually knowing what the hell I was even saying. I can confirm this happened because I had an eye witness who proceeded to tell me ''wow you're good at these quiz's. The only reason I started getting the questions wrong was when I stopped listing to the voices in my head, or couldn't make out what they were saying because they became muffled .

That's three episodes I had,which in all honest has convinced me that going outside is not only to strenuous on my mind, but is actually determent to my well being; going out into the public must trigger some type of schizophrenic hazy episode, which causes memory loss for me because I honestly can't remember much at all.",08Sep2018,1

Im still young, but I feel like the Rational conscious part of me literally surrenders as soon as its clouded by emotions, such as anger as mentioned above.

In addition, this is almost like a slippery slope. Because I know that I regretted it in the past, after a while it is even more likely to happen again to me.

Bit of context first:
I'm 18, from the UK and I have Aspergers syndrome. I'm about to start university to study medicine in 2 weeks

I've been banging on to my family for the last few weeks about wanting to buy an iPad and Apple pencil to take notes on for medical school and I have just about enough money to do so, but I've been asking for advice about how to budget this and just generally thinking aloud to them to try and sort myself out as this is just the way I do things.

Today I finally sorted things when I got a phone call from my grandad saying I should get the more expensive iPad and he'll give me the difference. (The iPad pro instead of the cheaper 2018 one) I politely declined because I just didn't need the more expensive one and didn't want to put my grandad out like that.

62,"I needed to vent or get help or something, I really don’t even know what i’m looking for or doing. This is ridiculous.

As an introduction, hello, I’m a 30 year old trans guy living in Sacramento, CA. I’ve got ADHD, bipolar 2 disorder and a very severe case of social anxiety.

For the last like 13 years or so I thought it was normal for me to feel that I could live without social interactions. I’ve actually never really had friends, if I think about it. I suppose when I was in high school I had a select few pals I would go out and do things with but that was well over 10 years ago and things have changed.

Outside of my girlfriend (who lives 3000 miles away), small chat with service staff or people at the counter at the gas station and visiting my mother on the weekends, 
I am by all accounts 100% isolated and alone. 

I live in a house with two other people around my age but my mental illness has pretty much hindered any chances of me being able to speak to them, we used to have a semi decent friendship but somehow it drastically drifted due to my inability to speak to people and now we literally never say a word to each other even though we live in the same house.

I am on disability at the moment so I don’t work which makes meeting people in the work place not an option, i’m enrolled in a community college for web development but all of my classes are online. 

For the last like eight years ive spent pretty much my entire day every day alone in my room. I spend my days watching youtube videos, scrolling reddit, doing homework or sleeping. I get out of the house a bunch of times during the week as to not go completely crazy but my activities are all things i do by myself: go to therapy, go to the psychiatrist, take my dog to the dog park, go thrifting or go out taking photos as i’ve gotten into film photography the last few months. 

With all this isolation, it makes it hard for me to even function during things that involve other people and I have a really shitty time with it. 

For instance, I’ll go visit my mom but outside of very limited small talk of “how you doing” and my mom talking a lot about herself, our visits just consist of watching movies and eating dinner with barely anything being said between us. And it’s like that with almost all of my interactions with people.

I don’t know how to describe it other than that it literally physically feels impossible for me to talk to people. A lot of the time when I try to speak to people my brain goes completely silent and it’s almost as if i’m deaf/can’t hear anything and then my mouth doesn’t work. When I try to talk I get this lump in my throat and my chest as if i’m gonna throw up or burst out crying and unfortunately sometimes I do. I feel very uncomfortable making eye contact with people, I literally feel like i’m stuttering very badly when I talk even though i’ve been told repeatedly that I do not, it still feels like it in my head and my jaw feels like it’s locking up. I literally can’t ever seem to think of anything to say or ask or bring up. I can’t make conversation with anyone at all. I’m advised to just talk about myself but when it comes down to it I physically and mentally can’t. I never know what the fuck to say or how to say it. I’ve tried to go the whole route of just telling people that i’m easier to talk to if i’m asked a lot of questions but most of the time even that doesn’t help and I don’t feel like i’m contributing to the conversation at all. It literally feels like i’m just a silent empty husk. When people around me are talking I have virtually no input in what to talk about and it makes me feel insanely stupid. So a good 89% of the time i don’t say anything at all.

In return people think i’m weird or too quiet and it honestly makes me come off as an asshole who doesn’t care or something and i’m insanely boring. 

The strange thing is that I’m able to talk to my girlfriend a bit better but she’s also very understanding of and patient with my issues. 
I just feel terrible because a part of this problem i’m having is interfering with our relationship. she has a social life and has friends and I want to be making a good impression on them and hopefully make them want to be my friend too but instead i just leave every interaction with them feeling stupid and like they think i’m weird. 

Needless to say all of this is ruining my life, making it difficult for me to get out of my loneliness and if we’re being honest the solitude is making me pretty suicidal. 

I’m dying to change this or try to figure out what the heck is wrong with me.

help? ",08Sep2018,3
63,"I don't really know where is best to ask advice about this, so apologies if this is not the right place.

We are a close group of 6 male friends all turning 30 this year. We all dabbled in recreational drugs here and there  when we were younger but mostly out grew it as we settled down with wives etc.

One of the group, we'll call him Joe, had a bit of an episode last year after taking something, whilst he was drunk, at a party. He freaked out and when he went home he was arguing with his mother and the police were called. He spent a night in jail and afterwards apologized to everyone involved and vowed not to drink or take anything again.

After 6 months or so he started smoking the occasional joint but nothing else. 

A month or two later he had started acting strange. Like he was genuinely high on life. The way he was speaking was like he had become enlightened. Speaking in riddles sometimes and other times trying to be very profound.

We all sat him down and told him we were worried about him. He told us there was nothing to worry about, he was the happiest he's ever been.

Should we believe him or does it sound like there some other underlying issues?

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Even another subreddit that is better suited.

65,"I'm 25 and the last year , my life has been just a sequence of insane events. I have recently started working in this enormous law firm in this amazing job, which is great, but I'm surrounded by these beautiful, 'normal' people. We're trained to be watchful of everything everyone says, how everything can be used against you ,and to always be careful of your 'image' in front of colleagues. Nonetheless, I'm in with 40 other new lawyers  for sixty hours a week, my age,  and we're  expected to party and be friends with these people. Balancing both those things is driving me slightly insane.

Previous to this, I had a parent get very ill and almost die on a number of occasions. My ex had a drug overdose and then four  months later tried to kill me, so I  had to leave in the dead of night  to another country. I've back in with my parents as a result, which has been very difficult. 

There is therapy available to me through a professional body at the moment and I think it would be a good idea. But I'm nervous that they will think I'm totally insane, or that I'm lying because I couldn't be doing the job I'm doing and be coming from this background of drug addicts and shit. I feel so disconnected from other people, like they're living on another plane from me because I've been stuck with these recurrent existential threats every few weeks for the last year.

Anyway, vent over , thoughts welcome

66,"Whatever particular object is being focused on by my mind becomes blocked from perception.

	Ex: currently working a retail job through college (psych major) and it includes stocking shelves. Let‘s say I‘m holding a specific ibuprofen product and I‘m looking for its location on the shelf. I‘ve perused these shelves thousands of times over placing product in their appropriate locations, but because my mind knows i‘m looking for this particular one on the shelf, my brain won‘t register it when the light reflects off the box onto my eyes. It‘s whenever I finally give up looking for that particular product and it leaves my focus, THEN it registers whenever my eyes see it. 

	Ex: Sitting at my computer desk looking for my tv remote. I remember turning the tv off and putting the remote on the desk before I left for work, it was the last thing I did before I left. So while I‘m looking for it, i remember that, so I KNOW that its on the desk. No matter how long or hard I look, its whenever I give up and I have the thought „I‘m just going to manually turn it on“ then BAM! Remote was sitting right in front of me the entire time. I remember looking in that area, i remember my eyes crossing over the location of the remote several times, but the MEMORY is also missing the remote from its datafile.

	Ex: Looking for my camera, (it‘s sitting right beside me on the table), and while looking around for the camera (I had literally just set it down 10 seconds prior), I look all over said table, move things around, can‘t remember where I just placed it, while also not being able to perceive it. I look over to my friend „Shane, where did I set my camera“ and he looks at me, staring at me wide-eyed in disbelief says „Are you serious?“

I‘ve talked to my abnormal psych professor, cognitive psych professor, a counselor, all of them had the same response, „I have no idea, that‘s interesting.“ and had no advice on what to look into either. 

It‘s becoming a worsening issue. I misperceived a red light and made a left turn, not realizing that I had just ran a red light until half way through the intersection. I misperceive homework instructions and do assignments entirely wrong, then have to redo them, and then become confused and infuriated because then I don’t know if I‘m perceiving/ reading it correctly.

69,"I'm 19 and from the US and I just started my second year of college. Thursday I tried LSD(100ug) for the first time and I've been in a pretty bad mood since then. I think I might come out of this specific ""mood"" but the problem is still the same even if I do, and I want to be happier in general and not just continue life not doing much, so any advice is appreciated. I knew about the risks of LSD but I wanted to try it because I've heard a lot about its beneficial effects for depression and I thought it might help. The trip itself was fine. I don't know if I've actually been depressed but I've never really been that happy throughout a lot of my life. It seemed like the LSD did help some at first but now it's only gotten worse. I kinda just feel disinterested in most things now and I feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life. I don't even feel like doing simple stuff like watching tv or playing video games and I feel less interested in school. I think that my ""loneliness"" is probably the biggest factor in my depression because it's never been super easy for me to make friends but even when I talked to one of my friends earlier today I felt less interested in what we were doing. I feel like I've had a decent number of friends throughout life but normally I just end up not talking to friends after I'm not in school with them anymore, which is pretty much what's happening right now with high school friends but I still talk to a couple. I've been in college for a year and I've basically made no friends. Recently I've thought about joining a club or something but when I looked on the university website it didn't seem like there was anything I'd be interested in doing. I've also thought about getting a job and dating but I'm not sure if I should or if  would help. I feel like if I tried dating, it wouldn't go well since I'm not very sociable/funny/interesting around new people at first. I feel like I just have no fucking way of going about handling this. I feel like I want to do things but nothing seems interesting. I feel ""hopeless"" in a way but not really sad. I think the LSD might have made me realize the reality of the situation that I've been in for a while but in a way I felt a little bit more optimistic about things before I took it and I have no idea what to do now. I used to think things would somehow get better for me after college but now it feels like I'm looking at things objectively but in a negative way. Like I've always thought of myself as a relatively boring/quiet/not funny person most of the time and since there's not much I can do about it, it now makes feel like I'll go the rest of my life not making any friends, whereas I used to feel like I would still somehow make friends later in life. Also my appetite has been suppressed. Has anyone had any similar experiences to this and what did you do about it? Does this sound like the kind of thing antidepressants/therapy would help with?

71,"Hey there people of Reddit! This is quite a long story and I’ll try to give you the shirt of it. A few years back I was taken to to a IQ quiz and the person testing me officially diagnosed  me a general anxiety disorder. And while I always was an anxious person, I also have a lot of other problems that don’t match up with anxiety. Mostly the mood swings, my family must’ve gotten used to it or something and I’ve always been like this so I never though it was weird but my mood could change at least four to five times during an hour if I’m alone and watching Netflix or something. At worst (usually with people) it could be about eight to nine, I thought it was normal but when I was watching a video a few weeks ago on something I couldn’t remember for the life of me it said something about unstable moods and that what was happening wasn’t normal. I also have major anger issues, I try my best to keep cool being huge for my age and being able to hurt someone if I did get angry enough (I have shoved my brother several times after he provoked me) but I always seem to get irrationally surges of anger and have even the smallest annoyance set me off. There is the suicide/depression problem too, because of course I have to have that too. It mostly just stems from a feeling of hopelessness if ever having someone stay around in my life other than my family and eventually being abandoned by all my friends. Which will and had happened due to a parents job making my family stay in one place for never more than three years. It sounds great, going to new places, but it’s just so unstable and at one point I wondered wether I should even bother to make friends when we wouldn’t really talk after I left. I always have a on and off extreme love or hatred for each of my family members and at least one of them is always the subject of my hate. I don’t like being this way and I want help, but I don’t think this is all to do with anxiety. I don’t know if I’m looking for a thing to blame this all on or something to learn more about to help myself but I’m sick of feeling unstable, it’s been like this before I could remember and I want at least something that could help it. 
TLDR: Was diagnosed with anxiety but even though it’s in check I still ha e other problems like; feeling unstable in life, having had to move constantly, depressive/suicidal episodes due to feelings of eventual abandonment, anger issues, unstable relationships with family, and constant extreme mood swings that can happen multiple time in an hour.",08Sep2018,1

I can't definitely say that he is partying without me, but there is pictures of his friends and one of them normally drives with him to the party and who else was taking the pictures of them together. It must have been my friend.

75,"Hello to everyone,not a native English speaker but i will try my best at expressing myself through this language and it will seem like rambling because gathering my thoughts and putting them to words was always hard for me.

A little background first,i am a 26 years old male,socially normal,tall and average looking with horrible teeth,with a part time unstable job,lots of friends,normal social life but non existent sex life,am a virgin and never been in a relationship.

I think there is something wrong with me mentally and i'm going to try to explain it through symptoms and then i will write a bit more about the symptoms themselves to give a deeper insight into the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Unhappy,unmotivated and bored a lot of the time! So this is pretty much how i feel right now and how i felt for the most of my adult life.The worst thing is i don't know the recipe to being happy and fulfilled and i generally don't know what to do with my life and what my future holds.I do hope it's something good,but thinking about it makes me anxious!

&amp;#x200B;

\- Low self confidence,expectance and fear of failure! This is a huge monkey on my back and the reason i never tried to have a girlfriend,i get anxiety thinking about approaching and being with a girl partly because of my bad teeth but also because i anticipate it would be hell of an awkward scenario.I do have sex drive but this blockade in my head is just too big to overcome.This is pronounced in other areas of my life as well although like on my job,i am hectic and unfocused a lot of the time and my superior often times says slow down and concentrate man.I always think i'm going to fuck up and i have no confidence in my skill and that i will hone it ever.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Difficulty making decisions! A lot of the time even the most trivial dilemmas can make me overthink like crazy!For example,picking a movie,when buying things,should i do something or not.I can spend an hour looking for a movie to watch and then i just give up and don't watch one and i am a filmophile mind you.I search for a new PC to buy for a month and just end up not buying one as i fear spending the money and i feel guilty afterward etc etc...

&amp;#x200B;

\- As of late some social anxiety and sweating when anxious!Although i got this under control partly,sometimes i will sweat  facially at the beginning of social gatherings,i will anticipate this sweating,people noticing it makes it worse but it usually lasts a few minutes then i ease in and everything is ok.I do not know why this started and cannot pinpoint the first time exactly but i also used alcohol as a crutch for this on many occasions as it prevents it completely.

&amp;#x200B;

\- And lastly i might have an alcohol problem! The best explanation is that i can control when i drink but once i start i will down 10 pints easily and sometimes but very rarely black out.I did use alcohol as a social lubricant since i was in high school but am not dependent on it physically since i can go month or months without drinking but in the last 2-3 years the consumption and tolerance has surely increased.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is,majority of my friends and family find me normal,they even think i'm witty and confident although weird perhaps,and i am struggling to keep this facade for much longer since i never told these things to anyone and i never relayed my feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what i ought to do,fix my teeth,find a girlfriend,get a hobby or a passion,buy a car,have patience with my job as i am waiting for a full time employment,yadda yadda yadda...problem is i cannot make myself do these things,i have this mental blockade in my head,this feeling of not being able to help myself and find motivation even when i know what needs to be done.

What is wrong with me and what do you guys suggest,am i depressed,anxious or just....i don't know...?
