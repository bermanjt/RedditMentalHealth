0,i can do everything right and still life finds a way to fuck me over constantly. what's the point in trying then?,22Mar2018,1
1,"I’ll get right to the point:  I am always tired. Even after a full nights sleep(7-9 hours). To the point that I have dosed off while driving briefly. Also, when I get to work I get there early and put my feet up and close my eyes for a half hour or so.  I’m a teacher and we’ve had a number of snow days, and I literally slept through most of those days. We had one again today and I literally slept most of the day. 

I don’t feel necessarily depressed, but I feel I have no energy and no motivation. I take anafranil and lamatrogine for OCD and mood stabilization. 

I guess my question is this: has anyone experienced this? If so, what did you find was the cause and were you able to move past it?

PS—I had a sleep study down and it was negative for sleep apnea. ",22Mar2018,1

3,"**Goal:** to be more comfortable in my body **Problem:** I feel very dis-connected from my sexually and reproductively dimorphic characteristics. I've had these feelings since I was about 12.

I don't like having breasts, hips, any of that. Don't even get me started on down there and up there and *in there*. Can't bring myself to have sex of any kind with anyone, or to try it myself, because I feel so dis-associated from those parts.

I don't feel I could use anything *in there* to carry and birth a child. It doesn't *feel* real. Intellectually, I know I have all the reproductive parts (except Fallopian tubes, because I had those removed), but it doesn't feel as if I *should* have reproductive organs at all.

I posted a very similar post on r/relationships a couple days ago, and most of the commenters internet-diagnosed me with BDD (Body Dysmorphic Disorder) and DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder).

Many users suggested I was on the autism spectrum, but I doubt that, because I've been tested several times for autism since I was 6 years old and never been diagnosed. They also said I was asexual - I am not really bothered either way, if I'm sexual or asexual. (Note: They didn't claim that autism explains all this, only that it explains the detachment and lack of sexuality)

None of my past therapists have diagnosed me with BDD, despite my insistence.

* My issues aren't mostly about my appearance. The biggest problem I have is with my uterus, and I can't even see that.
* I don't think about it for hours each day. I don't have ""persistent and intrusive preoccupations""
* My breasts are neither imagined, nor slight; I have mounds on my chest that anyone would agree are visible
* I don't avoid work or social situations because I fear others will notice my breasts or hips, it doesn't matter if others notice
* Most BDD sufferers seem to find issues with facial features, hair, skin, fat, muscles, etc. but these aren't the issues I have
* Mostly, when I went to BDD forums, their experiences didn't seem to fit mine.
* The only symptoms that applies is ""seeking surgery"" and camouflaging (I used to wear a chest binder, but I gave that away today because it's an unhealthy coping mechanism for BDD).

**I think I probably have *partial* DID because I'm only dis-associated with some specific body parts, not my whole body - I feel very disconnected from my reproductive organs/breasts/genitals but not from my arms, hands, legs, feet, face, skin, hair, heart, lungs, liver, etc.** I feel very ""real"" and ""in"" my body, except I feel that these specific parts (reproductive organs/breasts/genitals) are not a part of me, as if they are foreign objects.

All past therapists (seen 4 in the last 9 years), have diagnosed me with gender dysphoria, but I am female and am comfortable moving through the world as a woman, so I'm not transgender. I *wish* I was transgender so that I could have top surgery and a hysterectomy, both of which I want, but I'm not trans, so I am seeking therapy for BDD and DID. In the meantime, I just wanted to know what people here think. Thanks!",22Mar2018,1

5,"To begin, I want to clarify I'm not obsessed with women in a violent kind of way. In fact, it's quite the opposite. I was diagnosed with severe OCD when I was young, though I'm not sure if this is the cause of my actions. 

I overly care for all women, no matter what. If I see a woman cry, I will drop everything to help her. This may seem normal and sympathetic, until you take into account that I have no sympathy for men in the slightest. Being male myself, I'm not sure what has caused this. But if I see a man hurt, I do not care and rarely do anything to help immediately. But I naturally protect women, to the extent where if I grow overly attached to one, like a friend or lover, I obsess over their safety. I also get extremely protective, threatening to (or proceeding to) severely hurt anyone who even touches them in a slightly threatening manner. 

I wanted to know if anyone has experienced similar feelings, if anyone knows what these thoughts may spawn from, and if it is connected to mental disorders at all. Thank you~",22Mar2018,0
6,"So, I guess I should provide a bit of context. For a long time I have been dealing with self-esteem issues. I don't want to go into much detail, but it kind of works in a way where I hate myself, call myself mediocre, useless, and tell myself really terrible things in general. I understand that this thoughts are... well, stupid, but I always fail to ignore them, and they get to me. And they have increasingly become worse, the voice in my head that tells me this usually gets so loud and disruptive that it becomes hard to just function. But also I feel kind of like i shouldn't bother people with my problems since they are probably dealing with their own, and I would not think they would care that much either, so I have not told anyone about it.

So in order to cope I have been doing this thing for a few years now, where I push myself into working. Start a project, lead a group, join a competition, start another project, join a few other pair of competitions, learn a new skill, etc. In general I usually just set really difficult to achieve goals, at once, and see what happens. As a result, I tend to force myself not into perfection, but into excellency. Getting second place in competitions (literal and personal) makes me furious, but it also makes me feel alive; and when I finally get first place I feel incredible, empowered, like being high. You could say I love the struggle, the stress, and finally the reward.

But when it all goes quiet and I've finally arrived home, I feel like literal shit. I guess the thoughts occur much easier without the distractions, but maybe what I'm doing is unhealthy. My schedule of course is really hectic and doesn't leave much wiggle room for socialising and relaxing, and head-aches and insomnia accompany my really long days.

I want to stop, relax, but quietness drives me mad... I'm not sure if what I'm doing is healthy. For the record I have never had therapy or mental help of any sort, and I'm not sure if I should get any, but this situation is really getting out hand.

Thank you for help, guys.",22Mar2018,2

But I’ve just kept hitting road blocks. I spent two hours basically accomplishing nothing. It was so, so frustrating and demoralizing because I still don’t feel good and I could have been using this time to recuperate but the entire time I would have been resting I would have been anxious over the stuff I wasn’t getting done.

It physically and mentally hurts when I see him alone. I just can’t push myself to go to him. It’s tearing me apart. Is it normal for someone with anxiety/depression to be so clingy?

I’m just really frustrated by this lack of ... productivity, I guess. I know I can spend my time better, but I don’t, because I tell myself I need to relax because it’s my “day off.” Does any of that make sense?

I have no real life friends, but i do have my old online friends from brazil.

It really bothers me when i am sitting all alone and i just hear people having fun with each other making dumb jokes and in general being nice to each other.

It bothers me because i want to join in and have some fun too, in brazil i use to have fun with my friends and i loved it, my life was always happy and bright.

Now my life is pretty damn boring and sad the only good parts of it are when i get to connect with my friends through discord.

I tried joining in a group that was having fun, i ended up pissing somebody off really badly, they gave me a really creepy stare as a result
His stare basically told me ""i will kill you in your sleep"".

I don't know how to deal with all the cold shoulders i keep getting from these people always giving me mean stares and.basically ignoring all the damn time.

It makes me feel like nobody loves me and that i am pathetic and uninteresting, i even was thinking if i belonged in this world.

16,"So I figured I'd post this here and hope it gets some kind of response. I've been going through a really rough time lately, far worse than my usual which isn't good to begin with. But I've been reading that journaling can help. I'm just worried that journaling would just turn into a stream of consciousness full of really horrible shit. It's bad enough to have intrusive thoughts in my head, but having them on paper (as possible evidence for anyone wanting to have me committed against my will or the like?) just  seems like a horrible idea. 

The only option I can think of would be journaling only ""good"" things, which would feel fake and forced or just make me realize I'm not going anywhere/doing anything worthwhile. In short, it really just seems like it would make things worse. 

Has anyone done journaling and have an opinion on it? Any ideas to get around it feeling forced and gross and making me even more miserable? I just really don't know where to go from here.

All I can hear when I close my eyes to try to sleep is whispers and weird noises, subtle noises but I notice them, I notice all the small noises - the train tracks being worked on, people talking outside, etc - and I can't not fixate on them. Its all I can think about when I try to sleep, the noises, the whispers or the stupid shit I've done in the past coming to haunt me.

19,"So I just needed to get this off my chest.

I had an argument today with my mom because About two months ago, I quit my job at Domino’s and since then I had been telling her that I’d been going to work when I usually work, until recently she decided to call up the place and found out I had quit- she’s paranoid like that. Either way, I wanted to not say I had quit because I knew she would be irrationally mad about it, and she WAS as I predicted, and didn’t listen to any of my reasons for quitting. I would have to come in on days that I asked off, I would pull the weight of other people who were lazy, and dealt with some really crappy assholes there. 

I explained that all to her and apparently didn’t care at all. I also told her I hadn’t gotten a job yet because I’ve been trying to work on getting my counseling settled (first appointment is tomorrow finally) and get better, mentally, before I go back to work. I told her I was honestly being driven insane working there and doesn’t it make logical sense to remove myself from a shitty situation? I also told her I have been working on the very important nursing application I’m working on for the nursing program at school, so obviously I wanna work on that before I start working again and stressing myself out. I’m also working to keep my grades up in my classes.

And then she says after all that “I suppose you’ve been hanging with your boyfriend all that time” which was right and then she fucking dares, to make me feel bad, to say “HES GOING TO SCHOOL, he’s bettering himself” 

Like, what in the fucking hell? I’m 
-going to school
-concentrating on getting my nursing application done
-have been looking into getting therapy and am about to have my first session 
- took a short break from working ( previously had been working for 2 years part-time with no break) just so I could feel better and not be driven to the brink of insanity by a job I hated

And then she’s going to say something like that? I feel like my mom is just spewing shit to make me feel bad. just living life with whatever mental illness I have is hard enough, but I’m making small strides towards my future - and she’s just gonna disregard all that and say I’m not doing shit? What kind of a parent is that.

20,"Alright, so as the title says, I'm afraid to go back to public school. I left because I continuously had anxiety attacks. It's been two years since I've been attending an online school. I'm pretty much home all the time except for around 6ish hours a week. I still keep in touch with friends, but they're always telling me how much fun they're having or things that're happening. It makes me miss all social interaction with people. I feel like I'm missing out on my high school years, and that I'm going to regret not being there with everyone.

21,"**Background:**

First of some background. I am self-taught and self-motivated of what I have accomplished thus far. 

I come from a small city in Europe, taught my self English, went to college, worked for a bit, and now doing masters at one of the top 10 programs in the US. 

I have by all means surpassed what my parents have achieved in all their lives by now. However I have a huge problem.

**Problem #1**

I am able to do more 24 hours before a deadline than 2 or 3 weeks before the deadline. Sometimes I choose to not start working on something knowing I will just waste time
procrastinating and leave it for the last moment that I will perform the best. My problem is how do I harvest this ability into something I am capable of doing every day?

**Problem #2**

I can't multi-task. I get overly obsessed with a subject and for few days, a week, a month or few months that's all it matters to me to breath. Let it be working out, let it be research, a subject at school, a job opportunity, working, socializing, or partying. I do that until I burn out and then either move to the next thing or wait until I recover and go at it again. I hardly can have a balance. 

**Problem #3**

My mood affects my work. Problems with my family or a significant other, or friends can get to me super hard and distract me from my goals. I can spend all day watching videos 
unable to do anything during this time. 


**Personal Conclusions**

I believe I have potential, there is a lot of raw power coming from within me, that is just not utilized correctly. It feels like I am driving a car on the wrong gear all the time and not able
to get 100% from the engine. I know the reasons for that, I had terrible parenting, nobody to look up to and never developed any discipline or work-ethic. I am 24 almost 25. 


How can I fix these now?

important receipts (that I told myself to keep)

Forgotten to pay rent and bills on time.

When people find out that I am very bipolar, I have sever anxiety disorder, PTSD, and bad insomnia they always let the insomnia fall to the side. But it is a big problem. For those of you who do not have to deal with this I am truly happy for you. But if you wouldn't mind reading the rest of this, you will find out why I am happy for you. You are lifelessly pacing around your apartment as you have been awake for the past four days and all you have left is hours of pacing around on empty. I know what you are thinking, lay down rather than pace. Well the problem you run into here is you just lay there for hours alone with nothing but your thoughts. And I know first hand that laying alone with your thoughts can lead to a self hatred that is brought on because too much self reflection with out having someone to let you know that you have so much to be happy for. You don't think of that on your own. After about the the day of being up I tend to tart to lose it. I question everything. I start to wonder if any of my friends really like me. I wonder if I will ever be good enough. I wonder why I have never done anything that matters. I wonder why I feel trapped in my own head. And the answer is because as your body runs down, your mind runs down. But you are not able to recharge. And this leaves you in the midst of a mental state that you have no idea to get out of.

Do they just want to see how bad I get so they can say they know someone who has completely snapped?'

I can't take this, I don't know what to do. My meds don't work and I am walking on a very thin line. I feel like I could snap and completely lose my mind at any moment.

This continues for his entirety of the last maybe 9 or ten years. I don’t remember at which point he completely stopped going outside but it was probably around 11 years old. Now he only leaves the house to maybe go to the doctor or get a haircut. He’s going to be 18 this year and the only people he knows are people who are family or people who come to my parents house. I don’t live near my parents anymore but when I go home for Christmas he doesn’t talk to me or my boyfriend even if we talk to him. The only person he talks to is my mom. He’s 17 years old now and is apparently done being homeschooled so now he wakes up around 1 pm and sits in front of the computer until around 4 in the morning. 

My mom does everything for him, even puts the toothpaste on his toothbrush. The thing is, he is 100 % capable of doing the things she does for him on his own but she’s just always done it for him. The last time I was home I heard him talk for the first time in a few years and it was to swear at my mom for waking him up at NOON. He only seems to have two interests, watching videos of people playing games, and anime. 

My mom told me a few years ago she thought he might be autistic but she never got him diagnosed or tried to change anything in the daily routine that might help with the condition. He still is not diagnosed with anything. It’s getting hard for me to even visit home because I don’t like having to be quiet about the situation. I wonder about what will happen when my parents are gone. 

The homeschooling he had was so basic I would say he only has maybe middle school education. Also he was being taught by my mom who never graduated high school. He has no intention of trying to go to a tradeschool or university or get a job. I feel like it is possible he did have undiagnosed autism, but I think everything was made worse by the homeschooling, never leaving home, no rules, no independence, unlimited screen time etc... I think he could have been high functioning to the point of being able to work etc had it not been for all the other factors. 

Has anybody else experienced situations like this? How do you deal with it? I don’t want to fight with my parents about it but I can’t stand being around the situation.",22Mar2018,2

48,"So Throughout my high school years I was always wild. I did a lot of partying, I smoked and drank all the time. Well this last summer I was drinking and smoking every night. I had hit a bong for the first time and got extremely high, stayed awake for straight 8hrs after that, extremely paranoid, and even told my parents because I got so scared. 
Ever since then I decided I was done smoking. Well I was fine being around it, just didn’t do it. I still drank with my friends. I started my first semester of college and my best friend who I did most of my partying with moved away. My other friends had boyfriends and I didn’t see them much. So I did a lot of staying at home and not partying. Well now times has gone on, I have a extreme fear of weed. I can’t even smell the scent without being paranoid I will get high off of it. And I never had any bad experience with drinking. But now I’m scared to get drunk cause I’m scared I won’t be able to sleep. It’s the weirdest fears I know. But I don’t know how to overcome them. I’m tired of being a chicken about it all. I’m also on Zoloft for my anxiety over being scared I won’t be able to sleep at night. 
Does anybody have any recommendations on what I should do? ",22Mar2018,1

50,"I think I suffer with generalised anxiety disorder. Some days I get good days and don't feel as anxious. But for instance yesterday I kept getting this feeling that something was wrong with me and I didn't know what and I felt like I couldn't sit still and just wanted to get up and run away some where. When I feel like this I feel very anxious on my own, so being around other people I feel 100 times worse. When I feel this way I feel like there is something seriously mentally wrong with me and feel like I am going crazy. But like I say I sometimes get good days and don't feel as bad. The feeling often just randomly comes over me from time to time. The thing is I am an obsessive worrier, from the moment I wake up in the morning until the moment I go to sleep at night I am obsessing and worrying about something. Often I am obsessing about my mental health and obsessing how I can get better and worrying when that severe anxiety feeling will come back. I have heard that I am better to just allow the anxiety and unpleasant feelings to be there, like rather than push the feelings away and fight them I am better to just let the feelings be there. Because apparently constantly trying to push the feeling away is actually making it worse? But the thing is I really do try to push the feeling away because I hate feeling like that, and then I go back to obsessing about how I can get rid of that feeling, even right now I am obsessing about it. I also think maybe the constant worry and stress could actually be causing my symptoms? Does anyone know any good ways to overcome the severe anxiety feelings I always get? Or how to cope with the feelings? Does anyone know of any natural things I can do to overcome the feelings? Or any natural things I can take that will make me feel better?  ",22Mar2018,1
51,"So, my boyfriend is seriously suicidal. To a point where I've tried alerting his friends and family, e-mailed and left a voicemail with his therapist, and actively working with his friends to make sure we cover all our bases.

I'm in a long distance relationship with him, I'm in California, he's in Iowa. So, I can't personally be with him right now. He moved and got a new job recently, so I don't have his new address. I can't ask him for his new address because he is a stubborn dummy and he won't want to give it to me because I've called the police to his place before, for suicide threats. He hates when I call the police on him and has absolutely no sense of self preservation, even when he isn't suicidal.

I was thinking about calling his work to see if I can get his new address from them, but I was worried that if I did, he could potentially lose his job. I don't even know if his new job would be willing or could give me such personal information, so I could be needlessly risking his job. Losing his job because of me is the last thing he needs, and would probably worsen his overall mental health.

54,"Please let me know if you all think like this at all. I honestly think there is something dysfunctional with my thoughts, and I want to change this so badly. I'll try to explain what I am experiencing and then give examples. (I'm going to use the word awkward alot because that's basically what I feel)

I feel this awkwardness between me and literally every person on this earth that I meet besides my parents, brother, and few close friends. It's tough to explain, but it feels like there is an awkward, weird, connection between us, especially (but not necessarily) if I said/did something embarrassing in the past. When I think of past events with people, I feel this awkwardness. I also feel like people generally don't like me and avoid me, though no one has ever told me(except when I was younger and people were bullies) that I'm mean or look weird or anything that makes me a person repellant. Today I have been trying to study, but my thoughts are constantly focused on the past, embarrassing situations where I feel the weird way about the people from the past and I don't think this is helping me move forward in life. Also, I definitely think the people also feel this connection with me, it's not just me, but they don't feel it with anyone else. 

Ex 1: I am a 22 year old female and have graduated from university. Yet I still think about this one girl who was in my middle school and part of highschool who I had the weird connection with. She was very social and liked by everyone and I wasn't, but there was this weird awkwardness between us always though she was pretty nice. I would always know in the back of my mind if she was in the room and I know she was the same with me. We were on the same varsity team in high school, and this awkwardness persisted and the whole team loved her, as did I, but yet we could never be friends because of this. I still think back to her and feel that awkwardness and like I'm not good enough. I feel like I have this same connection with EVERYONE but to a less degree unless the person is a good friend or close family member. I know if I met this girl today, though its been around 8 years since I last saw her, we would not be friends and would be distant still due to this weirdness.

Ex. 2- With the same school team I was talking about, I felt this same awkwardness with each team member, and everyone was bffls, except with me. I was always the lone one out that everyone treated like an outcast(I honestly have no idea why, I know I didn't try too hard to fit in and was nice and not crazy). I still think back to that and feel awkward, and if I see those team mates around town all the way back from when I was 16, I pretend to not know them.

Ex.3- This same awkwardness exists with my cousins. They all love hanging out with each other and I used to enjoy it as well..... that is until I started realizing that they all stay away from me and treat me awkwardly, act like I don't exist, and apparently call me stupid. They love my brother though. How I've reacted is that I always pretend I'm busy now and never go to our family gatherings because I don't like feeling left out for no reason. :( My mom has noticed all of this, and it makes her feel bad, and that makes me feel even worse because she just wants us all to be a happy family.

Ex. 4- I worked in a research lab at my university, and I have to get letters of recommendation from the lab director. I didn't have any problems there and worked hard, and did my best even if there were some bumps. But now, a whole year later, I am anxious to have to go meet with the director because I feel the awkward tension between us.

Ex.5- I even feel this awkwardness if I go to the same coffee shop 10 days in a row. I feel like the baristas and I have this weird connection where I hope the same barista isn't there because of the awkwardness when I think of them and when I'm there.

Now that I've written all of this, I think there is something wrong with my thoughts, but I can't pinpoint why I am always excluded or why people just don't like me...... Does anyone feel this way ever or have any advice on how to proceed????

Tldr- People don't like me for some unknown reason, I am always excluded, and there is a constant awkward tension present between me and everyone I meet in life. What is going on??? Thank you. :)

55,Ever since I started doing drugs especially fake weed my brain and body have felt off. like seriously off. i have stopped using for a while now and I know of course I did some irreversible damage but i can't find anyone else that feels the way I do. when i drink water or any other liquid or eat food with liquid my body and mind start to feel off. my body gets heavy and my brain gets foggy. my mouth gets dry and i feel alot of pressure squeezing my head. like a head pressure headache. peeing makes me feel better or working out but then when i consume liquids again it's back to the way I felt before. I can't even enjoy the little things in life anymore because I feel so off. my body should and mind should not be responding the way it does to food and drink. I get really irritable and my social life suffers and i am unable to concentrate on things.  I have yet to find anyone else that feels the way I do and idk what to do anymore. Idk if i can live a normal life. I want to be hopeful and recover from this but i have no idea what to do because it is complex.  I also lose my sense of taste time to time.  at first I didn't know what was going on and thought this will go away eventually but it didnt. i never really brought it up because I feel crazy everytime i do just explsining it  I have becone really ocd from this and I limited my diet severely and i don't eat or drink much now to control my symptoms.

It’s been about a week and a half and it gets a tad better at times, but at the same time it still pulls my heart or what’s left of it. I get sudden flashes of memories and I remain still just thinking about what we were as if I’m trying to relive that memory to it’s fullest. My mind &amp; self still have not understood nor want to come to terms that it’s over. 

It seems as though I cannot let go, unless it’s just too early? Through those 4 years I was molding everything we told each other into my head and I believed it all, trusted it all with everything I had. I feel like I gave everything to her, handed her my heart because I trusted her, gave my soul to be with hers. My mind and body feel drained, all this is extremely overwhelming mentally. 

Why can’t I let go? When will I be? I understand people say to keep busy, but I don’t have anybody to hang out with where I am and I’m not very social. When I was with her, my whole life revolved around her, all I wanted was nothing more than to just be in her presence because that gave me life, gave me the purest form of happiness. Now that we’re split, I remain alone, sometimes with completely nothing to do, thus leading to strong thoughts of what was. It’s constantly just sitting there, feeling that void of all emotions absent.

In the most truth of it all, somehow I believe she wasn’t meant for me and I truly think there’s somebody out there, but I don’t think I’ll ever meet them. I’ve never felt so alone, time will tell, as I’ve been told. But till that said time is told, I don’t have anything to keep my mind busy, nobody to hangout with. If anybody is reading this, I thank you for being there, &amp; if anybody comments, I greatly appreciate you reaching out, seriously.

63,"Mental health issues are at an all time high. Depression, suicides, killings. All because we live in a society where people think it's okay to be trolls, people think it's okay to get laughs at the expense of someone else's mental trauma. It makes me fucking sick. Sometimes, the people who seem happy are the most hurt, and I think it's because they don't want their friends or family to be effected by their own circumstances. Moods are contagious and they WANT to be happy, but believe me when I say that that is just a facade. Mental health issues could stem from a childhood traumatic event, loss of a loved one, a violent past. We ridicule people for being sensitive, we bottle up emotions and sweep shit under the rug. People will label me an an emo or whatever the fuck people say. If there's anything I've learned in my life it's to be respectful of those around you, because from experience, it is extremely painful being disrespected and ridiculed. I've tried dealing with my own issues in several ways. Not always the best solutions either. I've turned to drugs and alcohol, I've isolated myself, denied friendships, been angry, sad, depressed, suicidal,You name it. The only thing I have that has helped me  put things into perspective is my friends and family. They keep me grounded. If it wasn't for them keeping me balanced, I really don't know what I'd do.. They are my constant reminder to stay strong and set the right example.. So with that being said, let's take a stand and end the stigma of mental health issues, before its too late.. i just want to ask, not just for myself but hopefully anyone else that might be dealing with some thing.

68,"I'm crossposting my thread from r/mentalillness - I hope that's okay!

First: English isn't my native language (German it is), so please bear with me - there will be a few grammar mistakes here and there.

About me:

* 28 years old, male, single
* emotional abuse/neglect as a child
* BPD as a suspected diagnose from my psychiatrist
* I've self harmed in the past (and still do, but rarely)
* helicopter parents, my mother might be narcissistic or suffering from BPD
 
Since my puberty and adolescence I have this craving to get diagnosed with a mental disorder, especially schizophrenia or any other serious mental disorder. For example: A couple of years ago I became deeply jealous of a co-worker who had schizophrenia and I wished that I could get the disorder too, especially the treatment in a mental hospital was important to me. I am also kind of scared to get the BPD diagnosis taken away from me - it would make me feel kind of empty I guess? Not 'special' anymore? It's really hard for me to describe.

I can't really put my finger on it, but it might have to do with attention seeking and/or gaining sympathy from others. However, I do not 'fake' any of my symptoms and I'm not proud of being mentally ill. (or am I, to some extent?) I even wear sweaters in midsummer so that nobody can see my scars from self harming and I do not boast about any of my symptoms. I also want to make clear that I am very honest with my psychiatrist but I haven't talked about this problem yet, but I plan to on my next visit in april.

After some research I've found out about münchhausen's syndrom and factitious disorders, but I don't really think that I fit those criteria since I do not fake being mentally ill. I also do not want to be disabled in any form and I do not sabotage my health.

Can someone here relate or maybe help?

70,"I have a suspicion that growing up in a family with lots of kids (more than 4) can be damaging on mental health, but I can’t find much in the literature. There have been studies about family size and mental health, but they are mostly studying kids with no siblings vs. kids with one or two siblings.  Not surprisingly, having at least one sibling is good for mental health. 

But I’m wondering about large families. Specifically, I grew up in a family of seven kids, and several of my now adult siblings struggle with anxiety, depression, and personality disorders.  

I’m not saying I don’t love my siblings, and my parents did the best they could. But I think having that many siblings really puts your mental health at risk. Any thoughts on this?

She began having panic attacks before going to work in the morning. Her attacks include shortness of breath and uncontrollable shaking and nausea. She would hide this and cope by turning to alchol to calm her nerves. Up until a certain point she hid it from me but it got to a point where she couldn’t hide it anymore. When I found out I convinced her to get help and we went to a psychiatrist who gave he three different medications and told her to come back in a month to see how they worked.

Since then she has gotten worst to where she fainted at work and is now on leave from wrok. Her anxiety isn’t just about work anymore, she now gets into these moods of self-loathing.  And her trigger for her anxiety can be small things and im afraid shes losing her ability to function. And to add to this she relied on alcohol to calm her down for so long that she is now an alcoholic and she needs to drink at least some alcohol pretty much every day. 

Im looking for any advice for steps we can take to get her some help. I was taking to her about trying some type of inpatient treatment where she can receive more thorough help. Do you guys have any advice?
