1,"I've been expecting this to get better since I was a child, and it has not. I feel like it's anxiety related. I'd really like it if anyone could relate, or could help me understand.  
  
I want to be able to deal with the people in my life without explaining my feelings to them. Most of those people don't/won't understand, and typically take any sort of conversation about my feelings as an attack against their actions. It never ends well.

Sorry for the lousy post. I just know that if I don't post this now I never will.",31May2018,3
2,"Comedy and cooking.

Tried stand up comedy, it went amazingly actually, but getting myself to write feels like pulling teeth. Plus I'm still terrified of boming/getting heckled.

As for cooking, I worked in a kitchen (upscale burger joint...) for 4 months part-time in addition to my crappy (but high paying, secure, awesome benefits having) day job. Loved the kitchen atmosphere and work, hated some of my coworkers, had to quit.

Haven't gone back to a kitchen but I'm strongly considering it (getting really excited about it actually)....

But i always feel like I ""should"" be ""doing"" comedy, even though it feels like pulling teeth. I can't seem to either ""just do it"", even just a little bit, each day, or give it up....doing it or giving it up both seem f***ing impossible to me!

I probably shouldn't even write this complainy post....I've known for a long time that my mission these days is to keep striving for daily action and discipline instead of asking the universe (or strangers on the internet) for some magic pill.

I've been super busy and stressed with two jobs, being in early recovery again, my fitness routine, cooking my own meals to save money, and just being depressed and horribly anxious, plus having to move 4 times this year due to unbearable room mates (I know I'm no prince, but man oh man is the room-mate market saturated with difficult people).

It's been brutal...but I want more, despite how that's probably a wild goose chase, but I can't....seem...to...just....fuck***....do....it....",31May2018,3
3,"I’ve never had this before - 
Missed a couple of doses of my usual anti depressants and tonight the usual very touchy and teary but all of a sudden I just snapped.

I’ve been irritable and insanely angry by the tiniest things and can’t get it to stop. Even mistyping a word on this post is making me want to smash every plate in the house.

I’ve been slamming drawers, acting an arsehole to all my loved ones, nearly breaking down and smashing something at the slightest inconvenience. My poor dog is terrified.

Anyone know what’s happening or how I can calm down? ",31May2018,1
4,"I can't just let my mind float free. The root of my identity in each moment is generally a concept or idea that I continously return to. I have gone through countless of these for a few years now. In times of greater hardship, I cycle through them faster. When I am at my shitty job, I may cycle through 3 or 4 of these in 8 hours. There is something about me where the smaller and more concise the idea is, the more attractive it is to me. There is also something about me where I feel great sadness in having to shift what I will call my ""top\-level thought"". And yet when I discover my next ""top\-level thought"", I cherish it and I feel like this is the one. I want this top\-level thought to work in every situation. **I have some strange problem with dogmatism** in this way.

An aside: To me, the future is uncertain. I have problems planning for anything because there is always a chance I will die or not succeed. In my view, I could get cancer or one of the other countless problems humans can get. I am scared being made of flesh and blood. I should note also that I enjoy video games, alcohol and marijuana. I really wish I didn't like these things. This is a bit of an aside, but I am searching for something that will stop me from doing these things.

**Anyways my problem is I am searching for a thought or concept to continously return to. Something I can always return to that works in every situation. The answer to this is probably that you can't, it is constantly changing throughout your life.**

Examples:

""Pay attention to the breathing""**Well you can't pay attention to breathing while talking to someone or moving heavy boxes.**

""Look for what you are calling ""I""""**This has not worked for me.**

""Why should my top\-level thought even be in english? I speak two other languages.""**I started trying to ensure that I think in all 3 languages equally. This didn't last long needless to say.**

""Watch your thoughts or make it easy to watch your thoughts""**The problem with stuff like this is that really I just want to get high or drink. The reason for this whole project may be simply that I am trying not to do drugs**

""There isn't one thing you can always return to. It is constantly changing""**This is a good one. But it scares me. If I can't continously return to the same idea, I am scared.**

""Make it easy to look for what you are calling ""I""""

""I need to be able to sit still, take deep breaths, and have a good time doing nothing""

""I need to make sure I reach the peak of the moral landscape before I die \(A Sam Harris concept\)""**The problem here is that I just don't know what that is.**

""I need to make sure I reach enlightenment before I die""

""I could die at any moment""

""Pretend that you only have 1 year to live""

""All of reality could be ""unplugged"" at any moment""

I recently moved to a new place, very small town, to pursue education (a program I've wanted to get into for a while now, a couple years at least). I knew I was struggling with mental problems before moving here... but it's been very apparent to me just how much I understated these problems.

I'm taking steps to handle myself (seeing mental health people at my college is the first step).

I just don't know what I'm doing. I've been struggling with a lot and I feel like I just need a friend who can relate.

12,"Before you carry out your purpose, I would like you to read these few lines. The only authority I can claim to request this from you, is the fact that I do not need to put myself in your place to make you reconsider, since, once, I WAS in your place. I'm talking about something that happened many years ago; therefore, in addition, I can see your dilemma in perspective. So the one who speaks to you is the voice of experience. I know that you feel bad, very bad, that things could not go worse and that everything seems to have been conjured against you. There is no hope on the horizon. Maybe at this time you have given up, as it happened to me. To understand what I'm going to tell you next, you have to know that, months before having thrown in the towel, I had participated in a literary contest, but I had no hope of winning it. I already accumulated some experience in such failures and, well, why would it be different this time? In fact, a lot of months had passed since (just two days before the expiration of the manuscript submission deadline) I happened to learn about the contest; so I had already forgotten that pile of pages that I wrote in a hurry. Well, it was then that a seemingly insignificant thing happened. I passed by a bookstore window and I was struck by the title of a book: ""Life after life"" by an American doctor named Raymond Moody. Given such a title, I felt a logical curiosity in my situation and I bought it. Dear friend, may this brief letter have the same influence on you that the reading of that book on me! His author reported a survey he had conducted among patients who underwent a technical resuscitation; that is, patients who, after being declared clinically dead, had come back to life. And to his surprise, he discovered one thing that has since been amply confirmed by the medical community: that there is a recurring pattern of post-mortem events in the descriptions of those patients. If you've heard about NDEs (Near Death Experiences) you'll know what I'm talking about: the feeling of well-being and happiness, seeing your own body from above, the appearance of loved ones, a kind of dark tunnel through which one advances at great speed in pursuit of a white light that shines at the end of it -an intense light that nevertheless does not blind and that transmits a sensation of peace and unspeakable love. By the time I finished reading the book, I felt still as bad as when I started it, but I did not want to take my own life anymore. I wanted to learn more about that strange experience called NDE, and I read other books that dealt with the same subject (Dr. Moody had published his book in 1975 and caused such a commotion among the medical class that many of his colleagues followed in his wake, so when I read his book there was already a lot of literature about NDE). All corroborated the study conducted by Dr. Moody. ""So there really is an Afterlife!"", I thought. And, well, for a desperate person, an Afterlife is the closest thing to a hope; so I abandoned my intention to take my life. I knew it would be a hard life; it would not be the happy life enjoyed by the people around me. Oh, but after this life, I expected another! And after all, I could use this life -even if it was a sad one- to do something positive, something that would be useful to others. And in my head, I began to plan for the future. After a week, I received news: the jury of that literary contest to which I had submitted many months ago, had chosen my work as the winner. And ... well, I do not extend more (the rest is already explained in other posts). I just want you to know that, whatever your decision, and even without knowing you personally, I feel for you a tremendous solidarity and empathy. Because you remind me of myself at an extremely difficult moment in my life. ",31May2018,3

17,"Recent diagnosis of Bipolar 1 after years of being treated for anxiety/depression. I don't usually go to the doctor when I'm manic/hypomanic (so much to do, can't waste time at a doctor, besides I'm FINE etc). This time around was different and I happened to be hypomanic/manic (not sure how to differentiate between the two),  bouncing in my seat and couldn't possibly sit still or focus, during my appointment. 

I still don't know how to identify certain states - I know depression because I binge eat, sleep all day and the world feels grey. I don't know how to identify anything else.

I *think* I was ""good"" hypo at the start of the week: I was walking 8 miles every day day, I deep-cleaned and organized my room, I was talking way too fast, I *really* interested in religion and bought every ""bible"" I could think of (Quran, Holy Bible, Satanic, Tipitaka etc).  I felt like my body was made of spring air and was a conduit for all the good energy in this world. It felt like I was filled with infinite energy, I didn't need to eat or sleep or rest. Everything felt fine, good, I was so happy. Almost like I imagine speed would feel like. 

I don't even know what to call the state I'm in right now. I'm still not sleeping. Instead of spring air it feels like I'm filled with an awful, dark energy. I'm getting blood-boiling, pen snapping in my hand rage at everything while also being horribly anxious and needing to pace.  I still can't focus at work, I have so many ideas and I feel like they're more important so I'm scraping by doing the absolute bare minimum while writing thousands of words in my new online journal (just started, made a new email and everything, fresh start). 

I'm still far too interested in religion and layering everything I write and paint with biblical references, names, certain scenes. I'm thinking about getting 666 tattoo'd on the back of my neck (I was born on the 6th). I don't know what to call this because it feels so right and I don't feel like I'm not normal right now. I feel like it all makes perfect sense. 

My partner told me they're worried about me. I'm starting to think that the psychiatrist has it all wrong and I can't possibly be Bipolar because I'm fine and I haven't ended up hospitalized so nothing could be wrong. 

Anyone have any tips for identifying moods? How do I start? I've got a mood journal; I started a new one and it's only been a week but I'm already 84 pages deep. I can start integrating new techniques for tracking etc. ",31May2018,4

20,"Hi everyone! I'm a science writer interested in putting together an article about the mental health benefits of being exposed to nature, especially in an age of increased urbanization. I hope this is an okay place to post this.

My personal experience with nature is one of overwhelming love and fascination. I grew up with moderate to severe ADHD and a certain degree of anxiety/depression; I hope to write about the ways that my exposure to nature over the years helped me with this. 

There's plenty of research supporting the positive health effects of nature, but not everyone has easy access to green space. Not everyone lives near a park or garden allotment, and with the rise in apartment living, plenty of people don't have yards or lawns. I'd like to explore the benefits of nature, as well as the alternative to outdoor green space: *indoor* green space \(as in, house plants.\)

If you're willing to share your personal connections and experiences with green spaces, I'd absolutely love to hear your perspectives. You can post a comment here, send me a personal message, or both \-\- just keep personal specifics limited to private messages, and of course, if you'd rather remain anonymous, please do! I'm especially curious about the following things; you can address any or all of them:

1. Do you live in a rural area, suburban area, or city? House or apartment? Any green space nearby? If you're comfortable giving me the city, or at least the country where you live, that would be amazing. If not, please don't feel obligated!
2. Do you feel that there is adequate green space where you live? For city dwellers, is there something you're aware of in the city's planning policies that prioritizes incorporating green spaces?
3. Most importantly, do you feel that nature and green space makes you happier? Do you feel that it affects your mental well\-being? Do you have any kind of personal connection to nature?

21,"I had a tentative diagnosis of Asperger's at one point, and official diagnoses of GAD and MDD, and Anhedonia if that's technically a diagnosis.

I have a therapist but I'm not sure she understands me very much. She often seems to be wanting to undermine the Asperger's diagnosis, but always backs off of it. She also seems to think I've been doing better, but honestly I feel worse. Sometimes I'm not sure she's really listening to me. Before I could get an answer for certain on the Asperger's thing, some years ago, I lost my insurance and my job and had to put it off. 

I don't know if Asperger's is the answer. Seems pretty spot on to me, but at this point, I'm so deeply depressed so frequently that it hardly matters. I can't even cry. Often I just feel empty of all feelings but self loathing, and I can't even feel sad about it. Suicidal ideation has been a life-long problem. I honestly believe that that's how I'll go, one day. It used to scare me that I'm comfortable with that idea.

What's even the point? I don't enjoy anything. Every hobby is just a temporary distraction. I often forget what order things happened in because the days just blend together. I've just about worn out all my social contacts because they can't help me, and I don't blame them because my problems aren't necessarily small.

I've recently been doing very well financially and I have very few concerns in that regard, a huge change from the last time I posted here, and it does nothing to comfort me. I am still just so tired of being. Every treatment feels hollow. Every question in therapy seems to rely on what I think would make me happy, but I don't even know what happy feels like. I have done many of the things my therapist suggests, that everyone suggests, my entire life. I try to combat my internal thoughts, I take long walks in nature, I get out of the house, I pursue hobbies, I make social plans, but ultimately I still feel nothing but depression and self loathing. This is no way to live. 

I'm lonely all the time, but I panic when it comes to reaching out, and when I do reach out, I have anxiety the entire time and then feel depressed when it's all done anyway. There's no winning. Every suggestion I've tried has amounted to nothing. Is anhedonia even worth surviving? I don't know anymore.",31May2018,8

I'm not exactly worried about my therapist giving them any information because that would be breaking HIPPAA and I know she wouldn't do that.

25," It's hard to  tell if the only thing you've known is or isn't normal. I know people can experience both under bad conditions.

I  work in an environment with bright lights and lots of little colorful  things. They play music at a decent volume which is hard to tune out  when I'm not into it. I have to focus on my movement in a cramped  workstation, and be both fast and dexterous. It's very boring and I'm  rarely ""engaged"" in what I'm doing. Administration tends to ban  'distracting' things until employee\-task engagement improves \(which has  never worked for anyone there I'm told\).

1\) Attention Deficit?

Often  I can't remember or follow basic instructions on tasks. I get a task  every 5\-15 minutes. For example, on a piece of paper I glance over  before starting, there are several different approaches and the one I  should take is stated on the sheet. Most days 95&amp;#37; are type A, 5&amp;#37; are  type B. It's the 5&amp;#37; that screw me up. I can look at the sheet, read it  says it's type B, acknowledge that it's type B... then proceed to do  type A until I happen to look at the sheet again which can often be when  I'm finishing up as Type A. I've pinpointed this to the ""doorway  effect"" when I get started after reading the sheet, EG grabbing a tool  or marking things right after acknowledging it's Type B... I switch into  auto\-pilot. I'll screw this up, get reprimanded, feed the office rumor  that I'm developmentally disabled, they'll get snarky about using  glitter pens and the like to highlight it on the paper, and I'll be 110&amp;#37;  vigilant about looking at the fucking paper every 10 fucking seconds  for a few days... then I'll start catching myself getting hit with the  ""doorway effect"" again and switch to type B before wasting too much  time... then it starts happening again where I'll nearly finish a task  the wrong way before realizing it.

I've  been doing that for... 7 months now? Everyone thinks I'm high or  ""special"". Some days are normal, some days fly by and I'll look at the  clock thinking 20 minutes have passed when it's been over an hour. I'm  chronically late, can rarely judge with any accuracy how long things  will take, have never managed to keep a consistent or efficient schedule  to get ready in the mornings, and need constant reminders to get around  to doing anything no matter how important or unimportant it is in terms  of how much I really should be worrying about it. Some days I'm  motivated to do everything and anything and other days I couldn't be  arsed to fold my laundry if my life depended on it, completely  independent of how well rested/fed/healthy I am. The only consistently  motivated time for me is sleep deprivation late at night when I don't  just feel motivated but I actually do the things.

2\) Sensory Overload?

I  might be hyperfocusing on things that don't matter while I work. Have  you ever intentionally been so focused on something you have no  short\-term memory of what you were seeing right in front of your face?  Or so short of mental willpower that focusing on one think blanked out  other senses? Like when you move your eyes your brain intentionally  blanks your vision \(this is a real thing\) until your eyes are stationary  again except when tracking a moving object. You don't see what's right  in front of you.

It's like my senses  sometimes selectively blank themselves. I can get flashes of that from  the music, especially if it's music I don't care for, distracting me  momentarily from what I'm doing such that there's a discontinuity in my  vision or peripheral hearing or motor coordination. I get flashes of  that shuffling myself around my station focusing on my movement and  placing my feet. I get flashes of that focusing on what I'm doing with  my hands not seeing everything else around me. Whatever snags the focus  of my senses becomes almost the entirety of my existential experience  for a moment, in the manner someone might experience while very high.",31May2018,1
26,"Okay, so I developed this habit when I was 12 and moved to Florida. I'm turning 20 in June so I've been doing this almost 8 years

TL;DR version: Not aloud to breath in while looking at things (or people) I do not like/hate/do not find aesthetically pleasing/have no opinion of it. But also not aloud to breath out while looking at things (or people) I love/find aesthetically pleasing..

Long version: I absolutely can not breath in air through my nose while looking at something I hate. It can be a person I hate, it can be an animal I hate, it can be literally anything I don't like. I also can not breath inward while looking at things that are just ugly, neutral looking, or I just don't care for or about. BUT I can't breath outward on things that I love or people that I love like my mother or my dog and my cats. I feel like absolute shit and like everything is horrible if I do breath out while looking at these things

Sometimes I'm okay if I breath out while looking at certain things I'd breath in on, like a painting I have in my room. But I absolutely can NEVER breath out looking at my dog. I have to violently breath in as I look at him, look away to breath out, then look at him again and breath in hard and ""meaningful"" again. Especially if I'm leaving the house, I make sure to breath in looking at him before I leave so I feel better

If I am in a situation where I find nothing aesthetically pleasing, I am aloud to breath in while I look at the sky or my arms/hands. Usually this happens while driving alone

If I breath in while I look at something I don't like or care for, I feel INCREDIBLY uncomfortable. I absolutely can't breath in looking at things I don't like

Also just because I love someone, doesn't mean I can breath in looking at them. I don't usually ever breath in while looking at humans except rarely my mother. And if I do find another human or a pet that isn't mine aesthetic, I can't breath in on them either because they're not mine



Sorry if this is super dumb or confusing, I've been to therapists about it, one didn't know wtf it was and another said it was a form of ocd. I'm thinking ocd or anxiety or a combination of the two but I wanted outside and honest opinions

Right now I'm on Atomoxetine, Lamotrigine, Venlafaxine, and Buspirone.

Lamotrigine has helped me a LOT. I tend to lean more depressive than manic, and it's honestly been a godsend at helping with my depressive states. Right now I'm in the midst of a mixed episode, but I'm doing okay. It's very hard for me to identify my feelings, which just leads to me being confused and just feeling ""unstable"" in general.

Busprione is doing hardly anything for my anxiety. Probably going to stop using it.

Atomoxetine has helped my focus somewhat \(not enough though, my ability to concentrate and focus is terrible\)

Venlafaxine \-\- It's helping a lot but I'm going to up my dose next time I visit the doctors.

Risperdone \(starting dose\) \+ Venlafaxine \(150mg\) \+ Lamotrigine \(200mg\)

With the addition of the Risperdone it's safe to say I'll be able to ditch the Buspirone. These 3 work pretty well in tandem to treat anxiety and depression, I'd say, along with everything else.

But, there's two things I'm worried about.

1. Risperdone effects serotonin, Venlafaxine effects serotonin \~\~ do I have to worry about seretonin syndrome?
2. I have very bad focus and concentration, but I'm worried about taking Straterra 

Check this out: [https://www.drugs.com/interactions\-check.php?drug\_list=1430\-0,2019\-0,2296\-0,](https://www.drugs.com/interactions-check.php?drug_list=1430-0,2019-0,2296-0,275-1683)[275\-1683](https://www.drugs.com/interactions-check.php?drug_list=1430-0,2019-0,2296-0,275-1683)

I think all these medicines would work beautifully to treat all my problems, but the heart rhythm shit really scares me, lol. That being said though, I don't think the Straterra is a good choice because I've seen a lot of people saying it really negatively effects people with mood disorders. It hasn't been an issue sofar \(not that I know of\), but I'd like to keep my options open just in case. Could anyone suggest a different ADHD med that could work with the Risperdone \+ Venlafaxine \+ Lamotrigine combo? I've thought about stimulants, but at the same time, so many dopamine reactions. So maybe I'm just stuck with Straterra? It hasn't really helped my ADHD to the level I need it to, though. The focus and concentration problems are major. Maybe adding the Risperdone will help that though. Let me know what you guys think! Sorry if this was a bit rambly lol, I just need someone else's opinion .",31May2018,2

30,"I feel so gone at this moment in my life. I’ve been severely depressed since 2015. It’s been a roller coaster of ups and downs since. I know for a fact I’ve changed since then. I lost a part of me. A piece of my soul that I’ve been trying to catch back. That’s only made the hole in it bigger. I can’t sleep which leads to me not being able wake up in the mornings. I chose dreaming over reality. I’m becoming obese. Practically every one of my relationships with friends and family is in a very fragile place. I’m just done with it. I’m 23 at the moment. Ive has this idea in the back of my head that I keep telling myself I’m not gonna live past 25. This dark thought haunts me and I believe it sometimes. I believe that I’ll take my life before I make it to 25 and it scares the hell out of me. I miss myself how I use to be. How I use to feel. My lovely mother who is amazing, has been pleading for me to go see a doctor for probably 16 months now. I always blow it off and kinda gesture like “fuck doctors, they don’t know shit”. I still feel this way but I think it’s time. I’m just scared of becoming a zombie addicted to prescription meds or some completely different person controlled by a substance. I hate the idea of thinking a doctor will just come in like a Jesus figure and just completely turn my life around and make me a better person. But at this point maybe I need some “professional ” help and guidance. Anybody who knows where I’m coming from and took the step our also feels like taking the step. I’d love to learn and become apart of a journey to a better life. ",31May2018,1

32,"My friends (21m) personality has *completely* changed over the course of about a year. He was a really light, happy guy, making jokes all the time and using funny voices. 

It's hard to even describe his behaviour now. Everytime he speaks now it's super pretentious ""spiritual"" shit. That's the best way to describe it. It's like psychedelic stoner talk about mother nature and other consciousnesses. It's never even remotely coherent. He's constantly using big words (often incorrectly) to try and sound smart. He sends me long rambling messages of actual gibberish, where I guess he's trying to sound smart? He started acting like this so suddenly I thought FOR MONTHS it was just a joke he was really committed to. 

He's basically devoid of emotion now. He's *always* stoic. I've asked him whether he's depressed and let him know he can always talk to me if he wants to, he declines.",31May2018,1

34,"Background: I am 19 years old and my mother is 41. I have a younger sister who is 10 and she lives with my mom. Five years ago my mom divorced my step dad and moved in with my biological dad to have a second chance at their relationship and to give my sister and I more stable lives. It ended up being very mentally abusive on both ends. They ended they're relationship, and my mom moved out with my sister. This happened 9 months ago. 

Current issue: my mom has a severe case of bipolar disorder, as well as ADD and paranoia due to things that occurred when she was with my father. She is in a nearly constant state of depression, she can't stop reliving the past, and she has started creating assumption of things my dad has done (ex. Cheated w/her best friend, gone through her phone records). She is also unwilling to trust me because she's gotten the idea I am in on it as well. She can't hold down a job, she's supposedly getting free therapy sessions every two weeks at a health clinic, and she may or may not be taking zoloft. Her current living situation isn't suitable for her and my sister, and I worry my sister isn't getting the care she needs. The rest of our family refuses to help, so I'm all they have. I just really need some help on what I can do to help her.",31May2018,1

37,"I'm a sophomore in college, and if I look at it objectively, the past two years have been shitty.    I started college in the fall of 2016, and was sexually assaulted and drugged at a party that October. I followed this up with a few months of binge partying, and got myself into a few bad situations, but nothing too significant. It took a few months, but I was doing okay until I was hospitalized for sepsis in May of 2017. You'd think life couldn't get worse, but then my father was diagnosed with cancer in September of 2017 and immediately started treatment. Fast-forward to now, and life is just kind of... whatever.    I don't know if I'm depressed. I know that I can't get out of bed until noon most days, and that I'm always tired. I know that I abuse drugs a bit to keep things more interesting (I'm in college, cut me some slack), and I know that I don't really have the motivation for anything anymore.    I don't know if I'm sad, but I'm not happy. Most of the time I just feel like I'm just going through the motions of things that I'm expected/obligated to do.

38,"My name is Anton, Hoang. I am from Vietnam.

I just finished episode 13 of season 2, Thirteen reasons why and I get emotional. That’s why I write this. Or there is more. The series may be controversial. But I see what they did there. They were trying to depict the reality as realistic as possible, that life is unfair and society is messed up. Yes, we are all messed up. For those who are not following the show, it is about what happened after the tragic suicide of a high school girl name Hannah Baker, and what happened before, and after. Its core object is suicide. But it circulates a much larger pool of social issues: mental illness, negligence, power and money, education, school life. The show left me stunt and stoned, because I can relate so well to any character. I deeply sympathise each of the kids. I deeply sympathise myself and all of us. So I wanted to write, to speak, to share, to act, to call out for help, to gather support in the story below. I name it “what matters in life”, I name my fundraising campaign “what matters in life”, because this philosophical question has been what I have been pursued for years. The following story is based 100&amp;#37; on the truth of my life and my quest for finding out what matters, its primary purpose is to share my thought and my love to all and secondary goal is to ask for your support in any way you could. 

What matters in life?

In my teenage years, I was a very reserved and shy boy. I had very few friends and I never hang out with them outside classes. But I was visionary and goal oriented. I had this feeling that I want to leave home and build my life for the better. I wanted to discover beyond my environment, go out to the world and make cool memories. I remembered telling everyone back then that my dream was to be a future CEO, because all I read each day was books about money and successful people. I aspired to be successful and rich and respected. I aspired to America. My American dream. 

I was born in a not so well off family. We had a small house and we had a sufficient life. I was grateful for that. We could afford to have good food and my parents work hard so I could go to a English center in the city to learn with foreign teachers. But that wasn’t enough. I knew I had to leave the country. We for sure couldn’t afford it. My mom told me to drop my dream because our financial capacity would never allow that to happen and the competition for scholarship may be too harsh for me. Others were saying that I was jealous of friends leaving for oversea education and that was just a phase. I left all of that aside and I believe there was a chance for me. I found out about a sponsorship program that could enable me to go. I fought really hard for it. I sat all the exams, got out of my comfort zone to engage social activities and all other achievements needed to reach closer to the future I planned. The condition of this program was that I have to work for my sponsor in return for a few years. Everything went perfectly as I planned. I went from this to that achievement to finally be granted that scholarship. That was one joyful and glorious year of life. I sat on laurels of compliments and respects for what I achieved. My dream came true. I did set my foot on the land of Australia. At 18, you are in a new world, everything is bright and future is of course promising. But dramas were just about to begin. 

Right in the first year, I was in a shortage of money because of some incidents. I had to eat instant noodles and left over food to save money. The financial crisis led to the homesickness and loneliness crisis. Sure this is normal for all international student. I managed to solve this by find a job at a fast food restaurant, eventually. Oh, because of having to work overnight a lot, I started to do a very bad job at uni and health issues rose up which made things worse. I had a housemate crisis and everything led to me leaving shared house for community housing and quitting job. Third year, I moved to a community college \(dormitory\) and fell in love really hard with this person. This is the most interesting part. I am a boy, sensitive one. And my crush is another boy. One thing led to another and we became best friends. I swear I devoted my life, betrayed my friends, abandon my studies, sacrifice my life to honour this young man, because that is what crush is about. Love at first sight was wild and crazy. Unfortunately, the boy could never reciprocate the feeling because he had a girlfriend. I found myself drowning in wishful thinking and self\-deceiving thoughts for a very long time. I cried for months behind the scene and acted happy in front of him. It was like that everyday until I decided that I needed to stop. And they say, the only way to end an unrequited love is to say it. So I did. I messaged him. After sorting out what I said, he blocked me. That was the day I broke down and cried to my dad. That was the beginning of my existential crisis I experienced for the next year. Sensitive and soft as I was, I cried every single day in my dark room. I listened to Sam Smith and James Bay to release my tears better. I didn’t know who I was. Only later than this did I finally admit that I am gay. Which is always difficult to speak out. My body went on strike. I vomited every morning I woke up. I couldn’t eat anything. I started to find it hard to breathe. I got nervous more often. And I regularly had to skip classes. In my last terms, I was totally messed up. I struggled with my identity, I did poor job in class, my health got worse, classmates were discriminating and competitive, friends graduated and left, food sucks, I had no job and I couldn’t work either. One thing escalated the other. I had no one to talk to. I was strong, though. I knew I could control the situation. I found a therapist and told her I could manage it well, because she wasn’t helpful. I never told my parents back at home because we far apart and I didn’t want to make them worried. The only people who trusted that I had problems were campus doctors who I paid regular visits to. The teachers didn’t fully trust me, and apart from education, they seemed to give no shit to my life or my issues. Friends in class were worse. It was such a competitive environment and no one ever act nice or look out for each other. I hated my classes, obsessively. The worse point was when I almost failed the course, which could have led to very bad consequences. But luckily with all the medical records I submitted, I passed. My passing results was on hold for nearly two months of anxiety and recklessness before it was finally approved. So I graduated and went home. Reverse culture shock made my symptoms worse. I got fainted often and went through a long stage of fatigue. Finally, I met a psychiatrist and was prescribed with Anxiety disorder and Major Depression. I started my treatment which was a year of medication. It worked well, only when I have those pills. Days I forgot to take them, I died. 

They say 20s are hard, harder for some than others. But hardship was a gift. Through tough time do you change very moment. It was a process of constant reflection, research and look out for solutions, for help there there was any, for courage, for identity. The hit my rock bottom seeing my life getting totally messed up. Every time I experienced a bad thing, I look up online for stories of those who are through the same thing, and my love, my compassion grew bigger while the ego faded a little bit. I deeply understand the pain of every single gay kid out there in the world, in their 20s, in their color skin, in their families, in their closet. I understand the pain of mental illnesses patients. I knew why people commit suicide. I was close to death so many times in my life. Sometimes it came naturally, an anxiety attack that made your heart break out, several seconds of breathing disability. Sometimes it is just manmade, like there was no reason left in the world to keep existing and there was just one solution, one way out of it. People always blame suicide for being stupid, thoughtless, childish and insane. As if we are there once, we will wish everyone could understand why we make that decision. Everyone around me, not single one, ever takes my mental problem serious. They say I am letting it defining myself, I am exaggerating it. The pills made my body store 10 kg extra of water and I look fat as a balloon. People started to fat shame me. May be they don’t mean to. But that’s stupid. I was fine, because I didn’t care. But someone else might have been affected and suffered from such negligence. And I know that not just me is messed up. All of us are messed up in different ways. I wonder why we show up every day happy, active, strong, selfish, cruel, weird, competitive just to hide our problems and our weak self. Don’t we all have pain? Why all the gays on grindr treat each other like toys? Do they all suffer though? Do straight people do so too? All the sexual abuse and harassment things? And that. I saw with my eyes this boss\-female subordinates thing when I was working this year. These touches, languagues. These nights in karaoke and massage facilities where family are betrayed. I learnt that this is not just happening in my country. It is everywhere. Isn’t it all of us are nice, kind and we want our kids to be too? Why do we behave this way? In my workplace I see corruption, bribery, discrimination, unfairness, inequality happening as they naturally are. Noone is speaking about it. Neither do I. I was too small. I kept feeling ashamed for not speaking up about my boss’s language towards my female colleagues, for touching her when he was drunk. I wish I could speak up so I could be treated fairly at work. I wish I could speak up and come out proudly to be treated as a loving human being. 

So I decided to make a change. I started my own projects because no one else was willing to support. I wrote stuffs on social media about life and mental illnesses and organize workshops about it. People reached out to me. Because there was nobody else to. In Vietnam we don’t have access to therapists and counsellors that easily. No body or agent are working on social issues and mental problems. What is popular? Classes that teach English, employment advantages, success, money, achievements. This society has no facility or venues for broken people. This society is chasing very fast towards its American dream. I left that dream behind long long ago.  It doesn’t matter. All that facades and shallow values. You know what matter? Constant state of peace and higher consciousness. Only sufferers at the bottom like us can understand this. What everyone should be following is how to live a good and better life. How to treat ourselves and others better. Because with lower consciousness, we harm and hurt people around us without knowing it, even ourselves. Look at the kids of yourself. How you want them to be, to become? Start doing it with yourself today. Don’t ask them to be honest and humble while you aren’t. 

I wish I had the power to change the world, to speak up and say the right things. I know my life destiny. I am the healer, of myself and of everyone else who cross my path. I am an empath, a good listener. I want kids to grow up strong and resilient and loving. I want schools to promote friendship and care and supports, not soulless morality lessons. I used to wish I could become a world famous speaker, to inspire more people and reach out to more. But may be that’s overwhelming. I am still struggling with my mental state. I am not stable. But I am ready, always ready, to help. I want to be there to back up for those who lost their ways, seeking help and understanding, finding light. Because I understand them well. I have this magical ability of a typical gay man: empathy. I am an artist, I want to use my art to teach the world about love and self\-compassion. I want to start locally. Because people have no resources here. I have friends from all around the world. I will travel around once I am ready and life let me. Making art, documents, writings about a better world. Speaking up the truth, the crime, the evil, the bad in a peaceful and indirect way. We don’t have to fight them with anger and violence. We can fight them with art and loving messages. 

But right now, I need your help. That’s why write this, and I will keep writing. This note is just the beginning. I am stuck in paying my university debt. I am stuck in an 8 hours job which is toxic. The environment I am working in is full of competition, negativity and corruption. This environemtn is a burden to my daily life and my health while I am still through my anxiety. I spent a lot of time crying at work, at home, smashing the table, the keyboard. I can no longer deal with this life. I asked for help. What people said was “try to adapt”. I can’t. Adapting means changing myself for the worse. I can’t either keep fighting for the good cos’ I am alone and neither can I become the bad. I don’t want to. The day I wrote this, I had a tattoo on my hand. Its an Alien. I felt alienated here. I am special I know it. I am kind and nice and proud of it. But I need to sort out the mess of my life. I need to change my life for the better to carry out my mission. Crowdfunding is an idea I read online and is the last resort I could rely on to help me, because my family can’t afford to return what they sponsored me for my education. If lucky, I could have enough donation to take a degree in psychology or sociology. I want to and need to quit this job, this duty to get back on my track, my life route: doing art and making changes. I know I don’t belong here and this is the only way I can get out: Returning the sponsorship of 200 grand.

If you are with me, if you think that you will enable another healer of the world, please support me by just buying my art on my campaign. The link below will let you buy a Tshirt that was designed by me and if you wish to support further, you can donate.

39,"I think when most people say they're starting over, they mean they're just going to be basically the same person they have always been but they are just changing their lifestyle somewhat. Maybe starting that diet/exercise program, getting a new job, or changing careers entirely... Maybe even moving to a new town or even a new country entirely.

But on my instance I mean it in the purest form of the idiom. After 10 years, countless sessions of electroconvulsive therapy and trying nearly every form of medication on the market. I have finally, after a year on these new (to me) medications, found a combination of medications that promote enough of a feeling of functionality and emotional stability that I consider acceptable to be able to begin moving forward. 

Now I get to explore this person I am. Who this is I have become and begin exploring my base desires as to who I want to become and to find my place in this world.

Now, at the age of 37, after spending 10 years suppressed and chained by debilitating major depression and anxiety, I have to figure out who I am all over again, and I can't wait to find out.",31May2018,3

Every relationship I've had has been trash. 
Starting from the person I love. I was like 15 and I did some shitty things to her. I dumped her the day of her 18th birthday for three weeks for another girl. I showed her private pictures to one of our mutual friend. 
Also the other girl. I stopped talking to her for months. I returned when I was in a difficult situation with the person I loved just because I was afraid of being alone, and I ended up leaving my girlfriend for her. 
After I dumped her because I realized what the hell I was doing, I started talking again to the person I love. I'm still talking to her, while I feel I'm not and I will not deserve her to be with me again. It's killing me. I don't feel good with myself. I didn't want to do all this. I didn't want to ruin my friendships and relationships like this. I can't go on, I just feel like I should just die. I feel like I should think about all I've done and cry my eyes out every day. I always end up hurting myself. I don't deserve to live. I try to apologize everyday to the person I love. I try not to talk to the other person because I'm afraid I might hurt her again. I don't want to live like this. I don't know how it feels to just be okay. I just cry everyday. I just feel like I'm hiding something everyday. I feel like I should just leave but I can't.

43,"I brought my dog out for a walk. Today, we walked around the neighborhood park beside my house. Between my house and the neighborhood park, there are roads, so I need to carry my dog Moo Moo across.

A long time ago, I have always thought about harming others in a violent way. The reason might be I had been bullied for twenty years and more. I would think about stabbing my mother and dog with a knife; push my mother and dog out of the window of our seventh floor flat so that they will fall and die; or beat up and abuse them until they die. I had talked to my counselor about this issue, but there isn't much help. I forcefully control my violent urges and carry my dog across the road to the neighborhood park. I told myself that I am not going to let my dog be hurt in any way. I will control my violent urges to harm others.

After the walk at the neighborhood park, I carried my dog across the road and back to my house. I want to strengthen my dog's muscles and heart so that it will live longer. I brought my dog out for a little walk again nearby my house. I am talking about the void decks below HDB (Housing &amp; Development Board) flats. I don't want my dog to over-exert itself so I finally brought her up to my house for her to rest after all the walking.

Back at our house, I was forced to put an Elizabethan collar on her because she likes to lick until her body parts become swollen and inflamed.

The other thing is I slept very late just now. In fact, I slept at the morning, not at the night. I didn't brush my teeth, remove my contact lenses and took my medications before sleeping. After the sleep, I took the medications and I felt drowsy. I told Vincent (my mental illness mentor) that I wasn't able to go to the activity organized by him because I can't drive to the place when I am drowsy. I can't take public transport due to social phobia. I need to drive my father's car.

I forced myself to go down from our HDB flat to run outside in the afternoons. I still remain drowsy, so I probably won't be able to attend Vincent's activity.

&gt; “Wait,” you might say. “I just said I’m perfectly happy in life. Why would I go to a therapist?” That question right there, however, shows a misunderstanding of what therapy is. Several people think that therapy is merely a response to a problem, something that only crazy people do. It might be true that that is the case, but there might also be less people that we would consider “crazy,” if therapy were more utilized.

Both in a call and in person. In person affects me more like I’d actually start sweating not because I’m cold. 
It’s been like this since childhood. 
Is this normal? Or is it not? Should I talk to my psychologist (which I skipped our session rip)

53,"I’ve had general anxiety my entire life. It’s always been something I can control with exercise or I just wait for the time to pass by and sit in my room alone.
I just went through two years of school which seemed to make my anxiety worse, however, I didn’t want to take medication and have symptoms alter my mind at all during my studies so I suffered through it. 
I graduated at the end of March and by the end of April I had to write my registration exam, which I failed by a few points. I know I knew the material, but days leading up to the exam I had panic attacks that I couldn’t control and my heart was often racing. 
I have to rewrite this exam in September and I’m just looking for advice: would you consider taking medication to help this? Im nervous to try anything because I was told it can sometimes be worse after taking medication and I really can’t afford to have more panic attacks or feel worse. This is truly affecting my life and my relationships and I’m just not sure if I can handle it on my own anymore.

54,"Just looking for advice on people who have had maybe something the same as my relationship at the moment we’ve been together 3 years , first 2 years was amazing and all of a sudden it’s been a year now since my boyfriend has shown very weird behaviours some of which have actually scared me , I will list some of the behaviours 

1- he says he never said things he did say some of them being very weird things about death and violence ( he changes voices when he comes out with these weird comments )

 2- I touched his face and he scratched my skin he stayed silent when he did it which freaked me out he then scratched the bed sheets in a upward motion which made me feel really uncomfortable he did t say anything whilst he did this or after wards . 

3- anytime I have a problem and I address it he will either ignore me or swear he can ignore me for days unless I want to make friends . 

4- when drunk he will say and act disgusting such as saying he hates me and to die

 5- he smiles at my face but behind my back he gives a look of utter contempt . 


6- he tells me its all my fault 


7- he doesn’t talk whatsoever 

8- he has told me before he doesn’t care about anyone ever but cares about me (I don’t believe this ) 

9- if I ask about his life child hood etc he will blow up and scream 

10 - our sex life has gone over the past year and he has said sex is not important in a relationship 

Many people would read this and think I’m weird for not showing him the door but I had 2 great years with him everyday is not like this most of the time he Loves cuddling , tells me he loves me more Than anything . I showed him a picture of himself 3 years ago and asked where that man was and he replied in a child like voice “ he is dead “ he also told me that he is two different people one nice and one nasty and the that is just his personality , I asked him if the person from the beginning could come Back his answer was no I have wondered a lot about a personality disorder and I also understand a lot of people would of given up I too feel to give up but there’s something about him I see like a wounded child who wants to be loved but can’t , he doesn’t talk to family and has told me he cannot communicate or carry on conversations with people  , he hates his mother the only thing I know is she was a alcoholic with bipolar and depression . 

If anyone’s has any insight there’s a lot more going on but I feel I’ve wrote enough for now 
Thank you ",31May2018,4
55,"Words used verbally can not be erased. Express yourself! If you have nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all.

Although I try very hard to think before I speak, what I’m trying to say often comes out wrong. Growing up, I suffered from mental illness and my parents didn’t understand it enough to help. My younger adult years were rocky. Today, I speak my mind and like myself, accept that others are different. 

Sometimes my statements offend others and I sincerely apologize because that is never my intentions. When I disagree with someone, I accept their opinions. To agree to disagree, and keep peace. I don’t bully or tease them. If I am offended, I have a private discussion with that individual at another time after I’ve considered their position for such a statement. Sorry if things don’t work out; my attention will be spent elsewhere. I will not be rude to that person. I have my own life to happily focus on.

Have we forgotten that we are unique individuals? We will never think, speak, dress, love, etc..we will never be the same.

61,"Hi everyone.  I'm a licensed therapist who is mental health/psychology blogger on the side.  I'm also an avid gamer and have been following twitch streams for some of my favorite games for some time.  


Recently twitch started allowing an IRL category where individuals can stream non-gaming content.  I thought that this may be a good way to engage with my audience on a more personal/direct level in order to continue providing education and a forum for discussion of mental health issues/psychology.  


Given that once I get it started and it'll be my first stream, I'd like to know what are some general topics that folks would be interested in learning about from a licensed a therapist.  


I'd like to stay more in the realm of general topics and stay away from personal ones so there is no confusion about this stream marketing itself as therapy or a replacement for therapy.  


I'd really appreciate any ideas!

62,"I know this is long for reddit, TLDR at end, and using a throwaway.

Lately I've been really struggling to be present and pay attention. It's happened over the past few years, but I can no longer read books or watch movies. I just can't focus long enough. I forget things all the time. If there is an object that I need to bring somewhere I will forget it. It's not just the occasional walking into a room and forgetting why you are there, I do that every day. If I need to remember to grab my camera, or some paperwork before leaving the house I will invariably forget it. a few days ago my gf asked me to change the laundry over when it's done washing, then she reminded me 3 times. I had forgot by the time she reminded me each time, I finally decided to set an alarm for myself in 15 minutes so I would do it.

As of recent, I basically cannot hold a conversation. I forget words all the time. Last night I was at a friends house and I would just trail off and do the whole ""umm, uh, what is that thing, oh yeah \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."" I actually was hoping I would give an example but quite frankly I cannot remember any. 

I live by a calendar for work, with reminders set all the time so I won't forget things. I can't pay attention at all, it takes me an hour to write an email. I'll end up staring at the screen or get distracted with a call or a text. I'm privileged to have a sales job where I work alone with a boss that mostly leaves me alone. This has not impeded my work enough to cause issue at work, but I feel strongly I've missed opportunities due it it, included losing the contact info for a client that would have netted me a couple grand.

Just some background/possible culprits: 

I'm in my mid\-twenties, live in New York State \(not NYC\), and a Caucasian male. I used to like academic hobbies like podcasts and books, but recently I've just been watching a lot of short videos online and on reddit b/c it's gotten nearly impossible to focus on longer format things. I have a science degree from a top school, this problem was either non\-existent or so mild it did not interfere with my life before.

My former therapist believed me to be an alcoholic, so I quit a year ago and have had no alcohol since \(other than a sip of things I want to try on rare occasion and smoking once b/c a friend got me a joint for Christmas\). I did try group therapy for 5 sessions \(felt like I didn't fit in/am ""functional"" for lack of a better term\) and tried AA for a handful of meetings, but also felt I didn't fit there. I figured hardcore treatment wasn't for me and decided to just not drink due to fear of substance induced depressive disorder being a reason why I can't focus/remember things.  I've since left talk therapy due to my feelings that traditional mental health treatment isn't what I want, poor insurance, and disagreements on diagnosis and treatment \(for instance I think the alcohol thing is wrong, but haven't picked it back up regardless, or he had me doing DBT when I think CBT made more sense\). I saw him for 2 years. I also saw a psychiatrist, but never liked her and couldn't discern any results from medications.

I also got in a motorcycle accident a year ago, but did not suffer a head injury. I requested a CT scan regardless which came back fine. I do not believe I have symptoms of PTSD. A few days after the accident I had a good cry/panic and confided in a friend that I could have died. But since then I've had no nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety attacks, etc.

My best hypothesis are the usual suspects for a 20\-something: persistent depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, ADD, or Bipolar II although I don't have good evidence for mania, other than some episodes of irritability.

I've recently tried:  reading/doing worksheets from Dr. Burns' ""feeling good"", guided meditation \(via 10&amp;#37; Happier\), diet adjustment \(no added sugar for 8 months, no alcohol for a year\), low stress art\-like coloring books, and church/prayer. I don't know if I had a diligence problem in not working any of those systems enough. 

I'm sure you all won't be chomping at the bit to diagnose me, or anything like that \(and if you are, you are probably not an authority\); however, I would greatly appreciate anyone who can help me find resources or give me advise I would appreciate it. I'm at my wits end here, this is really beginning to affect my life.

TL;DR: I'm a 20\-something that's been having trouble paying attention and remembering little things. It's gotten progressively worse over the past few years and is in the way of my life. I'm hoping for some recommendations.",31May2018,1
63,"I've never felt so alone.
So, I've (24F) been in a long distance relationship with my best friend (34M, let's call him J) for over two years. We've known each other for longer.
We've both had our struggles, my own involving moving out from my parents and him involving homelessness. He's had an incredibly painful and difficult past and it impresses me how hard he's fought to keep his head up, especially having no relationship with his father and his mother having passed away years ago. 
Well, he has this thing where when he makes a mistake and slips and falls, he'll stop talking to me out of shame. He just falls into a depression and stops going online.
I highly suspect he's bipolar (I myself am bipolar; I recognize the signs in him and his case seems to be more severe). Pretty much everyone else who knows him suspects the same. 

He hasn't been talking to me for nearly three months now, and from what I hear through a mutual acquaintance (she's a social worker and helps out people in bad situations), he'd lost his job and has been camping in a tent in the woods with some other people. She said he seemed down and depressed, and that he lost his phone so has no way of contacting anyone (I believe this) and that's why he's not been messaging me. 

This morning I received a message from another mutual friend (Let's call him M). M said he saw J looking for bottles to sell for coin, and that it seemed he had a girlfriend. I asked what made him think she was a girlfriend and he said ""Just the way he was acting around her and such... I could be wrong but if I am then it's a strange thing he's got going...lol""

Needless to say, I felt sick and heartbroken; I don't know what to think or do. 
The thing is, M has always sort of had kind of a loose affiliation with the truth, and has a way of chasing females (M ""stole"" one of J's ex girlfriends, and she ended up dumping M because he's also a bit creepy). He's seemed almost...flirtatious with me in the past. 

I don't know what to believe. I don't know if he's just trying to get me to lose J; it seemed odd how vague the message was. I also wouldn't doubt J found someone during this shitty time in his life and just isn't in his right mind. 

I'm assuming that for now, that J simply has a new girlfriend. He's told me in the past there would never be anyone else, that he is mine until the end of the world, that he would die for me and that I'm his best friend...but how far would someone take that when times are unimaginably rough? 

Well, just wanted to get this off my chest. J was my only friend and I feel sad and alone right now. I really hope he's happy, if this thing is real, and I hope she doesn't use him like others have used him in the past (he's a big softy with an enormous heart and falls in love terribly easily). 
This hurts. This really hurts. All I can think about is I hope his pain heals and his life becomes easier, and hope that whoever this girl is will be good for him, and how much I miss him.

Thank you for reading.

66,"Can someone with ADHD skim this and give some thoughts? Want to be sure I've got my arm\-chair diagnosis correct.

I'm working up to scheduling an appointment with an actual specialist for a diagnosis.

In the meantime: I'm supposed to be doing something important right now and am waiting for the caffeine to kick in so instead I got distracted researching that's possibly wrong with me and posting this.

I can't stick to a structured schedule to save my life \(or career\), an 8 hour work\-day drains my soul, and I have difficulty not being completely drained working just 30 hour weeks, being drained by structured work saps my ability to be structured and efficient in my freetime, there are things I \*want\* to do in my free time but instead waste it all bouncing between distractions that don't accomplish anything \(I don't even feel entertained or refreshed\), really forcing myself to do what I tell myself I should be doing takes extreme mental effort and drains my willpower, I can barely plan anything beyond the immediate moment, my task\-memory is constantly wiping itself blank while working such that I fuck up basic procedures because it just evaporates from my mind as I go resulting in me unintentionally skipping steps I just read and told myself I have to do merely seconds ago, conversation is difficult for me because I often can't listen for less than a minute before I catch myself wandering and completely forgetting what we were talking about, I myself can barely make a point in a conversation before my own tangential thoughts pull me away or I forget what point I was trying to communicate resulting in a rambling branching logic path that I'm lucky if it circles back around to close, and it's difficult for me to discern what people are tying to tell me because of the prior difficulties and getting distracted mid\-conversation with the myriad of possibilities of what they could be saying and often forgetting soon after anyway.

Some people have suggested ASD as well but there's a huge overlap with ADHD?

I do fine on reading expressions, tone, empathy, etc. I have problems with volume, masking the tone of my actual mood, and clear concise communication, and sometimes get a strong impulse to talk about something that's caught my attention which can impede my conversational skills by sapping willpower to ignore it. Anxiety in social situations for me is pretty bad. My hobbies and interests jump around a lot, I can do really well in them then often drop them only to cycle through them on an unintentional rotating schedule, but at no point do I have life\-long obsessions or am very interested in the ""data collection"" type hobbies usually associated with ASD. There may be some motor/coordination issues, disassociation by environmental stimulus, and some repetitive movements \(but they're not repeating continuously, just things I do more than others over the course of a day like cracking knuckles, stretching my neck, sighing, etc\).

I got this far before realizing and adding the 3rd line/paragraph. I should do the thing I need to be doing but I know I'm actually about to go get some food and watch a few videos instead despite the fact I've already eaten then check out the amazon package that was just dropped off when I know I don't have time for that and should wait to do that when I get back from work.

I’m messing up my sex life and he feels like he can’t confide in me. I’m way too sensitive. He used to drop everything to comfort me and run to my side. After 3 years of crying constantly, I wonder if he even cares anymore. 

My father blames me constantly for everything and yells at me and we work together so I have to take it. It’s like this every day honestly, and I’m reaching the end of my rope. At this point I’m constantly upset about SOMETHING. I cry and get so indecisive I can’t think. It almost comes off as unintentionally manipulative. I can’t stop myself from fighting with people lately and I never want to be alone either... 

The people I could once count on to support me seem to have given up hope even though they still love me, and nothing I do is helping. I feel totally hopeless.

72,"Super quick backstory: so 2012 mh hit me hard; hospitalised, misdiagnosed and mismedicated which only made me have insane manias and psychosis, took till 2014 to correctly diagnose me as bipolar. 2014\-2015 were good then became too manic, crashed into psychotic depression where I developed an obsessive thought which some psychs say is a delusion and others a weird OCD obsessive thought. Been dealing with mania, psychosis, depression episodes since 2012 and tons of anxiety related to this obsessive thought since 2015. Was detained and hospitalised multiple times in 2016\-2017. But it has been one year where I have been relatively crisis free and things are mellowing out a little it seems.

73,"I live in a house with about 4 other people and one of the people here, I'll call him K, never leaves his room. He spends a majority of his time on the internet, his latest obsession is VR Chat. If he ever leaves his room, he quotes terrible memes from /pol/ as if they were passages from the Bible. I wish he were just trolling, but he's had hour long lectures with other people about how Trump does some good things, leftist propaganda, Alex Jones has valid points, et cetera that's proven to me otherwise. 

I met K through his uncle, who I'm great friends with and also lives and pays all the bills here. Also living here is K's grandmother and M, a transgender activist. K throws around racist slurs, justifying it by saying that overuse will nullify the history and meaning behind the words. M and K have obviously gotten into plenty of arguments before M realized it was futile.

Anyone who has interected with him has wanted nothing to do with him. His mother and father left him with his maternal grandmother, who in turn left him with the paternal grandmother. Conversations he has with people end in arguments. He doesn't listen to people at all and has especially bad reactions to people asking him to stop talking or telling him he's wrong.

He's constantly trying to prove he knows more than others in subjects he has no experience with. He tried to tell me that antibiotics help with viral infections, but mentioned laryngitis, strep throat, and tonsillitis.

74,"Today marks 8 years since my father passed away.  His death is a complicated one, and I’ve got two different stories depending on who I’m speaking with.  With strangers and co-workers, it’s “He died due to complications of esophageal cancer.”  With friends, family, or other people I feel close to, I tell the whole story:

My dad was an alcoholic, one of those “high functioning” alcoholics that only drank at night and due to his alcohol tolerance, could put down a lot of drink without looking or feeling hungover the next morning.  He would often drink to the point of passing out, eventually trudging off to bed in a drunken stupor.  Rinse and repeat the next day.

He was diagnosed with Stage 3 esophageal cancer in March 2008 during the spring break of my junior year in college.  I took care of him that summer during his numerous radiation and chemo appointments as my brother left for boot camp with the Navy and my mom was working 40-50 hours a week.  He was pretty despondent the entire time, and it was difficult staying positive.  Of course, he continued drinking and smoking, and resumed these activities not long after he had his esophagus removed toward the end of the summer. 

I went back to school and finished my senior year, leaving several months after for graduate school. I partially left to get away from the dark cloud that was my father.

In March 2010, I received a call from my brother saying my mom found my dad in his bedroom (my parents had separated September 2009 after I left for grad school) with second degree burns to his arm after having fallen asleep drunk with a cigarette.  He had done a similar thing in 2005, dropping a cigarette on the floor that caused a fire to start; our home was significantly damaged to the point it had to be completely gutted. 

While in the hospital for his burns, he suffered a stroke which left some permanent damage.  He eventually caught an infection and became septic. 

I had stayed in New Jersey where I was completing my Master’s, too angry at my father to even speak with him.  Doctors determined his sepsis was irreversible, and I eventually received a phone call from my mom saying they were going to stop treatments and let him go.

I went home a few days later.  I didn’t want to go, but my then-boyfriend (now husband) said I should go, that it might help provide some closure.  Seeing him emaciated in bed, unable to recognize anyone around him or speak is an image I will never forget.

It took him over a week to die.  I wondered each day if we had made the right decision given how long it was taking for him to pass away.  I don’t doubt now that it was the only thing we could do given how damaged his entire body was, but I struggle sometimes wondering if he was in any pain and was cognizant of anything.

I post this because it’s been 8 years today.  Each year, I never know how I’m going to feel on the day.  Some years it’s easy; I think about it for a little bit and that’s that.  Other years, like this one, I struggle trying not to cry at work, feeling angry, guilty, sad, and frustrated for everything that happened.  Feeling like I wasted my time trying to keep him alive after his cancer diagnosis, angry that he didn’t see me graduate, get married, and have a baby, sad he didn’t feel the need to fight to stay around.

My husband doesn’t understand my feelings, and I don’t expect him to.  I know others have been through similar situations with their parents, and sometimes it’s nice to unload in a place where others may “get it.”  I have a lot of unresolved issues with his death and the events leading up to it, issues I often don’t know how to address.

Anyway, even if only 1 other individual reads this, thanks; I needed to get this out.",31May2018,1
75,"I don't want to get out of bed anymore. I don't enjoy anything, from trivial video games and food to my relationship and my newborn son. I don't like myself. I don't want to continue pushing through each day, pretending to be okay for those close to me. I could care less about talking to friends and family anymore, or at least what's  left of them. I have no health insurance, have a shit paying job, and can't even afford to see a doctor much less see someone repeatedly. Help lines are only a temporary fix, a short moment of relief until we hang up the phone and I'm left with a whole lot of nothing when it comes to feeling better... Or anything at all. Sometimes I feel like doing risky or ill-advised things that come off as spontaneous. No one understands what I'm going through. ""Just stop thinking like that"" ""just stop feeling like that"" ""why do you feel this way?"" ""If you feel this way something must be wrong"" . I don't know okay? I can't just tell myself to be okay.  I'm not here to get speculation on what's wrong with me. I already know. I've been hospitalized twice, have had SI issues for 14 years, and everyone around me knows what I've been through. But magically I'm ""okay"" now simply because I have had another breakdown and been found with my body slashed up or hanging from who knows what. No one really notices or tries to care unless I'm physically hurting. Anything less than that and it's something I should know how to fix on my own with absolutely no resources or guidance. If I can't I'm just ""seeking attention"". 
This has never been a phase. 
This has never been a cry for help. 
This has never been about a pity party. 
This has never been something made up in my head. 
This has never been taken seriously.
This has never been about me being selfish. 
This is about how awfully empty and careless I've become to feel inside again. 
This is about how sad and shocking it feels, to lose all feeling. 
This is about getting this out somewhere, someway. 
Even though I know anyone who may reach out or give support, as a random person online, will not help me or change anything, I just need to get this out of my system. It's not really helping. But everyone else I've turned to responds with ""I don't know how to help you"". 
I don't know how to help myself. 
It's fucked up, the only way I can get professional help at this point is to do something drastic. I don't want that. I don't want to relapse. I don't want to hurt myself. I don't want to feel so low and empty that I get to that place again. 

I don't want to be me anymore. I want to feel the love and contention with my life again. I want to feel something positive. I want my mind and heart to warrant any kind of emotional response to anything other than ""oh. Oh well"". 

I feel doomed. Sorry for wasting your time. ",31May2018,1
76,"So I've always been an introvert, and pretty content with that. I'm perfectly happy in my own company and got through university and the first few years of work just doing my own thing. When the need to be social for a specific purpose came up I could manage (I'm actually very good at public speaking and interviews, and can just about stumble through networking and the like), but it always felt like work, not something I'd choose to do in my spare time, and I've never been any good at casual chat/small talk.

However in the last year or so when similar situations have come along I've found myself getting irrationally angry during events that are meant to be rewards/fun. We had an away day at the races at work (paid, and during work hours)  and I spent the whole day going through the motions, but as the day went on I felt myself getting angrier and angrier at the fact I had to do this, to the point where on the bus back into town I had to claim to be travel sick to get people to stop speaking to me because if I had to speak I was going to snap at them when it's 100% not their fault. It was noticed because my boss pulled me up on it the next day and I spun the same lie about feeling ill, and if he didn't buy it he didn't say anything.

It's happened again today at after work drinks for someone's birthday. I sat there, chatting with colleagues I genuinely like, but again getting no enjoyment out of it and viewing it as necessary extension of work, but as I sat there on the edge of conversations I ended up getting stuck inside my own head, feeling myself getting angrier at the fact I had to do this in my own time, then getting angry at myself for getting wound up over something so irrelevant when in the grand scheme of things all this means is I get home an hour and a half later than normal. In the end I had to grab my bag, make a quick goodbye and just go, because again I was going to take out my own mental bullshit on people who do not deserve it and who are being perfectly friendly to me.

It's been happening more and more often and it messes me up for the rest of the day when it does to the point where I can't sleep. Hoping writing this out can help straighten out my head a bit and avoid that.  It's giving me the real fear because I'm good at my job but I feel like I'm fucking my career up because I'm becoming totally incapable of handling the casual networking/teambuilding I'd have been fine with even 2 or 3 years ago. Have also caught myself being shitty to family because of this too which just makes me feel worse. It's a dumb downward spiral and it takes me ages to snap myself out once caught in it.

77,"For the past 2\(ish\) years I have struggled with mainly severe anxiety, but partly depression. 2 months ago I got into a relationship with my current boyfriend and until about 3 weeks ago he was there to help me a lot with my mental state and did improve it dramatically. We had a deep talk 3 or so weeks ago and I admitted I wanted to fully say goodbye to my issues and aim to fix them, my goal was around 2 or 3 months to properly tie it up. He took it the wrong way and thought I was saying that my issues had ended and he opened up about how he had to change the way he said things to not hurt me and he would have looked at breaking up with me if it went on for another month or two.

As you can probably imagine, that absolutely destroyed me inside. Since then I have just been going around trying to be happy as anything and acting like nothing is there and it has honestly been so scary. For about 2 weeks after that happened, being forced into this changed mindset seemed to help and I thought I was getting better, until today when I fell massively. All those suicidal thoughts, the sadness and the extreme anxiousness came back and its shot me down so much. I'm stuck living a lie and im scared it will be the thing that will kill me. There are so many things I am starting to take in different ways and I can no longer explicitly ask my boyfriend what he has meant without it coming across suspicious.

If I'm honest with him I am genuinely so scared he will just leave me. You may think that means he isnt right for me or whatever, but the point is he already sacrificed a month and a bit for me, primarily because he loved me as he said. I just dont know I guess.

Some advice would be much appreciated on how I can approach the topic \- thank you all :\)",31May2018,1

Let's face it being in a bad shape mentally sucks. 

Life can start to feel hopeless and futile. 

Usually this goes away, but if you are building strong neural pathways to these patterns of negativity they become re\-enforcing loops. The worse you feel, the more you think about it, the worse you feel .... and so on.

To break out of this pattern of depression you have to shift your focus. As impossible as it seems you have to let positivity into your life again. Letting go of your victim identity will feel impossible yet I know that you can do it. In reality everybody can.

There are just aspect of ourselves that rather stay with a known sense of negativity than to step out into the unknown and change. 

Depression and most mental health issues are related to a false self image and identity.

I want you to challenge this superimposed negative reality and help you build new neurological pathways again.

Only positive and affirming action can. 

Be aware that only you can change your outlook and perspective on life. It is you sole responsibility to do so.

Helping you is my core desire as I know how shite it can be to feel down on life.

Let's move into a new paradigm together. I hope my words of inspiration and encouragement can help you to make big shifts in your life.",31May2018,0

85,"I am really having trouble identifying my “condition” if there is even a condition. To keep it short, I need total freedom to do something and if I need to stop halfway, I just don’t start doing it at all.
&lt;p&gt;
For example, I will not start watching a movie unless I know I won’t be interrupted. It just loses its magic and momentum. I will not start drinking unless I know I can get drunk af, so I see no point in meeting up with friends to have a drink or two. I will not start working on a certain task unless I know I will not be interrupted. If I get interrupted, I will not want to go back to the task afterwards. I will not start playing any video games unless I have 12-16 hours of completely free time to do so - with minimal eating, minimum number of bathroom trips, etc. I will not smoke pot unless I can get completely stoned. I see no point in listening to music unless it’s blasting very loud and very bass-y from good quality speakers; so loud that everything around me must vibrate. I will not go out and take pictures (street phography) unless I have an entire day to do so. When I walk, I walk at the fastest pace I can hold without getting fatigued easily; so no slow walks for me. I go from point A to point B as fast as possible. If I want to relax, I must be completely free of chores. So if I have to go shopping or do a couple of pretty simple chores (washing dishes, doing laundry, etc.) in the course of a day, I will not consider that to be a day of relaxation at all. Relaxation means Zero, nada, absolutely nothing that needs to be done, not even warming up food, or showering, or anything else. 
&lt;p&gt; 
Any ideas? Lately I keep denying meet ups with friends and all kinds of people, just because I don’t see the point in having one or two drinks with them, or smoking a joint and talking about stuff. I need to either get drunk and wild, or get so stoned that I am unable to speak. Everything I do, is like sex.
