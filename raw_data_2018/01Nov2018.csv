0,"My girlfriend (17F) recently had a mental breakdown at school. She is a straight A student who takes the most difficult subjects and also has a supportive family and friends. However, she absolutely hates herself if she doesn't get 100% on a task/test or if she isn't studying while at home. She is also hypersensitive.

She doesn't really have any hobbies but I think it might help to take her mind off of school. 

What can I do to help her?",01Nov2018,1
1,I’m just always so agitated that when anyone says anything to me I just feel annoyed by them. Even if I haven’t talked to a person in days I just get aggravated. I do have social anxiety and major depression. But I’ve just now started to get agitated with everything.,01Nov2018,1
2,"I recently discover the term maladaptive daydream and begin having worries if this is a problem to me. I usually daydream after classes when going back home in the bus while listening to some music or when bored waiting for something ( in line in a shop or in a doctor waiting room). The thing is i never though this was a problem or not normal, always thought i have a lot of imagination. Daydreaming doesnt affect my life in my opinion, i go to classes, had 3 serious girlfriends and dated a lot of girls, have a bunch of good friends ( i mean im really shy but i have a good group of friends), i box and go to the gym too, so it doesn’t seem to be affecting my life. The thing is when i looked online for maladaptive daydreaming o daydreaming in general people where really harsh on if its OK to loss yourself in your imagination. 

So is it really a problem??
I have to add that my daydreams are usually different esenarios where i save a baby from a fire or another random incident where people clap at me, sometimes i imagine i go back in time and solve some stupid mistake i made in the past,sometimes i create stories, movie like stories,  put in on pause or forget about it till i was bored in some situation and continue with the story, i remember everything from the story so it can go on for months but i never have the urge to keep it when at home or when more people, only when bored in situations where there is nothing best to do ( not a big fan of using my cellphone for escaping boredom in the situation previously mention, prefer daydream)

I dont know, what you guys think??
Ps: not an english speaker, i think i make a lot of mistakes but dont have the time to check them right now, so sorry :/ hope everything is understood.",01Nov2018,1
3,"My family and I discovered recently that my sister is depressed and suicidal and she's only middle school aged. She's going to see a psychologist to get evaluated soon and my family is planning on sending her to therapy which will likely include family sessions with her.

Now I'm 21 and I suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts myself. However, I have never been officially diagnosed nor have I ever gone to therapy. I don't know much about how family therapy sessions work, but I am 100% willing to support her through this. However, I'm curious to know if I will be psychologically evaluated as well? I've kept my depression hidden from my family for quite some time now and I intend to keep it that way. I really don't want my parents realizing that both of their kids are suicidal and right now I'm worried about her, not myself. I want her to get the help she needs.",01Nov2018,1
4,"As the title says has my life been a hell of a rollercoaster ride in my later years and please fir gods sake dont try to call social services on me. My parents have suffered enough as I believe. In 5 sentences am I gonna explain some of my most troubled parts and I will elaborate at each.

TL:DR
1. My parents have had their marriage on shaky grounds because of my dads gambling addiction and other things

2. My only rock at this time (My ex, 17, F) has left me after being at my side in 9 months.

3.I've been dabbling with drugs as a stupid young adults does and it has got me fucked up dozen of times.

4. As my parents have raised me as they did. So I have problem for trusting people to much and putting other before myself

5.I'm not sure but its a fine path for alcoholism for me as it seems now

6. I've seeked for help but cant say everything because of the consequences psychological effects will have on my parents

7.My whore of a ex just does everything worst by fucking up my mind even more

8.My friends have their own psychological problems and they barely listen to me.

*read the TL:DR before*

So my story starts with my dads gambling addiction where he gambled away shit tons of money where as we had to sell our house to barely go even for half the loans. After that my mother which had worked like a slave to be able to afford for a better life for herself and our family then she saw it all go in the drain because of my dads stupid loan (she was already at the brink of getting burned out so this pushed her down even more in the psychological trauma) so it was a really shitty year and then my first fuckup comes in the picture where I had the brightest idea of smoking at a party and then proceeding to drink 400ml of hard liquer(downed the jaeger in half hour) so I was getting completly shitfaced but the liquer hadnt hit me yet when I saw a friend(and a old flame) really drunk and she looked really ill and I thought that it would be a nice thing to do and help her get to that toilet (where I had in my mind that I would help her to the toilet so she could puke the shit she drank so she didnt puke at the middke of the floor and as the nice samaritan my parents taught me to be). When I helped her to the toilet she asked me to lock the door and as my stupid high ass that barely understood words did. And after I locked the door she asked me to take off my pants and high as kite me took my sweet good time of trying to analyze the words she just said but that didnt matter because she did it for me after I stood there like a question mark and barely made a sound of me. And she proceeded to give me fellatio and I felt it didnt feel right (she used her teeth and it didnt really hurt but it felt on my penis) so I said no in everything but she didnt stop so after a minute she asks me to lay down and in the minutes she did her thing the alcohol had started to kick in so I was even more wasted. Then she asks me to lay down and after some help of her and my wasted ass layed down and then she climbed on me like a goddanm horse and proceeded to do her thing and I layed there barely awake as she enjoyed herself but the alcohol seemed to affect her to in a while. So out of a sudden she started to bleed and screamed at the top of her lugns ""I had a miscarriage,"" over and over again so that fucked me up real good and I was high as kite but shit happens I guessed. I wrote with her the day after and asked her how she felt and if everything was okay with her and she was completely fine and she was even thinking about partying with me again. So after a month I started hear about rumors about people that knew about the fuck up started to get called for interrogation where as I was gonna be on trial for rape. That fucked me up hard because I was barely there myself as she did literally everything herself and I was basically a puppet. After the whole shitstorm of interrogations and my parents finding out about this ( and about a party that I threw at home) my parents trust in me died completely and my freedom of doing anything disappeared in months( it was about 5 months where I had nothing to do because I couldn't get out, no phone, no tv and no computer) so as I sat in my loneliness my psyche declined bad, really bad. But it started to look brighter after all the shit, I got back my social life and started to hang out with people(i had quit drugs completely after the whole police shit and I came out as innocent) and after some months(in the mids of being together it had come forward that my dad had continued to ganble and now my mom is on the verge of a mental collapse and I was ofcourse worried about my mother and it took a toll at my relationship) I was started seeing this girl(my now ex) and everything started to look bright but there were some mishaps that took a toll at our relationship where as our friends always fought and it got our relationship involved and it started to decline and increase as a rollercoaster. So fast forward to the beginning of last month, everything where everything seemed to be fine, I had my rock, I had friends and I thought I was past all this shit but fast forward to two weeks ago when on the Saturday me and my gf was at a party and everything was fine( forgot to mention that we breaked up after I was getting really frustrated(I was drunk) on my gf not even thinking about me in the end of a huge fight with our friends(everyone fighted not only me and the friends) ) so she slept at my place and the day after we had our morning routine and I was just really hungover as she was and I thought nothing about it until she acted cold out of nowhere and I asked her how she felt and if something has happened but she responded with nothing and proceeded to write goodnight as she normally did with the sweet little talk. The day after we met up with our other friends and I noticed something didnt feel right(she was kind of cold the whole day) and when I went home I got a text saying we need to talk. So in my desperation I wanted to reconcile and try to solve it but she didnt feel the same and just wanted to break up because she felt that she wanted to be alone and single as she had lost her feelings for me. I wanted to get this conversation in person so I could get a proper end but she didnt want to so a call had to be enough(felt that a face to face meeting was more respectable becuase 6months is a lot of time) and so I was broken completely. I was alone again with shit up to the roof and had to clean it all myself,  i tried to talk to her but she acted really immature by being really rude and didnt even acknowledge how I fellt left at the ledge without answers. So we have common friends so we are always at the same party's where she took a old flame and proceeded to make out with him even though he used her as one time sex toy when she expected a potential relationship(she started to develop feelings for him to but that was long before me) and that hit me but not that hard and I was drunk and tried to talk to her by only asking if we could talk while we both are sober and she then tried to sneak in a dark corner to cry but I noticed that and tried to comfort her but she then proceeded to be angry/really sad. I know her really well and reconized how she fought to keep the tears back. Fast forward to last week where I thought I was starting to get over her but apparently not because she made out (she did really long also) with one guy she had previously talked a lot of smack to me. And the worst part was how she did everything in her power to do it infront of me( It felt like I had come over her for the most part but that look shit had me totally fucked up). Had sober friends there that noticed how she took the guy and dragged him right next to my drunken ass and proceeded to make out with him hardcore and I noticed how she frequently looked at me and if I weren't wearing sunglasses we would have met looks all the time (I was so shitfaced drunk dont even know where to begin). So after that party finished I got the great idea of going to a after-party at my friends plce where I proceeded to take ecstasy and I was feeling so euphoric and I was having a wonderful night for once. I even tried to get this girl home to me. When the second party closed down I didnt feel like going home so wrote to my mom that I would sleep at a friends house but she didnt agree so she picked me up and of course then she saw my pupils bigger than my intellect so she wanted me to take a drug test but I weasled my way out of it. We were sober at a friends house and I noticed how much she looked at me and it makes me so frustrated because im trying to live my own life and she keeps dragging my back in to the illusion that we could be something again. I have to lie to myself and everyone around me that im over her and that I have no respect for her but im a sucker for pain if I would put it plain and simple. But the thing that disturbs me most is how my mental health is declining more and more for every day because of the mdma depression.

I’m suicidal and alone. I guess it was just easier to be alone then to have to face someone leaving.  I never consciously understood why I’ve always done this until recently when I took an online attachment style test. I’m not sure if there’s anyway to fix this. I know no other way of life but a lonely one and I want to die because of it. 
I remember when I was little once I was at a dirt bike track and I was clinging to my mothers leg and wouldn’t let until I was forced to. She had to go off and do something else. I don’t remember what. It’s things like this that bother me. Little memories that stick around. Currently I’m so empty that all I can think about is suicide.

10,"I just dont know if the way I'm feeling is normal or if it's really a concern. I feel like I might be over reacting about  everything since im in high school and everybody goes through this. I just feel like I have nobody to have a deep conversation with since I also might have sm(selective mutism), which basically means that I can't talk at all in most social situations. I can't talk with my friends and it gets pretty lonely. I've gone to therapy and am currently going to see a therapist but I'm not feeling better. One therapist said that i had sm but the one I have right now says that I dont??? Anyways this has caused me to feel a lot of isolation which I cant really communicate with my therapist. I also keep lying and saying that I'm fine and that I havent thought about hurting myself. I'm only a freshman and I'm already beginning to worry about doing something harmful to myself one day. I'm sorry that my mom has to have such a lazy daughter. The disappointing look on her face when I do bad in school really hurts me. But I feel so trapped in this repetitive life and I want a  way out. I honestly feel like others have it worse and that I shouldnt be complaining about silly problems. I guess the way I deal with all of this is by crying in the shower or at night. After I cry I feel happy for a while idk why. I dont want to hang out with my friends because I always fuck that up. They dont need me even though I feel like my life depends a lot on them. I'm sorry that they have to deal with me and that I'm just a burden. I'm thinking about ending our friendship. They'll find other friends who are better than me. My mom cant replace me though, shes sort of been forced to love me since I was born. I'm just so sorry to everyone and I just want to disappear from their lives. Thanks for reading :)",01Nov2018,1
11,"Hello! Im in need of help, for this is driving me crazy. In the last month i been having this picture in my head about beating people i talk with. For example, my girlfriend is 7 months pregnant, we are talking and all of a sudden, my head sees me hitting her, or beating her, and im scared. Not just my girlfriend, it happend with random people i talk to, all of sudden this picture comes to my mind. Sometimes its just me spitting them in the face. Im really anxious about this, for i fear it becomes true.

This thing started about a month ago more or less. I stoped smoking tabacco a month and a week ago, and at the same time is stopped smoking weed too, maybe it can be related?

Now I’m alone. And my mental health has never been worse. I haven’t been able to leave the house much. I’m having anxiety attacks before going into stores. I can’t sleep. I haven’t held a job for the last 3 months and I’m broke. 
I have no insurance to get help either. And nobody to talk to at least. 

I thought losing weight would really help me to be happier but it hasn’t at all. 70 lbs down and instead of becoming this healthier person I envisioned I have become a hermit even more. 

I understand why my mother is a drug addict and my father was an alcoholic. I wish I could numb the pain too. And I’m starting to worry that will become my future soon enough.

14,"I'm a 34 male, never had a girlfriend, don't have many friends and I sabotage myself all the time. Every time I get close to having a girlfriend I intentionally screw it up, and hate myself later for it. I'll do things like, don't message / call them back, ignore them, etc. I once had a girl tell me to ask her out on a date and I didn't. I hate that I do this. I recently got a new job that paid a lot more, I left it and went back to the old job that paid less. I really hated myself for doing this. I can't allow myself to have something good. I need to destroy it. I was bullied a lot in school.. and I mean very badly for years. I think it all comes from that. I've been in therapy and it didn't help.. went on meds.. didn't work. I really don't know what to do. I see all of my family members get married and have kids, and I'm still waiting for my first kiss... which would have happened a long time ago if I didn't sabotage myself so many times.

I need help. I really think if I don't change soon, my life will end by suicide one day. I went to a popular bar for the first time in a number of years and I really felt like I was starting to get old since the people in their 20's are starting to look young to me. I'm running out of time to date a younger girl (20's or 30's), and I'll miss out on that part of my life as well.

15,"I used to consider my Mom one of the closest people in my life. 

As someone who has been dealing with anxiety and depression, she was the person who I always confided in.

She would tell reassure me, tell me things were going to be okay, tell me I wasn't an awful person, etc. 

A few months ago, we got into an awful argument where she essentially ""took back"" the things she had always said to me. She said, that I don't suffer from anxiety, that I'm just spoiled. Also, that all the problems that I spoke to her about, were all my fault. 

Since this argument, we've been fighting none stop. There have been several times that she has told me that I should move back in my Dad. It's gotten the point where we can barely get through one day without arguing. 

I'm definitely holding onto a lot of unhealthy thoughts about what she said to me, and I can't seem to move on from it. 

Any advice?",01Nov2018,2
16,"Okay. So. I don't even know where to begin about my shit. Pretty much, I'm 22/f and in my senior year of college. I've had anxiety since my junior year of high school. It was just officially diagnosed this past February. Along with major depressive disorder. I pretty much wasted all of last semester because I was trying different meds every month to see what worked best for me. This led me to having, on average, 3-4 panic attacks every day, which inevitably caused me to get D's and F's in most of my classes (this coming from someone who has a constant GPA of around 3.6). I either didn't sleep at all, or slept too much. My psychiatrist was finally like ""go the fuck to therapy"" so I started consistently going to therapy after many failed attempts over the past few years. 

So, it's now November and though I am doing leaps and bounds better, something still feels off. Today, I found out that I might have cyclothymia (it's on the lower end of the bipolar spectrum). My cousin has serious bipolar disorder, and since it is genetic, it is super important that I tackle it now. 

Currently, I am taking Pristiq for the anxiety and depression, Hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety-inducing situations, and I just got prescribed Lamictal for the potential cyclothymia. 

I guess I just want to know if anyone can relate and if mental health improves after graduation from college, or any encouragement or whatever. Winter is coming, so my seasonal affective disorder is going to kick in soon; if I could kick it off with some positivity from some strangers, that'd be cool.",01Nov2018,1
17,"I ask this because of the unique situation I'm in.

I'm   not mentally up to par, and nobody here thinks of that optimistically.   There is no ""have hope maybe one day you will find friends or a  relationship"", the  circumstances set it in stone that I won't,  especially the population  decline here where everyone I once knew has  migrated away. Actually, my  plan A in life was to marry nobody and  adopt my children as a single  father as I have so little libido that I  wasn't initially interested in a  relationship. However, social services  here has been documented to be  rigged against the mentally disabled,  and I can provide the  documentation to the skeptical. There are a lot  of people with trust  issues with them, apparently enough according to  newspapers that it  affects child statistics. And even after looking for  one for a decade  now, I have no hobbies, either because nothing  matches the aspects I'm  interested in or because I am a tad emotionally  numb for hobbies, the  same numbness that makes me apathetic towards  luxuries like a house  bigger than a single room.

If  you want a  metaphor for working in this life, picture a guy who is  filling his car  with gas, but the ""car"" is a prop and he's just filling  up cardboard. My  parents always suggest getting SSI, they're the ones  pioneering the  idea. However, I've been denied thrice. I asked ""so what  do I work for  that parallels your desire to maintain your family"" and  the old jerk of a  guy said ""everyone finds something, why can't you"".

Even if it’s not, I’m in severe pain. I skip class because of these head pains all the time and I’ve seen like 3 neurologists and they don’t really give a damn. I want to go to the emergency room, but I know they’re gonna brush me off and say to see a specialist. Honestly, I know it sounds stupid, but these headaches are so bad I want to die when they happen. That’s not the biggest reason I’m suicidal, but it’s adding to my hopelessness.

I need hope or else I'm very depressed at best. Today I was fantasizing about cutting off my fingers (a lack of sleep probably didn't help). I don't know what to do.

The days are so lonely and all I have are the thoughts that haunt me about how much my life sucks and I suck. All of my friends have moved away. The only bright thing for me right now is gaming with friends and I feel like I’m kind of bumming them out. My father is older and kind of racist, my mom an addict. Alcoholic brother.

Throughout my years of school, I could always pin-point who were the ""best friends"" and once you said someone's name you could always associate it with someone else. Not for me. I never had and I don't have a best friend. Heck, I wouldn't even say I have any good friends. Just friends in general. Sometime's I  will go down my contact list when I'm sad and be like, ""who can I text?"" And the answer for pretty much everyone is ""nope...nope...nope."" And it makes me really sad, but it's like I can never make those connections with people and it makes me really sad. Because I can hold a conversation, but I can never make the connections to make best friends. Or at least people I feel comfortable to talk to when I'm sad. I always just think they don't want to be my friend or that they wouldn't want to deal/listen to my problems. Idk I'm sure I'm not the only one.

I have ADHD, and when you combine that with adderall it can result in thoughts racing. This means that I'm thinking and talking to myself in my head 24/7, even when I'm trying to go to sleep. It never stops. Anyway so now to relate it to my question. Sometimes when I'm having these thoughts at work or school or whatever other people sometimes laugh to my face, as if they heard it themselves. And sometimes they say specifically what I was thinking back to me in a mocking way. Like for example one day I was thinking about how much I like taking showers(random asf, ik), and this kid in my class that I don't talk to says to me out of nowhere, ""You like taking showers? hahaha."" Now you could chalk this up to mere coincidence, but it keeps occurring literally every single day (each time a different thought being made fun of) and it's killing me. Either people can hear my thoughts or I'm saying them out loud. It's driving me fucking crazy and I need to know  what's wrong with me.

I'm trying to understand what's happening with me, for some time now...I know I've been depressed before, after I injured my back and then was very unhappy with my tentative career choice.

Anyway my therapist told me depression medication is something to seriously consider--she doesn't want me to go all in at once, but just look into it, and will support me. All this to say, I want to look for some BOOKS YOU RECCOMMEND that can offer just different insights on anxiety and depression, like, low level stuff? Or any other thoughts? I can function, but I've always felt my general disposition was sad. I thought that everyone else was that way too? I want to be well, sometimes I'm content but I'm just achy and feel yucky.

30,"... any guesses as to what this is?

All down my father's side of the family. Not one individual is unaffected. It's HIGHLY inheritable.

Always gravitate towards: cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, weed, over any other drugs and never manage to kick any of them. Extremely poor life choices, piss-poor self-awareness, extremely selfish, every impulse-control issue possible, major anger control issues, no emotional intelligence whatsoever, zero self-care, no higher education with only one exception, and hate reading. Gambling addictions, losing jobs to DUI's and Theft, stealing from family (even dying family), fraud, fights, endless infidelity and chasing of other women/men, and even one genuine narcissistic sociopath who's now barred from all family funerals and won't stop trying to start shit over 40+ year old grudges.

My mother is from a family of alcoholics who seem HIGHLY functional in comparison. The people from my father's side  don't have the self-awareness, self-control, or long-term actions to correctly act on any good intentions they have. I don't think a single one of them matured past the age of 17 before dying of old age (and self-neglect). My father himself is useless outside his dayjob, relied on my mother to handle all ""adulting"".

I'm sitting here connecting dots, and the fact I'm the fourth-born male who's mother suffered malnutrition &amp; given genotoxic drugs during pregnancy... it seems more likely than not I probably have whatever problems are being inherited.

I've just managed to kick alcohol and nicotine. Weed is life now. Had ""temper"" issues and anger meltdowns growing up... still have some when something irritates me just wrong. My brother is ""OCPD"", can't handle daily normal workplace interactions, is in a fucking foul mood 24/7/365 his entire life, and normal daily-maintenance work is the bane of his existence. I can barely work 30 hours per week, 40 if you include ""adult functions""... and then I'm fried for the day.  My most common fuckup is just being on ""autopilot"" 24/7 even when I shouldn't be, and having zero urgency for important stuff. If you watched my day-to-day routine you'd think having, managing, and working toward life goals scares me. My biggest accomplishment is graduating college at all which is a massive drag because I can't actually do the IRL-job work. I've done shit like stiff myself out of a 1,500$ payday due to simply failing to keep up with daily-maintenance-level paperwork. My coworkers keep thinking I'm ""autistic"", but me &amp; my siblings were tested for that as children. I had friends, socialized, was mostly just ""weird"" growing up and now I'm just overwhelmed 24/7 but not ""sensory overload"" overwhelmed. It's ""shit I have-to/need-to do"" overwhelmed.

I'm reading that executive functioning is about as inheritable as eye-color. More inheritable than even IQ. I don't think the prior three levels of my father's family tree have the combined forebrain power of a single chimp, despite the fact one of them is a (disbarred for incompetence) lawyer.

31,"I'm having a huge identity crisis.

I have realized that I am heavily two faced, I have been for most of my life. 

I don't feel strong emotions. I want to feel.. i want to..

Recently I got into a relationship. I want to feel love for them but I feel incredibly empty.

Oh how I wish I could feel love. 

What can I do?",01Nov2018,1
32,"i'm 21 years old, female and I have extreme changes in mood/ outlook in life several times a day.

For example, (this happens \*every single day\*), i will wake up and i may or may not feel great - but I usually feel neutral just waking up nonchalant, not feeling amazing but not feeling depressed either. as the day goes on, I will often start feeling very depressed and that there's no point in any of this (life in general, working, friends, family, hobbies, enjoyment etc), and i will often spend time contemplating my existence and overall paranoia about why and how no one likes me (i take every thing very personal during these moments).

&amp;#x200B;

maybe a few minutes later, something ""good"" will happen to me, such as my dog being healthy (more on this later) and i will instantly perk up and start being so joyous and happy and start being productive about my business i want to create, and just being happy about life and think about going out and doing things. 

&amp;#x200B;

maybe an hour or so later, my dog will be sleeping and i will be afraid he is sick or dying and he won't wake up the same dog he was before he went to bed and i will start feeling depressed and anxious and i usually just lay down or sit and not do anything - i lack a lot of productivity and im very sensitive during this time and i just dwell on my life and see how nothing i do or want to do for my future is of any importance and how i want to give up completely.

&amp;#x200B;

then something will happen, like my mom or sister will want to go out or my dog wakes up and he's all happy and energetic and my whole mood will change to the complete opposite. 

&amp;#x200B;

and it repeats... over.. and over.. again. It's very exhausting, and it sounds unimportant to say this but if there's any chance this could be a sign of mental illness or if im just ""hormonal"" - i would like to get to the bottom of it.

&amp;#x200B;

the only thing keeping me from plunging deeper in a dark abyss, is that when I'm happy I have so much ambition, so many plans and things i want to do for my future and for my business (also really exciting to me), and so much excitement for my future. and when im neutral (neither happy or sad, like right now) i compare my high's and low's and i know that i do have some sort of ambition for my future, because i remember how i feel when im happy and i know that's something special to me, even if it disappears when im sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

so i dont want to let that ambition go... i used to be really depressed when i was 13-15, and wanted to try to attempt suicide. yes, you read that right... wanted to try. i was too scared to go through with it, so i took only 5 random rx pills i found in the cupboard, and i started to hallucinate and i ended up telling my parents (cause i was scared) and they took me to ER where i was monitored but my mom told me to tell the doctors (on the way to the ER) that i took the pills by accident, and i told my mom that it wasnt an accident that i wanted to. and she was very frustrated with me and told me if i told them the truth they would think im crazy. so i put on a very convincing act when i arrived and told the doctors i thought it was a different pill. after that, my parents never mentioned it again and refuse to acknowledge it of any type of suicidal act... since then, i would like to say that i got better on my own, and even wanted to go out and do normal teen stuff. however, that stopped once my parents started just getting mad at me for staying out ""late"" (10-11p on a weekend... and i was 16-17 at this point) and it started getting on me, so eventually i stopped going out completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've since dropped out of college (to pursue my passion which IMO was my personal decision that college would not help me build this skill), and i live with my parents. now the thing about my dog... he is 17 years old. my pride and joy, my true baby. growing up, i had a not so great home - my parents argued and my father was abusive. i remember calling 911, and having to hide around the corner of the hallway to make sure my mom wouldnt die and have the phone in hand (in case i needed to call 911 which i did a few times) and talk to strangers on online forums for advice, ages 8-12.  during these moments, my dog was always there for me. he would comfort me, and just be there for me to focus on and be useful during these times. now that he's much older, he's had a lot of near death experiences, his last one being a few weeks ago. i thought i was going to lose him. my only reason i couldn't kill myself when i was a teenager. he did fully recover and im taking care of him like i always do. but the fear and anxiety that he will get sick and suffer and/ or die which will happen eventually, is like an anchor preventing me from pursuing anything, and an anchor to my emotions. I love my dog more than anything, i wish i could sacrifice my whole being and health and comfort if it means he wouldn't suffer again. he's the only reason i never killed myself, and i dont know what i will do when he actually dies. 

&amp;#x200B;

i am not suicidal now, but i do have extreme mood changes from 'i am so excited for my future and my career' to 'none of this matters. there's no point to any of this. what i want to do is pointless and meaningless'

34,"Today..has been a rough day to say the least. My husbands depression has really been effecting him today, he punched a hole in our bathroom door (for no reason), and threw my can opener across the room. He's just looked angry all day, and it all started because he couldn't find his wallet. Even when he found it, it took hours before his mood got better. We were arguing over very small things today (taking a shower at the gym rather than at home, since hot water isn't working at home. I insisted boiling water and washing up at home, not fond of showering at the gym, he said I didn't respect him since I didnt want to go to the gym). He's been constantly throwing things and slamming doors. He was calm for a few hours today. We had a good time up until 30 minutes ago when he threw my can opener from where he was standing in front of the sink to the dining room. I have generalized anxiety disorder and ADHD, I literally can't relax, and haven't all day. He's sleeping on the couch, and I'm in the bedroom. I'm really hoping things are better tomorrow. :( ",01Nov2018,1
35,"Some context before I start:

I struggled with depression as a teen and was briefly medicated with antidepressants - they made me worse, so they were discontinued. However, I was also ""tested"" for some other things at the behest of my parents being that I struggled in school quite a bit. I was diagnosed with ADD and put on Ritalin 60mg. Nothing changed. A few years later, at age 18, I switched to a new doctor with some complaints: the Ritalin made me too jittery, etc. and I was struggling with anxiety and insomnia. I was put on a relatively low dose of Adderall (10mg) to replace the Ritalin and some ambien (1mg) to be used as needed (1 every 3 days was the official recommendation on the bottle). I used the two latter medications for 6 years with little issue. My life improved a lot during that time - despite my struggles in high school, I thrived in community college and then moved on to a four year university, something I would have never thought possible before. I was in the best shape of my life and generally looked forward to the day.

Now for the issue: 

Two years ago the office I was at closed. The Doctor I had been seeing moved his practice to a different state. I was put in contact with another group to continue my medications, but I was in the process of moving at the time and figured I would just find someone closer to my new place. The move ended up being super stressful, things with my new job fell through, and I had a lot of other stuff on my mind. On top of that, I've always kind of disliked myself for being medicated - ""why can't I function without it like a normal person?"" etc. so I just kind of let it go. After a few months I settled into a new job, things were going well, and I found the time to see a new doctor. During the intake appointment she basically told me there was no way those drugs had been prescribed to me and all but accused me of being a drug dealer. I was really taken aback and honestly incredibly put off by this, and so I left and never returned. Fast forward another year to present day, I've been struggling incredibly over the past year at work and in my daily life. I find it incredibly hard to sleep and wake up, I'm constantly tired throughout the day, and I can't focus on -anything-, even my hobbies. My performance reviews have gone into the toilet, and the only thing that's saved me from being fired is the fact that I opened up to my boss about my current issues and insisted that I was going to find some help to remedy the situation. 

So, my questions:

1. Is low dose adderall and ambien that strange of a combination? 
2. Is there any way for me to get my old medications back without having to jump through some serious hoops?
3. Would it be legal for me to seek out each drug (or something similar) separately from two different doctors? Would I have to tell them I'm seeing other doctors / taking something other then what they prescribed? 

Before you mention it, I just want to say that I know medication isn't always the answer. I've been in therapy for the past 3 months and earlier today the fellow I've been seeing all but told me he has no idea how to help me and that I should see a psychiatrist. I also know that environment / life circumstances can play a big part in what I'm describing, but I assure you that I enjoy the field I'm working in, have a full social life, and a very loving and supportive girlfriend. I wouldn't be asking these questions if I hadn't thought there was another way to get back on track. 

P.S. If any of you are in similar situations medication wise, what do you take to manage your attention issues / anxiety problems? How did you arrive at that treatment with your doctor? Any and all tips are welcome, I just didn't want to come off as a junkie like I evidently did to the last person I saw. ",01Nov2018,1
36,"Ok. In the years since I really started spiraling I’ve tried to get help probably a half dozen or more ways. I’ve been summarily dismissed repeatedly. 
I wonder if because I’m a female with a very flat affect they don’t take me seriously for being too composed in person? I don’t know. I’ve gone to great lengths to master my ‘normal person’ behaviors and expression. So much so that I can’t willingly turn them off even though they rarely have anything to do with what’s going on in my head. I don’t really care anymore.
Just getting the first appointment took me months of panicking and hanging up the phone. I must have driven to the place and sat bawling in the parking lot three times before I worked up the nerve to get that appointment time. Only to get looked at like I was wasting his time and sent away with the advice to buy a planner.
I don’t want to lose my job over someone misdiagnosing me or be just handed some prescriptions for some generic problem and forgotten about. 
After all the other places (chaplains, online services etc etc)  I’ve been recommended have ended up much the same with no real help and a very dismissive attitude, I just don’t think I have the energy to try anymore.
It’s at the point just trying to go to government buildings for any reason is starting to cause panic attacks because I ~know~ at best I’m going to get treated like I don’t matter. And at worst they’ll actually make my already falling apart situation even harder. Because for three years that’s what’s happened over and over again. Asking for help gets me nothing, or it gets me harm. 

 I don’t have another source of support. Not emotional, financial or any other. What I do have is an S.O. who leans on Me for all of that and continuously taxes my already gone resources. 
I don’t have enough (of anything) left now to get out or change things. I don’t think I have the will left to try if I knew how. 

Clearly I’m doing something wrong or something is so wrong with me that I can’t even effectively communicate a simple need for help anyway so... 

I guess the question is, did I miss something? Some option somewhere? I feel like I’ve tried every hotline and mental health place that will take me without luck. I don’t have money. I don’t have insurance. I don’t have anyone in my life but an S.O. who provides no tangible support aside from a warm body and occasional impersonal conversation. 
I’m more lonely than I’ve ever been but this has been socially about how my life has always gone despite my best efforts to fit in and self improve. 

I haven’t felt anything at all in months. 

Can I give up yet?

(I could guess at all the things that might be wrong with me but I have only guesses and the pretty strong understanding that wishing for death on the daily is suboptimal. Apparently nothing a shiny new day planner can’t fix. Although it hasn’t seemed to yet. Maybe day 730 is the magic day.)

TLDR: Mental health professionals don’t seem to think I need help or don’t care since I don’t have insurance. So, does this mean I’m sound enough to decide my life’s never getting better and I can opt out now?",01Nov2018,1

39,"It is constant and the same memories over and over. I can't stop thinking about my life two years ago, and I'm not sure why. Actually, that is a lie, and I know why It was the worst and best year of my life thus far. I was working 45-50 hours a week, running 45-50 miles a week, taking ten credits, partying constantly, and traveling to places like Hawaii and shit. I was also unmedicated for bipolar disorder and having mental breakdowns a least once a month where I would draft a suicide note. It wasn't good enough though, and I have goals to accomplish, so that's why I'm here. I had friends that I didn't want, I mean they were good... just not for me. It's frustrating when I realize people are human and they make mistakes, I can't handle that. I can't handle that I am also human and make mistakes, it makes me want to die, so of course, I hate it when I see it in others. I don't want to try in school because if I do and don't get an A then what? So I don't try and get a C/B and say, 'oh well, its because I didn't study.' SO LAME, just study!!! I was talking to a guy whom I liked, but I couldn't make a move. I only liked him when I wasn't with him, and I don't know why that is. I have issues apparently, wild. I am so tired all of the time; my apartment is so fucking gross because I don't have the energy to clean anything. There are clothes on the floor and dishes in the sink and don't even get me started on my bathroom situation. I think I did something wrong a year ago. I was talking to my cousin whom I had just met, and we were both drunk playing a card game that I had just made up (and won, of course), and I was inquiring about the drug status of our family. I mentioned that I smoked pot in an effort to make him feel more comfortable about disclosing information to me. I have been told I look innocent; my interpretation is that I look like my idea of a good time is eating saltine crackers in a bare, white room. Anyway, it worked, and he told me that he has a pill addiction and that I am the only person he has told aside from a friend of his. I gave him the best advice I could because A. I was drunk and B. hypo, and told him my brother is a heroin addict. He said that 'I will always be the girl he stayed up until 3 am with' and something else that I'm forgetting. I somehow got his number and told him to keep in touch and radio silence since; I found out from his mom that he relapsed shortly after. For some reason, I feel guilty for this because I said that, 'It's okay if you relapse because that's a part of becoming sober,' which is true. So, why do I feel guilty? His relapse wasn't my fault, but at the same time, I felt like I was glamorizing drugs... even though I wasn't. I wish I could go back in time, but not really because I'm in a relatively solid place at the moment, aside from grades being iffy and my apartment being a mess and my on and off depression, more off than on, to be fair. No mental breakdowns though! I am where I worked for years to be, I mean I am living what I dreamed of when I established this goal when I was 16ish. It is like that meme of the guy who is depressed in Egypt; I am depressed in Egypt. I have what people would kill for, and I am throwing it away and shitting on it. WHY!? My current goal is graduate school to attain my doctorate in psychology, but do I want that? Because my effort isn't reflecting it. SO, what do I want? I want money. I want money, not for materialist purposes, but I want freedom and money grants that. I want for little, just freedom which I guess isn't that little is it? I want to find people who I can be myself around, people that get me. I think I may be asexual. I have never gotten my peers hormonal and primal urge to fuck someone. I think people are hot and have a type that I see and think, 'damn, nice.' However, beyond that, I am repulsed. I can think about sex and get turned on, but when it comes to the physical aspect, it makes me want to vomit. Not sure, and not willing to dig too deep on this one. I also spent 1,000 dollars this month, not sure how the fuck that happened. I canceled my therapy appointment for today because I have been oddly nauseous and not hungry, which is unheard of for me. I gained five pounds since my move. YIKES. The bulimia has made a slight return. I am a mess, but then again who isn't? People are weird, man.

Between the age of let's say 5 to 13, I would have these episodes were all the muscles in my body would freeze as if it was extremely painful to move them out of their current place. My vision would then glaze over and I would see and hear static with big numbers that would count down faster and faster. 

This was extremely unsettling for a little girl and I would always feel this gut-wrenching feeling and often cry after not knowing why I was so sad. 

I used to have these regularly on a weekly basis then as I grew up it was once a month until they stopped altogether.

Making simple choices like where I wanna go eat are now just ""Which is in less if the way if people."" My mind set now has gone from ""Do my best"" to ""Do my best to not get in the way of people.""

I don't really go out often, I am not involved with the community, I'm sorta out of shape, and I am not that talented at anything.

44,"A bit of background first. Mental health issues have been a thing for me for basically ever. I'm 27, had my first run-in with suicidal ideation at 12. I'm transgender, I have major depressive disorder with psychotic features, severe body dysmorphic disorder, and while I'm undiagnosed, my therapist and I both think I have inattentive ADHD. I also have PTSD from multiple times being raped.

A couple of months ago I quit my job. Earlier this year I broke down, which led to me taking a month of leave. I went back to work, lasted a week before checking myself into the hospital after a few nights of self harming again. I joined a partial hospitilization program, which I oddly did very well in. 

After the program's end, I went back to work. Again I had a breakdown. All the progress I thought I'd made at my PHP slipped away. I heavily debated between suicide and going back to the hospital, but ended up just quitting.

That brings me to where I am now. I have no job, I'm back at my mom's place, I lost my insurance, my savings are dripping away. I can't afford my meds so I weaned myself off of my effexor as best I could with what I had left, so I'm unmedicated as of this week. 

I know what I want. I want to lose weight, about 80lbs; I believe my weight issues are the biggest source of dysmorphia, dysphoria, etc and I have to finally fix it. 

I want to physically be in shape. After two awful blood clots 5 years ago, I let my weight and fitness slip. I'm at the point where just being awake is painful and exhausting.

I need a job I can handle, and I'm no longer sure what that looks like. I have a computer engineering degree, but I can't program like I used to. If I push myself hard I can manage around an hour of focused and productive work time. Anything past that, I fall apart.

I want to move out west. I want access to better legal protections for trans people and a more progressive culture. Legal weed would be nice as well, lol.

However, accomplishing these tasks feels almost Herculean. My dysmorphia gives me a lot of issued when it comes to working out, especially around others. I can't handle swimming at all which used to be my favorite form of exercise. My gf doesn't hold me accountable or push me to improve, and I have no friends around anymore. Submitting job applications ruinsmy mood so much too. I get no positive emotions from getting through an application, instead it makes me suicidal and gives me the urge to selfharm.

Any advice for getting out of this rut? I feel like I have  no help, or at least not the right kind. I'm desperate at this point... in even devating getting uppers off the street to help, but I'm not sure they would be safe with my blood issues.

Was studying math and physics, with a plan to get my masters and PhD in theoretical physics with the ultimate goal being professorship, I absolutely love teaching. I say would be and was, because I was forced into taking a pause this semester because for whatever reason my normal ocd bumped up to 11 over the summer and it’s basically impossible for me to leave the house.

I’ve spent the last 2 months sleeping in the bathroom and browsing the internet/playing games because my anxiety causes me to rapidly grow nauseous whenever I fixate on something and can cause violent vomiting. I carry a bucket around with me around the house, although I rarely use it because most of the time its just gagging/dry heaving. If I have to vomit I can usually tell beforehand and make it to a toilet. Going out for psyciatrist appointments is awful. I bring my bucket and a box of small garbage bags. Sometimes I dont need to use them, sometimes I use many. The surprise of how bad the anxiety will be is great. I have been prescribed klonopin to help with travel and the days where the anxiety is especially bad and it helps. I’ve been testing different medications with my psychiatrist trying to find a solution to this so I can get back to college best semester but it isn’t looking optimistic. I just wake up, take my meds, and browse the internet or play games or talk to friends on discord all day, then go back to sleep in the bathroom, and I hate it, but it’s all I can do right now.

47,"Hi. I have a question about myself and it’ll be pretty hard to explain but I’m just looking for some answers and whether I should get certain help or not. There seems to be a lot of things wrong with me. I’m going to list my medical diagnosis’ in case it has something to do it it. PTSD, anxiety, depression, and possibly bipolar I’m waiting until I’m 18 for the diagnosis but my therapist said I may have it. I do this thing where I’m really really inspired to do something like making a song, doing art, writing, playing a certain video game, or makeup and then when I go to do the thing I lose all self esteem about it and just drop it instantly. I just suddenly don’t want to do it even though I have tons of ideas. I can’t seem to get the ideas out or something. I get depressed about it too. For example I’ll go and draw maybe draw one line or get all my supplies out and then I’ll just stop wanting to do it. I’m an extremely insecure person and I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. I truly think everything I do is bad compared to someone else or just bad in general. I can’t figure out why this is happening. It always wasn’t like this. If I wanted to do something I’d just do it. I also verbally have a hard time telling anyone what’s wrong. I physically can’t say it. I don’t know why my mind is making me unable to physically do anything. It feels like I’m slowing shutting down. ",01Nov2018,1

I miss my little brother because we never had enough time spending together, I was always too busy doing other things, I regret it.  I miss my girlfriend because she is the person I want to go and cry to, I feel so warm, calm and peaceful in her hug, she is the person that I know she will always be there for me (except my family ofcourse).

51,"Greetings from the UK
This post is designed to be a process for those that struggle with dealing with negative thoughts, it’s something that I’ve been using and know works personally. **note this may not work for you but it may be worth giving a go if you have no other method**
To begin I’ll give a little background; I’ve been suffering with depression for a few years and suicidal thoughts for the past 7-8 months; and I have been fortunate enough to receive therapy for this.
A big thing I suffer from is overthinking and intrusive thoughts, and to remove this I follow this process.

A thing that people forget when working towards a goal is the process, being so hellbent on the goal they forget the method they use to reach it. In this case the goal is being in a positive mental state due to a negative thought or feeling that is manifesting. Liken it to dieting, so many people say “I want to lose weight” and just straight up resort to eating less. In doing so they will not see the progress they want and lose sight of their goal as a result of no process.

Process.

**Step 1.** Openness with myself, being honest with myself about the way I am feeling
**Step 2.** Allow my mind to vent itself, get itself of its chest if you get me
**Step 3.** Pick out something that stands out from that internal vent, focus on it and work with it
**Step 4.** Clear up the unnecessary information to reveal the true reason as to why I’m not feeling okay
**Step 5.** Rationalise with myself, come to a compromise in which my conscious mind can satisfy my subconscious mind and vice versa. This is the difficult part, you have to change the negative into a positive, reword and rephrase the thought in a way that changes the nature of the sentence. I will try to give an example afterwards.
**Step 6.** Realise that the process may not always work but over time it will become a second nature and may help in the extreme Long term.

To help understand this and apply this, try to apply it to a process that you know and follow, for me I liken it to a simultaneous equation. You focus on it, then you can let yourself argue with how to approach it. Find a value you know how to work out. Make that the subject of the equation. Add values that make it work. And that’s how I see the process, and over time I would be able to do this “simultaneous equation” without thinking about it.

**Changing a negative into a positive**
This part can be difficult, so don’t be afraid to take your time. Let’s look at something simple: work. If you don’t enjoy work and get upset about work try focus on an aspect of the work you enjoy. For me I don’t want to go to work but I have friends at work and I look forward to seeing them, making work enjoyable. Easy as that. But like I said it may be difficult to find the reciprocal positive but when you get it, use it.

This process isn’t something I found overnight, I’ve been applying it subconsciously for a while now, and yesterday it became obvious to me that this is what I do to help myself.

If you have any suggestions or thoughts on the process let me know.

Afterword.
I understand that it may seem offensive to say that if you follow this it will work, and I’m not at all, this is a matter of trial and error, you may need to adapt the process yourself to suit your needs. If that’s the case try to use this as a template.

53,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Anyway my mum is known to drink almost every night (4-5 glasses of wine, dunno if that’s a lot or not). Some rare nights she doesn’t which are the good ones.

We often get into fights when she’s had a few glasses since I have a very short fuse and she genuinely says some really stupid shit. I’m not just trying to say that to justify things.

Tonight was one of the nights that she’s had a few glasses. She was screaming from the kitchen and I had my earphones in at full volume and I could still hear her.

I went out and asked if she was yelling at me, she said she was taking to herself so I asked if she could quiet down a bit since there was no need to yell. She then goes on this whole rant about how ‘she’s the adult’ and ‘I don’t get to tell her what to do’.  About how we aren’t equal and she’s the adult so she makes the rules.

Afterwards I  with ‘you know what you should do, stop yelling.’ I admit I probably shouldn’t have said that. She then goes “you know what you should do eat more! Tomorrow youre eating pancakes” in a threatening tone.

She always brings this up in an argument even when it’s non related.

It doesn’t seem like that big of a deal and maybe she’s right but to me it feels like she’s trying to use this against me? As a kind of way to make me feel bad if that makes sense. Like it’ll always be in a argument to try and get back at me. I wouldn’t have a problem if she didn’t say it like that and if we talked about it when we weren’t fighting ya know. maybe I’m wrong

64,"Everytime I am asked who I am...I cant help but to NOT know who am I. Weird right? Well I'll go ahead and explain. If I dont feel 110% whole in terms of who ik confident i am, I start to lose my grasp on reality, to the point of questioning my goals. So I want to start slow in terms of what I DO know.

I am seen as arrogant and constantly head in the clouds, usually am wanting things to go perfectly, and always plan things out. For some reason one moment I will feel like I'm constantly lacking empathy towards others, because logically its detrimental to what I stand for. I dont care for others on an emotional level, I cant recall a time where I have. The only times I ever cried was when I lost someone important to me. Besides that, I tend to feel that people are worthless. 

My goals in life are always shifting, mostly due to my obsessive nature to who I want to be and what I want to accomplish. I had plans on joining the Military, but after a few circumstances where I felt it was impractical to join now, now I have goals of going to college and become a police officer or go to Law school. Everything I seem to desire deep down has to do with authority to a certain extent, because I want control. But the problem is, how can I control anyone when I rarely control myself. I feel like I'm a ghost, as if reality around me was created by my head. But I KNOW that's not true. I just want to have a linear path, one that I can fully understand and grasp. I just want to make SENSE of things. The moment I dont make sense of things, I just start oversleeping, having reckless sex, or am doing things I know is not me.

70,"So a few years ago  we lost our big sister ( 30/f) to cancer which is difficult enough for us but for our younger sister (13/f) seemed to be the final straw . There are 5 of us in total and the youngest is technically a half sister and her father was just horrible . Very manipulative and abusive ( verbal and emotional) he was also classed as mentally ill suspected he was just on a lot of drugs .  As a youngster she witnessed a lot . He used to hurt himself is he wasn’t getting his way.  Needless to say there is no contact with him now and hasn’t been for a few  years( her choice ). 

Fast forward . Since my sister passed my youngest sister has been self harming . At first was just superficial surface scratches but last year she started going very deep . She had to be stitched up twice in one week which made the hospital put her in a unit for a while . She’s had counselling and family therapy and has meetings with the relevant people and it’s not that she’s trying to end her life but rather to take control of something . The meds and unit helped and has settled it but not cured t . She still is doing it when she gets anxious and I’m so worried she will end up with an infection or worse of this continues .

He gets really depressed for long stretches of time.

Then, I know I have to take a step back and focus on myself. Only then, we both can’t help the other because we’re focusing on our own health, which makes us feel disconnected and sad and abandoned and it can really spiral out of control. It becomes a waiting game. Then, we both question our sanity and our relationship and neither of us can trust ourselves as far as if we’re thinking and feeling rationally and we don’t have a mentally sane person to weigh in.

This week I've lost my girlfriend and my best friend. My ex and I were having troubles a lot of it due to my mental health, I have a deep self hatred and I apprently see my self and my place in the world very differently than people. Obviously I can't relate to that I can only see my self as I actually see my self.

Anyway just after breaking up with my ex I messaged my friend and the discussion quickly became about how I need to sort my self out with either therapy or medication. For those that don't know getting mental health help from the nhs in Scotland is a case of unless the person is a direct danger to themselves or others then the help you'll get is a leaflet for a self help group and a pat on the shoulder on the way out the door, at least in my experience. I can't afford private therapy and things got heated in our discussion, I don't remember exactly what was said but the end of the conversation was until I got help for my self they couldn't watch me go through all of this update again, it's too painful to watch, and so my best friend has blocked me and cut me out their life.

I understand all of this, I'm hurting these people with my anxiety and stress and neither of them need that in their lives and have frankly done the right thing and got distance from it.

78,"I’ve been going through the worst time of my life this entire year, really. But my depression and especially my anxiety have reached a peak in the past several months since I ended my engagement and temporarily moved in with my parents. I’ve suffered from mental illness for 27 years now. There have been many ups and downs, but I honestly never believed it could ever be this bad.

My psychiatrist of ten years fired me because I cancelled two appointments like ten minutes before because I was having such intense panic attacks, I couldn’t have gone. I understand why he did that... I can’t blame him. I broke the rules. I wish he had been more flexible over two appointments and severe panic attacks, but I also didn’t particularly like him as my psychiatrist and had been wanting to find someone new anyways.

I narrowed my search to two psychiatrists. I have an appointment with one tomorrow and the other on Tuesday. I just want to see who will fit best with me, as I don’t want to spend another decade with a doctor who doesn’t understand me.

My best friend’s fiancée recently completed either a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient program at this place she speaks very highly of and has amazing reviews. It’s a little over 30 minutes away and driving makes me anxious, but it takes my insurance, had better reviews than other places in Dallas, and they were super nice. I made an appointment for a free assessment on Saturday.

I was really proud of myself for doing all of this, but particularly making the appointment for the assessment for an outpatient program. I need serious help right now, and while it’s not something I want to do at all, I just need help. I want to do everything I can to get better.

I called my Mom to tell her I made the appointment, expecting her to be happy that I was working on getting help. She was angry. She didn’t understand why I would sign up for something so far and that I shouldn’t have made an appointment because I wouldn’t go. Well,first of all, the assessment is free so if I went and decided it wasn’t for me, I wouldn’t owe anything. And, yeah, maybe I do have a history of having panic attacks and not going to my psychiatrist appointments (well, only twice, but it’s still not okay), but I am desperate to get better and I think this could help. At this point, I’d do pretty much anything.

She said that she wanted me to go, but everything else she said was discouraging and seemed angry that it was 30 minutes away. I live in Dallas. It’s a big fucking city. Sometimes you have to drive a bit.

She was so discouraging that I just went into a massive panic and cancelled my appointment. It’s something I do plan to approach again soon, but now I just kinda feel like... what’s even the point in seeking help? I’m going to screw it up, nothing will change, and it’s just not worth it.

My parents aren’t perfect, just like any others, because they’re human and make mistakes. So I don’t want to hear about how I have bad parents. I absolutely don’t. They’ve always been amazing parents and have always been INCREDIBLY supportive. This is the first time my mom really discouraged me when it comes to my mental illness. Maybe she was having a bad day or something...I don’t know. But after that conversation, I just questioned if I could ever even get better or if there’s a point to trying at all. I don’t usually feel this way. I stay upbeat and positive and optimistic... but it’s hard to be that way when you have mental illness in the first place... and feels impossible when you feel like you don’t have support.

I desperately want to cancel my other appointments now, but I won’t. All I want is to stay in my room alone with my cat. But I’m not going to let myself. I’ll do these appointments. And when I am less emotional, I’ll make another appointment with the outpatient place.

I’m not having a full-fledged panic attack right now (or I wouldn’t be able to write this!), but I sure hope my level of anxiety goes down very soon. I’m just so sad I went from happy and proud to dejected and anxious just because I was trying to do something to fix myself.",01Nov2018,1

80,"Washington, USA

I feel like it's getting difficult to talk to my friends and family about how I feel. I don't want to be a burden on my boyfriend and cry about my problems to him because he has his own. I know I'm very emotional but I don't know how to control it. I'm also kind of anxious, which isn't helpful.

I know rationally that all of this is in my head, but it's hard to shake this near constant feeling of unhappiness. I don't even know why I'm unhappy most of the time.

For example, I dressed up and went out to my favorite bar with some good friends and my boyfriend last night for Halloween, but when my boyfriend decided to go home I started getting anxious because I was worried he was mad at me. He showed no indicators of being upset, and seemed normal when I walked him to his car, but this morning I still feel dread like he's upset with me and I don't know why. 

I had a lot of fun with my friends after he left and went home on a good note, but I don't feel any residual satisfaction like I normally would after a night out with friends. Like bitch give me the dopamine, amiright? 

The only drugs I use are alcohol and marijuana, I work out semi regularly and am fit, and I eat mostly healthily. So what's the problem? I can't figure it out. ",01Nov2018,1

I’ve always been a little mentally unstable with anxiety, but it’s gotten worse since starting college. I think when I fetishize mental illness and “self-diagnose” I’m trying to find a reason as to why I don’t act right socially. I’m not used to being alone so much, and recently it has just been me and my thoughts.

The current list of possible mental illness I’ve been “relating” to have been schizophrenia and ADHD (which isn’t as far fetched). I only think the former because I have started to talk to myself more, which is far from being schizophrenic. I just want to be okay.",01Nov2018,1
83,"I am basically dealing with nearly a year of no motivation and struggling with it. I have always been a very driven type A person. I've dealt with my share of troubles but my drive and motivation have pushed me forward and kept me going. 

My husband died last December and my motivation died with him. Not only do I not have motivation for the larger things - career, life plans, etc - I don't care about the smaller day to day things either - what to have for dinner, seeing friends, Fridays at the end of the work week. 

I just don't give a shit about anything. I can barely get the energy up to do difficult-but-important things like planning a major surgery. Routine stuff - going to work, showering, sleeping, eating - I can do but I with no joy or desire. I do them because they are there to be done. 

I still read voraciously although I have given up on fiction. I'm a top performer at my job. I still keep up with hobbies like yoga, knitting, and binge watching Amazon. But I don't particularly want to. I do it because it's there to be done but I find no joy or fulfillment in it. 

In 2017 I wrote my first book. I reread it last month and it's like looking at someone else's life. Who was the eloquent driven person?

84,"Whenever I have plans with my friends to go out and do something, I spend the couple hours beforehand in my house trying to calm down from severe anxiety attacks brought on by simply thinking of being around many people. Last night my girlfriend and I went out and I did some breathing exercises to calm myself before we left. We went to a couple bars and all was well. Then she mentioned how her family (Mom, dad, aunts and uncles) were doing karaoke at a bar down the road. The thought of going to that bar (lots of rowdy douchebags hang out there) and also being around her family somehow triggered me and I began panicking. We got there and my girlfriend immediately grabbed the microphone and began singing. She has a beautiful voice. I sat there and watched as all these creepy dudes eyeballed her, and tried to make conversation with her parents but they hardly speak English and when I’m in a bad mental state/ in a noisy bar my Spanish isn’t as great as it usually is. I immediately went to a quiet corner in the bar and just sat there with my eyes closed, taking deep breaths. My girlfriend found me and was very upset and embarrassed by the way I was acting. “My family is wondering why the hell you are acting so weird.” I didn’t know what to say. I told her I wanted to leave, and she told me to leave. But I didn’t wanna leave her. She’s the only one I have and I needed her to comfort me and distract me from my mental state. But she was confused and disgusted. We left the bar, me trailing her by 10 feet as she purposely and angrily walked ahead of me. I began sobbing. We came to my place, she called an Uber home, and this morning I’m so goddamn embarrassed by the way I was acting last night. I don’t know why I acted like that. It was totally stupid and uncalled for, and I ruined her night. She says she forgives me and that she loves me, but that she just doesn’t understand why I act like that sometimes. And i don’t understand it either. But it happens often when I’m in social situations. At bars, sports events, parties, etc. I’ll just begin panicking. I really hope my girlfriend doesn’t leave me because of all of this, because she does so much for me and is an incredible soul. I wish I were healthier mentally.

I have Bipolar II and GAD (medicated for both). Lately I've been under a lot more stress than usual and have coupled that with some alcohol and Marijuana use. I've since quit drinking (nearly two weeks), stopped vaping (nearly one week), and only occasionally use THC now.

I've been withdrawing more and more from friends to the point where I can't even go on social media anymore. I talk to maybe one or two people. I just argued with and blocked one of my longest friends in an irritable fit.

* I hate school because i feel like i could do so much more to educate myself than sit behind a school desk all day. / I hate long holidays and want to go back to school because i get bored and don't do anything to educate myself.
* I love people like teenagers and listening to how their minds work to figure out how society's pressure affects them. / I hate teenagers who fall under the pressure of society and dislike listening to their problems about relationships and smoking.
* I want a boyfriend. / I want to be single. 
* I don't crush on people. / I can't stop thinking about this guy. 
* I want to live with my mom because i don't get along with my dad. / I want to live with my dad because i don't get along with my mom. 
* I hate bacteria and google dieseases obsessively.  I get panick attacks when i have a fucking flu. / I eat food i drop on the ground and eat my nails. I also get sick on purpose so i don't have to go to school.
* I genuently accept my body and eat whatever i feel like eating. / I hate my body and feel weak and unhealthy.
* I'm not a productive person during the day. / I'm not a night owl.
* I hate attention and can't take a compliment. / I crave people listening to me talk because i feel intelligent when people tell me i've helped them.
* I hate my bad habits soooooo much, they give me anxiety. / I keep lying to my friends and parents and stealing from my dad.

98,"Hi, first time posting here. So my history: dealt with anxiety all my life in one way or another, very rarely short stints of depression, and for the last year pretty bad health anxiety (including OCD behavior) on and off, and what my therapist considered a high amount of stress (grad school). I always sleep at least 8 hours and do my best to eat well.

So I'm just wondering, especially to those who deal with high anxiety and/or stress: does anyone else get momentarily disorientated? Even on a full night's rest, only like 11 in the morning, I'll have these moments of being like ""Whoa. How did I even get from Point A to here?"" I'm slightly confused about where I am spatially, like manually thinking through ""Ok, I'm in my office, in this building, at this location."" This has been pretty scary to me, and always sends me down a rabbit hole of thinking I have early dementia or something, since this never happened in undergrad. I'm hoping and guessing that my stress has led me to be ""in my head"" a good amount of the time, which takes away from my observational processes. But still, what the heck! Sometimes I feel like my eyes are getting tired just from looking around at too many things. Hope something isn't wrong with my brain. Hoping that someone else can relate. Thanks. :)",01Nov2018,1
99,"So I tried BetterHelp, which is a service which sets you up with an online therapist and they have to message you once a day or something like that, if I remember correctly. I had a *horrible* experience. And the service is not cheap at all.

A big part of my issues revolve around trouble with dating and connecting with women. Sometimes when I vent, I say things that I could not say outside of therapy without getting a negative backlash, so of course, I tend to let it out in therapy. Nothing really vitriolic or disturbing, just things that could offend. But with this therapist, I really started to get the feeling that she was passing judgement. I don't remember specifically what it is she said, I just remember feeling that way. Then of course, on one occasion, she said something which made me really question her credibility. I was discussing feelings of being sexually undesirable to women due to body image issues, and she responded mentioning that sexual attraction isn't about looks and listing examples of other things it can be about and she included ""money, status."" Ummmmm, correct me if I'm wrong, but thinking ""women are sexually attracted to me because I have money"" is NOT a healthy way of thinking. This is the type of thing that you would see on Redpill forums. WHY would a therapist say something like that?? Then after a couple months or so, she said something about how she doesn't think she is able to help me and must terminate our relationship. She said this very abruptly, there was no prior discussion about this possibly being the case. But what I found most offputting was that she suggested that I should seek a male therapist. What does the gender of the therapist have to do with anything??? She said a male would be ""able to provide better feedback and better understand my situation"" but I don't really buy that. I am sort of under the impression that she felt offended as a woman by the stuff I was saying and she imagines other female therapists would feel the same way and would not be able to handle it. I see this as very unbecoming of a licensed therapist.

Then I switched to another therapist, whom I selected because of her credentials and I expected she would be more professional. But she was even WORSE. With this one I legit felt like I was being trolled. I would spend hours typing out huge messages in which I would describe my issues and my feelings in the best detail I could muster and she would respond with two sentences just asking a question, often times about something that I CLEARLY already said in my message. And then that would be her message for the day and she wouldn't have to respond again until the next day. It drove me nuts! There is absolutely no way a therapist with her credentials could actually be that inattentive and insensitive. I am pretty convinced she was doing it on purpose either in order to get me to find another therapist or just to troll me because she was offended by things I said and harbored contempt for me. The ONLY reason I did not report her behavior was out of fear of the possibility that she could somehow find out my identity and out me online for the things I said in our sessions.

This can't be acceptable behavior for therapists, can it? Are the rules different for online therapists? I will NEVER use BetterHelp again.",01Nov2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy the kids. They have never been my issue. But the other people ... it's just all backbiting, gossip, fighting with each other, complaining (SO MUCH COMPLAINING - and it's contagious... because now I am complaining on Reddit), and more. I bring this stuff home with me, emotionally, and I can't filter it out. I can't wind down from it. I've tried meditating, going for walks, deep breathing, playing video games, reading a book, you name it. It's like this tight feeling in my chest and stomach, knowing I have to go back into that place just 8 hours after I go to bed.   


If I was able to ... not care.... about anything these people say or do... I would be on easy street. I have no idea why it deeply affects me. I've sat and tried to analyze it to death. Why do I care if they are complaining about the kids or each other? Why do I care if they fight? All I keep coming back to is that it is basically obnoxious and it gets old. I feel mentally exhausted from being exposed to it all day.   


I'm very new to this particular building. I've only been here for three months. (I've been doing this particular teaching for 15 years - I'm a special ed paraeducator.) So I really don't have much pull or say as the newbie in the building. If I ever decide to go to the principal about this... I feel like I should have hard documented moments/dates/times of the things going on. But when I'm preoccupied with my student (a priority in my book) - it is difficult to commit to documenting what everyone else is doing. Also it just feels a bit slimy on my part to do that.

Scientists have proven certain things about the Endocrine System (controls hormones in the body &amp; brain) and it's connection to the Sensory-Somatic Nervous System (carries info from the sensory organs to the Central Nervous System and then INFLUENCES the Endocrine System and hormonal balance {homeostasis} in the body &amp; brain). This system (SSNS-&gt;CNS-&gt;ES), when exposed to certain stimuli, either speeds things up (a Predator is threatening you) = Fight-or-Flight, or slows things down (Exposure to pitch black) = sleep. There doesn't always need to be a stimuli (threat or biological cue) though. You can voluntarily direct your sensory organs, muscles and joints (i.e. Meditation, Yoga and Progressive Relaxation) and in a controlled and conscious way affect your ES.

Holding a Power Stance for 5 minutes increases the level of testosterone in your body, male or female, whether you've won something or not (I do this at the end of my yoga sessions). Testosterone and Cortisol (the stress hormone) are on a teetering see-saw -&gt; when cortisol is low, testosterone is higher &amp; vice versa in stressful situations. More testosterone in the system makes you more resilient to stress. Consenting touch releases a wave of Happy Hormones (Why Therapy Animals and Hugs are so Beneficial). Basically keep Juggernauting forth.  Smile. Hug. Show Affection. Laugh. Do Yoga Poses &amp; Power Stances. Use Positive Self-Talk. Fake It Til You Become It!

106,"Hi I’m new to this sub but I had a question about mental illness &amp; it’s selective advantage. Sorry if this isn’t allowed &amp;/or the typical post for it.

A little background about me: I’ve suffered from anxiety since ~8 &amp; depression since I was ~12. I just graduated college, having studied genetics &amp; psychology. 

Throughout my studies, I’ve learned that mental illness has a strong genetic link, although its exact causes &amp; genes responsible are unknown. Since suicide is one of the major causes of death in the U.S. - which points to the sheer number of individuals who have struggled with mental illness - it’s a safe extrapolation that there is a huge population out there dealing with depression &amp; other mental illnesses.

I was wondering if anyone had any personal hypotheses or actual scientific articles pointing out the selective advantage of depression.

For example, it’s obvious why so many people suffer from anxiety. In the past,  anxiety was a good thing because it kept humans alert of their surroundings &amp; less likely to be preyed upon. The prolonged anxiety we feel today is detrimental in modern society but makes sense in the context of our recent past.

But what is the selective advantage of depression? I read one article about how genes involved with depression are also involved in immune response. The short version is, people with depression are more suited to fighting off illnesses because 1) they’re lack of interest in events &amp; low motivation is meant to prevent them from socializing (higher likelihood of catching a disease) and 2) with the lack of movement &amp; energy spent, individuals’ immunes systems had more resources to combat the virus or cold infection.

I like to deal with my mental illness (&amp; in general my problems) in a scientific &amp; level-headed way. I was just wondering if anyone else had other hypotheses or has read something along these lines!",01Nov2018,1
107,"About ~20 minutes ago, I was over at my boyfriend’s house. We had sex and cuddled and then we started getting ready because he had to go to wrestling practice. I’m in a very emotionally heightened state after sex so I’m not sure if I’m over reacting or what. So while he was downstairs getting ready, I was up in his room, and I noticed a piece of paper with writing on it pinned to the wall, face-down. So I flipped it over to read it out of curiosity and saw the words “it’s all my fault” carved into his wall. I was literally in stunned silence for a solid minute and I got really emotional and worried about him. The paper itself was old and he had gone through some really rough things 4 years or so ago, so I’m pretty sure it’s old, but the last time I ever ignored something like this one of my friends ended up in a mental hospital on suicide watch. 
We’re both really open with each other and he’s generally a really happy and loving person, but school and his family life has gotten him really down lately, so I’m worried. I want to talk to him about his mental health and check in on him, and bring up the carving, but I’m worried. I want to be sensitive about it. Any advice? ",01Nov2018,1

And before that I realized that I don’t want to die before I make myself known and live luxuriously. But then it started developing even more to the point where now I don’t feel real. It’s like an ego death but sober. It’s like I keep seeing this timeline of life In my head instead of actually looking through my own eyes. It’s just feels so weird. Like nothing matters at all because we’re just little marks in reality and we’re all just little timelines. It’s not all the time but it’s bad because it makes me stop caring about things. I just want to know how I can return to reality or why I’m thinking like this.,01Nov2018,1

112,"This is my third time trying to write a post and not ramble. I just feel like I have so much to say, but I can't manage to stay focused on a single point or any level of coherency. I feel so incredibly lost. As I write this, and wait, I feel so light headed and tired. Like I am fading away. I have been diagnosed with an Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, and PTSD. My therapist had told me that these are treatable (even curable!) and that I will feel normal again someday, with proper care. The problem is everything just gets worse and worse. I am constantly finding myself in situations or circumstances that cause me to behave irrationally (was taking 2 medicines at separate times, Gabapentin and 5-HTP, that caused my serotonin levels to increase but instead of feeling happy I felt insane and obsessive) or make the worst possible decision I can. It is infuriating to finally have things going the right way and then BAM it's a damn mess all over again. I do not know if I am currently still going through the ""withdrawls"" or coming down off of the gabapentin medicine even though it has been like 4 days since I last took it. I feel so out of place. I want to be normal again, not just for me but for my partner. Our relationship is the most rocky it has ever been and I keep making excuses and blaming the medicine, my work, etc. It's like I can't stop. I have always thought of myself as the most patient, understanding, and reasonable person in the world but I have also never been the person RESPONSIBLE for the issue. I have never made someone feel so low, and so terrible about themselves and it has destroyed me. I can barely sleep, I don't eat nearly as much as I used to, and I don't even feel capable of holding down a job in the future as I transition out of this awful career field.

But I have no idea what the first steps to do that are - I've only ever been to a college counselor before. Do I just Google ""therapists near me""? How do I know who takes my insurance?

114,"So, here I am. There is something wrong with me, I'm slipping away. I can feel it, but I can't stop it. It started out with some odd quirks 2 months ago.

Every day I hang out with my friends, but it is like I'm in a different world entirely. I broke the heart of the only girl I loved because of paranoia. I black out, it started for a few seconds, now I don't want to be alone, because when I do, I become catatonic for hours.

119,"I was speaking to my counsellor today about an incident over the weekend, which she said sounded like I’d had a mild panic/anxiety attack. I’ll fill you in on what happened. 

On Saturday I went with my husband to get my eyes tested for glasses, but I took too long to get ready and we ended up missing our train. My husband was frustrated because I do this very often, I waste time watching YouTube when I should be getting ready and cause us to be late frequently. He said he felt bored being the bad guy who had to chase me up. I totally understood why, and I agreed with him. It is a problem, but on the drive there, I just lost it. I had a knot in my stomach, I couldn’t stop crying, I couldn’t stop replaying it in my head. Every time I tried to stop, or got myself halfway calm, I’d start again. I was beating myself up in my head for being selfish and juvenile.

Then I started freaking out that my out of proportion reaction would be seen as manipulative and trying to make him feel guilty, and that just made me cry harder. Then I started to cry even more because I was going to have to go out in public and show up at a glasses shop with a swollen red face or crying my eyes out and it was humiliating. 

As we got closer and closer I got worse, and when we couldn’t find parking, I was blaming myself, and my husband’s attempts to comfort me were not working. It’s making me cry just thinking about it. 

I ended up crying the entire 40 minute journey in the car, then down the busy street alone as my husband tried to park, and into the glasses shop. I only calmed down thanks to the lovely ladies in the shop who spoke calmly to me and didn’t bring attention to it. It gave me a massive headache the entire day though. 

I am a little conflicted as to whether this is anxiety or just hypersensitivity. I don’t want to diagnose myself without advice from people who actually experience this. I have had other incidents like this, and at one point as a child I did get stress induced seizures. My two siblings also have issues with anxiety. Am I in the right area, or is this something else?

122,"Also posted to r/advice but didn't get any feedback yet. I’ll try to keep this short, but really there’s a lot to unpack here so feel free to ask questions if you have any.

I’m 22F. I have dealt with an undiagnosed eating disorder for roughly 6 or 7 years now. I go long periods of time feeling relatively fine and undisordered in my eating (although my eating remains abnormal compared to most even during these times as I usually only eat dinner each day), but then my ED will flare up and I’ll spend days, weeks, or months restricting my intake severely, fasting, and feeling incredibly toxic towards food (I’ll feel happier when I’m “empty” or proud of myself for eating under 300 cal a day - when I’m feeling undisordered I don’t have these thoughts and can recognize they’re disturbing). My weight bounces between a little under normal weight (117ish) to decently above normal weight (150ish).

So you’re probably like okay, no brainer, go to a doctor. But things are a bit more complicated than that. Let me run through some mitigating factors:

- I have a very slow metabolism. I have for my entire life. Even as a child I barely ate and complained about being full from the day before often. I can comfortably eat one meal a day and maintain my weight. It stresses me out to imagine getting ED help and having to figure out a “normal” (aka two-three meal a day) mealplan which I know will make me uncomfortably full, require more work in terms of cooking, and possibly make me gain.

- I have a chronic pain condition. Cooking is very hard. And it’s boring, and it uses up my very limited energy which is absolutely a precious commodity for me. If I have to cook more, I have to sacrifice other things that I wanted to do that day because I will be too sore/too tired from cooking. I hate this.

- My chronic pain makes me depressed. Food, and my control over it, helps significantly with this. My pain condition has taken so much control and power from me, and I feel overwhelmed and devastated at the prospect of giving up one of the last few things I do have control over.

- I fear weight gain. I know pretty much anyone with an ED does. But most people with EDs can move to healthy eating with healthy exercise to control weight in a healthy range. I can barely walk many days, let alone work out, due to pain. A large reason in why I restrict so much is because my TDEE is astronomically low due to how sedentry and short I am. I’m very upset at the idea of eating more calories without anyway to control my weight gain.

- I legit hate healthy eating. Healthy food depresses me and has a huge negative impact on my mood. I have never found a vegetable I actively want or crave, same goes for fruit, the only meats I like are red meats, and I have a weird other ED issue with anything smooth in texture (it makes me sick immediately).

= I have extreme apathy and lack of appetite when presented with the majority of foods. It’s like most people have split food into five groups: hate, dislike, neutral, like, love. And they’ll eat anything from either dislike-love or neutral-love. But for me if I don’t actively love it, it feels like a waste of effort to eat it. Even when I’m not disordered, if someone else is cooking and not making one of the few foods I love I’ll probably just skip dinner. I have been this way my whole life, and it makes any sort of consistent healthy eating feel impossible.

I’m not sure if it’s the right time to get treatment for my ED. I’m dealing with a lot of other physical and mental health problems, and my ED feels both like a backburner issue and a crutch to make it through my life right now. My chronic pain diagnosis is very new and have dramatically changed my life. My depression is pretty bad. I recently came to realize that I have been ignoring and suppressing a lot of trauma in my past and I might actually have C-PTSD. I have next to social life due to physical limitations. I’ve become dependent on drugs to emotionally cope. I worry that trying to stop my ED will send me spiraling and lead to a mental breakdown. Thoughts?",01Nov2018,1

126,"Haha. Terrific.

To be more specific, in true schizophrenia fashion it's always the same insult (in Portuguese, I'm Brazilian): ""How ridiculous."" And it's always women.

Curiously, when I try to talk to these women, they are often very nice to me. I'm kind of good-looking, and I have a way of ""arrogantly ignoring"" people on the street (avoiding eye-contact, that kind of thing), and often there is sort of a resentful energy in the ""How ridiculous"".

The Christian part of me wonders if it's some kind of curse some woman cast on me after I treated her badly.

I know, of course, that the professional assessment here would be to say that it's all a delusion.

But the funny thing is this. I have seen they say it. I have seen their lips move. It tends to happen when I'm within their ""radius of perception"". You know, close enough for them to notice me and for there to be some interpersonal tension. Know what I mean?

It's like I'm broadcasting the words to them. My low self-esteem (I think there might be some self-esteem stuff going on here too), my unconscious, whatever - the word-cloud of insults, this swarm, ever surrounding me, ""How ridiculous!"", ""How ridiculous!""... and when I get in the vicinity of these women, it starts coming out of their mouths.

Years ago I would hear it now and then. This year it has ramped up. Now it's all the time. Particularly, it seems, when I drink too much coffee. I'll try quitting caffeine and see if the phenomenon subsides.

130,"So I've just found this sub and read up a bit on something I think might be an answer to a lot of my problems. I must say in advance that I'm quite opposed to the idea of self-diagnosing and so see the hypocrisy to what I'm about to say. Sorry for that.  Also buckle up, It's a bit of a long read. 

I'm a 23 year old male, and my life has been kind of a struggle so far. In school I performed a lot below my potential performance. Back then I was told a lot ""you can do this easily, but you just have to do it."" This phrase has become my most hated in my life because for these people it seemed like a choice. Just do it. Just put yourself to work and do the thing. For me in my mind, I had extreme difficulty actually doing said task just because I didn't feel like doing it. I was your typical lazy guy. 

Now to me, I always felt like I didn't have much of a choice in what I did. I felt no possibility to actually convince myself of doing what I should do. I felt like my willpower was extremely weak. 

I then found myself in a sex addiction. Constantly cheating on my then girlfriend, despite the fact that I felt absolutely awful while doing it. Eventually got psychological aid to help fix this problem. It was at this point that I was diagnosed with an impulse control disorder and ADD. 

This ADD diagnose revealed the reason behind my habits of being late, chaotic, dreamy and very bad at concentrating. 

As with many addictions, this therapy made me realize many of my behaviors had a root cause of being a cover-up for hidden feelings that I wasn't even aware of in the past. It was with this ""checking of my thoughts"" that the first derealisation symptoms started showing up.

With my constant introspection of my thoughts, I started to question everything that crossed my mind. Even the question whether I was actually sober. Literally asking myself whether I'm experiencing reality in the way I do ""normally"" 

Now obviously, asking yourself this constantly doesn't help at all with actually experiencing reality in a way you think feels ""normal"". 

Now fast-forward about 1.5 years to the moment that I'm writing this post. I check myself constantly all freaking day. I constantly ask myself about feeling normal, and constantly conclude I indeed don't feel normal.  The more I think of it, the more I experience it. For 2 times already, about 1.5 years ago, it got so bad during a conversation with my then mentor at college, that it felt like I was staring into the abyss of a panic attack. Just barely being able to calm myself. 

I really hate doing this constantly, and the obsessiveness of these thoughts recently lead me  to making the link with OCD. I also have some tics in which I make some very specific movement with my body. For example, I grind my teeth a lot.  

I've never been diagnosed with OCD, only an impulse control disorder and ADD. After reading my story I'm curious to hear people's opinions on the matter. Could these obsessive thoughts be connected to OCD? 

If you're still with me, thanks a lot for reading this much!

133,"Good day, guys, 

Was just at a birthday party for a friend where I met someone I went to high school with. In conversation, I mentioned I cannot remember A LOT of what happened in high school at which point she jokes that she doesn't either and attributed it to trauma. I said I believed the reason was depression, and the conversation on the table switched to one about mental health. 

A familiar feeling washed over me during this conversation, like I didn't deserve to tell all these people about depression. Like I was lying to them. Like I was being dramatic and seeking attention. Like what I feel could never truly be classed as depression. 

**Does anyone else feel the same way?** I'm just wondering if these thoughts are in fact, true. Granted some days I feel lower than others. But I still go about my day... I am rarely crippled by it. I understand it can have a paralysing effect to some, but it rarely paralyses me. I'm just more aware of the void some days...

**How do I cope with this and deal with it honestly and truthfully?** 

Thanks in advance.",01Nov2018,1

135,"Hi there,

Bipolar disorder runs through my dad’s side of the family. Throughout my life I’ve been regularly short-tempered, and when in rage, gone as far as hurting myself without cause (not like self-harm with depression).

I’ve been to counseling on three separate occasions, and I don’t want to necessarily go back. I’m not currently going. Is there a way to go in for a wellness checkup/possible diagnosis and then choosing which steps to take? I don’t want to be tied in if they do decide there’s a name for something wrong with me.

Thank you.",01Nov2018,1
