0,"Every night lately I've been getting paranoid I hear every little squeak and noise that goes on around me in my house and especially when I go out for a cigarette it's like I get hyper sensitive to everything around me but I don't take drugs that would do that to me or any drugs or alcohol at all, it's been about two weeks since my last injection which I have monthly so I've got another two weeks to go.

 I keep thinking people are going to break into my house and that I'm constantly under the watchful eye of what I call the shadow people.

This starts happening every night as soon as my mom goes to bed or it gets dark outside, my mom works away a lot too and she's going away again tomorrow, I can't tell anybody about these feelings because I want to come off my medication all together I don't like it, it makes me feel like a low functioning robot that can't compute the simplist of things and I end up getting really confused.

I don't know what to do!

2,"Everyone I know says they’ve experienced these. I have since I can remember. BUT, it’s ramped up to a very intrusive point lately.

They usually hit in early morning, upon walking, and when trying to go to sleep. 
This kind of makes sense as that’s when the mind has calmed down and is more vacant.

From what I’ve read this is normal but can also be a form of OCD at some accelerated point.  It is a low time in my life which is probably no coincidence.

The odd twist for me is that they aren’t just playing on a loop but I seem to be pushing it along out of anxiety. My best analogy is that it feels similar to how Dustin Hoffman’s character in Rain Man handled stressful situations by repeating “Who’s on First”.  He used it as a tool to calm his anxiety.

3,"I recently scheduled an appointment with a new therapist.  They do not accept insurance, and use a sliding scale.  During our consultation, they asked me what I would be comfortable paying per session, so I told her $60, which is what I paid out of pocket from my previous therapist. I was unfamiliar with negotiating for health treatment, and the fact that she didn't give me any benchmark for what a session usually costs was questionable.  Like if I said 100, would she have taken that? If I said 25, would she also have accepted that?  Obviously I want to compensate her fairly for what she's providing me, but I'm wondering if I should have handled it in a different way, or if I'm over/underpaying for her service.  ",25Aug2018,2,

5,"I live with my parents and grandfather and have had a lot of difficulty in the last 8 years since being kicked out of college. For most of the time it was because drugs and my grandmother developing dementia, but since I got clean for the last year I've been really trying to develop purpose and whenever I catch onto something promising I invest very heavily to the point where it appears to my family that I am being inconsistent to the point of mental illness. This caused me to cease my attempts at improving whatever skill it is so i can appear relaxed, though it mostly makes me forget the passion of having an objective which causes me to act intensely and sometimes angrily towards them. Often my goal is being more pleasant to them, which becomes difficult as I give up and reason why I shouldn't blame them for my inconsistency. Tonight I ended up just very very angrily arguing with my dad and trying to make the point that I need to have the value of my purpose acknowledged thoroughly enough to motivate me- which i believe is true for everyone who is developing a purpose. More often this time I've felt righteous indignation to the point of almost manic anger, but I can't let go of the idea that if my purpose is nurtured through basic means- someone picking up on my programming or math skills and referring me, so I can have money to put into both the healing process of my family and whatever simple necessities (diet related) that I need to better my meditation and counseling skill practice- that I could actually save someone's life who was experiencing the awful and harmful things I was a part of.",25Aug2018,2,

I'm not sure how to cope with this, and since I've suffered from depressive thoughts along with anxiety this is really frightening to me. We were the same age, but the social conditions were somewhat different.

I know I'll have to see a psychiatrist regarding this since I would otherwise just 'push' it away back into my skull.

10,"I was sent away at 17, diagnosed OCD, Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and Adjustment Disorder, to the top of a mountain in Redding CA to a Christian based behavioral correctional camp. These camps aim to help ""troubled youth"" kids who until they turn 18 or graduate the program are stuck there with completely inhumane treatment as explained in this wonderfully and much needed article [https://www.amadorvalleytoday.org/2873/opinion/the-harsh-reality-of-behavior-correctional-camps/](https://www.amadorvalleytoday.org/2873/opinion/the-harsh-reality-of-behavior-correctional-camps/)  Most of the time, these programs are affiliated with private, for-profit corporations that are completely unregulated by the government. They convince concerned parents that they are out of options, and they offer to take the burden of parenting off their hands as did mine. The worst part is that this industry is free of government regulation, meaning that they can only be held liable for damages if serious bodily injury or death of a teen results. Post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, and other various after-effects often result from being kidnapped, villainized, and isolated from society in such a manner. Thankfully Governor Jerry Brown just put into place Senate Bill NO. 524, see link here [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill\_id=201520160SB524](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB524)  Some of the rules that I and the other teens there were obligated to follow included: no eye contact or communicating, no speaking to staff unless spoken to, no music, no dancing, frequent chores that subjected us to unsanitary and unsafe conditions, ""being put on peanut butter"" which meant you ate peanut butter sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday until they felt you had learned your lesson, and entirely unrealistic expectations for absolutely perfect behavior. Religious intolerance and staff bullying was another major problem that teens have experienced in this program (and others like it). There was no allowance for any religion besides Christianity, which was forced upon us in nearly every aspect of our lives. Additionally, staff took the opportunity whenever they could to criminalize students and make them feel inadequate. As you may have guessed with my diagnoses and the fact that the therapeutic solutions they offered were basically ""pray the mental problems away"" as they are not required to have licensed therapists or psychiatrists this was basically the worst thing that ever happened for my mental health and my future. I tried running away on one of my first few nights but the school is located miles up an enormous mountain in Redding CA and the school hadn't even allowed me to have a pair of my shoes yet so I ran and walked down the mountain until my feet bled so much they clung to my socks. When they realized I had ran they followed in a car me mocking me the whole way about how I would never make it and it was too far. Finally exhausted, defeated, demoralized, and bloody, I allowed them to bring me back up to the school. I now knew the only way out was to hurt myself so I found a piece of glass that had been broken off a picture frame and cut my arm countless times until I was sure they would get the message. When I showed one of the staff members, instead of treating me with compassion and concern he treated me like I was an annoyance and a burden because he now knew he had to take me down to a hospital. While in the ER room a different staff member continued to mock me and belittle my situation. As they were transporting me to a psychiatric hospital and began wheeling me in on a gurney I took my one and only chance to escape and unclipped the restraints and ran. I ran and didn't stop to look back until I tripped over a curb and skidded to a stop on my hands and knees. when I looked back I cannot explain the relief I felt when I saw the EMT's had not followed. I stayed hidden for awhile until I felt it safe enough to try to find a ride back to my home city, which I luckily found, bless your heart whoever you are you were a godsend. RVCA took everything from me most importantly both my High School diploma due to the fact that now I was considered a ""missing person"" and couldn't re-register for High School without my parents and my family relationships including my three younger siblings. This in turn has cost me countless friendships, job opportunities, and extreme feelings of abandonment due to a continued lack of financial support to help get me the real treatment I have longed for since 17, I'm 21 now, and that's proper therapy, counseling, and medication. Please if you've made it this far consider checking out my GoFundMe page located here [https://www.gofundme.com/manage/the-brutal-reality-living-at-a-bcc](https://www.gofundme.com/manage/the-brutal-reality-living-at-a-bcc) but please feel no obligation, I just wanted to get the word out that there are still places like this up and running for now, including RVCA, the one I was sent to. If you are a parent and you are at all considering sending your child away to a place like this I would just ask you to please reconsider, there is never a reason to give up on your child. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

11,"I have few things that worry me about myself, however I do not know wether they add up to a single issue or not. I’m not that good with structuring this type of thing, so I’ll write a list. What I want to ask is, am I normal? I feel like I’m just attention seeking when I consider talking about this in person so I want to ask here.

I sometimes feel like I will be successful but often feel like I don’t deserve the praise I get for getting good grades/work  

I used to cut myself regularly, still do occasionally but deeper when I do

I often have sexual fantasies about killing people or being killed in violent ways

I often suddenly change my views on the people I know with only small issues as a trigger

As a child I had anger issues relating to being bullied that mellowed but never went away completely

I have sometimes researched how to kill myself (eg what guns or drugs) i don’t feel like I genuinely wanna do it, but I think about it anyway

12,"I'm confident that she has some kind of mental health issue but I don't know where to begin with finding out what it might be so that my SO and I can navigate our relationship with her. She's a great woman and I like her very much. I want to have some sort of basis with how to  go about supporting my boyfriend's interactions/relationship with her. He says she makes him very tired.

She gets \*extremely\* paranoid to the point where she cannot drive properly anymore. She drives so slowly that it's a hazard on the road and swerves out of the way of people waiting to turn onto whatever road she's driving on.

She is very anxious all the time and behaves in a flighty, nervous manner. She talks fast and disjointedly, doesn't like people over-hearing her on the phone at all and mumbles into the microphone when on the phone to my SO to the point where he can't understand her.

She can be very cold and distant and then will be ALL over him, calling him non-stop over and over again when he doesn't answer, sending multiple texts in a row asking him to answer and calling him pet names (which I think are endearing, but they make him uncomfortable). It's very clear to me that she loves him \*so\* much, but she can't express affection physically and won't hug him or anyone. (That's fine to me but I thought it might help paint a picture of her to include.)

She rarely helps him out with money, lifts anywhere or anything really (which is absolutely fine, of course. He thinks it's strange though because my parents help me out all the time. Maybe it's just different parenting styles?) If he's struggling, there's a 30% chance that she would help him out. But then she goes and smothers him when it suits her. It's very confusing for him.

She gets very childishly excited about things sometimes, shouting in happiness/excitement.

I know that she had a very traumatic and at least an emotionally, psychologically and physically abusive upbringing, so I know this is likely to have contributed. Apparently her father used to make her comb his hair for \*hours\* when she was a child. He was apparently a narcissist and literally a psychopathic type of person. I don't know much more about him than that.

She's a very intelligent woman who I believe would have thrived at university if she'd gone. 

She has a phobia of psychiatry and psychiatric hospitals/wards because her brother was committed to one in childhood and came home from it with worse issues than before. Apparently he behaves like a 'zombie' now. She attributes this to the psychiatric hospital. She apparently used to see a therapist but refuses to use medication and is \*very\* against anyone else taking any psychiatric medication. She is estranged from everyone else in her family and her sister stalks her. (I'm not sure whether she actually does, she certainly has reached out to her but I don't know whether it's just innocent attempts at contacting her or whether she's actually malicious and stalking her.)

My SO's mother seems to regard him as the pinnacle of her life's achievement and gushes about him to almost everyone she meets, including me whenever I see her. But then turns around and doesn't contact him for a couple of weeks until she blows up his phone again.

Apparently when she was pregnant with him, she threatened suicide after the father left her and my SO's ex-step-dad begged her to get an abortion as he didn't see her being fit for motherhood. My SO's father agrees with this. They both call her crazy.

Like I said, she's a lovely person and I like her very much. It's just that she behaves strangely and it has me and my SO scratching our heads a lot of the time.

I know that the best way to find out would be for her to be diagnosed by a professional but I can confidently say that I don't see that ever happening.

Would anyone be able to point me in the right direction so that my SO and I can understand her a little better?",25Aug2018,1,
13,"Today I experienced one of the most terrifying moments of my life. I woke up sobbing, continuing the tears that torrented literally all day since yesterday AM. The only respite was the 4 hour intermission at night, when I tossed and turned with hellish fever dreams. The voices which usually only spoke in low tones or even whispers became louder until they began to insert unwelcome fantasies of suicide and self harm. In a panic, I called my outpatient psychiatrist, who sounded alarmed and told me to get to the ER immediately. After 2 solid hours of a crazed Howard Hughes-esque freakout performed iun front of my horrified boyfriend, I fumbled through a shower and was driven to UCLA emergency services. 

 The perfunctory blurb you see on suicide prevention posters saying if you feel the need to harm yourself or others, call 911 or go to the emergency room immediately, seems like such a simple directive, but when faced with the reality of actually doing the thing, I lost all faculty and couldn’t compose myself long enough to answer the barrage of questions the triage nurses pitched at me and to stumble through the maze of hallways. The whole time I was shaking, unclear of where I was, where I was being taken, what was going to happen, what kind of treatment was hiding behind those doors. 

More than 10 physician-like people visited me in a relay, all asking the same questions phrased in millions of different ways. Feeling shitty as it were, each time I still had to dig into the dark recesses of my brain, that I desperately tried to shut up, in order to effectively answer their questions. When did the sadness start? Do you have a plan? Have you had prior self harm? How are you feeling at this moment? Is your home safe?

The cluelessness and abject helplessness are things never discussed in suicide cases that make it to the media (i.e. the masses). It’s always about the person, how they did it, a demonizing of the cocktail of antidepressants and mood stabilizers, and some obligatory mention of how they gave into depression and that there is help for others.

But what does that help look like? 10 hours after “detainment” I’m left still somewhat confused, but drugged with a new medicine just to help me get by. Aside from the tangibles of the prescription pad, or the straight jacket you might eventually wear, there’s not enough real talk about how it actually feels to be in this personal prison, and how to actually pick the lock and escape the cell. Even closest friends and families resort to the media-fed and inwardly rehearsed platitudes “stop being sad, you have so much going for you,” “you are doing the right thing,” “I’m always here for you,” “that sucks” which all lend to nothing - it doesn’t cut it. All these well-intended cliches are presented so robotically and so obviously as a defense mechanism to guard one’s own true emotional gashes, that it comes off inadvertently insincere. Can we please have an honest discussion about how it truly feels, because I guarantee at least one other person in your orbit feels the same as you, but doesn’t want to open up? How much comfort can we find in the strength in numbers? 

I’ve learned through this process is that the longer I hold it in, try to “work it out” on my own, and try to pretend it is a personality quirk, it only lends to a much larger unintended explosion that could have lasting unwanted effects. I want to be able to talk about this freely without fear of persecution and ridicule, and ignore the taboo that taught us that mental health (cray, if you will), and suicide ideation should never be openly discussed.

14,"Background: I am a 20 year old college student about to approach my 2ed year at a local community college. I have a form of mild autism and a visual processing disorder. I love school. I have always loved education. My primary studies of interest are in the following order: Pure mathematics (as of now proof theory, set theory and recently chaos theory), Philosophy (Plato, Pythagoras, socreates, mostly Greek philosophies), Music theory ( I have been trying to learn baroque music, like hadel and vivaldi), CS (Im not heavily interested in this subject, but i want to learn MATLAB and know the basics of C, Java and C++), and more recently Physics (I still do not know what i like, but my physics professor gave me a book called ""Newtons Clock, Chaos in the solar system"" and I have been hooked.  


 Story: Prior to now, I have had very few friends. I did not make my first true friend until about 5th grade, and then again in 7th grade, and now that I am in college I am trying a lot harder, but still am not making an reasonable results.. Due to my family moving quite often, I had little time to appreciate my friends. At about the age of 7, after a month long series of nightmares (still never found out the cause) I started talking to myself. At first it was at night, then it developed to now where my moments that I ""talk to myself"" are almost at a constant basis. 

When i talk to myself, I don't feel alone. I can imagine the scenario in which I am speaking, to a great detail. Once a idea is put into my mind, I feel like I am engaged in a dialogue with another person, that person giving me responses to continue talking to him/her/it. To best describe him/her/it in simple terms, it is a shapeshifter that plugs these ideas into my mind and paints a scene for me to discuss and give my personal philosophy about the topic. I cannot see nor hear him, yet I know he is talking to me and giving me these responses (or at least it seems like he is). These topics can range from platos theory of forms and existentialism, to the fat horse I thought I saw on my bike ride home. These conversations feel like they do not end until about half an hour before i go to sleep, and begin about 4-5 minutes after waking up in the morning. 

The worst (or from my perspective best) part about this thing that he is really smart. It seems that this ""fantasy land"" i enter when talking to him is not powerful enough for it to overlay with reality. What he does is he creates the fantasy land so well he makes it very tempting to stay for just a bit longer. It seems to get harder and harder to ignore the temptations of this fantasy land since it is a lot better than what the real world has offered me so far.  


My Thoughts: In my attempts to figure this issue out, I feel like the only reasonable explanation is mild schizophrenia. Yet if it that was true, then what does not make sense is that I do not experience the delusions (I don't believe that the Russians are after me, nor are aliens coming to probe me, I don't have imaginary friends that play with me. It is just the shapeshifter) since i cannot see nor hear them. So if that were the case and I was not schizophrenic, then it would not make sense that i have such easy access to the blissful and almost imaginary fantasy land. I know (or at least feel like ) it does not exist, yet it invades my day to day life.  


Conclusion: I don't know that is why I am here now to ask. Is this something that everyone experiences throughout their lives or is this something else?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; Something that i cannot see or hear is making a world for me to try to leave reality and I don't know if it is schizophrenia or not.

Zero friends, stay in the house 24/7 except to buy food and go to the Vets Center for employment help.  Am convinced now, that I have PTSD -- only a small bit from the war and military,  but nearly all from that marriage.

19,"I know a friend in this case his name is bob. So basically, i have known him for years and bob always makes dark jokes/statements. He has no friends (except me) been all his life bullied and always weird. Before i knew him he had long ass-hair stayed in his room all day in the dark no social life whats so ever and cannot communicate well with other (99% women).  He stated he always thinks about suicide and  never seeks help even tho many of us have tried but he wont and will not help himself.

Well recently during 2-3 years he has been really gone beyond weird. He has it in his mind that he is very ugly and i keep telling him he isn't (he actually isnt) its got to the point that he looks at videos to re-define his jaw.   But its got the point that he stares at the mirror for 2 hours straight and waking his mum up to ask why hes ugly (crying sometimes) at 4am after midnight!!! 

Bob is always with me Everyday (allday) and he  causes fights between my friends and me for gossip and over pointless shit. (He does not to this when everyone is not together behind my back) 

Now he think every girl that looks at him for 1 SEC fancies him and has fantasies of them being a couple. Here is the edgy bit. He has started to stalk them on social media for ages. And bob tells his mum that the girl is his girlfriend, which he meets up with and goes on dates and tells his mum about arguments they had but bob HAS NEVER MET HER or SPOKE TO and this went on for months. He thought a girl was in love with him because she said thank you after holding the door open for him. He told his about her aswel and they ""relationship""

After midnight he wakes up and walkes in his room in circles for a while. He goes for mysterious walks outside at 3 am
At family gathering he never really speaks but always in his head thinking about things and be's motionless.
His eyes looks evil and about to pop out.

So just yesterday he attacked my friend and his ex close friend. because they had a falling out a few months ago and do not speak to each other so he just ignores bob and talks to me. Bob says he attacked him because he smirks at him and trying to provoke him and plays mind games. But i do not see what he thinks.

So after  bob attacked him his eyes went wide and crazy. His voice went really FUCKED. and his hand motions were like something off a horror movie. He were saying stuff like ""you ugly fucker"" ""you look gay"" a million times rapidly. And then my friends says ""is it because you cant get girls and he storms out and has a breakdown and goes completely crazy until i took him home. He smashed the mirrow (broke his knuckles)  and punched walls screaming ""i want to kill them all"" so we calmed him down talked about and next day he comes to my house like Hes a Gangster and nothing happened and REALLY REALLY HAPPY.
 
Please i dont know whats wrong.
I dont know what to do or think. I tried a lot to help but he acts like nothings wrong despite bob telling me his problems. This has affected me too. I have lost  friends (they will talk unless i ditch him but im not going to do.)  And other things.

21,"Hey there.

I’m currently studying abroad in Australia, and when I came here I started to understand the importance of mental health.

My hometown’s outlook (some Arab country) on mental health is somewhat tarnished.

As a child I was molested twice (no penetration) on 2 separate occasions by cousins who were 5-6 years older than me. I always had this at the back of my head, but as I grew older I started to think maybe my fear of everything stems from that. 

I’m constantly scared of little things like approaching people, hearing a police siren, I’m afraid of any authority figures, I find it hard to order things at a restaurant or cafe without feeling nervous. I drink before going to my university lectures because if I don’t I feel like I can’t attend.

I have many friends, some closer than others, and I’m really outgoing when I feel like it. Sometimes I’d hang out with friends for 2 hours, feel good and then suddenly become self-aware around them and find it hard to focus on what they’re saying (because I’m thinking of other things like “do they think I look weird if I sit like that?”), or to look directly in their eye when it was perfectly normal to do so. I don’t know. 

I am not a coward, I have ambitions and a positive outlook on life. I believe I’m destined for success. I just don’t know why I fear so many things. I fear people with tattoos, bigger people, younger people, older people, loud people, people who don’t smile. The list goes on and on and on. I’m constantly thinking of things and sometimes it’s hard to shut off my brain. 

I just want to know why I’m like this, maybe an insight on what it is that I have. I’m tired of being afraid. It wears me out and I overthink things. 

I tried meditation and it’s not for me. I can’t focus either way with or without it. I haven’t seen a psychologist either because I feel like they’re going to ask me embarrassing questions. I can’t even look at other strangers sometimes because I think I’ll offend them in some way. 

I can go on and on but I won’t in hopes of people not being discouraged to not read all this. So if you’re interested in knowing more, or to help, please reply and I will respond.",25Aug2018,1,

This was on Monday, and I'll see him this Wednesday. I haven't managed to write anything yet. I have no idea where to start. Has anyone done anything like this before? It's making me feel very anxious.",25Aug2018,5,
23,"I know that it is standard practice when seeing a therapist for them to tell you the conditions under which they are obligated to contact the authorities and violate confidentiality. I was thinking though, that really those conditions aren't the real boundary for that. I imagine that it would be possible, at least for some therapists, for someone to not necessarily meet those conditions but for other reasons the therapist would think it necessary to report them to the authorities. And it might go the other way, that someone might meet those mandatory reporting standards but because of the exact situation the therapist may not report based on their own person feelings.

And because of this, I was thinking about people who know that there is something wrong with them and they know that they should go see a professional about it, but either don't or if they do they purposefully censor themselves because as much as they want help, they really don't want to lose their autonomy if they get committed or arrested. I think this applies in particular to those who may be on the path to commit acts of violence or have already committed acts of violence, either against themselves or others, and also mostly to those that are more or less consistently lucid and self-aware.

I tried to think of what recourse a person in that position would have, but was unable to find a good solution. For someone who finds themselves in a situation where they need help and know they need help, but also know that if they seek help fully and don't self-censor then they will be committed or possibly arrested for their actions and lose their autonomy, what options do they have?

And losing autonomy is only one reason to self-censor. Maybe they are trying to keep their problems a secret from other people (family, friends, work, etc.) and if they are committed then their issues would be revealed and they could lose their job (even in places where you shouldn't be able to be fired for that sort of thing).",25Aug2018,1,

26,"I’m now a 20 year old female but had a childhood filled with my dad constantly yelling at my siblings and me. Just to be clear, when I say yelling, I mean aggressive, as-loud-as-you-can-possibly-shout kind of yelling. He never psychically harmed us, but his yelling was always terrifying as a kid. 

I remember he would yell about the most trivial things too, like the time I drank soda after brushing my teeth, or not getting a good enough grade on a quiz, etc. He usually came home just yelling that the house was a mess. One particularly bad memory was a few years back when my sister said he accidentally shrunk her clothes in the dryer. He came into the room screaming at the both of us. After he left, my sister locked the door, but he came back threatening to break down the door if we didn’t unlock it. After my sister unlocked it, we both cowered holding each other on her bed (my sister was also having a panic attack during this) while he yelled at us some more.

I always burst into tears whenever he did this, to which he’d yell to “knock it off” or “stop the water works”. Any attempt to talk to him would only be met with him yelling even louder. Usually after some time has passed after he yelled, he would say stuff along the lines of “sorry I yelled, I just care about you” and claim that we hate him so we were the ones having to cheer him up.

My dad rarely yells at me or my siblings now, but on the few days that he does, I revert to the sobbing little girl who just shuts her eyes as tight as possible and hopes that he’ll stop soon.

Whenever I even think of any memories of him yelling from my childhood, I immediately burst into tears and shake uncontrollably until I can get myself to calm down. I’m about as sensitive as any other average joe but just the thought of him yelling absolutely terrifies me to no end.  I love my dad, but would this kind of behavior be considered abusive? Or am I just looking too deeply into it? For anyone else with similar experience, how do you cope?",25Aug2018,27,
27,"Over the last couple months, I get this recurring kind of ""spider sense"" thing that happens, where it's like I can mentally ""feel"" my immediates neighbors (a one house proximity all around me), so I know where they are in the houses and what they're doing.  To be clear I'm not trying to say I have a super power, this is just a sensation I know (once it's over) is false.  I've also been having this thing where I think the neighbors I can sense can also sense me, which when it's happening makes me paranoid about showering (in case they decide to watch or do a B&amp;E while I'm showering), going to the bathroom, or let's say if I had masturbation planned in the next five minutes of my life.  In all these cases I just sit down somewhere in the house instead and wait for it to pass.

I also don't think this is occurring for no reason.  It may be a stress response to two things.  I have chronic back pain which keeps getting worse, I know this puts the brain under more stress (it's gotten so bad in the past it felt like it was so much for my brain to respond to that it ""fried a circuit"" so to speak).  Also a few months before this happened I've had a couple neighbors who will just meanmug me whenever I'm about on the property or coming home.  When I've said hello or wave, they immediately turn their backs on me, if I just stare back or do nothing they keep looking until I'm out of sight because I've left or gone inside.  I'm on disability and though they can't know that 100% I'm aware of the social stigma and I've been fearful ever since getting on it, so I'm wondering if all this + back pain always getting worse is resulting in the weird ""out of body with neighbors"" sensation or what.

I'll also sometimes think sound is travelling much further than can be possible.  ie. when taking the cap off a pen I will assume the whole neighbirhood hears.  Or if I make a noise in my truck while leaving, the whole neighborhood hears.",25Aug2018,1,

31,"Hi everyone. I'm a new user here. I need some help trying to understand some things my new boyfriend said to me last night that have me kind of confused and concerned..

So a bit of background about him, he's 28 years old, he doesn't drink or do other drugs as he has addictions, but he does use psychedelic mushrooms on a regular basis (at least once a month) and I think that the mushrooms might be the cause of or possibly aggrevating factor to this..

So we were talking and I asked him ""why are you so mad at yourself all the time?"" Because I can always sense he's mad at himself... Well he kept saying over and over that he can't tell me... Finally I convinced him and this is what he told me..

He says he existed before the universe existed, and he kept saying he ""had nothing to do, so he had to do everything"". I asked what he meant by that, if that meant he'd given birth for example, and he said ""yes"".

He told me he created the universe and that he will destroy it, and the reason he is so mad at himself is because he feels bad about the things that humans to do each other, hurting each other, killing eachother. He somehow feels like he's responsible for that. He also told me that he has traveled through time...

So after listen to all this, and trying to get to the root of what he was getting at...I asked him when did this all start? He said for his whole life he's known there was something different with him, and then I asked him ""do you remember the moment you created the universe?"" He told me yes, he remembers that. But then he went on to describe a night when he was on mushrooms and ""saw all this"", not the moment the universe was created.I asked him if he thought any of this had a correlation with the mushrooms, and he said ""it's plausible""..

I don't know if I should be concerned, i think he genuinely believes what he told me...I don't know what I should do? He says ""he's not hurting anyone"" so it's not really a concern, but I'm a bit concerned fort myself. He had some pretty weird looks in his eyes last night, and I'm not sure what to think.. I should add he was NOT in mushrooms during the conversation and it has been about a month since he did them last.",25Aug2018,36,

35,"  I'm sort of at this point in life where I truthfully don't know how to improve my mental health circumstances. I've tried meditation, medication, being grateful and talking to somebody about my problems, but for some reason I can't get myself to accept past events, the fact that they have indeed hurt me, causing me to constantly feel emotions from the past and be inside of my head 24/7. Just for a quick backstory, I was addicted to porn for roughly four years and quit towards the end of high school. I was somewhat bullied, had friends, but I was always a very sensitive kid and never developed a very positive mindset because I just always focused on the negative. I had and still have a non-existent self-esteem, confidence and positive outlook on life. Basically, after I quit my porn addiction, I just starting feeling all of these emotions, very weird thoughts about whether I'm gay, and I took people's criticisms about me to heart, to a point where their rude comments made me feel really bad, causing my depression, and I constantly think about these people in my head every second. It sucks. Like I said, I don't know what to do. Someone explained to me that I created this mental hell. I realize that. I basically made nothing into something. But, kind redditors, I don't want to give up. I have a loving family, close friends at college who would never abandon me, and I know that cognitively speaking, I am a smart a kid. But, it just hurts me to know that I have all of this potential and am throwing it when dealing with these thoughts. I just want to move forward but don't know how to. When I feel less anxious but still think about my bullies 24/7, people really enjoy being around me, and I know that I have a very good personality. I try to be as kind as I can to people and use humor that doesn't put down anyone, but my social anxiety has just made me extremely awkward, and I dislike it. I just want to socialize and do what everyone else is doing, but I struggle to. And, well, it hurts :'(",25Aug2018,2,
36,"I know this isn't a dating advice subreddit, but I feel I'll be better understood here since we both suffer from mental illnesses and it's affecting our relationship.

I'm 26, she's 29. We both suffer from depression. I've met her at a rehab social group 6 weeks ago. We clicked because we're the only introverts there. She barely leaves the house (she said she can't find reasons to), so I try to fill that void. We're not officially dating. I never asked her out *on a date*, but I did ask her out to hang out a few times, we go on walks together, went to an art festival together, we always take the bus together after the social group. I'm inviting her over to cook together and she's excited for that (said she's excited to be my sous chef). I *think* she likes me (because she doesn't seem to mind putting herself in one-on-one situations with me), but I don't have a confirmation. We hug, and I can feel intimacy in them. We held hands but she never initiated it herself. Nothing beyond that.

I want to confess and tell her my feelings. I wrote it down so it'll be easier for me to recite when the moment comes, and hmm, I thought of posting it for validation, because of I'm scared of making a mistake. The backstory behind it is; In the social group we ask everyone how our week's been, and during my turn I broke because I spoke about farewells (as my friend is leaving the country), it made me realize how alone I am, I entered a depersonalization state where I couldn't feel anything due to so much pain. I didn't even realize it till the end of the night when she hugged me, I was confused, like something was missing, so I hugged her again, then I realized I can't feel anything. I was depressed throughout the night and the next day. Then sent me a message, and it warmed my heart. 

&gt;I wanted to talk to you about something. It's about last week. Speaking in the circle last week about farewells really upset me as you remember, I felt so much pain that my body disconnected my feelings so I wouldn't feel any more pain. I couldn't feel any emotions.

&gt;The next day I finally understood why. It's because farewells reminded me of what the world has taken away from me. My father is gone, my mother is gone, and with that came depression, which drove away my family like a plague, and pushed away any friends I've had.

&gt;But then I received your whatsapp message, and you wished me a good weekend, and sent me that random quiz, even though you were busy. It warmed my heart.

&gt;Then I remembered something. I remembered the first time we had a walk together, and you told me the words ""Now you won't have to be alone, because you have me.""

&gt;I held back saying this. I wanted to tell you, at that moment, that you are the sweetest person that I've ever known.

&gt;I want you to know that every time I make you smile, it makes me feel like I'm worth something in this world.

&gt;And I want to keep making you happy.

&gt;I want you to invite me to more walks together.

&gt;And I want to keep dragging you out of the house wether you like it or not, because I know you need it.

&gt;I want us to keep cooking together.

&gt;I want us to keep going to activities and festivals together.

&gt;Heck, even random walks satisfy me, because I feel alive just talking to you.

&gt;I think of you more than a friend, and I want us to be more than that. What do you think about me?

We both are getting professional help, I don't intend to depend on her, I believe our relationship is beneficial for both of our healths, but I can't help and feel it sounds too dependent/needy? I guess it's because I have that tendency, due to trauma. Yeah I'm already feeling anxiety over this. I don't want to lose her. All in all, I just want her to know that I enjoy our times spent together and I want more of it, and I want to know what she feels about it and about me. ",25Aug2018,1,
37,"Hi, 
I’m 16 and for many years (as long as I can remember really) I have had persistent suicidal thoughts. 

I also don’t really feel any emotions, except for occasional sadness, anger or disappointment which I recently realised isn’t normal. 

I have no motivation, at all. I can sleep for 12 hours and still feel exhausted all day, every day, except my exhaustion is like mental (idk if that makes sense?) and I’n just absolutely dead without having physical signs of tiredness. For example I’m into my 6th week off for summer and I’ve only left the house twice, I have done nothing but sit around and I am still not up for doing anything :( 

I previously had some weird eating habits, which are now mostly gone but if I look at myself in the mirror after eating I can see that my legs have got fatter, which I mentioned to my mum who told me to stop being stupid. 

I feel the need to check to see if my hair looks bad or if I’m too spotty allllll the time, especially at school, I have a compact mirror in all my uniform pockets so I can always check if I look stupid. I usually cry before I go out somewhere because I look so disgusting, that’s if I don’t cancel because I look so bad. Whenever I’m outside the house I feel like everybody’s staring at me all the time. 

Recently I watched a documentary on Body Dysmorphia which made me wonder if I have it because the people seemed to act and feel the exact same way as me. I also found out 3 of my close friends are in therapy for mental health problems, which shocked me since they seem pretty happy (always going out, nice supportive family, hobbies, good grades, etc) when I can’t do any of that and no one seems to care? 

So I went to the doctor and told him all of the above, he told me that I’m just a hormonal girl and gave me a website to look at which essentially said ‘cheer up’. I’m feeling worse than ever and don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m just faking everything? Is he wrong?

Recently I feel like it’s gotten a lot worse and I’ve actually stopped caring as much as I used to about others. This isn’t something I do on purpose and I really hate it. I feel like an alien and like I can’t relate to others and therefore care about them. I find it hard to talk to people about things that aren’t about work or my interests and I know that they feel the same (my ex’s dad said he found it very hard to keep a conversation going with me, this was after +2 years of knowing him). I’m very forgetful when people tell me about the things they’re doing or what’s happened to them. For example one of by best friends mentioned the time when she went to South America and I had to think about it for a good minute or so before I remembered that she actually went. Before that I had absolutely no recollection whatsoever. Then another one of my friends had two relatives pass away recently. She mentioned (I think) visiting one of them. This was before they passed away. She then still went to said place to visit said person and I mentioned this to someone else, who went “but didn’t their relative pass away recently?”. I feel like I’m a horrible friend and a selfish person but I don’t know how to emotionally connect to others. Like I said I never used to be great at it but I just put it down to being introverted or shy and awkward. Now it’s gotten to the point where I’m embarrassed because I can’t remember major life events that have happened to my friends and i feel like a shitty person because of it. Three random people in the past 3 weeks or so that I have never met before have told me that I’m a quiet person without me prompting them to say so. 
I also go really quiet when I’m stressed out and go blank and I’m aware I’m acting antisocial which makes me even more stressed and it’s a vicious cycle. I’ve also neglected a relationship I was in up until recently and found it hard to care about the person I was with when they were going through a really rough time. I find it hard to act emotional and like I care and it got very draining. Why am I so selfish and unaware of the outside world and what my friends are going through, and why don’t I care???

I was apprehensive about moving back home after living with roommates or in my own place for so long, but I could hardly afford my rent while I was working 40+ hour weeks. Caregiving is my only real marketable skill, and so when my parents offered to let me move back home while I finish up, I accepted, even against my better judgment. 

The problem I’ve been having is that my parents, and my mother in particular, who cannot respect personal boundaries. She’s read through my journals which, yeah they were from middle school, but they still weren’t for her eyes. She’s followed me and accused me of lying when I’ve gone out to meet with someone. When I confronted her about this, and told her it made me uncomfortable because what I do out of the house is none of her business so long as I’m in by midnight. Her reply was to laugh and say “I’m sorry, but everything about you is my business”. 

Eventually my dad and sister both talked to her,  but all the changed is now she asks, “will it make you made if I ask ____” before she starts in and that alone causes my anxiety to shoot up, but then when I say no she gets upset and says how I’m sneaking around and how she doesn’t like when I’m “like this”. 

I’ve just reached the point where all I say is, “I’m going out, and I will be home by midnight as per the rule.” I don’t want her to know that I’m actually getting out and going on dates and having fun, because all she’ll do is keep asking questions about it and prying.

42,"(REPOST) I just created a reddit account yesterday for this reason as I have some legitimate, serious questions I want to discuss in public as it's rather hard to do it in real life. Recently I have been struggling with resurfaced bad memories. Now that I'm older, I'm able to remember that my first ""best friend"" sexually abused me for her own advantages- we were both kids so I realize the term sexual abuse isn't appropriate, but I don't know how else to describe it, it was just continuos non-consenting sexual, sort of kinky activities. Thinking about this fucks me up on a regular basis, especially when family member brings it up as a joke. There was a large power imbalance with them being three years older. We gradually grew apart, but another person I befriended who I am still friends with to this day emotionally abused me for ten years. We are very close and I love them to bits, but it's a bit of a weird relationship ever since I covered this with my therapist. I've put a lot of research into this, talked to my therapist, etc. I'm fairly certain it was this. I'm sorry if it sounds overdramatic, but I'm not sure how else to describe it. The worst of this was when they actively encouraged and befriended my childhood bully. They also did a lot of fucked up physical things to me (like make me pick up literal dog shit, eat grass, try to make me cry, and tie me to fences).

​

So essentially what I've been questioning is whether or not these are the causes of my depression and anxiety, and whether or not this is childhood trauma. I also wonder if it's the reason I have trouble standing up to people, being submissive, and often being a target to pick on. It all sounds fairly mild to me and doesn't really align with the definition of childhood trauma, so I've had this sort of questioning in my head whether it is or not.

43,"Hey reddit,

in the near future, I would like to change jobs but I'm afraid of the whole process. I'm afraid that I won't be able to do the future job properly.

* Sometimes I can't do the simplest tasks at my current job, e.g. to copy a file. It takes me a couple of tries. I stare at the keyboard and have to press CTRL + C couple of times to make sure I indeed copied the file.
* I've noticed when I drag the cursor over the screen I sometimes drag it very slowly and really need to focus to click ""the right way"".
* When one of my coworkers is around I perform a task normally but once they are gone I need to check it if I did it right (even things like closing a box).
* I tend to check e-mails I write multiple times for spelling mistakes, etc.
* I can't concentrate while others are talking.

When you take all of this into consideration I manage to do less than the others and with that comes the feeling of incompetence and anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

And of course there is double checking of everything like whether the lights are turned off, the door is locked, etc. Even though I can clearly see the lights are turned off I turn them on and off again. When locking the door I need to be very focused. I have to check it three times (1, 2, 3, pause 1, 2, 3, pause 1, 2, 3) only after this ritual I can leave. It gets even worse when I feel under pressure (like when I'm running late).

Recently I've started driving a car and I have a problem with leaving the car. I can clearly see that the lights are turned off, the handbrake is on, the shifter is in the reverse but I still have the urge to check it \[the lights are off (3x), the lights are off (3x), the lights are off (3x)\] or perform the task multiple times \[active and deactivate the handbrake (3x) and finally active it\].

45,"Me, my sister, and my cousin were riding an elevator up to the third floor of a hotel. My sister told my cousin about a time from the last hotel we were in where, although I clicked the floor number in the elevator, we didn’t move. My sister clicked it, and up we went. My cousin looked at me and asked, “your class rank was what again?” In context, I previously told her that I finished 26th in my class out of 400 students and how I challenged my younger brother to get a higher rank. I was proud of it, to say the least. But back in the elevator, I didn’t respond. She said, “I guess it’ll be easy to get in the top 25 of your class...” I’ve been in a depressed state since then, and it’s bad enough that my depression is clinical.

46,"I don't mean free online psychiatry - I mean having appointments with a ""real"" psychiatrist remotely. I have very severe trust issues and some paranoia and I don't think I can overcome these things. I took a huge step forward this year by seeing both a psychologist and a psychiatrist for the first time, but neither one is working. The psychologist I saw sporadically and now we're on a hiatus of sorts because the situation was too uncomfortable and I felt too threatened. The same thing is happening with the psychiatrist, who I've seen twice now.

I was almost speechless whenever I was around him and I loved to look at his face. I told him I thought he was beautiful a while ago and were actually friends now but before I’d managed to spit it out I was a bumbling idiot. It wasn’t even sexual attraction, I just thought he was so beautiful. Like one of Caravaggios painting. 

I don’t know if it’s some weird coping mechanism I’ve developed. Part of me really loves it because it’s someways a nice thing to enjoy beautiful things. Im studying fine art and i plan to do music long term some it makes sense but it’s not practical and I can never snap out of it. ",25Aug2018,1,

49,"Hi.

I'll be starting university this fall, and I have been living with major depression for all of my teenage and adult life. I will also be living at home, a source of stress and anxiety for me, but I have no control over that. I have no access to mental health services (a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist), and have been warned by current students about the risk of approaching campus mental health services (non-confidentiality, unprofessionalism, and other problems with the system). Knowing that university is a very stressful time, especially as a freshman, what coping methods can I incorporate into my daily life to help me lead a normal university life and to try to prevent my mental health situation from affecting my studies?

53,"Deep down inside. I consider myself a perfectionist. But I am not. I often find myself starting over from scratch, relationships, projects, goals or tasks. I will put hours, hundreds of hours, thousands of hours into doing something, anything. And the second I hit my first bump in the road I evaluate my situation, and ask myself. Should I start from scratch? And almost 100% of the time I do. But I almost never reach the point where I once was. Its so bad that I have had to move because of it. I have lived in 3 different states and am about to move to another state because I feel like I have ruined that place for me. I have quit jobs because of petty issues, where I have been perfectly happy working for years. I have gotten rid of all my belongings and bought brand new everything. The first time I left my first state, I left with a backpack, I got some more stuff in the 2nd state, then the 3rd state I got an amazing job and furnished and entire house. Now, I am moving again, once again purging everything I own to a few suitcases. I have spend thousand of dollars buying something I already own in another state or used to own. But I pretend like those belongings are no longer mine. I cannot finish anything. I cannot be happy with anything. The most stable thing in my life is my current girlfriend of 2.5 years and my actions are hurting us. I am uprooting her. I am taking her away from her family because she loves me so much and will do anything for me, but I CANNOT be here any more. I tried for a month and there is something inside killing me. But I have no idea what it is. I feel trapped. But my logical part of me knows that's not the case. I stress out so much. I get intense stomach pains. Where I will roll around in bed for a full day in agony. Unable to sit, stand and lay down comfortably. My heart goes through periods of palpitations. I lay in bed at night unable to sleep because a thousand things are going through my head. And half of them are things that I have done that I look back and think are bad. And the other half is me planning on how I can escape everything. I am 27 years old, and I have been like this since I was probably 14. And it has gotten so much worse since I was 17. It was so bad that I met someone online, told them my situation and they offered a place for me to stay. And I moved in with them. I was 24 years old, 1500 miles away from my family in a strangers house. Hating every second of it figuring out how I was going to escape again. I stopped talking to all of my family. I have brothers and sisters who try to get in contact with me and I just cant. I cant bring myself to have a social relationship with them. I have pretty much blacklisted my parents from every aspect of myself. I think this is my biggest issue in my life. I can't do... anything. There's always a tense feeling in my chest. Almost like butterflies. Every day.

I never considered it to be a mental issue. But... maybe it is. I do hear voices. And when I say that out loud it makes me cringe. Because I know how that is viewed. And I am not like that.

Only to feel dumb when I realized that the radio isnt even on. I hear people in my living room arguing while I lay in bed and try to sleep. I used to get up and check to see if anyone had broke into my house. But after several dozens of times of getting up to check. I figured that no one would break into my house and be loud and argue in my living room while I am home. But I am getting off topic and that is irrelevant I think to my situation. I've just been toughing it out. Starting over. And over. And over. It probably doesn't help that before the age of 14 my family excluding my father used to couch surf off the kindness of strangers.

I was isolated as a child and grew up with only one or two close friends; who I saw intermittently. I had severe social anxiety which prevented me from being sociable throughout my life so I learnt to enjoy loneliness. Now things have changed, I’m becoming more social and cannot stand time alone. An hour or two is fine but any more time than that and I start to feel increasingly more hopeless. It’s driving me insane, I cannot sleep without company (I’ve always had insomnia but this is very different), I don’t want to do anything other than cry. 

Is this normal at this stage of my life? 

Do you think there could be anything I’m overlooking that could be causing this anguish?  

I’m very aware I suffer from depression, anxiety and ptsd but fortunately I have these issues pretty well looked after (60% of the time). I’m not afraid to look myself in the face and admit my faults, I treat myself with love mostly and I don’t fear myself in any way that would impact my alone time. 

I’ve recently (1 month) been in the company of new friends, who I enjoy seeing, I’ve spent every day of the last week with them and its been great. I don’t seek out their company to avoid dealing with my issues - I’m pretty self aware and enjoy tackling my personal issues head on, I talk to my friends about what irks me and I talk to myself about it too so I don’t think I’m reaching out to company for any reason other than to have company. This still isn’t enough though! 

My behaviour in my youth was unusual and probably unhealthy and maybe thats why I’m seeing this as more of an issue than it is. I think I just need some perspective to help me gather my thoughts so I can understand the nuances of my adult personality better.

This other person controls the body 99% of the time, as they're the same gender as the biological sex of the body. I usually just watch and observe, but occasionally I interact with people online.

Anyways, we've had struggles with depression and anxiety our entire lives, going through therapists and medication throughout the years with no real success. We've been hospitalized 2 times in the past for suicide attempts and I feel like were bound for another trip fairly soon. 

I've been ok for the most part, but the one controlling the body has been getting more and more unstable as the years go by. He seems intent on either killing himself or killing everyone around him at some point, which is concerning to me. I don't particularly care what he chooses, but it will have negative impacts on both of us in the future.

61,"Hey, I’m a 23 year old guy from eastern Europe. For the last 7 years I have been struggling with mental issues and I really want to type my story out and maybe talk about it with someone that isn’t involved in my life.

When I was 16 I was in high school and while people around me started getting to know themselves and made friends I was in a tricky situation. I had a handful of people that I’d occasionally hang out with, one of them was struggling with some intense mental issues. I showed her interest and she praised me higher than I’d ever been praised. We got into a relationship that was bad for me. She’d cut herself if she felt like she didn’t get enough attention or affection, she’d threaten suicide causing me to bike there (45 minute ride) before I found out nothing was wrong. That kind of stuff. That relation burned me out and together with the feeling of not having any real friends made me look for professional help. Because I fell under youth care I had to go to a specialized center. I had a full day of tests (IQ, EQ, social interaction simulations, memory, etc.) and a few interviews before the conclusion came that they would have to diagnose me with Dysthymia. Some interpersonal sessions, three different psychiatrists and half a year of antidepressants (Sertraline) later I was out of the youth care and had to puzzle together how I’d continue.

I stopped with the antidepressants and went to university. Made some friends, joined a fraternity and felt like I belonged. Until I started drinking more and more. Drinking was the culture inside the fraternity, you really couldn’t be seen without something alcoholic in your hand or people would get you something. If you refused you better have a good reason (Just saying ‘I don’t want to’ would result in you getting a drink anyway). It spread, I started drinking after work. In the next 5 years I had more than 10 intense blackouts, jumped in front of a bus, had to be bailed out of jail by my parents, kissed and fucked people that I don’t even remember meeting and thoroughly embarrassed myself. I cheated on my (now ex) girlfriend and only found out by the stories of people that had seen me, I couldn’t remember any of it. Many of my hangovers resulted in a bigger feeling of shame than I could handle and I would cut myself to lessen the frustration in my body.

Now I am again in professional care. I’m on different antidepressants (Vortioxetine). They think my problems aren’t from depression or dysthymia. They think it might be a personality disorder like Borderline. 

I don’t feel like my life is going to get any better, I have no long term goals or aspirations. No reason to get out of bed. It’s hard to find a reason to do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I have gone through a good amount of trauma and grief, which I'm not going to get into today in great detail, throughout my life. I have attempted suicide at the age of 15 and was diagnosed with depression and ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) after being bullied through my whole schooling. After have my sister attempt, and my mom being diagnosed with Stage IV Cancer all within 3 years of my own suicide attempt, I tried finding peace and happiness, but came up short and filled with anger and resentment towards those who tried to help me.

I've run away from problems and tried to make sense of this world that is not yet ready for people on the spectrum. I have moved across the country, changed meds countless times, changed healthcare providers, changed states, and have even moved several times in the last 2 years trying to find something in this world that will take away this horrible pain in my soul. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just have got out of the hospital this week on the Behavioral health unit and was very angry at people who providing mental health treatment. I felt that it was everyone's fault and also my own. I had a conversation with my mother the day after and was trying to make sense of basically my whole life and why I feel like such a failure. I wanted answers, yet she had none. The only thing she had for me in this moment was to say that if I did not forgive myself and everyone in my past and people who are trying to help me now, it will eat me up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I reflected out loud an hour or two later and said how much I missed my old therapist and my old teachers. I said how much I thought they cared, yet couldn't help me. It then dawned upon me that almost everyone in my life, such as past service providers, teachers, friends, therapist, etc. didn't have the answers, but all cared about me and tried to help me the best they could to reach those answers by myself.

I have a friend who claims to have a lot of different mental problems. They also put the blame of every single problem they face onto these mental problems. If they can't sleep, it's cause they have insomnia. If they can't focus, it's cause they have OCD. If they can't go out, it's because their anxiety is causing their muscles to hurt. If they can't show up to school, it's because they have PTSD. I'm not even sure how many mental problems they claim to have but it doesn't really matter. I genuinely believe that something is wrong, because hat's no normal behaviour. I really want to help this person, but when I try to bring up ways to improve their situation, they always shut my suggestions because I just don't understand their situation.

Although I know that most people are not out to get me, I do feel that certain people that I have not told about my condition can sense my state of mind, my psychosis, my paranoia, and they try to have their way with me.

For example, a teenager at the park was telling me that they were stealing my ball, but I told him that you're joking because I have my ball in my hands, the teen kept screaming and trying to convince me.

Another example, sometimes people would try to convince me that it was me who did their mistakes. They may break something or spill juice on the floor, and then say that it was me. This is something that did happened often to me when I was a child in elementary and I did take the blame.

Well, now I am beginning to get worry, because I feel like my closest friend from childhood is trying to control me. He knows about my condition and knows that I am currently not taking medication.

The part that scares me is when he shows at my house unexpectedly and ask me to go along with him, to keep him compannied and hang out, because he is on bad terms with his girlfriend.

Two days ago, he came to pick me up, unexpectedly. I told him give me time to shower and eat. He bangs on my widow to hurry up because he wants to go to his home to change and then go see the sunset at the park. So I rushed and take my food to go.
