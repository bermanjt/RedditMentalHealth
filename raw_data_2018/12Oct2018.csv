0,My brother has suffered from it ever since Kindergarten. He has been going to in school therapy all the way through Elementary. He still hasn't been able to talk in Middle School. My parents are constantly frustrated with him especially since his grades have been dropping due to his Selective Mutism. I'm scared he might soon suffer from Depression also due to all the pressure from his parents and school. How he be treated?,12Oct2018,1
1,"Just need to ask for advice as I've been so lost my whole life and need direction. Ever since I was very young, I would forget things that most people easily remember ex: what I did an hour ago, whether or not I took a school test, etc. Everyone thought I was a pothead as I would also have an extremely low attention span. However, I am not stupid and often figured things out based on logic ( I have pancakes so we must've gone to Ihop, etc). On school tests I would do fine or above average as I knew the information was important and made this effort to remember it. However, I was often not able to pay attention long enough for the test.

Anyways, I tried pot last year and everyone was like WTF? That's his first time? So now people just assume  I'm stupid even though i have done fairly well in AP classes. Often I feel incredibly great or incredibly horrible, but my social tenancies seem to change multiple times everyday. Sometimes I'll be loud and bubbly, and others I'll be extremely quiet and shy. I easily forget social occurances, especially embarrassing ones but sometimes the memories suddenly are there. Often, people ask me what drugs I have taken even after I was sober several days. A teacher even recently asked me what drug i was on while I was perfectly sober. Often, people think I have done crack even though I have never even seen that drug and wouldn't mess with it. Other times, people think I have down syndrome or autism. Last year, someone in my math class commented that there was probably an ounce of shrooms in my backpack before I had even tried them.
 Everyone seems to think I'm completely different. It makes me so depressed that i have begun to actually smoke a lot of pot to cope. I have not been to a therapist and cant really afford one. Extremely confused as to what is wrong with me and what I can do.

Sometimes I decide to confront people about what I think they said: ""bro why you talking shit about me?wanna fight?"". But they often just deny it and leave me confused and wondering what really happened. If I'm more specific:""Bro the only one with autism here is you"" then I could've made a mistake that he did not really say that and confuse myself further. Recently, I've tried to just let people say whatever but it drives me NUTS when I'm fairly confident they really said it or did it.

I took the ACT recently and got a score of 34/36 on the first section (English) which I considered my weakest section then zoned out for the rest of the test. I need to be able to focus! However, on shorter school tests I often still do great. (I got a 4 or 5 on all five AP tests i took except US history which I got a 1 (could not remember all the events/people).

Honestly just depressed and stoned and confused. Have few friends as my personality changes so radically and today a sports teammate told me I scare him (was not joking).",12Oct2018,1

3,"I need help for sure, I'm not very used to reddit however I have found it useful for other things.
 I know I need to get a therapist, I was in an institute but left because I felt conflicted about being there even though I would've liked to have been there longer. 
I have health insurance through my family but I feel like it doesn't cover much and it might be time to get on the gvmnt roll. 
I'm 23, and before going to the institute have never gone anywhere for help which is a big issue for me. I only started putting together things that I thought were normal and I'm becoming more aware of myself and everything else every year and it's too much.
I'm also in an abusive relationship that I've been trying to leave for over a year which isn't helping my situation. 
If there's any sites or links anyone can connect me to I'd be really grateful. I think a lot of people don't have a lot of awareness for mental care, which is changing I hope for more, but I definitely don't know where to look. ",12Oct2018,1

6,"Backstory: Met up with my Aunt-in-law tonight after not seeing her for a while. They were having a retiring/going away party for an employee at the company she works for at a bar near the office. Met someone who right away asked me, “What are your passions? What’s your story? What makes you tick?” 

Well, I’m awkward to begin with socializing with a bunch of people I don’t know. I didn’t really know how to answer the question. Or maybe I just didn’t really want to be honest. I just started talking about work, but it’s really not something I’d say I’m extremely passionate about. Didn’t want to dump on them and generally try avoiding over sharing in general. It seems like it’s better that way. 

Jokingly after the fact I said to my AIL “What are my passions? Um, surviving?” When someone asks about my story I think about my father passing away four years ago, the fact that my uncle (yes, the one my aunt was married to) shot himself and his girlfriend 2 years ago, my mom (love her DEARLY, but she isn’t always all there due to the abuse and trauma she has suffered), and my psycho ex-step father who was mentally and physically abusive to my mom and I for nearly 10 years. Just seems like “what are your passions” is a privileged question and “what is your story” is a loaded one. Anyone else feel this way??? ",12Oct2018,1
7,"I have never been depressed, and I don’t know what to do.  The chain reaction began a year ago, when I tore my ACL playing basketball for my junior college.  It was hard to overcome losing a year of basketball, cause I’ve been playing since first grade. But I realized I could make the most of it by getting ahead in school, getting physically stronger, and making some money.

Flash forward one year. I have a good job at a gym that’s been helping me get better, I’m about to begin my season, and I’m very strong.  I end up going to an open gym at my college, and feel good about returning to playing.  30 minutes later, I tear my ACL again.

Pretty much since this happened about a month ago, everything else that’s part of my identity has been lost. I quit my job because it became unbearable, I can’t focus in school and will likely drop out, and I’ve started to hate all my friends.  My attitude is just awful and I keep having these horrible negative thoughts about my life. I’m trying to overcome my issues but I just feel hopeless.

I’m looking for some help on how I can help my girlfriend. She’s diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and has good an bad days, but ever since she’s started her new job, it’s become apparent to me that her bad days are getting worse and lasting longer. 
I’ve been trying to talk to her about getting professional help, but she tells me it won’t help her and that talking about her anxiety and depression only makes it worse, and she already knows what the therapists will say anyways.

11,"Recently, My very close friend and his mom were having an argue, She blamed him for being unhappy and that he ruined her whole life by his existence. She even blames him for not having time to learn english or computer , because whole day she spends thinking about him. (They live separately). She would live a happy life without him (with her younger son). She dislikes his any activity, she cannot say compliment on his success or any positive sentence to motivate him. I know him very well, he is not a saint , but I see that he does not deserve such bullying, for things he has not done. He did upset her 5 years ago (he did some light drugs like weed and club drug), but she never forgets that. He is typical millennial.  


Do you think that woman has some mental issues? What is that disorder called when someone hates her child? I am just trying to figure out if there is any peaceful communication method possible between them to work out?


Some more symtoms, she is extremely tidy, sometimes it even looks funny how she stops to clean her shoes in the middle of rainy street. Worst part is that she asks same question 100 times to be sure. She calls it ""to be organized"". And she is paranoid about everything. 


I am trying to help him, they always argue when they meet, but she never leaves him alone. This last argue they had just hurt so much. He is being more and more demotivated, even asking me questions about suicide lately (with kind of humorous tone). ",12Oct2018,1

Every now and then, I'll get a glimpse of encouragement or appreciation, but that's after working till my hair falls out and the stress breaks me to tears. 

But tonight, I broke into a billion pieces. Why? Because my depression has slowly creeped back into my life. It took a vacation for a while when things were content and okay for a bit, but as soon as there was an opportunity, it settled neatly back into my routine. It has made the past week the hardest I've ever endured. I don't want to shower. I don't want to get up. I don't want to eat or survive. I just want to delete my life. 

So today, as my bosses asked a million and ten things from me, all last minute, all disorganized, all demanding. I lost myself. I started shaking and I couldn't stop. I just couldn't stop. Something that is supposed to benefit my existence has become something that is tearing me apart.

I want to be clear that I’m not trying to blame her, but I definitely have recognized that that’s where I’m at. 

I woke up this morning to go to my out patient program and had a panic attack and starting vomiting non stop. I obviously didn’t go, so I stayed home and tried to sleep. When I tried to get up again, I had to pull my car over in an active roadway to throw up out the window. I tried to go back home but I called my therapist at the program and we both agreed it would be best for me to go back here. While I didn’t feel expressly suicidal, I didn’t feel stable. And I definitely couldn’t guarantee that I wouldn’t feel suicidal. I had to remove her from my emergency contacts and when they asked for a new contact, I realized just how alone I am.

17,"To start, I am hoping someone can suggest specific strategies to improve my negative thinking and help me deal with insecurities. Things like mindfulness will help, but also suggestions to be more proactive to help reinforce my positivity would be welcome. Or book suggestions, that would actually be great! Or anything I can google further. 
I am 25F.
I have two siblings, both younger. By brother is very intelligent but very harsh. He has also become very social lately, always out and about. My sister is quite a bit younger and she takes a lot after my brother. Very intelligent, but she’s young, so she’s very arrogant, often disrespectful, downright rude, also very judgemental of anything that doesn’t fit into her personal beliefs (EVERYTHING she thinks is right, no matter what) and will pick fights over it. 
I am the least social and although I think I’m pretty smart (above average), I’m not as smart as them. Growing up I was also the most social and the smartest. So I’m grieving the loss of my place in the family as the smart/outgoing/talented one, and as pathetic as it is, their success is making me insecure about myself. 
I don’t live with my parents so I don’t see my siblings as often as I used to, but when I do see them, I get the sense they look down on me. I don’t have a degree and have tried various things to find a career, and I think they judge me for being a failure. I also am fairly traditional, I’m not edgy or forward-thinking or innovative or creative, and I think they think I’m dumb because of this. I’m really good at other non-creative things, but society puts such a premium on innovation etc that even my rule-abiding talents are perceived as weakness. I also have depression, which I’m managing with medication, but they see that as weakness (both the illness and medication). Depression has made parts of my life harder than they needed to be, so I’m envious of them when they have opportunities that maybe I had, too, at one point, but I couldn’t pursue due to it. 
What are some ways I can stop comparing myself to them, stop caring what they think, and stop letting their (perceived, whether real or not) judgement affect me? They’re my siblings but really, they’re not very important to my overall life path (in the sense that they don’t get a say in my decisions, my future, my happiness, etc).

19,"A little background. I am now, (although I dont look anywhere near it) twenty-one years old. For as long as I can remember I have struggled deeply with body image issues and disordered eating, as well as anxiety.

My anorexia was bad as an early teenager and I started to recover around age sixteen. I'm learning now that your eating disorder never really goes away-- the ED voice always shows up.  it stays with me, trying to make me feel bad for eating that bowl of pasta. Its wanting to be healthy but crying in a dressing room when you try on clothes and realize you are not as small as you used to be. 

The last couple of years I have felt OK, you know? OK with myself, my body, my face.. okay enough, anyway. 
But things have changed. This is a plea for help. 
Someone tell me whether I'm insane or if there's hope for me. I feel absolutely exhausted from this struggle and this pain I'm in. 

I've realized that I may have Body Dysmorphia and I may have had it for a VERY long time. It's been ruining my life and opportunities for me, possibly making me needlessly anxious about my appearance. But this is the part that makes me want to kill myself. I do not know what they see. What do these people see when they look at me? I feel sick when I look at my reflection. Disgusted. I've cried because I wish I was some beautiful girl. I've thought I were fat, and the next day be unhappy with my body in the complete reverse way... how is this possible?? 

I hate that I have a little bump in my nose and I feel that my nose is HUGE. I have a fat face and so no matter what I try I cannot lose the chubby cheeks which makes me insecure to smile and look like a chipmunk. I've spent over half of my life hating my body but as I'm losing more and more weight I am still seeing a disgusting gremlin in the mirror. 

me some days: i still look chubby. why do I still look chubby. 
the next day: am I getting too thin.... I lost my boobs and my butt.. but I looked awful then, why do I look awful now ? What will it take? 
 these are the thoughts that encompass my head every single day. its driven me absolutely mad and lately an event has triggered me into a place very dark that welcomes and encourages MORE self loathing.

 In August, the guy I was with broke my heart. 
He told me we couldn't be anything anymore because he was confused and didn't know what to do because he still loved his ex. Ouch. I'm downplaying this here, but I just stopped crying about it a few days ago and I am still in the process of moving on. (Obviously, it was very recently.) I'm telling you this to explain what happened... everything was fine and well until I unwillingly hopped aboard the Heartbreak Diet. 
I couldnt eat. anything. Not because I was starving myself purposely, but because I was so hurt and heartbroken for the pain this caused me it was wreaking havoc on me stress wise: too depressed to eat, no appetite, nothing tasted good anyway so why bother, always crying. Y'all know how it goes. I wouldn't wish a broken heart on my worst enemy. 

I began to lose more weight. I stand at 5'3. I have a small frame. Theres a very good chance I've never been overweight and my BDD is just severely awful. Oh goodness, it scares me so much. I've looked in the mirror and felt like a hideous whale. 
No matter how many compliments I get from men or women alike, strangers treating me special or giving me free things, people telling me I'm pretty-- its momentary fleeting flattery and approximately 30 seconds of feeling CUTE... and then it's as if I have forgotten every nice thing ever uttered to me, ever, to assure myself again that I am UGLY, that my body is WRONG, and that my middle name is Inadequacy. 

I dont understand. I'm scared. Mental illness is the only explanation. Well, it just has to be. Nothing in my past or upbringing molded me to feel this way about myself. With the way I feel about my nose, no one ever mocked me for it. No one ever called me fat. Nothing. And this constant battle, this daily struggle combined with the recent events of losing a man that I love to his ex, wowee yippee how can I feel good about myself in any way? Not only am I very depressed but the body dysmorphia is my #1 concern right now. I believe left unchecked I will destroy myself somehow with this. I will starve to death, or something. 
I cant believe I became nice and slim and I still despise the reflection looking back at me. I just want to be pretty like everyone else. Its funny, I rarely ever see a girl and pick apart her flaws. I find most people pretty and attractive in their own ways, why cant I be gracious towards myself? Help me. What do I do? 


If you start with the oldest pictures those two are from a year and a half ago. At 5'3 in those photos I was probably somewhere between 118-122lbs.

Those newest ones are present day. I am now 109lbs.
I cried looking at those pictures because in the older ones I thought I was so fat, but I wish I had those legs now. (until I have them again, and maybe I'll hate em.) 
And I lost fat from my chest, which is obviously not fun, and this is like a prison in my own body, this is hell, because I feel powerless to these changes in my body. I feel that I have no control because what I SEE when I look at myself is what i REALLY SEE. Its REAL for me. I see the fat where it isnt supposed to be! And then the next day I grab my stomach and cant latch on to anything because its practically abs, so what the HELL is all the fat I was seeing yesterday? 
I want to be healthy. I want to be strong. I want to be curvy without seeing it as fat. I want to be NOT ill. 
I want to smile without thinking people are looking at my nose and realizing how big it is, or that I have a fat face. I want to stop daydreaming about cosmetic surgeries and just be kind to myself. But what do you do when your eyes and mind plays tricks on you? Are they even playing tricks on me at all?

22,"I have no idea what to do. I feel completely dysfunctional and disorganized. My entire life feel like a PTSD fueled joke (or nightmare). I desperately need work or some sort of income stream to escape this hellish condition. But I do not feel mentally capable at the moment (the trap). 

I will break down my life into a few smaller sections to summarize how absolutely screwed I am: 

* Early ages, frequent stays at ""daycare"" centers and having horrifying reactions 

* At age 6, moderate to severe brain injury from tripping into a large brick surface at full running speed (no hospital trip) 

* At age 8 to 10, I spend two years in a hotel after mold is discovered in a new home we moved into. My weight goes from something like 110 pounds to 180+ pounds. I was around 5 foot tall. My ""new"" home becomes a hoarding and toxic nightmare fueled with my parents' crazy behavior. 

Most of my early pre-teen and teenage years were trying to recover from the big three points mentioned previously. Food, porn, video games, and school grades were my ways to cope and avoid thinking about my past self. 

I avoided women, I avoided friends, I avoided thinking. I felt trapped either in my addictions (porn, food, video games, school/grades) or my compliance (agreeing with teachers/parents/higher authority). 

I was NOT mentally or emotionally ready in a healthy consenting way for college. I was financially and emotionally manipulated compounded with a learned helpless response to just continue a grind for the sake of a grind. 

Until I tried to kill myself. 


Anyways, the past is the past. But it has crippled me. I feel completely defeated. I could not even kill myself properly (which lead to the TBI). 

Things I have never experienced and most likely never get to experience: 

* Moving out of this shit hole environment my parents' call a ""home"" 

* Dating 

* Getting a job that is not fast food or the like 

 
I can only do intensive, thoughtful tasks, in bursts. Symptoms of the TBI include irritability, lack of impulse control, ringing of my ears, cognitive decline, and constant headaches. 

What advice, if any, do you have for my situation?

23,"i was going to write this in my journal, the journal i haven’t written in for a couple years that i used to write in everyday. i wanted to reflect on myself, on everything that has happened to me and that i have felt. but i feel i can’t do that until i figure out exactly what is wrong with me, so this is me venting to a community and hopefully i’ll get input and some advice about where i should go next.

it started in the second grade. my parents forced me and my siblings to move from south carolina to west virginia with no warning. we just left school and had to leave. for a second grader, i was doing alright. competitions, spelling bees, excelling in school, many friends. then nothing. i finished second grade at one school then started third grade at another. at this point i became a mute. i talked to absolutely no one but my parents and siblings.. and the couple friends i made that actually made an effort to get to know me. this lasted all the way until senior year of high school. i was teased and made fun of and tormented and humiliated because of being a mute in school. i found friendship in online friends, even then.. i wasn’t able to be myself. i questioned that. i mean it’s online??? 

then i went to college. this is when i wanted to make a fresh start for myself. i found tumblr and joined many different communities until i got sucked into one and one only—the pro anorexia community. food became the only thing i was able to control so i starved myself. they cheered me on. i felt accepted again. i’ve always struggled with my image since we moved to wv. “your hair is thin, you have a big head, no 11 year old should be built like that.” it hurt me. so i wanted to change it, somehow.

eventually.. i didn’t let it overcome me anymore. i defeated it. but i hate myself for defeating it. because i’m still not happy. everyone tells me i’m beautiful. i’ve never seen it. i pick apart every thing about me and i drag myself and i don’t see beauty. i see constant disgust. i can’t go without makeup. i facetune my face and body on social media. i don’t like anyone taking my picture unless it’s on my phone because at least i know i can alter it before it’s posted. 

it all makes me anxious. i worry too much. i judge myself too much. i think i bug everyone. no one cares what i have to say. because i don’t say much that means i’m standoffish but i’m not. i want to be everyone’s friend. i can’t keep friends because i push them all away. i’m too afraid to socialize and be myself. i feel my purpose in life is to be a mother and i’m scared to bring a child into this world because i’m not happy with myself. everyone’s negative opinions of me sit with me. they always will i feel. i don’t know if i’ll ever be truly happy with myself. 

currently.. im 25 years old. as of lately, i have a shortness of breath and choking feeling almost every day. i’m trying to practice breathing but i feel that can only do so much. i don’t know where to start.

But it hasn't gone too well the few times in the last week or so that I attempted to talk to someone about feeling suicidal.  For example:

* friend #1 had emailed me, asking how I was doing; I was honest (I've known her for years and she knows about my struggles) with where I'm at; she never responded...but two days later, on social media, she posted one of those suicide prevention advocacy posts that is all like ""We need to destigmatize suicide""/""If you are feeling suicidal, I'm here for you, my door is open, please talk to me"" and such.  It's been 2 weeks and no word from her - but she texted me earlier asking me a question about something mundane.
* friend #2 straight up told me that ""things have been tough for us, too \[he and his wife\]"", that he ""has no answers"", and ""wishes he could point me in the direction of something helpful"" (mind you, this guy is a pastor, too - with more than ample experience, both in the field and personally, dealing with folks like me struggling with mental health stuff; as for my telling him that I've been wanting to relapse back into my drug/alcohol stuff, he ignored that (but not because he doesn't understand that - he's in recovery himself, he's the one who started the ball rolling for me to get clean/sober, and he even helped establish a substance abuse program next state over a few years back)
* The above friend interactions happened over the course of a few days - at my next therapy appointment, I was honest with my therapist about where I'm at - the self-injury, feeling suicidal, wanting to relapse, etc. - and next thing I know, she's telling she doesn't know how to help me, how to respond when I tell her these things.  Hurt, saddened as...I've been seeing her for over 5 years - and to hear a professional who theoretically ought to know a bit about me by now, tell me she doesn't know how to respond when a client tells her they're suicidal...and she's never responded that way before...

I just feel stupid for opening my mouth at all, and thinking I should have kept it shut in the first place like I was initially doing.  Like I learned to do throughout my entire childhood.  Stuff in my head all the time screams to shut up, old tapes of my father telling me nobody would ever believe, nobody would ever care, nobody would ever listen.  A long term rehab program I did years ago told me that these were just ""bad tapes"" and not true and things my father said out of his own alcoholism and illness.  But...  The things he said...keep happening...keep playing out.  ",12Oct2018,1

29,"Hey everyone, I just found this sub so sorry if this is a frequent question and I just didn't find answers in my quick search. 

A little back story: My girlfriend has suffered with depression for most of her life. She just recently got diagnosed with anxiety less than a week ago though we all think it's been there all along just undiagnosed. I have taken one mental health first aid course but I feel like I completely failed her in getting her to proper resources until this episode and even then it wasnt really me that mentioned it and more her family (which has me really pissed at myself). Anyway, she now has appointments scheduled with psychiatrists and counselors and has her meds adjusted to hopefully help combat this addition.

I was wondering if anyone could direct me to podcasts or other resources that would help me be a better support structure for her cause God knows I need help on this.

Thank you for your help! ",12Oct2018,1
30,"Before I tried the bambi sleep files, I used to think hypnosis was bullshit. That it was made up or did not really occur.

I would go from file to file testing the waters and just smirking as nothing really happened to me.

This all changed when someone linked me the bimbo bambi files.

The files are extremely fuzzy, even now, and I have been listening to them every day for the past 6 months.

The basic idea is that a ""bimbo personality"" is installed when you put on girly clothing. Eventually every action you start to become more and more airheaded, dumb, ditzy, and girly.

I do not even remember purchasing my ""uniform"" for the bambi sleep files. All I remember was a hazy, ditzy, blissful sensation like I was drunk or high.

And the desire to obey anyone who uses the triggers are also extremely powerful. The only time I have ever felt these sensations was when I was a very, very little kid to my parents.

I have a feeling that this new personality will take over my existing persona and I have actively tried to kill myself due to it.

I do not want to be a bimbo girl (or transition to become one). But even now I have an overwhelming urge to put on my girl uniform, listen to the files, and then be commended to obey.

I had caught the other personality looking up methods to transition.

This shit is scary. Worse than a fast food addiction. Worse than a job that forces compliance. This is the heart and soul of a person being crushed by a seemingly irresistible desire because a hypnotic file got into their head and started altering their behaviors.

And again, the more I try to lash out against this, the more I feel ""bambi"" taking control and having me listen to the mp3 files over and over and over again.

The only way I tend to break the spell is doing 50 push ups and taking a cold shower. 3 times over until the urges are all disappeared and burdened into a mental hell. Then I actively go into my mind with mediation and set fuel to every single hypnotic trigger, burning them all away with a sadistic grin.

But even after ALL OF THOSE THINGS, these files still have an irresistible urge.

What advice (besides, ""hypnosis does not work,"" because, yes, yes it does, and that thought caused me to be in this position) do you have?

If my mom doesn't tell me to eat when I'm at home, I don't really eat anything but tiny little snacks and even then I get super paranoid that I'm eating too much. When it comes to school, again I opt out of lunch and instead buy small snacks and eat those instead. I once survived three days off of clemintines alone even though I had plenty of food in the house. During the summer I would only eat a meal a day and that was only if the pain got bad enough or if my mom had me eat. I went from an XL to a medium in two months.

37,I've been having super bad anxiety the past couple years. I find it hard to talk or look at people I don't know and I even find it hard to talk to people I do know. Theres been times where I'm so stressed I'll think of killing myself for hours on end usually all throughout the day from when I'm awake to when I'm asleep. Theres also been times where im so stressed that along with the suicidal thoughts I feel like I'm going to have complete freak out melt down and this feeling can go on for months every day all day. The worse it's ever been was one time I was feeling really stressed and suicidal because of the stress and anxiety and as stupid as it sounds I wanted to kill myself because my parents made me mop the floor. For some reason that sent me over the edge because I felt extremely pissed for hours. It was so bad that I honestly though I broke my brain because that night when i tried to sleep i couldn't because i still felt mad and when i did sleep my brain did this weird thing where i was asleep but i still couldn't stop thinking. So I went the entire night thinking endlessly and being aware that I was thinking and having thoughts as though I was awake but I was asleep. It was so weird I literally thought I lost me mind. I'm almost always feeling paranoid about people and feel like somebody is going to do something bad. I like to collect weapons because it gives me a sense of comfort and I juts genuinely like them. I always feel like somebody is going to break into my house at night. It has been so bad lately that it will take me almost all night to go to sleep every night.

39,"I'm very open about having anxiety and depression. I am also a sociopath but not even my closest friend knows that.  Most of my close friends and everyone I sit with at lunch on a regular basis know about my anxiety and depression 

I sometimes talk about it at lunch but when I do it's usually just to my bestfriend. Sometimes some other people get in with the conversation.

Of course, I don't expect them to know exactly what to say since mental health can be a sensitive topic. But they can at least TRY to be more serious about it.

A couple days ago I remember mentioning something like ""I haven't had a panic attack since last year."" And one of my friends said  (it's clear that this guy has an undeveloped sense of empathy) says ""I really don't care.""

Usually when he say things like I just dismiss him, but anxiety is something I don't think people get a lot of support on. People with anxiety diagnoised, and undiagnosed need a lot of support.

It doesn't help that the school I currently go to is not really supported of mental disorders. They are, on the surface. But when it actually comes to students with disorders they couldn't care less. 

////side note pretty unrelated////

Can people stop acting like anxiety and depression is, like, an emotion? (Lack of a better word) I don't mind when people joke and say ""this cured my depression"" or whatever when they don't have depression because I know they don't mean harm.

 But when people are sad for an hour or two and claim they have depression.

No. You are a human. You get sad. You have been sad, but just because you get sad sometimes doesn't mean you are depressed. 

Depression and sadness are two completely  different things. So is anxiety and feeling nervous. 

Everyone gets nervous, everyone (for the most part) twitches or have their hands start shaking when they are giving a presentation. It's human nature. Anxiety is not just fidgeting or shaking.

It's feeling like everybody hates you. Like people talk about you behind your back. Like no matter how hard you try it would never be worth anything. It's having your heart beat so fast over the simplest things, where you think you are going to have a heart attack. It's wanting to runaway after having the shortest amount of social interaction with someone you are not comfortable with. Its feeling trapped in a room full of people. 

And if you know someone with anxiety don't make them do anything that can cause a panic attack. I.e. go to places with lots of people (movie theaters stores are my biggest nightmares ngl) socialize, or worry them by any means. 

Like I'm a diagnoised sociopath and I still have boundaries.

40,"I've just recently joined Reddit and i thought this would be a good place to find out some information; seen as most topics tend to get numerous decent reply. 

To put it into context; since June 2017 my life seems to just be going downhill. I'm a young adult male and with that i just never feel right discussing my feelings to people and as unhealthy as it is i would rather just push all of my problems deep down and just try to ignore them (A.K.A Bottling up). 

Go back to June 2017 and my Grandmother had passed away from cancer, one of those inevitable things everyone has to put up with. Still mourning, a few months later i was coming back from work and i had saw my father (Who i don't live with but still saw now and again) in what seemed to be a drunk state. This was confusing for me as i knew he rarely drank and when he didn't get in such states, i went over to him to try to see what was happening and he just moved me aside and carried on walking. Long story short i went home and came back down and found him... he told me everything. He had secretly been addicted to prescribed drugs for 4 years... 4 YEARS! For 4 years he was doing this and i didn't know, i didn't know what to say or to think.

 After a long period of him coming on and off drink/drugs i found out very recently that he had tried to kill himself 5 days ago. I stopped all contact with him around 2 months ago but some of my family still kept in contact. I just can't help but feel like its my fault and that's another issue what just won't go away and is always there. 

Personally i am legendary at putting on a facade, colleges always mention how i just persevere and i am always happy but that's just what they see. So this week alone has been rough anyway but i have just stuck too it with the hope of everything being better. So on Monday after work i took to seeing my girlfriend as everything just seems better when i'm around her; without her i don't think i could have made it through this year as she is honestly my motivation and she doesn't even know half of whats gone on in my life. But once again, another issue. It has now been 5 days since she didn't take her contraceptive pill (She takes it 21 days and this is her week to bleed) and she still hasn't bled, so the thought of her being pregnant lingers in my head. We won't be keeping it and i know its an easy procedure but its just another issue.

My years of bottling up are coming up to haunt me. Words what i learnt to block out such as cancer, addiction, suicide now echo in my head. I've filled the bottle to the brim and now its overfilling into my head and there is nothing i can do. I feel like utter shit. Any advice will be taken on board... anything.",12Oct2018,1
41,"So I've been binge watching a serial killer series called most evil. Basically this high respected, well to do psychologist uses years of studies, experience, and profiles of different killers. Then he categorizes them in a 22 tier system, 1 being the least evil to 22 being the worst of the worst. The killers are ranked according to several factors. The severity of the crime, the intent behind the crime, mental illness, brutality, and whether or not there was any forethought or planning. Not only does this psychologist rank them, but he and a group of scientist and doctors, are also trying to find the links in different functions and activities in the minds of these variety of killers. Like sociopaths have been known to show about 25% more grey matter in the frontal lobe, that just happens to also be the part of your brain that controls impulse, fear, and emotional understanding. Basically a sociopaths brain can't process emotions like normal people because at the early stages of brain development something goes wrong and the brain never fully developes how it's supposed to. 



But here's what I really found interesting. If you didn't already know, schizophrenia is a hereditary disease that attacks your brain by making you feel paranoid and then starts making you have auditory and visual hallucinations. The hallucinations, especially auditory hallucinations have been studied by monitoring difference in the brain activity of a schizophrenic and of a mentally healthy patient when asked to speak words aloud. In the healthy person the frontal lobe has a quick pulse warning the body that you're about to hear your own voice, but in a schizophrenic there is no pulse of activity because again that part of the brain has never developed right. They believe there really is a link between the activity and the disease. But that's not even the full extent of my realization today. I've just learned that people with schizophrenia have studies proving that the disease actually deteriorates their brains until they lose all cognitive function. It's just like dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Which means one day scientist will learn how to reconstruct brain tissues and cells that at this point in time are thought to never be able to be gained back. Its possible that we will be able to save people from that hell of a mind they're trapped in and restore them back to normal. ",12Oct2018,1

43,"I work as a counselling psychologist and meet many people, from all walks of life who share their lived experiences with me.  One of the general themes that I often notice is how stubbornness can often hinder the therapeutic process in bringing about change to help my clients to have a better life experience.
 
Is Stubbornness a personality trait, is it something we learn or is it something innate within us. These are all good questions to think about but difficult to answer.  
 
I find that stubbornness can be both helpful and unhelpful in how we deal with life. This article will briefly explore the function of stubbornness on our psychological well-being.
 
In being stubborn it can be a both a positive and/or negative.  For instance the positives of being stubborn can help you achieve goals in life such as finding a way to make something work. Therefore, there can be a great sense of achievement.
 
However, the negative aspect of being stubborn is that it can maintain maladaptive behaviors and beliefs. From my experience clients can be stubborn in not wanting to change their maladaptive ways of thinking and being as it feels safe to them to do what they know best. The idea of change brings about fear and this is something we often like to avoid.
 
For instance, I have seen clients working in very demanding jobs in which there is a lot of expectations put upon them. In addition they hold beliefs or rules ‘I need to prove myself’ to others thus they often maintain a vicious cycle of needing to prove and people please leading to exhaustion, feeling depressed and anxious. In instances like this stubbornness can be harmful, negative and unhelpful.
 
So, it is important to be mindful on how your stubbornness can be harming you and causing you to feel low  and on the edge. It might be helpful in questioning your own stubbornness and the effect it is having upon your psychological wellbeing. In doing so, it may help to improve aspects of your life such as relationships, expectations you put on yourself, thinking differently and creatively and more importantly bring you peace of mind.",12Oct2018,1

Hey everyone I am a 13 year old boy and I need urgent help. Now, I know that many of you are going to not take me seriously because of the fact that I'm 13 but I really need this help. From now I on I'm just going to type whatever I am thinking right now.

I am currently in a state of absolute mental anguish. My mind is going haywire and I don't understand anything including myself. What if no one understands me? What if I'm just alone with my thoughts? WHAT IF NO CAN TRULY UNDERSTAND ME, EVER? 

Why do I have to keep replaying completely insignificant things such as a trivial sentence like, ""I'm hungry"" over and over in my head and analysing them? Why do I scroll back just two seconds in a YouTube video just because I looked away for two seconds? Does this only happen to me? AM I ALONE?!??

When I said I might not be taken seriously because of the fact I'm thirteen no one really understood when the read that, did they? When I say I'm different, I really mean I'm different. And when I say I really mean I'm different, I really really mean I'm different in some way I don't even really understand. Or am I? Does anyone understand? AM I ALONE?

My mind is a mess. There's so much I need to work on and so much I need to do. So much pressure, so much stress. I'm always sad. People look at me and they just see a normal 13 year old boy. I think. I'm not sure. 

What should I say next? I have too much to say!

Why do I always feel strange about ""emotional""(?) things like really liking something and coming close to getting it? Why do I always pull out even though I really wanted it? Why do I hate these ""big"" changes that aren't really significant? What is wrong with me?

Are all people like me? Do they think about how easy it is to get hurt or get in big trouble in everyday life and how people other than you have common sense to avoid those things.

For ever since I can remember I have been afraid of my father. I've always acted strange around him and felt disconnected. For example, if he shouts at me for doing something ""bad"" (like being shy) and walks off into his room I spend 10 minutes trying to figure out whether to go inside there and say something or just not do anything and which would be the best option and the effect it would have on how he perceives me. I have forever being trying to carry this perfect image of myself for my dad thinking that the character I have been pretending to be around him is what he wants, I don't know what he wants but he doesn't want the image I'm trying to have around him I don't really understand its all just so confusing.

Sometimes my mind just goes so haywire I start to scream and yell and shout. I should be going to sleep now and I want to but I'm going to keep on going.

Tomorrow's Saturday, the start of the weekend. Yay (not). All I ever do on weekends is work and my father is at home so he gets angry at me all day and makes me scared. Sometimes I'm going to the kitchen and I hear that he is there so I turn away and run into my room stealthily hoping he doesn't see me so he doesn't think I'm scared of him. Oh yeah did I mention that my father used to shout at me and tell me it was my fault that I didn't have any friends for years and got bullied? Hmm.

I also feel bad for my father because he is always alone because everyone in my family is scared of him especially me. Sometimes I go and stay with him even though I feel really scared and on edge and uncomfortable.

Now I feel like I'm only a fifth of the way through this post and I haven't even said all I need to say.      

I hate being asked by a friend to give them something. If I don't I'm seen as stingy but if I do they may be my friend because I gave them something or be nicer to me or keep asking me. What if I don't want to cooperate with their demands anymore? That would be really awkward. Same thing with someone who's not my friend. If I gave them something they will feel indebted to me and start acting fake and trying to be my friend when in reality AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry I couldn't express myself there.

Am I the only one who is ""smart"" with ""common sense""? Or do others have those too? I know they do but do they? Sorry if this post makes no sense.

I think this madness started last year when I learned about productivity and started creating mad to-do lists for myself. I want to get rid of these lists but there are so necessary for me. How else am I supposed to remember to take out the bins on a specific day?

When I read a sentence half the time I have to reread it because I can't comprehend it somehow. Why is this? Do I lack focus and concentration or something? And half the time it depends on what I am reading. 

What if I'm the only person who is conscious in this world and everyone else including everyone who reads and responds to this is just part of making my reality (illusion?) seem real? What if you guys all try to convince me that you're real but its not true? And then you try to say you are real even though I said you might not be real and then you say you are. Does this even make sense?

I'm feeling sleepy but I really wanna keep writing and fix this problem I have. Everyone reading this please have empathy for me if you understand and if it is even possible which I don't know whether it is. Right now I feel like the most miserable and tormented person in the world. Right now I'm feeling like I failed with this post. What if I never get help? What if I'm stuck like this forever.

The other night, after an on-going fight with my girlfriend, I smashed my head against a telephone pole...i don't know why I wanted to do it but it was something along the lines of destroying my brain to feel nothing.

I feel awful about doing this to her. I kept saying she should leave because it's too much to handle but she refused. We're still working on our issues but I don't know why I have someone like her around. I don't deserve it really. 

I'll be starting medication soon. Hopefully that stabilizes me and makes me able to interact with people better. ",12Oct2018,1

I have Borderline Personality Disorder and I just began therapy with someone whom seems promising but he’s more on the spiritual side for BPD treatment (Buddhism, awakening, etc). I think this could help me a lot, but I also feel like I need to get into more structured therapy with DBT. I just found a program that seems really good. It’s pricey but I’m committed to get the best help I can to save my life. Does anyone have experience with DBT? I’m considering DBT first then onto more spiritual counsel. ",12Oct2018,1

60,"At the age of 3, I remember constantly thinking the carers at nursery didn't like me. I felt this kind of fear and abandonment all the time. I felt like I'd done something wrong and hated myself. There was this constant scratching thing in my chest, for as long as I can remember, symptoms of anxiety. I don't remember myself at 2, but I didn't speak to strangers.

So, growing up I was always analysing myself. Constantly telling myself off for ""immorality"". At the age of 4 I was constantly analysing my thoughts and thinking about my thoughts and feelings, whether i was a bad person. 

Then, I got bullied. So that made me go literally crazy. I'm now extremely mentally ill, and the whole thing feels like a dream. I've had manic depression for about a year, and constant fearfulness and explosive stress.

Is my obsessiveness as a 3 year old very abnormal? Does anyone think it could suggest anything?

61,"After Kanye West visited the White House, people perpetuating the stigma against bipolar and other mental illnesses has really been bothering me, from CNN mocking him for being hospitalized to everyday people calling him crazy. 

I’ve been diagnosed as mentally ill since grade 7, but I’ve never realized how bad the stigma truly was. I did have an experience of falling out with a friend and them calling me crazy because of my bipolar diagnosis, but that was the only personal experience I have. 

I wish people could understand that the mentally ill are not inherently dangerous and that we just have issues with emotional regulation. ",12Oct2018,1
62,"I apologize in advance if this isn't the type of thing posted on here.I just thought this may be a useful place to post this on.

To give you some back story, I was raised in a very abusive home and was sexually abused for a little over a year when I was 16. I was diagnosed with traits of BPD, bipolar 1, ptsd, and an anxiety disorder. I am 20 now. I've struggled intensely for my entire life, dropping out of school, quitting jobs due to mental breakdowns, but over the past couple of years I began trying CBT and DBT therapy and this is my life now.

So what’s been going on with me? Life has gotten easier to live. That’s quite the statement, isn’t it? I don’t entirely know what to do with this newfound ease. School, work, exercise, chores, and homework are a thing again. There isn’t a word to describe how magical this is. I’m setting and staying firm on boundaries and am in a relationship with the absolute love of my life. Things got better. Wow… It feels so deeply unusual to say that. Sure, I’m still struggling, but it seems as though I’ve exchanged or retired my debilitating worries for more beneficial worries.

Being away from family has been the most profitable factor in this whole healing thing, also getting a job holy shit, and group therapy. All of these components are really quite the recipe. There have been no mental breakdowns within the past three weeks. Like, holy shit! That’s huge! I can slowly notice myself comprehending information in healthier ways as opposed to the habitual toxic default. A weird byproduct of this is it’s gotten easier to sing. I can genuinely feel and hear the ring of passion in my voice.

I was looking through my old, angsty, journals and thought it would be valuable to document this feeling and state of mind, as a majority of my writing is just a display of my suffering. My god, it feels like I can breathe again. I can watch movies or listen to music again, and actually digest and remember what I’ve just seen or heard. Life isn’t as faint and blurry and hazy as it was before. Colors seem distinct and lively. Noises sound unique again. And every breath doesn’t feel like it could be my last anymore.

And I’m in love! Super, proper, love. Loving fucking passionate, feverish, hilarious, disgusting, love. I’m with my best friend and he is truly the definition of what it means to be a genuine person. I could write 20 novels in a series about my appreciation and absolute adoration for this stupid, lovely, guy.

There’s much more detail and nuances that are happening in my world right now that I’d love to focus and expand upon later, but I had to give a brief summary and capture the glow and gratitude I’m feeling in this moment. It feels good to be back.

The reason I'm posting this, and disclaimer this will be very cheesy so get a napkin, I did not think my life would get better. I've had multiple suicide attempts, in and out of psychiatric wards, and I felt as though there was no such *thing* as getting better. When you live a certain way for so long it's natural to theorize that this may be it for you right? I was under this belief that I was treatment resistant, immune to getting better, but, and I can't believe I'm saying this, it does get better. With baby steps, albeit, and a horribly frustrating amount of patience, it does get better. Wherever you are right now, whatever situation you're in, know that our brains (and this is backed up by science yo) literally have the ability to rewire itself to cater to healthier thinking patterns. Neuroplasticity is one hell of a drug, let me tell you. **Healing is possible for you**. Also, CBT and DBT have changed the game completely for me so please if you have some free time I recommend these practices heavily. Love you all and hang in there. If anyone has any questions about CBT or DBT or anything really feel free to message me.

64,"My husband has some undiagnosed mental health issue that has been going on for a very long time, and with more stress on his plate, he’s getting completely overloaded. His dad died when he was 8 and he’s been pretty messed up about that ever since. His mom and sister are a little high strung (short fuse type of thing) so their family dynamic is just weird to me. Compared to my family, they all just yell at each other all the time. They love each other and help whenever they can but they seem to have no coping mechanisms whatsoever. He also was in the military and developed alcoholism while in. I think he was self-medicating his depression with alcohol to the point of over doing it. In the military it’s a common thing to lie your ass off to mental health for fear you’ll get medically discharged or other things. While he was in, mental health did little to nothing for him. 
He’s been out about a year now, and the stress of life is too much for him. He goes through extreme mood swings of happiness and energy to self loathing and suicidal thoughts. He wants to change careers and move away every couple of months. He also used to be really bad with money but he’s getting better (still bad though).  He is refusing to get help because “nothing will help” and he “doesn’t want to get better.” He said the only reason he hasn’t committed suicide is because he doesn’t have life insurance. We have a 1 year old daughter. 
I don’t know how to help. He usually shuts down right when I think I’m getting him to open up. He thinks all medical professionals are only there for money and won’t help. And I really hate to say this but his mental health is making me have issues too. I’m never good enough and he’s always mad at me for small things. I’m exhausted.

I feel dead inside

I feel numb

I don't feel alive

I don't feel real

I feel like a husk of a person

I feel like I am sleeping with my eyes open

I don't feel any strong emotions

I don't even feel music anymore 

I don't truly enjoy anything

I am indifferent/apathetic to everything

I am on autopilot 

I am not sad nor am I happy.

I would rather feel sadness than feel nothing.

I feel somewhere between a ghost and a human. 

I feel like I am a passenger in my life and I am not the driver.

I feel like my environment lacks depth.

I feel like an observer of my own life

I never feel in the moment

I don't want to die but if I was faced with death I would be ok with it

I am not motivated to do anything because there is no point

Nothing makes me happy

Nothing makes me feel any sort of way

Nothing makes me feel alive

When I am talking to people I feel I emulate emotion 

Everything I do feels like I am expressing it though someone else like a movie or a video game

It feels like I have filter around me that filters out a lot of the world. Everything feels 2 dimensional.

I just want to go back to a time when I felt anything

You know when you “zone out""?  I feel constantly zoned out.

I feel I come across as aloof


I feel like there is a blanket between me and reality I can see myself typing this right now but it feels like I am watching someone else type it for me, like a vr headset. This feeling is with every sense
I used to feel present and awake. I could feel the sun on me, the wind on me and things around me. But now I feel dead. Nothing seems real.
I met my one of my favorite bands but it didn’t feel any different than seeing them on a screen.
It feels like I am on a drug trip like I'm constantly stoned but not high and I’m not enlightened I’m deadened and I’m not free from my subjective self, it's trapped inside me. 
The only time I am happy is when I can (very rarely) feel sadness to the point of crying. This usually happens when 
As mentioned before I don’t even feel music anymore, it was the last thing that enlisted a semi strong emotion response from me but now it’s gone.
The one thing that makes me feel kinda better is nostalgia. I will sometimes go on late night nostalgia binges remembering how things used to make me feel. The intro of a show I watched as a kid or the music of a game that I played years ago and sometimes it will make me tear up and feel something but I can't describe the emotion. 
I feel this makes me unable to make friends. I can talk to people for a while and click with them but I don't really form any emotional connections to them, I have no drive to purse them beyond acquaintance. Besides who wants to be friend with a robot with no emotion? I emulate emotion around people, but I think it's clean that I am not as enthusiastic as everyone around me.

70,"Hi everyone! I am new to reddit and this is my first post. I just want to know if my experience is “normal” and that I’m not going crazy (which I know I’m not supposed to call myself). I’m also asking for advice I guess. I’m sorry that this is sort of lengthy. 

History (NOT going into childhood and teenager crap, which is a whole can of worms, complete with a traumatic upbringing and being sexually assaulted by my uncle at 16, yay 🙄

•I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety disorder (I don’t know the exact names) in 2012, started taking some low-dose medications to get me feeling better. I attempted suicide in 2013 and then started seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist and started a new regiment of medications. It was so helpful and I finally started feeling what “normal” people must feel like. I was able to start exercising, actually feeling motivated, not having bouts of rage/crying/evil behaviour, etc. 

•I weaned myself off of my meds in 2015 before we moved from Canada to the States because I was feeling better and knew that I would not be able to handle finding new doctors or encountering any issues with my insurance and prescription coverage. 

•Now it’s late 2018, I’m 32 yrs old, and I feel myself becoming so unhinged, but it’s not like before where I was just feeling sad and engaging in typical destructive behaviour (drinking, being reckless, etc). I don’t actually drink anymore because family history with drug and alcohol addiction. 

I feel like my brain has SO many things wrong with it. I can’t stay focused on any task, I forget what I’m doing in the middle of things, I flit around the house moving from thing to thing without accomplishing anything. I’ll click an app on my phone with the intent to log my food or check fb and then a second later I find myself somewhere else not even knowing what I’m doing. I have to have things at home “just so” or else I get so anxious/unsettled and mad. I get into moods where if too many things are touching me (the sensation of leggings for example) or if my fiancé casually touches me, I want to explode but have to hide it. Sudden noises freak me out and I overreact by yelling or crying. I can’t focus when anyone is talking and will tune out stories and have to ask people to repeat themselves - but I’m very good at pretending to be engaged and listening. 

My one cat will poop on the floor and depending on my mood, it might make me fly into a rage and I have to leave the room or else I have horrible visions of wanting to hurt her and scare myself. I can’t accomplish anything with my jobs because I find it 100% impossible to focus. I’ll find myself bouncing on my exercise ball for an indefinite period of time before realizing “oh, I should try to work again.” Some days I am so happy and motivated and feel like I can do everything and then other days I feel so depressed and like there isn’t possibly a future for me/I don’t deserve happiness. I online shop too much (sometimes I’m good at recognizing impulsive behaviour and can put my phone away but other times, not so much) and excessively scroll online and then feel guilty afterwards. 

I am NOT suicidal but my behaviour is getting harder and harder to hide. I’m very good at getting work done in a short amount of time when my procrastination catches up to me. I’ve tried booking appointments with psychiatrists where I am, but I have such a hard time working up the courage to call. Then when I do call, the receptionist says they’ll get back to me - but they don’t. What if I was genuinely a danger to myself?! It seems like it’s impossible to find mental health care.

It’s just really frustrating - I’m a freaking research scientist and I am physically very healthy. I have a job and a fiancé and it seems like all should be well. I should be better at managing my brain/mental wellness but I have no idea what to do anymore. 

I guess I just want to know that I’m not alone and if anyone has advice on what to say to a doctor (should I ever be successful with getting to one) so that they can actually help. I feel like if I go, they’ll just think that I’m making things up or creating issues. Or if anyone has general advice on how to manage whatever it is that’s wrong with me, I will happily read it!

72,"Hello, I'm pretty new to Reddit but I consider this a platform with opportunity to communicate with the right people regarding different topics. I'm an aspiring developer, I'm not only interested in programming but the storytelling involved. I believe that video games are an extremely interactive and empathetic platform that's not being used enough to talk about certain themes such as mental illness, therefore making its representation highly bland and becoming stigmatized. Also, every piece of art or software, every project, is meant in my opinion to create an unique experience. I've been learning how to use game engines and I want to improve these mediums for storytelling and I think that tackling such topic as mental illness is important but full of responsibility and that's why I'm writing this. I've experienced anxiety myself, but still, I cannot bear to imagine other people's experiences and I admit to being ignorant on certain aspects of extremely complex and different realities. As far as my storytelling goes, I've always been fascinated by mythology and how fantasy and horror can entangle us in different worlds, but I don't want to think of these as a mere product of symptoms but a journey affected by society's standards (which are still tough today). If you've had hallucinations, delusions, heard voices and more; it's all valuable and It'd be very helpful if you, even if it's anonymous, told a little of that story. You can send an email here: binarycasper@gmail.com. Each and every story is a valuable source to me. ",12Oct2018,1
73," 

I’m trying to act in a way that promotes self-acceptance and honesty. I have stopped lying to people when my illness precludes me from participating in something. I no longer say I have a stomach bug, or that my parents need me to help them with something. I say that I am disabled, and I need to just sit and do nothing for a day or two in order to prevent an episode. This puts me in a vulnerable position. I may be judged harshly, not taken seriously, or even hurt someone’s feelings. But if I want to be a mental illness advocate, I know I need to live that role. Most people are understanding and want to help, even if they don’t know fact one about mental illness, so I decided that it’s a good idea to put awareness and information out into the world. I want to be an ambassador of our cause, and the best way I can do that is by being open, honest, and frank about my disability and what kind of help I need.

Asking for help takes bravery, nothing less. It means admitting that you can’t do something for yourself. No adult wants to feel that way or be seen in that light. But if you are disabled, you have a legitimate need that has to be met. If you can’t help yourself in the active sense, you need to spend some time thinking about what help or accommodations you need, so that you can ask the people around you very specifically to help you in those ways. Guess what? Most people want to help. Like seriously, earnestly want to help, even when they don’t understand the problem. If you ask someone for help, you will probably get it. Isn’t that great?

Of course, everyone fears the day that they ask for help and are denied and told that mental illness isn’t real or some other mean-spirited or evil thing. I’ve been asking the people around me for help for almost 13 years, and I’ve only had one person be mean to me because of it. Sadly, it was my best friend at the time. I was crying and didn’t know why, and when I tried to explain that I thought it was the bipolar and I just needed a hug, he shot me down, saying “No, I’m not going to hug you! What the fuck is wrong with you?” That’s pretty much the worst case scenario for asking for help. However, I survived and went on to ask many, many other people for help of various kinds, and ALL of those people were kind to me, even if they didn’t or couldn’t help. That’s a damn good average. Not everyone will be able to help, but since most people want to see themselves as primarily “good”, the average person will probably try.

Honesty is key to asking for help. You must accept that you are ill. You must accept that you need help. Then, you must figure out exactly what other people can do to help you. If you’re thinking “There’s nothing anyone can do to help me”, I understand that. I’ve been there. I was there for the first three years of my illness. Eventually, I figured out some things I could do to help myself, some ways to change my surroundings into a place that felt safe, some specific sentences that were very comforting to hear from a loved one, and what expectations I needed people to change. I wrote down the helpful sentences and gave a copy to each loved one, explaining that these phrases that they already believed would be helpful to hear during an episode (examples: “I love you”, “This will pass and you’ll be okay again”, “You are strong”, “You will survive this”). I also let them know that I can’t live up to the expectations of healthy people. There will be events that I can’t attend. There will be times when I have to go outside for a long time to calm down. I need to leave some parties early. I can’t walk through an IKEA. All of these truths about what helps me are now part of my support system. Honesty and bravery will get you far.

Being honest with others is helping me accept myself. Every time I put myself out there and am not met with meanness or anger, I get stronger in my sense of rightness as a person. What I mean is that the way I am is a legitimate way to be a human being, and I have as much right to exist in this space-time as anyone else. We each have inherent worth. I am not greater or lesser than anyone else. It’s easy to believe that I’m not greater; it can be tremendously difficult to believe that I am not lesser. So the more honest I can be, the more validation I will receive in return, and I believe that if I continue this relatively new behavior, I will be in a much healthier position within a year.

The truth is, we all need help. You will be furthering the cause of mental illness awareness with every person you talk to about your illness. Every time you show someone how to help you, you are making a difference. Being honest about your abilities and disabilities makes the world better and helps *you*. Even if you don’t ask anyone for help (which I don’t recommend), telling the truth about why you can’t go to that party on Friday or why you stayed in bed all day yesterday is tremendously liberating. When you’re honest about your illness, you are showing yourself love and respect. You deserve love and respect from yourself above all. Tell the truth. Watch what happens.

But I hate it. 

I have a 2-hour commute each way.

It pays too much for me to go looking elsewhere. Nobody pays like they do here. I feel like any other job I find will be even more work and for half the salary/benefits (according to the job searches I've done). Or no benefits at all.

I have four weeks of vacation accrued (decent benefits). 

I haven't had any real time off (except for weekends) since January. I've taken maybe three or four weekdays off randomly since January. I was sick for a couple days a few months ago, too.

I have a 3-year old and a 1 1/2 year old at home, and the younger one is still not sleeping through the night, and the older one insists on waking up at 4:30am or 5:30am every day. And neither my wife nor myself can seem to get in bed any earlier than 10pm (kids are finally asleep by 8:30 or 9, and then my wife and I talk for a bit and then get ready for bed). So we're not getting enough sleep.

I'm burned out. I have a project delivering at the beginning of November, but after the first two weeks of November, it should be rolling all by itself and the workload will be low enough that someone else could easily cover for me while I'm out for a week.

But I'm being told that I can't take any vacation time during the holiday season (even though December is absolutely DEAD in my industry). 

My boss says I have to wait until March of next year, or maybe just take one day off here and there if I really really need it, between now and then.


And so, I'm in this situation where I hate my job (have hated it for years), but it's such a ""good"" job that I feel so totally stuck, and I am so sick and tired of telling myself how good I have it, compared to most other people. 

I'm so sick and tired of having to tell myself to be thankful for what I've got.

Life could be better. I want a less stressful job. 


I need to schedule another therapy appointment. But I got assigned a new therapist with my HMO (because my old one got transferred) and I've only had one session with her, a few months ago.

77,"First time poster.  A few years ago, I experienced an extremely strong sense of deja vu. It was just a regular day, I was putting on my coat to take my dogs out for a walk. Suddenly I felt an overwhelming sensation of deja vu that flattened me, literally. I could barely stand. 

I had vomiting reactions and persistent hallucinations. These were like scenes from movies I remembered seeing or video games I had played, except they weren’t. I had never seen these movies or played these games. But that’s how familiar they felt. 

These visions became increasingly intense. I felt I couldn’t separate my waking mind from my subconscious. I had a vision of trees chasing me around my childhood home and I felt compelled to run from them, literally run in my apartment.  I ran and hid behind sofas, chairs. 

My husband came home and we tried to watch tv. Watching tv made it worse. It’s like it allowed my subconscious mind off its leash. I kept having to ask him if certain things had just happened. “Were we just talking about X?” “Did we just watch a show about X?” The answer was always no. 

I truly felt I was losing my mind. But it was just that one time. I’ve talked to my regular doctor, my psychiatrist and my psychotherapist about this. They all write it off as a panic attack, but I feel it’s maybe because they just don’t know. I’ve never experienced this again, I’m just curious as to what might have happened. I lean towards it being some kind of seizure.

I just woke up from a colorful and fun dream to find that this mundane existence was waiting for me again. Now I'll do my homework, take a shower, go to school, and spend the rest of the day hanging out with my dad, which is also the same every day. We make dinner, walk our dogs, I water the plants, then we watch TV until he goes to bed. 

Every day is the same. Every once in a while I'll stray from the routine and take the city bus to school, or meet up with an old friend, but any time I do something new it doesn't feel real, and I feel like I'm not experiencing it fully because of a brain fog I can't get shake off. I broke my two-month streak and started cutting again. It wasn't my longest streak but it still feels like a waste of all that time to break it. I feel like I need to run away, or start doing something with myself that matters, like try to get my driver's permit. But I can't stop thinking that getting my permit or looking for colleges are milestones that mark my aging, and though I often think I want to die, I'm really terrified of it. 

I feel like I was born at the moment humanity's stupid ass mistakes finally begin to catch up with them, and that none of my peers seem to give a shit about it, so maybe *I'm* the one that needs to grow up and try to fix climate change, or give everything I have to cancer research, but it's hard to picture myself doing those things when my social anxiety and depersonalization problems led me to quit public school for an eight-hour a week charter school. Literally everybody else is handling my old high school fine, but I couldn't go two weeks without having a panic attack and having to go home. How am I supposed to save people in India when I can't even hold eye contact with them during conversation? I feel so useless.

Sorry for rambling, I'm gonna go feed my old-ass cat who won't eat dry food anymore even though his teeth are healthy. ",12Oct2018,1

82,"I may post an updated version of this later, but for now I want to refrain from extensive details and just get the general situation off my chest.

I'm currently in graduate school about 2.5 hours away from my home town, and have two younger brothers, one a senior in HS and the other graduated last year. The younger one, we'll call him J, has been having increasingly bad anger and mental health issues that started before I moved out and have been escalating since.

My parents weren't always easy and they had plenty of their own major faults, but nothing to major extremes and myself and other brother have turned out okay. I've been hearing more and more frequently over the last few months about J having violent outbursts at my parents and sometimes at school, consistently blaming my parents for everything. Lots of screaming, calling them every name under the sun, and recently he hit my mom in the face and gave her a black eye. On top of that, for several years he's had other contributing problems, such as hygeine (trash all over his room,  peeing in bottles because he doesn't want to get up and go to the bathroom, etc). 
He was recently put in inpatient psychiatric care for suicide threats, he goes to counseling, and they have been trying to find a medication that might help him but it sounds like every week something else is happening with him. There or some more details that I want to spare for right now.

Just today, he texted me telling me he just got expelled from high school. It's his senior year, he's been talking to me about college, and the school marching band was probably the last positive, productive use of his time he had left going for him.

What hurts me the most is that with me being far away, I don't directly see that side of him anymore and he's always the good kid I know is deep inside of him when I am around him. Of course I don't condone or sympathize directly with his behavior at all (hitting my mom, exploding at teachers in school, etc), and it's a very confusing feeling mixed between anger at his actions and empathy/sadness for what he's going through (even if a lot of it he has brought on himself, I know it's just crushing him and making everything snowball)

I know there's nothing anyone can really do to help change anything. I'm just feeling sad and helpless about the situation and just wanted to get it off my chest to anyone that may have gone through similar things. Thanks for reading",12Oct2018,1
83,"hello, i'm a 16 year old boy and recently I've become hyper aware of my mental state and what is actually happening inside my brain. honestly i don't even know where to start with this, but I've started compiling a list of things that i'm willing to share.

so recently my boyfriend suggested that i may have OCPD, due to my obsessive tendencies when it comes to micromanaging myself and the things around me. i basically have an obsession with the idea of things being perfect and controlling them, and when this is taken out of my control i can become severely distressed. for example, if i don't leave the house at 7:57am, the rest of my day will not be right as that IS the time i must leave and that's the way it is. other things that suggest i may have OCPD are my stiff actions in social situations, my 'coldness' and 'stubbornness' that many have picked up on before and my devotion to listing and scheduling things that others may consider irrelevant, yet i find comfort and enjoyment in.

i strive for perfection in all i do, and i find myself building my own little world. from a young age, i used lists to keep order as well as a way to escape. i would list the top 40 every week, then make several variations in the hopes that one would match next weeks chart. i produce my own reality tv shows on my laptop and place people i know as the cast, and write out synopsises of every episode until there is an eventual winner of the shwo. i have no interest in being a singer, yet i have planned out albums, release dates, tracklistings and subsequent tours that i could embark on just in case. it's as if i create my own fabricated little world of weirdness, and i find comfort in that.

then i began to research OCD a little more, as i know the two can be sometimes confused. my boyfriend, who also has OCD, suggested that it may be worth researching OCD a little more for my own sake. i did, and i found myself quite overwhelmed. as a person, i have a rather guilty conscience and find myself regretting and replaying situations constantly. whenever talking to somebody, i feel i'm putting up a front, as i am acting the way i think will be most appealing to them. i know who i am and i'd like to think i'm pretty pure as a person, yet i do alter myself for different people, based on what i've picked up from analysing them. that's another thing, i overthink everything and analyse the tiniest of things.  whether it be people, patterns in my surroundings, or a message a friend has sent. but anyway, i found that intrusive thoughts could be something that applies to me. there are several standout examples i can think of to support this. during december 2017, i had a fairly dark and lonely time, which led to an episode in which i got the image of severed fingers and bloodied wrists in my head. then all i could see all over my bed was severed body parts. and these images kept on coming for a matter of weeks. these thoughts would develop in to imagining myself committing suicide right in that moment. whether i was on a bus, at the dinner table, walking home, i would just get these thoughts and couldn't stop them. and i never acted on them, and i wouldn't even say i was feeling suicidal. i just couldn't stop these thoughts. even to this day, sometimes i just get bizarre thoughts like my leg snapping. and i just can't get it out. or i'll imagine somebody coming in the room and shooting us all. and it won't go. this may be a pretty normal thing, but i don't know, i'm just letting you know.

basically, I've got no clue what's going on in my head and i feel i need help. recently, a prevalent thought i keep getting is 'you want a mental illness. you like the idea of being diagnosed', which then leads to me feeling sick and guilty and trying to push it away. but i'm trying to overcome that and tell myself it's not all fake and based off of a want i can't control. i think it's time something was done, and advice would be much appreciated. feel free to ask questions, i am willing to share. sorry this was so long agh.

84,"My girlfreind has major depressive bipolar (idk if thats what its actually called) and is currently in the middle of a very stressful point in her life. She just graduated high school and is starting adulthood, ik nothing out of the ordinary. The only problem is her last few months have dragged her through the mud hardcore. She was raped, for the second time, told she has 5 years to live (max) and her mother has moved back into her life after almost 6 years of absence. 

She refuses to open up and hasn't really talked to me or anybody for that matter for a while. Those of you with anything in common with her, can you give me some sort of way that i can get through to her that i still love her and that no matter what everything will be ok? 

Also her silence is extra scary because she has a suicide attempt under her belt from her first diagnosis and chemotherapy cycle, and my mind can't help but going to the worst outcomes in times like these.",12Oct2018,1

86,"I'm 15 and I feel like I should be a lot more happy. I have good parents, good grades, a nice house etc. The only thing is that I'm a bit lonely and pretty nervous around people but that's pretty normal. But somehow I'm still not happy. I don't want to do anything. There's nothing I enjoy and I'm constantly tired, (except at night for some reason, then I can't sleep) although I've learned to ignore it most of the time. I just want to lie in bed and watch YouTube all day. It's like I don't feel anything. I know that if I'm laughing I'm enjoyong myself and if I'm crying I'm sad but I don't actually *feel* happy or upset. The one exception seems to be that I still find things funny but that's it. Also, I don't know if this is at all relevant but I'm a bit of a nihilist. I find it hard to think that there is any point or value to life. There just isn't any proof so that must be the logical assumption: that there is no point abd my life doesn't matter. I can't imagine any future that would make me happy. Just a million scenarios that will make me miserable in one way or another. I think it's worth mentioning that I feel a lot better now than a couple months ago. Back then I would actually catch myself occasionally actually wanting to die. Now I'm just kind of indifferent. I don't really care about anything, not if I live or die anyway.

Thanks for reading my incoherent rambeling. Is this just my hormones going hawire? Is it just going to pass or should I get help?

87,"Emotional talk has never been my thing. I realized that long before I started therapy 2 years ago. I went two times and haven't been since. I've been thinking about getting back in but I feel like therapy has done nothing for me. Every time the conversation gets remotely personal or about all the feelings stuff I get really tense, fidget a lot and stare at the floor. I just give some weird, nervous answer and end up kicking myself because I think what I said was really stupid. It doesn't help that I get these completely impossible questions.

88,"I’m considering starting medication. I was wondering how a psychiatrist decides which medication to give you. I know it depends on your diagnosis but for even for depression and anxiety there are SO many options. I know sometimes psychiatrists have deals with brands to push a certain medication but what really determines how they choose. 

Also, I’m kind of scared to start medication. I hear so many people say that it gets worse before the medication starts working. Also are there any kinds of medications that don’t have nausea as a side effect, or how can you lessen the chances of being nauseous when taking medication?",12Oct2018,1
89,"I've seen psychologists for depression/anxiety/social anxiety here and there, and taken medication for depression and anxiety in the past. I just started seeing a new psychologist, who I like a lot. I talked to them about OCD symptoms (which I try to hide and had never told anyone about before). They're encouraging me to see a psychiatrist to talk about medication (mainly for obsessive thoughts, though in the couple appointments before I talked about it they already thought I ought to talk to a psychiatrist and consider medication for depression or anxiety).

I'm concerned about medication with a misdiagnosis, though. I've only seen this psychologist 3 times (3 weeks). The last time I saw a counselor, they thought bipolar II might be more accurate than depression, and mentioned that some antidepressants can worsen bipolar symptoms. In addition, my parent (social worker) really thinks I might have Asperger's (and I think they may be right) - if I am, I think knowing might help me in working on my social skills (which need work regardless). The psychologist I'm seeing is specialized in depression and anxiety disorders.

I read that psychiatrists can give comprehensive psychiatric evaluations? I've only seen this in the context of kids, though. Is this something I can do? Do all psychiatrists do these?

I was diagnosed with a chronic illness a few months ago, and although it was nice to have a name for my symptoms, my heart sank when the doctor said there was no cure. I dont want to go into what it is. It is very hard for me to talk about and come to terms with. This illness really gave me a lot of anxiety when the symptoms started to appear around 18. So 2 years of doctors shrugging me off and then finding out I have to deal with this forever has taken a toll on my mental health. 

I really think I need to see a psychologist to talk about this, but I am too scared to open up to them about my illness. I havent told anyone about it except my parents and my boyfriend.

93,"Cattle heads, stripped of their skins, all the meat and muscle still intact, maybe a dozen or so, arraigned on a dull silvery metal rack. Their eyes, full and wide, perfectly round, without the surrounding skin to hide or protect, those eyes still seemed to communicate the pure horror that they must have experienced at the moment of their death. All staring, with eyes that were frightened, pleading, begging, but for no success. They were killed, beheaded, stripped of their skin, and slapped on a rack.

Whenever I search for my earliest childhood memory, that pops up. There are older fragments of recollection , but that is the strongest full memory that I can bring forward out of my early childhood brain muck. A slaughterhouse, with my uncle. It was  a cold morning when we left. There was no snow, I guess it would had been early  Autumn, before Thanksgiving. My aunt and uncle were my fathers older sister and her husband. They had children, but none of them exceptionally close to me in age or in heart. I had always enjoyed being with adults, even when very young, and my uncle was a strong man, a funny man, it felt pleasing to be around him. Even if he had told me where we were going, with his thick coat, thermos of hot coffee, heavy boots, I never would had guessed what I'd be seeing. I had no idea what he did for a living. I was excited, pleasantly waiting for the surprise of what this man, still mostly a mystery to me, did to earn his pay.  Even if he told me, I had no clue to what a “ slaughterhouse” was. As a child, I didn’t realize where meat came from, what the process was.  

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing the heads, I had tired to keep my own eyes focused on the floor. I saw bloody boots, and white pants smeared with red. I saw gutters and drains, not flowing, or puddled, or splashed, with rain water, but with crimson cattle blood. I remember being very cold.  I am am sure that the conditions of the processing plant demanded a cold environment, but the shocking horror that settled on me, made a chill so intense that I was certain that I had become frozen the point of being brittle. I felt that I was sure to shatter at the presence of any pressure.  To break into a million pieces and to flow into the cold, black drain.

&amp;#x200B;

And the smell, there are no words for it, nothing that I can compare. Imagine the stench of death, and fear, and combine that with the smell of machines, and the smell of working men, industrial cleaning products, and you have fragrance of an early childhood memory that rattled me. I was cold and sick for days. I strayed in my bedroom and didn't speak. Skinless heads were all I could think about during the day, and it was the fuel of my nightmares for months. My parents were slightly concerned at first, but I just told them that I didn't feel well. A cold, the flu.  I never told anyone what the real source  was. I feared that I would be viewed as “weak” or “sissy” by my father. I never blamed my uncle for this dark spot on my early thought. To my uncle, this was daily work, I'm sure he thought nothing of it, to a child, to me, it smacked me like a death bolt to the forehead.",12Oct2018,1

97,"So I have a close friend who I met because she is a close friend of my late husband. They had been friends for decades. 

She is dealing with a crisis - her mother recently went into hospice and she is her primary caretaker - and I have been trying to support her. We had been talking about getting together this weekend for a long time but in vague terms. 

I have been dealing with a health issue that is critical since before my husband passed. He promised he would be there every step of the way but he died. I was scheduled this Monday for the most invasive response possible and have essentially been in a fugue since. 

I told my friend that I would see her tomorrow but only after I go see my therapist. She insisted that it was morning and early afternoon or nothing. (My therapist sees me at noon.) I said I would see her any time after one. She pushed back saying it has to be midmorning. I said I'm sorry I can't make it but I am worried about this invasive procedure and need to talk to my therapy. Also I had a panic attack in  surgeons office this afternoon that needed medical intervention. 

She has sent me a bunch of messages about how she is anxious too and was counting on seeing me etc.

98,"Where do I begin. I will begin by saying that posting this is a big thing for me to do, given that I tend to be narcissistic. That being said, I will begin. 

Last year I saw a psychiatrist because my parents believed me to be depressed and angry. During my sessions, my psychiatrist prescribed me depression meds. The first meds had no effect, so he prescribed different meds, which again had no effect. He prescribed another med that didn’t work again. In our time talking he said it was possible that meds didn’t work for me and talk therapy would be best. In our therapy sessions he had me elaborate on my personal history. So, I will highlight my personal history: 

I have had numerous relationships that end badly. Mostly on my end. I tend to be very antisocial and disregard the significant others needs. So, my significant others always broke it off with me, which made me extremely angry. I would make an effort to ruin them for what they did to me and told them I never loved them. I would go out of my way to give them anxiety. I was reported to the school and they had me on watch. My ex’s parents (every relationship I’ve been in) have confronted my parents calling me manipulative and psychotic. I have a repeated history of getting in trouble for stupid stuff like this. 

Every time my expectations are not met or if I lose control of a situation, I lose my mind. I broke my hand a few months ago from punching a wall because the grade I got on a test was not good. 

I know that everyone is thinking “You’re a sociopath”, but that’s not true. I do have emotions, they just trigger me with anger. 

I tend to be extremely pessimistic and often drink and smoke cigarettes a lot. 

After telling my psychiatrist my history he began to see me trying to manipulate our sessions. Before college started this year, my parents stopped making me go to the sessions and he gave my parents a health script to submit to the school for my ADHD accommodations. On this script, along with the ADHD I also saw that I have an “unspecified neurological disorder”. I didn’t feel like figuring out what that meant, so I just let it go. 

I have also lost friends because of my anger and I have even ruined a few of their lives, dragging away everyone that was close to him and making them side with me by making him look like the psycho. 

I hate myself and have no idea what is wrong with me. I can be normal unless someone does something to me that I don’t like or if I, myself, don’t meet my own expectations, then I lose my f****** mind.
