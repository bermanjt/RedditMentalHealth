0,"I am 19[F] and feel like I'm not your 'typical teenager' that is out enjoying and making the most of their life. Both of my parents were addicts and I was almost taken into care when I was younger as they were not fit to look after me. I was taken in by my grandparents at age 4/5. I was not in contact with my parents for a good few years until I decided I wanted to reach out to them. My parents are both still using currently and my mum got out of prison about 3 years ago. I don't see my dad often but try and make a point of seeing my mum every 2nd week. Although i appreciate my grandparents and love them both, my grandfather made all of the rules and was severely overprotective and a bit of a nasty person at times which caused me to rebel and go down a bit of a bad path at around 13 years old. I began drinking and smoking, I was never a straight A student but was relatively intelligent however i got into a bit of a depression and stopped caring so my grades slipped. My grandfather dealt with things in the complete wrong way and would constantly put me down or make me feel like what i was doing wasn't enough or it wasn't deemed as important in comparison to things other family members were doing. I attended therapy for my depression for a few months and hid it from my grandparents until about a year later when I told my grandfather (also told him about my self harm and how i had had suicidal thoughts) and he laughed at me and told me i didn't even know what stress was.

I have recently been withdrawn from my second year at college due to being absent so many times because I literally couldn't force myself to get out of bed and i didn't want to face people. I now live with my boyfriend of a year and a half in a different city from my home town. I love living with him and I am also due to start a full time job that pays quite well soon so my mood has generally been better. However, I cant stop fucking things up.

I went to my doctor about 4 years ago with concerns i may have bipolar disorder as I am either really happy and confident or really depressed and anxious. Some days I am also just numb and feel nothing. They told me they didn't think I was bipolar and it was probably just my age and my hormones. Fast forward and something still isn't right with me.

I cheated on my boyfriend 6 months into our relationship and had no idea why i had done it other than at that time i had a depressive episode and nothing mattered to me. He forgave me and since I have had a bit of an issue with trying to self destruct (getting involved in doing hard drugs and ending up in horrible situations) I am no longer taking hard drugs though due to them fucking my head up and giving me really bad anxiety. I have put him through way too much and i have no idea why he is still with me. I have not only cheated on him but at times have also spoken to guys i care nothing about in a flirty manner and that really isn't who i think i am. I hate myself for the things i have done but i have no idea why i do these bad things. It's like i turn into a completely different person. I know who i want to be and that is someone who is loyal, loving and happy and sometimes I am that person but other times I am irresponsible, careless and nasty. I feel like I can't control it and it's driving me insane.

My boyfriend has been a massive support to me and I love him more than anything and i just want to stop letting him down but i don't know how to when i don't know why I do the things i do. 

Has anyone else struggled with '2 personalities'? Am i just a horrible person and should I stop trying to make excuses for myself?",19Apr2018,1
1,Today I heard that someone I know takes the exact same (but lower dosage) meds as me. She takes it for her schizophrenia but I have been diagnosed with something else. So is it normal to have the same meds for different conditions or is someone being unprofessional? PS: my meds don't work but hers do. ,19Apr2018,1

I’m terrified of dying, I can’t comprehend not existing and when I think about it I just panic. You’re not there but reality is continuing forever. I can’t describe it very well. What is not existing. I’m terrified of the thought of dying and the eventually cessation of the universe. 
This consumes my entire thinking, I can’t stop panicking until I find an answer, I don’t know what kind of answer I’m looking for, I’m just really really scared. 

Has anyone had any experience with these kinds of thoughts? Do you have any answers??

6,"My god I hate this saying. Family is not always number one. When you have a:

-mother that's constantly negative, yelling, putting her family down

And

-a sister that is a big hypocrite, calls you a bitch, screams and yells at you in public, cuts you off completely, all just for dating someone that doesn't meet her standards

Family isn't always number one for everyone. In most cases it is but some of us aren't lucky enough to have this. So when people say it is and look down on others that don't feel the same way, it truly disgusts me and makes me feel sorry for their lack of knowledge and how oblivious they are.",19Apr2018,3
7,"So, I just made my first call to set up an intake (obligatory yay me, goid job bro). I've been having serious depression and fits of rage ever since I was 14, but I've sort of always muddled through by having great friends who always make time when I call.

I've lived with one of these friends for about 4 years now, and they suffer from a slew of diagnosed mental illnesses. Things got really bad, and it came down to the ultimatum, either they got into therapy and on meds or I would have to kick them out (their mental state was becoming violent and dangerous for myself to be around, and I was scared for both of us). They got into therapy and have made MASSIVE improvements, and I could not be prouder of them.

Ever since then though, my mental state has worsened, leading to a hospitalization 2 years ago and very nearly another one this year. Since the day my negative emotions, intrusive thoughts, and self-loathing came to a head, about a week and a half ago, I have felt emotionally clear and generally positive, despite still struggling with very low self esteem. I have been trying harder at work, writing poetry, working out daily, and have started forming a new band. I've spoken with my family and closest friends about the reality of what has happened this month, and they were all very supportive and truly made me feel like trying to live well again. I was thinking about trying therapy anyways, but am in no rush because I want to really spend all of my time focusing on liking myself better as a person.

Well, my roommate has made it clear to me that the same ultimatum is now on the table, but reversed. Either I get into therapy or they'll leave. This fills me with a lot of fear, mainly because we're horribly codependent and I can't imagine life without them, but also because they are barely able to financially sustain themselves WITH my help. It feels like a threat to attempt to control my actions because I'm so scared to be alone and so scared something might happen to them. I'm really not feeling mentally ready to start this process yet, but if I dont make moves on this, I will be left anxious and feeling (unreasonably) abandoned.

I always say I think everyone needs therapy, I just want be able to drive my pathetic ass there on my own, so I am trying to hold out for that. Its been 12 years that I've been trying to get myself driving though, so they clearly have lost faith that I will ever achieve this minor and seemingly easy goal.

Should I just suck it up, because clearly I DO need some help, or should I make it clear I'm emotionally unready to make this leap?

Also, am I hypocritical for fighting the same expectation I placed on them?",19Apr2018,1
8,"I'm a 20yo female who has just started seeing a therapist for CBT to deal with depression and anxiety. I've had one session so far and my therapist seemed lovely, however I've seen a lot of mention on this sub of finding the ""right"" therapist for you.

9,"All my life I’ve struggled with some sort of identity crisis just never truly knowing who I am and what my priorities are. Sometimes I’m very calm, confident and efficient 100% focused on the task at hand. Some days I am unmotivated, depressed, and irritable. Some days I am rather mischievous, fickle, spontaneous, and foolish, acting with little self control. There is no on or off switch for my behavior, however I wake up feeling is me for the day. These different sides of me have completely different interests (I no longer feel my passion to grow as a martial artist in my depressed state, I find it difficult to do the job I do everyday in my playful state, I am distracted or irritated by things that calm me would brush off without a second thought) However they do not have different names and I don’t black out and struggle to recall what happened when I am not “normal”. I have never seen an actual case of multiple personality disorder outside of fictional depictions, so I don’t know much about what the signs are. Multiple personality disorder has been a bit of an after thought in my mind, I thought maybe I was bipolar but today a coworker told me she thought I might have multiple personalities and her words left me unsettled because that was the first time someone other than myself has mentioned it to me. Was hoping for some expert insight or general thoughts on the matter.",19Apr2018,1
10,"So for nearly 2 years I've had fairly depressive symptoms and recently I have been considering getting help but I have a few issues preventing me.  

First being while I'm Canadian I have no damn clue how our insurance works and can't seem to find a good source that might shed some light on it for me. 


Second, kinda related to the first.  I can't find price points anywhere.  I work a part time job and that's it.  No way I'm attending therapy if it leaves me broker than I already am. I have issues but I've lived the past two or so years with them and while it hasn't been pleasent if it's at the cost of other comforts I don't want to do it yet.


Thirdly. I don't want my parents knowing.  I have my own issues with them but I also live under their roof.  Again I have no idea how our insurance works and don't know whether theirs covers me AND even if it did I wouldn't want to use it as that means they might find out.

12,"Hello peeps I'm a 20 year old male and as a child of around 10/11 I had an episode of a few months of hearing voices telling me to do 'bad things'.

I've done a bit of research and it seems to be children often do experience voices (around 12% apparently) but all these examples are of children much younger than I was (5, 7) and I can't really seem to find any saying these voices were negative.

I can't remember what they said, I remember it being the voice of a man, I was obviously frightened and told my parents but they just let it pass. Haven't had any experiences of that since that initial episode and am inclined to just agree and say it was a childhood thing.

Should I be concerned, I've been really interested in people experiences and stories relating to mental illness and been hearing that you normally develop these conditions at around 21-23 and got hit with a bit of anxiety.

tl:dr heard 'commanding' voices as a child (10/11) none since then but want to know of should be concerned

13,"Feel free to ignore this. It's a long read that I'm not gonna bother editing. 

TL:DR Took adderall for the first time today. Still in my system. It helped me get thru today and I actually don't feel depressed right now and now I'm afraid I'm going to become dependant. I still asked my friend to get me more. If not, I'm making my parents get me a prescription. 

I'm a freshman in college right now and I have never been diagnosed for anything. I don't know if that's due to my parents' (mainly my dad's) active denial that mental health is a thing and it's something you don't actively choose to have. But that's besides the point. Over time, I have found that I may have OCD, depression, and most recently ADD/ADHD. I am very confident I have ARFID because I have always had extreme anxiety over eating foods I'm not familiar with, eating in public, etc. I could go on about it. Anyways the whole point of me making this post was to just say I finally caved from the stress of college classes and took adderall for the first time. I actually have had possession of one pill for about a week now. I was originally planning on taking it for a chem exam but I knew I was fucked for it anyways and decided to save it for my chem lab report that's due tomorrow. The effects are still in me, I had originally thought they wore off after only seven hours but they came back after I took a shower. I'm not sure what my original reason for wanting to post this, I'm just waiting for my friend to call me so we can finish this report. I will say I had another lab report that was due I think a week ago that took me 10 hours to do. This time, with adderall, I was able to get the majority of it done in less than 2 hours. 

I'm not sure what else to put, I just currently feel fidgety from not working on my report and I have not felt this confident and not depressed since maybe the 3rd grade. I'm just writing to kill time so apologies for any grammar or spelling errors. 

I just don't want the effects to wear off I like the feeling I'm getting from being on adderall. I'm afraid I'm going to be addicted to that feeling and become dependant on it for various reasons. I'm still going to convince my parents to get me a prescription for some, maybe not for the other possible issues I have. I'm too afraid of being sent somewhere. I just need something to get me thru this semester that isn't hard drugs or alcohol. 

I guess if anyone has any advice on how to cope (literally just cope, my brain has completely shut down this far into the semester) feel free to leave a comment below. All I know is I had one of the worst mental breakdowns yesterday this semester alone and I'm sick of having to stress out over classes that aren't even going towards my major because I switched too late to change my classes. Sorry this post is long, even with adderall I still ramble on and on about stuff that doesn't make sense. I'll probably delete later if I even remember too. ",19Apr2018,2
14,"So pretty much I’m a wreck of a person and my emotions aren’t cohesive at all. From spontaneous bouts of sadness to feeling upset in a millisecond also I become annoyed very easily. I’ve been to a therapist and I felt indifferent towards the treatment...didn’t help @ all waste of money and time. I’ve never been diagnosed with any mood disorders just went for my debilitating crippling anxiety. I do experience depersonalization and derealization. The crushes I’ve developed on people have gone to far starting off from a light innocent liking to straight up on my mind every waking moment obsessions and it takes me weeks to maybe months to get over people I like it’s not hard for me to catch feelings for people either. The aftermath of getting over my crushes aren’t easy either I’m left feeling really despondent and detached and numb sometimes suicidal thoughts creep in. I get really upset or even sad over the smallest of things and there are other times when they don’t bother me as much I feel content with life. But all of these feelings at once and mood switches are much too exhausting for me and cause me to feel like I’m have ten different people with different personalities living inside me not to mention my anxiety and I don’t know what to do....😣 (also I hold grudges which I’m actively trying to change)

Edit: I’ve not been to a psychiatrist but I’ve been to a therapist and I detested it.... it makes me cringe just even thinking about it. I’ve also considered taking meds but idk if I’m ok with the whole side effects.

I am currently in a psychotherapy clinic in Austria to get treatment for PTSD and am actually pleased to say I am already feeling a positive change or at least I did. 

On Monday a new patient got admitted and when I saw her I was in complete shock: she looks exactly like my abuser (I am talking same eyes, hair, overall body shape and even her voice and gestures are terrifyingly similar). To keep things short: I tried to ignore the triggers  since she befriended my group of friends here and ended up having horrifying flashbacks, night terrors and laying down in the middle of the street as a result of a nervous breakdown. 

The therapists and doctors here tell me there's not much I can do other than ignore her and just isolate myself. Now I am sitting here feeling helpless because no-one acknowledges my issue and I feel like I can't continue treatment as long as she's here. What should I do?

I struggle with anxiety, social anxiety, am subject to occasional bouts of (non-severe) depression and am currently going through tests to determine if I have aspergers or not (the results of the tests won't come until after I have accepted or not).

So the school has a lot of support for mentally ill students. But I'm really worried about how I'll react to being away from home in a different city.

I spent the two or so months after my husband's death pretty actively suicidal. I won't go into detail but it was real bad and I struggled to find therapy or support. At one point I went to the local psych ER because I was like, fuck, I need help. 

It was pretty traumatic. I had to give them everything including my wedding ring and sit there in my stocking feet for hours. When a counselor finally saw me she literally said I would be taken in patient, put on at least three medications with rapid titration, put in mandatory group therapy, and she couldn't say how long I would be there but it would be at least a week. When I said that I work and need to pay the bills and, you know, have a fucking dog, she said that a social worker would handle that for me. 

I noped the hell out of that, insisting that I wasn't actually that bad. (I was.). I do not have the infrastructure to just disappear for a week and I don't have the constitution to not be allowed to wear my wedding ring or books (another rule) for an untold amount of time. I also have bills to pay and they told me that if I wanted to check out before they approved it, there is a three day wait. I am an hourly wage worker. How in the hell. 

Since then, on top of everything, I am dealing with a health scare that is a) bad and b) not one doctor understands but c) is now so visible my coworkers are asking if I am seeing a doctor. (I am.)

But my therapist, who doesn't know this because I wasn't seeing him then, thinks I am dissociating as a coping method.  He wanted me to try to feel my sadness/grief and I tried and it is absolutely as overwhelming as it was before. 

Is there a way to talk to my therapist about this without involuntary commitment? The vague ""a social worker will handle everything"" inspires zero confidence in me about handling my responsibilities in life and I really really do not want to be in a mental hospital and forced to take meds. I am not opposed to meds, as long as I can talk to my doc about them and start slow and monitor side effects.

In retrospect the relationship had problems but I was still happy. The one thing holding me back though is that ever since moving to university I've been experiencing what I can only expect to be some form of social anxiety. I've not spoken to anyone professionally so I don't want to diagnose myself or anything but I find it incredibly exhausting to be around unfamiliar people and as a result avoid it. I also experience nausea in my stomach when I'm forced to sit in the middle of a row in lectures, I find it hard to focus on anything and I basically have to sit there feeling like I'm going to throw up for 20 minutes until I calm down. This was usually done by texting my ex. I think this why I've found it so hard to make course mates, I had to leave lectures a lot at the beginning of university. I think a large reason why our relationship broke down was me going through periods of feeling inadequate and jealous when I really didn't need to. It was unfair on her but I really couldn't help it.

We broke up around 3 weeks ago because of something I did drunk. I have no memory of what happened but it was vile and I'd rather not discuss the specifics. 3 days after it happened we broke up at 3am over text. I think the fact that I have no memory of what happened and the break up was over text is a large reason why I'm struggling to process that we're not together anymore. Since breaking up we didn't speak for a week, after which she messaged me saying that she didn't want to throw away our friendship because we didn't work out and that if she could rewind to last year (we dated for 11 months) she would. We continued speaking for 2 and a half weeks but after coming back to University we fell out. I think this was because I'd largely failed to internalize and accept the fact that we're not together anymore due to the circumstances of the break up. Ever since falling out again I've felt so so low. I have no motivation, I've not eaten a proper meal in 3 days, I go through periods of just wanting to sleep and not interact with people. I find no interest in doing what I'd usually enjoyed doing and I can't focus on my work. I was up until 6:30am last night and purposefully skipped my lecture this morning, something I've never done before. I even have intrusive thoughts about ending my life or harming myself, which when I put it down into words seems so ridiculous because I don't think I ever would, but there we go. I've sent her a long message explaining where I'm at mentally and that if she wants to be my friend like she says then that's what I really need right now. She's not replied since seeing it which is fair enough but I just, don't know what to do. I'm worried that when I speak to a professional they're going to tell me there's nothing wrong with me and that it just turns out I'm a ****. I don't want to be a bad person, I never meant to hurt her :(

I don't have any close friends of my own and I'm finding university such a lonely place. I just feel so empty, I just need someone to care and someone to help me :(

EDIT: From the UK.

**For context on what I actually did as far as I know I never physically harmed her. I'm not a threat to her and have no intention of harassing her or harming her. I think that needs to be established.**",19Apr2018,2

47,"I'm a 25 year old female from the US. I've struggled with anxiety, mostly social, for most of my life, which mostly stemmed from my childhood family/school experiences. Basically, I have a default assumption that everyone is against me. That nobody REALLY likes me, just tolerates me. And as a now married woman, it's very difficult to live with. 

What breaks my heart is that I don't trust my husband. Whenever his phone goes off, I assume it's another woman. If he doesn't text me back right away, I assume it's because he's sick of me and doesn't want to. If he comments on another women's photo, who's an old college friend, I fly off the handle and get upset. We've gotten into arguments over it because he's upset I don't believe him or trust him, even though he's told me time and time again.

57,"*Content warning: Airplanes, disasters, tragedies, 9/11

I am diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and ADHD-combined type. I believe what I'm about to describe is all three illnesses working together to spiral me out of control. 

On Monday I flew home from a business trip, Denver to Dulles on a United 737. I was 8 when 9/11 happened and I was petrified of airplanes for a years afterwards. I was also very close to the pentagon attack, living just outside of DC. I finally conquered my fear a few years ago and have been flying comfortably since. 

The day after I flew home, the infamous Southwest flight where the engine exploded happened. I was surprisingly composed when I found out. It wasn't until my cousin informed me that Southwest had one other mishap over the weekend and Delta also had one that didnt make headlines when I started to panic. He linked me to [this article](https://thepointsguy.com/news/southwest-flight-severe-turbulence/) and a coworker sent me [this one](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Flight-Makes-Emergency-Landing-at-Dulles-After-Losing-Tire-480017093.html?amp=y). The article on the Southwest flight to New Orleans scared me shitless. Reading the journalist's tweets about people contacting their families made me feel like I was there. I has a full blown panic attack. 

I was able to calm down from the panic attack, but my mind was still spiraling. I started researching commercial airline mishaps, crashes, and tragedies. I blew through documentaries of the most disturbing ones I could find. I would rewind the dramatized crash scenes and watch them over and over. I also watched the crash scene from Denzel Washington's ""Flight"" movie. I wouldn't even say I was panicked or scared, but my adrenaline was rushing. When I would hear the panic screams, my adrenaline would rush. It was like I grew addicted to the adrenaline and I couldn't stop. 

Of course as one could expect, this YouTube binge brought me to 9/11 videos and I started to spiral further, but in a much darker way. I started out with flight related videos, focusing on the recordings we have from flights 11, 93, and 77. Specifically the calls from the flight attendants on board. The videos on the flights that hit the towers started a whole new spiral. I started watching the most disturbing, gruesome, and chilling videos available on the internet about the WTC that day. I watched many videos of the jumpers. I listened to detailed survivor stories. I listened to the WTC phone calls. I watched the towers collapse over and over. I can still hear those souls' panicked voices and screams. I couldn't stop. I still cant. I didnt sleep. I was up all night watching and reading. I am at work now look for every possible free moment to continue watching and reading. 

I have no idea why my mind reacted this way. It started with an airplane mishap and ended with one of the biggest massacres known to man. Talk about an overreaction, right? I dont understand why my brain suddenly got addicted to tragedy and was consuming it like a drug. It was disturbing and shocking to me. I dont even feel panicked or fearful. Just calm. Curious, but too curious. My best theory is that my panic triggered my depression and ADHD. The depression probably decided the dark subject matter and the ADHD fueled the over-comsumption. Im still having a hard time calming down. Ive been at work all day and have gotten nothing done. I feel like Im going to go home and keep on going with my YouTube binge. Thanks to YouTube's algorithms, I will probably be shown many related videos and I'm trying to figure out how I can get myself to stop. ",19Apr2018,1
58,"I posted this yesterday in r/relationships but it was removed. This seems like a more appropriate sub for advice.

**TL;DR:** My wife has been dealing with severe depression since late 2015. She spent two weeks in the psych department. Got out and stopped taking prescribed meds after her second appointment with a psychologist. She learned how to manage her panic attacks. Arguments about silly/overblown topics  started around late 2017. Accusations of breaking her personal stuff and feelings of being watched emerged. In January of this year she started accusing me of having poured ""some kind of liquid"" in her hair. Days go by, accusations get worse, and a few days before our birthdays, she tries to kill me while I was sleeping. Ends up stabbing me a total of three times. The injuries were thankfully not serious. She is in a prison ward of a hospital. Two weeks have gone by. She is currently stable and taking medication, but still believes the same crazy ideas and has not mentioned what she tried to do.

I apologize before hand because I know this is going to be a long read, but I will try to make it as short as possible.

**Background** - We've been together a total of 13 years. we have two kids (5 and 7). It was a long distance relationship at first, until I was old enough to work and bring her to this country. It was a perfectly normal relationship. We have so much in common and have been through a lot together. We have supported each other through everything. We basically grew up together. Both of our families are really close.

I really don't know where to start with this, but here goes nothing. In 2013, our second daughter was born. To my wife, the birth was a traumatic event because she believed that she was going to lose her life giving birth, due to the fact that she was administered Epidural (twice). After the first dosage, she was still feeling pain, and by the second dosage of Epidural, she wasn't feeling anything at all, and therefore, she believed that she couldn't breathe and was going to die. To the doctor, it was a pretty normal birth with no risks involved. Since that event, she became fearful of anesthesia and fearful of dying, but showed no signs of depression/anxiety/etc...

After that, life was pretty normal, the relationship was going strong and our kids were happy. In comes 2015 and she begins to ask slightly concerning questions. 

*""Do you ever get thoughts of just jumping in front of a train or hitting someone for no reason?""* 

I respond with: 

*""Sure, these are called intrusive thoughts, pretty much everyone has them from time to time and it's just our brain being curious, just you know, never act on them...""*

Fast forward a few months later and she asks me if it would be possible for a completely normal person to lose their mind. At the time, I did not believe it to be possible, so I said no.

I never really gave it much thought, and after that, she never asked me anything weird again, so I left it at that. 

Then, around late July of 2015, we were looking at pictures on Reddit (I don't remember the sub), and we came across a picture of a few friends that were at a club and a few hours later they died in a horribly graphic car accident. This picture triggered something in her mind and she started crying. she cried for HOURS while I tried to console her, and all she mumbled was: ""I want my mommy"", ""I love you a lot"". At around 3am I fall asleep, and so does she (or so I thought). I woke up at 6am and she was awake and saying crazy things that didn't make sense. She was pacing back and forth, throwing herself on the couch, making sexual gestures, saying she wanted to die, and by that point, I knew she was having a mental break down. 

I called my mom so she could watch the kids and I took my wife to the ER. She was admitted immediately and given sedatives/meds, and went to sleep. By the next day, she was sane and lucid again, although she was visibly shaking a bit. She spent two weeks in the psychiatric department and was diagnosed with severe depression. She was prescribed antidepressant medication and was told to follow up with a psychologist in order to help her with the anxiety and panic attacks.

She went to a total of two appointments. Then psychologist told her that she didn't really need to continue seeing him, and that all she needed to do was face her fears of dying by going to a cemetery. She actually never went to one but she was able to manage and overcome her panic attacks. She then used this as an excuse to discontinue taking her medication, and that was that. All this happened in a span of (give or take) two months.

Time went by, all seemed normal, and my wife did not appear to be depressed anymore. I was happy, she was happy, the kids were happy.

In comes 2017. She starts having ""abdominal pain, chest pain, etc"" but she claims that it isn't panic attacks. She makes an array of appointments, gets tested, results come back negative. This does not ease her fears, but she does not voice any concerns over it. 

Then the arguments start, over anything and everything. Every word is overblown. I get to a point where I simply don't want to argue anymore, specially not in front of our kids... so I would just space out, ignore her, and stop talking to her until she calmed down. Sometimes she would calm down the same day, sometimes it would take three days. One day she wanted to make love, and the very next day, as soon as I woke up, she would start arguing with me because she had a bad dream. 

Then the accusations of having a lover started to appear. Mind you, I don't go out alone. We go out together or as a family, everywhere. From my house to my job, and back, every day.

In comes 2018. She starts accusing me of pouring some type of liquid in her hair while we were sleeping together on the couch (right after sex). At first she was claiming it was a perfume that belonged to my lover. Then she claimed it was witchcraft. Then she claimed it was something to make her crazy, and so on... That's when I realized that she needed to make an appointment with a psychiatrist before she got worse and relapsed. 

She would whole heartedly decline going and instead would make appointments with different doctors and MANY trips to the ER in order to know what illness *I* had given her. Every time she was given the results (perfectly healthy, no illness, no sickness, etc), she would just become more emboldened in her beliefs that it was some kind of witchcraft.

All of this became a cycle. She would accuse me of something ridiculous, and the very next day she would expect me to be intimate with her, or else, I was with someone else. I always tried my absolute best to comprehend her feelings and once we were together, I would have hope that everything would be normal again between us, but then she would accuse me again! My heart and soul was crushed every time...

About four weeks ago, she stopped eating and sleeping. She dropped a lot of weight. She wouldn't eat anything in the house because she believed it was poisoned. I would always try my best to cheer her up so she could rest a bit and eat something. Sometimes it would work, other times she would have a nervous break down, accuse me of trying to poison her, and completely freak out, until I would call her mom, and she would manage to calm her down. Immediately after calming down, she would fall into deep sleep on the couch. 

About two weeks ago, I wake up and get ready for work. Before I leave, my wife starts begging me to stay with her, saying she didn't want to be alone. I felt extremely bad, so I called in, and stayed with her. She then proceeded to fall asleep on the couch. A few minutes would go by and she would wake up scared, she would then look at me, and fall right back to sleep. I pretty much spent the whole day watching her doze off, and I felt good because I knew she wasn't getting ANY sleep at all. Before you know it, it's midnight and I'm on my PS4, she asks me to pass the glass of water that's next to me, I pass it to her, and continue playing. A few minutes go by and she starts accusing me of poisoning the water, she starts trying to vomit, but doesn't succeed. She then puts clothes on and rushes to the ER, mean while, I'm just sitting there, in shock. She comes back literally a few minutes later, calls her mother, tells her what is happening, and her mother tries to calm her down. I decided to give her some space by sleeping in our kids room (kids were at grandma's house). At around 2am she enters the room and I wake up, she starts asking me why is she feeling that way, why is she going through this, etc... I tell her that I am extremely tired and really need to sleep in order to go to work in the morning. She looks at me, gets up, says okay, and leaves the room (she has done this before, some times it lead to sex, not this time though). At around 4am, I feel an extreme sharp pain in my back and I turn around **immediately**, only to see my wife stabbing multiple times. I try my best to get a hold of her hands, I feel a lot of blood dripping down my back, and I literally thought I was going to die. I manage to grab her hands, stood up from the bunk bed, and struggled with her all the way to the front door of the apartment. I opened up the door with one hand, and with the other still grabbing my wife's hands, all while also screaming my lungs out for help. No one opened their doors, so I quickly push her out of the apartment and close the door. I looked for my phone and dialed 911, the rest is history...

Now I sit here, on my birthday, wondering how to feel. I have been feeling sorry for her, thinking that she didn't do this in her right mind, and that she wasn't aware of what she was doing. But after finding out (via her mother) that she has been cooperating with her eval and taking the meds that they are giving her, two weeks later, she STILL believes the same crazy ideas she had. I don't even know if she knows what she did. She blames me for being locked up in a prison ward of a hospital as if she did nothing to be there.

I guess I was expecting her to be sane and lucid enough to reach out to me and ask for forgiveness, but nope. She flat out refuses to call me and blames me for being where she is. 

My questions are, will the medicine help her stop believing her crazy delusions, or will she be broken forever? Have you ever dealt with this? What was your experience? Did the person ever become normal again? How does this even happen? I still love her as if this never happened, how do I even move on from this? I still want to help her no matter what, but how do you even help someone who thinks you're evil? Am I the trigger itself? I have so many freaking questions and I just feel lost and broken. What do I tell my kids?

68,"So I'm under review by my university on whether I should continue studying, full blown panel. 

Can't call whether they'll suspend me or not. I fucked up and did something really stupid n naive when I was in really dark place. At the time I'd had repressed memories burst out of the back of my mind, it sent me spiralling and I was sat in a noose at the top of a stairwell, notes ready, but I'm too much of a non-committal coward and couldn't go through with it (happened almost every time over the years, other than when my mate followed me n stopped me). Same happened a week or so later, tried to jump off a cliff - I was just crying and crying, but so angry at myself because I couldn't do it. Right at the edge, all it took was one step, beautiful day, beautiful spot, fully behind my decision to dip but nothing. 

Around the same time just dove right back into heavy drug n alcohol abuse. Spend more of the past 3 years high as balls than sober. 

Long story short tho, because of my actions I'm under review, they might suspend me. Come from an abusive home, whole life was building to getting out. Already had to suspend last year my mental health was so bad. Obviously doesn't really bloody help, going back to the home from hell. Super depressed and bipolar mother who can't differentiate reality from her mind when really bad. Super depressed alcoholic dad who can't cope with my mum n turned into a monster too. Both psychologically, physically, emotionally abusive. Got choked out by my dad 2 weeks ago. Great day guys. 
Shit like this happened my whole life, the few earliest bits of childhood I can remember are of police, fighting my dad, abuse from them both, all fun stuff. Not making excuses, but there's a reason I'm an angry wreck myself. 
Despite my family situation and them being dicks about funding me, they still have. They've made it abundantly clear if I fail again it's over. 

If I get suspended I can't lie, they'll find out and it'll be very explosive. Much worse than just failing. 
Ironically because I'm working so hard to pass my mental health is the best it's been in years. I mean, that coupled with being choked out - good incentive to work hard for my future and get fit to defend myself now. But, if the uni suspends me, I'm stuck. I'll have to drop out as they can't afford to cover mine and my siblings' rent. On paper we make enough, in reality we're drowning in debt. They're probably eager to get rid of me, so almost certainly will suspend and they can take my 9k n discard a problem student. 

Issue is, it's honestly a fate worse than death living full time in that house normally. In these circumstances it'll be purgatory. Got depressed originally because my fantasy for my late teen years was uni, built it up in my head to be this amazing place where I'd always be happy. In reality it was shit and when your whole life is getting out and it's as bad in different ways, not so good. Now because of this situation not only have I sacrificed my future, but actually have managed to get back into the house and in a worse situation.
I don't have any recourse, and I'm planning on getting a whole lot of weed, booze, painkillers and anti depressants, getting fucked up and jumping off a cliff in the woods. Rather than return there. Rather than face a life I've fucked up for myself. 
It'll be nice. I'm a little sad to lose all the potential tied up inside the time I have left, but I've fucked myself and that future through my own idiocy anyway. It's not that I want to die, like when I have a depressive episode - but have no option. Reasoning it out, I'd rather do this than go back into that house in such a bad situation. 
I'm going to drop all my close friends a message on fb when im waved asf and let em know how much they mean and how their lives are gonna rock. 
Not gonna say shit to my parents, probably will write a note to my sister. 
Take in the sunset, get so fucked on painkillers I'll either die quick or slow, so quick'll be the nicest way to go n just jump. 

It just sucks I'm in this position. I've nobody to blame but myself. It came about because I felt isolated and like my uni's dropped me to the side, waiting for me to self-destruct. Now through my own idiocy I've given the self-destruct button to a for-profit enterprise that gets my fees at the end of the day and is probably all to happy to see the back of me. 
I'm here just waiting a fortnight for that panel result, working all day and all night in the hope of passing these exams I know they won't let me sit. I can't tell them what'll happen if they suspend me as they'll use that as grounds to suspend. It's pretty shit. I can't even use Big White Wall, a resource the uni gives to help, because if I do they'll use the address my account is registered with to contact the uni and again, use it as grounds to suspend.
But at least I'll be out of here. I'll get to become part of the woods that have always been my escape fantasy, from a child who couldn't understand to an adult who couldn't cope with understanding. Quite poetic really that the warm arms of the woodlands which sheltered me from shit at home, shit in my own head, watched me grow to the man I am now, will finally embrace me for good and protect me forever. Part of me can't wait.

To put it like this: I cannot any longer separate which of my memories are real and which are not. It worries me, because I no longer trust my own perceptions at all. Is that man friendly? Is he not? How can I know when I no longer trust my intuition?",19Apr2018,6
76,"So I had to take a medical leave from college because of my OCD and how much it started to derail my life. I've been home for a month receiving ERP therapy. 

However, all I keep thinking about is college and how I must get back to college because my entire life has been shaped around getting prepared for college so not being there is a complete change for me. 

I never take breaks, like my whole life is basically school and OCD.  

But although I'm not in school, I keep worrying about my job in the future, worrying if I will qualify for a job, worrying if I will be successful in the future and just like worrying about everything pertaining to a job/future/college.

I spend hours googling about job advice/college because I fear that if I do not worry about it now then I will never get a job in the future. 

How does one focus on the present moment? like I mean isn't it important to worry about the future and be prepared...? ",19Apr2018,1
77,"I'm not sure where to ask, maybe there's a more relevant subreddit for this.

I think there's something wrong with her. She's contradicted herself in the past (doing one thing, then denying it) but I thought she only does it because she gets upset. She makes things up about me and our relationship (as in I never help at home or I set my family up against her). But what's worrying me now is that I was just talking to her and she wasn't saying anything. I complained that she wasn't listening and then she strongly insisted that she had replied to me. She didn't even open her mouth or even talked softly, but she was completely convinced she had talked to me when she didn't.

Suddenly, it clicked in me. She complains sometimes about me not listening to her. She goes mad, says she gave me details in previous conversations and I think ""Perhaps I didn't pay enough attention"", but it happens so often that now I think she really doesn't say them, only that she perceives like she does. What if she's absolutely convinced she talks to me when she actually doesn't? Should I look for symptoms of mental illness? I'm going to pay extra attention to confirm this.

For context, I've had a rough year with her (the marriage as a whole hasn't been too great anyway, for many reasons). We had a daughter and there was some friction with the in-laws that escalated to big fights, basically because she refused to do anything other than visiting her parents every day, even on holidays. It's nearly impossible to make any other plans. I'm talking about her seeing her parents all year long, save for one day a week sometimes. She's also on the phone with her mother several times a day. This was true before the baby as well.

If this is not the place to ask about this, please direct me to where I could talk to someone. I need some guidance because we've done some counseling with a half-friend (she stormed off twice in three sessions and completely quit it much sooner than me) and there's no way I'll ever convince her to see an independent psychologist.",19Apr2018,3
78,"After waiting for 4 months for a time (I'm using public side healthcare, cannot afford private (I'm Finnish)), I finally got a time to my first therapy session, which will be tomorrow morning. I sort of feel good about it.

I had some visits earlier to see my situation, but the psychiatrist couldn't pinpoint any specific disorders at that point, so I'm hoping to get a diagnosis soon enough. I have bi-polar -like symptoms, as well as some psychotic symptoms, plus dangerous self harming behavior. It's been getting progressively worse over time and it's exhausting the hell out of me, so I'm really hoping the therapy etc. will help. I'm getting tired of all the bullshit that has been brought along and I just want to enjoy at least some parts of life again.",19Apr2018,1
79,"My best friend, let's call him John, has been having a bad time lately. Ever since he got his highschool diploma he's never completed anything else. He started two studies but dropped out after losing interest. The only ever returning interest of his is the military. Since a year or 2 he's been wanting to join. Sadly we have a policy in Holland where it states that if you fail your physical your gonna have to wait for half a year or so before trying again. 3 times he has now weezeled out from that physical whilst being in very good physical shape. Blaming it on not being able to run as fast as needed. 
In January he signed up again and said that at the end of April he would try again. With a lot of zeal I might add. April comes and again he's starting to think about dropping out again. We (his two best friends) are really fed up with this routine and whenever we confront him about it he only blames himself. Hiding behind the fact that he already knows and that he is his own worst enemy. How do I help him break that system of self demotivation so that he can finally do something he actually wants? 
Sorry for long post. Thanks in advance for any advice!",19Apr2018,1
80,"I have struggled with dysfunction my whole life, and after I turned 15, began to develop depression, body dysmorphia, and anxiety. Now, as a 23-year old, I struggle with regular panic attacks, anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies. I have tried meditation, antidepressants, yoga, exercise, spirituality, and love. My situation has only worsened over time, affecting my day-to-day activities and my ability to focus. I have recently realized that a part of me enjoys my suffering, and sees it fit. Is this because of being brought up in a traumatic environment, where abuse and hate were a regular affair? Does a part of me believe it is safe only if it suffers? I do not understand what the core is: Do I desire conflict and suffering because I am familiar with it, or because I feel safe in such an environment? I have tried affirmations to overcome my self-hate and replace it with self-love. So far it has worked, but it has yielded no results in enhancing my state. I try to dig deeper and deeper into my condition with meditation, but the suffering has now completely depleted my abilities. I would really appreciate any insights into my condition, as I cannot afford medical care as a student in the country where I study. ",19Apr2018,2
81,"Hi,

A member of my immediate family suffers from stimulant laxative abuse, it is only relatively minor (around 10 pills a day for a few years). Whilst this isn't really a problem, I have the odd day where it gets to me and I want to talk about it? Would it be ok to talk about it, even though it doesn't really affect me?

Thanks",19Apr2018,1

85,"I once read this idea that people suffering from physical or mental health have a certain number of mental ""popsicle sticks"" in a jar each day. Each time they exert energy into something, it takes one of the popsicle sticks. Once they don't have any more popsicle sticks, they're drained and can't do anything else pretty much. 

It explained how I and a lot of other people struggling with daily physical and mental issues feel. Does anyone know what this ""theory"" or whatever is called?",19Apr2018,1

88,I’m trying to hold an event at my college (special needs college) to raise awareness for mental health and hopefully get some money to donate to a mental health charity called mind/younger minds because I suffer from anxiety and I was also close to suffering depression as well all from high school. ,19Apr2018,2
89,"I have anxiety and see a therapist etc. and deal with it mostly that way.  My sister is a teenager and she has depression/anxiety.  She recently started therapy and her therapist is consistently suggesting medication as the path forward. My family is pretty skeptical because this therapist hasn't really worked with her for very long, and because she's so young and her brain is still developing etc. Is it completely irrational and phobic to be skeptical of this suggestion? My sister is convinced that this is what she wants and I want to support her but I'm also skeptical because I think its a bit weird that her therapist would suggest it after a couple of months.... We also live in an area where people have a tendency to just throw medication at any mental health problem so I'm just wondering what the more generic wisdom is with providing meds for teenagers?",19Apr2018,1
