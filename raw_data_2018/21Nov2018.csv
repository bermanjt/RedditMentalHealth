0,"I have had depression ever since I was nine. From between twelve and thirteen I cried myself to sleep every night and there were days I considered suicide. After some time I started to feel better, or at least that’s what I thought. 

The constant sadness and the crying faded away (I’m bad at describing everything I was going through...). But the problem is those things were all I had. I didn’t feel happy, I just felt numb and it was the worst feeling in the world. So me and my brilliant brain decided that constantly feeling nothing was much worse than what I was feeling before. I was very, very wrong. 

I “induced” depression on myself. I remembered every single thought I had, every suicide note and every emotion and wrote it on a paper. I kept reading it every chance I had and soon enough the feelings came back. Once again I felt that being like that was much worse than before. Feeling nothing was better than being depressed. 

Now I’m fifteen years old and it hasn’t stopped. The time that takes for me to “switch” is now much shorter (a month, maybe two). 

I’m on a loop where I feel depressed then decide to feel numb again on purpose but the second I feel numb I decide to induce depression again. 

I’ve tried everything, I changed my daily routine, tried to get less sleep (I was sleeping almost 13 hours a day), tried to eat less (which almost led me to start starving myself but that’s a different story) and exercised one or two hours a day, but it’s still the same thing.

I have no idea how to get out of this and I’m starting to feel more hopeless than before. I’ll keep trying but if it keeps happening over and over again in 2019 I think I’m just going to give up. Living like this just doesn’t seem worth it. If anyone has any suggestions I’d be happy to try them out. ",21Nov2018,1
1,"Hi guys, 

So I was told 1 in 5 people can have a dependency on weed.
 I've been smoking for almost 2 years and for the longest time I didn't want to believe it was making my anxiety worse. Even if it was, I would just smoke to stop being anxious.
 I also am an over thinker, weed just helps slow my thoughts down. But now when I'm not high it's like an overload in my brain. My tolerance is also pretty high at this point. 
More over. I was just told that weed is easy to quit cold turkey. Yes probably for most people it is. Defenatly easier that cigs.
Basically  I'm trying to stop smoking recreational weed for 6 weeks to see how my mental health does. I'm not sure if it will improve or not. 
But I myself am finding it hard to quit cold turkey. I don't really like being thought as fitting in somewhere to just another general study. I'm me. And I'm saying it IS a little hard! But I need to slowly reduce it I think,  and not just quit on a dime.
 I was also told by a doctor that addiction and dependency are the same thing. 
Any thoughts on this? 
Also please share if you have related in any sort of way at some point or another. 
Please. I feel like people think it's a big joke that I'm having a hard time quiting. ",21Nov2018,1
2,"I'm trying to get some understanding of this person.

Person seems genuinely nice and harmless.  
No clear indication they're acting maliciously.

Person believed they were a 'monster' growing up.  
Person in is hypersensitive to any perceived criticism.

Person is not immoral, but has no solid morals/ethics.  
Person is not antisocial, but doesn't adhere to social norms.

Person is able to infiltrate a social group very quickly, becoming very close to core members.  
Person admits to putting on an act to win favour, but also admits they often eventually mess-up.

Person becomes very intense and codependent in relationships, can seem committed.  
Person can turn off intense emotions easily if their partner is deemed unsuitable.

Person during arguments becomes robotic and detached emotionally.  
Person during arguments is deflective: pulls apart everything being said and gaslights.

This person does genuinely seem harmless and nice, only sign of any negative behavior is the emotional abuse during arguments but even then it doesn't seem to be intentional rather it's a result of someone with significant emotional issues. What I'm finding particularly interesting is their uncanny ability to infiltrate social groups, they claim to be socially awkward but are able to become very popular with seemingly little effort, it's hard to put across but it seems abnormal.

I've had sociopath and narcissist suggested but I'm uncertain - they don't have a big ego so narcissist doesn't seem to fit, and they aren't antisocial or clearly manipulative and seem nice/harmless so sociopath as I understanding it doesn't fit.",21Nov2018,1
3,"So, I'm 15 years old girl, and I have this problem that, when I get mad at myself for something ((not everything like 'oh snap, my pencil broke', things like fighting with someone I care about)) I get this urge to hurt myself. Not anything extreme or that I know that can kill me, just like, I'll bite into my arm untill blood comes out, or I'll bang my head on the wall a few times. I don't feel anything while I'm getting hurt, just after it, and if I don't do it I get this horrible feeling untill I find a way to harm myself enough.
I don't know if this is a mental illness or just hormones ((considering that I'm on my 15))
It's really self destructive and I wish I knew how to stop it, I'm planning on going to a psychologist, but while I can't get one, anyone have tips? The best thing I do its try to find any zits to pop, since it hurts a bit and I get rid of them.

Thanks in advance ^^",21Nov2018,1
4,"Lately I'm having very strange mood swings. Well, to be more precise, I've been experiencing them since I was younger (now I'm 21), but in the past couple of years I've been facing these more frequently and intensely (since I'm in university and away from home).

There are two periods.
Period No. 1. - I call it the 'Efficient phase'. The name speaks for it self- at this time I'm very motivated about my life, I want to fight my weaknesses, I sometimes even want to happen some misfortune to me so I can defeat it. I'm very perfectionist at such times-I clean my room, study hard etc.. The problem is that I'm too much obsessed to do everything PERFECTLY. For example: I study for so long at the night that my mind begins to hurt + because of the exhaustion the next day I felt awful and become sick. Normally (not in this phase) I never do this. My health comes first to me ( but I also  have good grades). But when this mood kicks in I feel an invincible urge to do my very very best at everything. I HAVE to properly fold my clothes etc.or else here comes the 'Period No. 2. The efficient phase always lasts lesser than the other and the first signs are sudden increasement of motivation (like I have strenght to do everything), I feel a weird tingling in my thighs and wrists, then I walk more confidently, talk more slowly and clearly than usually. My whole personality becomes more serious, responsible and formal. Like I'm not myself. 

Period No. 2. - The 'Aphatetic phase'. Usually comes after the No. 1.or if I faild 'defeating' something etc. This can last for days or weeks. What frigthens me a bit, that this phase starts lately to overtake my 'normal phase'. In this period of time I have very low motivation to do anything that doesn't  make me feel good (you know like waking up early, studying etc.) , I do my duties with minimal effort, I overeat myself (I treat myself with food that I survived the day-but this is not drastic, I just don't do it normally), if this period is long enough then my grades start to drop etc. Most of the time this period ends with what I call the 'Great fall' (that I'm worthless etc.,this actually really unpleasant 1-2 hour, once I threw up because of crying too hard). Now, the issue with this that the reason why this periods even starts is kinda ludicrous. Sometimes it begins spontaneously, sometimes because of a minor failure (like failing an unimportant test, having an awkward conversation with someone and later overthinking it if I hurt him/her). So basically most of the time the trigger is my guilt (because of an event that shouldn't effect me this much). But interestingly, this phase feels like I'm true to myself and that I'm not acting.
Thoughts? Should I seek a therapist? I would definitely do it if it wouldn't cost so much  a session in my country  (well it has it's price, if I want to have good treatement), but like I said, I'm student... But if you think that it would be very beneficial then I will try. ",21Nov2018,1
5,"He killed himself and no one seems too hurt by it. More like an initial, ""oh no!"" But everyone moved on real fast, even his own parents.

I guess he was dealing with a lot of stress and financial problems and he was stuck here in America with no where to go, our family is all overseas. My grandma told him to go back to his parents but I guess he had a lot of problems with them and refused to leave America, despite all the shit he was going through. When he died, people weren't very sympathetic at all and most said ""oh well, his life sucked.""

I feel so fucked up inside over this. We have a lot of parallels over our situation and I feel like I can relate. I wish I knew what he was going through before he killed himself so I could reach out to him.

And when I say we have a lot of parallels, I mean I too have been facing suicidal thoughts and I feel like no one cares. Except his suicide kinda proves that no one cares whether you live or die.",21Nov2018,1
6,"I need help and don’t know what to do, I have been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since I was 16. I am 22 now and I’m at the lowest point in my life. I think about taking my life everyday. I wake up everyday and have no goals, motivation, or ambition. I feel so empty like I am already dead. I have tried almost everything I can think of: therapy, SSRIs, SNRIs, anti-psychotics, mood stabilizers, ketamine. I don’t know what to do at this point, should I check myself into a facility? I honestly wish assisted suicide was a legal option for me. ",21Nov2018,1
7,"I really don't know what to do. I feel so out of it and everything I feel is being consumed by this vast emptiness in my chest. I know that reasonably I have plenty of people willing to listen to me and to help me, but I feel so alone. Not a normal type of alone, its like isolation. I have a loving SO who is patient and kind to me and I don't even feel like I can admit my feelings to him. I'm afraid to let this out, the struggle and the pain. I've spent weeks feeling more depressed than I've felt in a long, long while. I've considered hurting myself again to cope with this. I think about it a lot. 

I have no idea what the actual problem is or what primary emotion I am feeling. I have spent the last week and a half scrolling desperately through my contacts and friends list and feel like I can't reach out to anyone. I don't know how to talk about this. I don't know how not to be a burden with this stuff. I don't want to sound self centered or seem like I'm trying for attention. Things are actually going really well in life right now and I don't understand why this is happening. I'm taking my meds as perscribed and everything. Idk what to do right now. Been on the verge of a breakdown for the last two days. I don't feel okay. I don't know who turn to. I don't want to seem weak. ",21Nov2018,1
8,"So for the longest time, I've never felt like I have been able to connect with people. Like, I can fake it well enough to get by in most fleeting social situations, mostly. But at the moment I'm fucking struggling to do that at the moment. It's almost as if I exist in a different dimension or plane of existence.  

You know how you're in a room, and you see someone outside and you have that sense of acknowledgement that you and the other person are on two sides of a barrier. Well that's my perception of the world right now. And it's like the fucking Berlin Wall. It's always been there, but I suppose it's always been there, I can't remember a time of it not being there. But right now, that ladder that helped me glimpse over the other side as gone. Just me on my side, and everyone else on theirs. And you can over hear folk on the other side of this wall ""Nerrr, hashtag its okay to not be okay..."". HOW ABOUT FUCK YOU. That's how you present yourself, yet you can't even muster throwing me a fucking rope.

10,"To be blunt, I was raped three weeks ago. I’m a bit all over the place emotionally but for the most part I can keep it together. Here’s the thing, I am not typically an emotional person. I don’t talk about my feelings, I don’t cry often, and I keep things pretty bottled up. But since the incident I’ve had crying episodes, been panicked, and my body’s reacted in ways I’ve never experienced before. Example, when I got the pelvic exam, I started bawling and shaking uncontrollably. This was out of nowhere and I hated it because I felt so out of control and unlike myself. 

Anyway, I’ve been able to get more of a handle on my emotions recently. I can control these random panic attacks and crying episodes and it’s all good. However, when I drink, I feel way more emotionally vulnerable. I guess this confuses me because I used to think drinking made things easier to cope—or at least that’s the stereotype, right? But with me, when I’m drinking, it’s almost like I’m more in touch with my emotions and can finally “feel” things. I’m way more prone to crying and breaking down and feeling my emotions. 

Why is that? What’s wrong with me?? How do I be more in touch with my emotions? Last question, is it possible that I’ll be able to just tough it out and put this behind me or will all this bite me in the ass?  I’m so lost and suck at dealing with emotions.... any tips are welcome. Thank you.

But maybe I’m just imagining things. ",21Nov2018,1
11,I’ve gotta be honest. I really want to die but most people would say that I don’t. Because “if you really wanted to die you would find a way to make it happen” I’ve read too many failed attempts at suicide that it scares me more to try and fail. Lately I’ve considered getting a gun because that really seems like the best way.  Even that has some failure stories that scare me. I’ve fought the urge to get a gun for this very reason. I’ve researched suicide methods. I just don’t understand why I have to be here. I was careful not to have children. I have no family. I’ve pushed all friends away. I have multiple health issues that will not ever go away. I believe I should be able to choose to die.  ,21Nov2018,1

13,"Just a little background, i am 25. Holds an ordinary job. I’m not sure if it’s because of work or am I just getting worst. 

Most of the time I am just tired. Being out 8 hours a day is extremely draining, and most of the time I come home not being able to do anything else other than play some games or just rest in bed. 

I don’t feel happy. Technically, most of my entire life I don’t exactly feel happy. Nothing is satisfying. And I get extremely moody whenever I have settle any home errands. I think my boyfriend is getting most hits whenever I get frustrated. 

I wasn’t diagnosed before. Though I suspected I might be depressed. I do have “anxiety attacks”where it gets hard to breathe and the whole world pretty much just zoned out. Some times I can’t sleep at night. 

It’s getting worse the past week (feelings wise). And I am considering of seeing a psychiatrist. ",21Nov2018,1
14,"I won't say I've been struggling with depression, no matter how many times others make that assumption after I open myself up to them, simply because I've never had it diagnosed and don't wanna overuse the term when there's people out there really struggling. 
I have however been struggling with mood swings of sorts, ""depressive spells"" of sorts for many years. The last few months especially since my last relationship ended and I failed a year of uni (changed course and redoing the year, nothing big happened from it bar failing a year), I've been pushing people away and talking to far less people and experiencing these spells worse. 
I'll have weeks at a time where I can't bring myself to leave my room or do anything productive in anyway, but have to force myself (having work helps with this). I genuinely struggle to talk about any of my issues in person and the best I can do is over messages when I'm sure the other person won't reply. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, but if a quick death were a readily available option right now I would take it if it weren't for flatmates needing me for rent or my family not knowing anything is wrong and having them hurt for thinking it's their fault. They only don't know, or I don't know they know, because as normal as everything seems at home, I've just never felt comfortable opening up to them about anything.

16,"So in grade 10 i went to a new school where i became what i thought was contamination ocd. Currently im being told i don’t have ocd and im just strange.  Ok so i think i have contamination ocd because in gr 10 i was grossed out by a student and i would become super attentive to him. I ended up avoiding him the class the school. When i was near something that was from the school or that kid i would hold my breath and or was my hands or whole body when i got home depending on what i touched and if i touched something while i was “triggered” i would avoid it when i was clean including certain parts of the floor, walls, ceiling.  I ran away from home because of the stress of cleaning and having to deal with my nuisance parents. I stayed at a youth shelter and wasn’t “triggered” until i learned that a student from my old highschool was there. I ended up getting emancipated and lived on my own sorta.  I moved into a place that had mice and bug infestation and my “triggers” came back again. I ended up leaving because i couldn’t keep my place “trigger free” and i was getting a roommate that i couldn’t deal with. I ended up sleeping on the streets “trigger free”  for a bit. Eventually my sister told me to call her friend for help so i did and was fine. I ended up having to leave because he has an addiction and had to go back to my sisters place. Being out in the city and at her place has caused me to worry, avoid things, get easily agitated, my heart rate to skyrocket and not slow down, to twich and shiver, to clean, to starve myself, to stop my newly given medication.  My sister says i don’t have ocd because i dont clean her house even though i have when shes not looking, i don’t fold my clothes, i seem normal. Currently im not sleeping in her bed or couch because it’s “triggering” me, im actually sleeping in a blanket on the floor or in her car, i wont touch her tv remotes sink fosset or fridge/cupboard handles. I wont want to touch my clothes if when im taking them out of the washer/dryer i/it touches the outer walls of the washing/drying machines. Now i dont know what else i could have but i think its ocd because its not only thoughts that bug me but i physically feel it like i cant get my mind off it till i clean myself.

I would say I have an anger issue but it’s more like frustration.

 Whenever I’m really frustrated or angry from anything to a loud noise or if I’m too stressed I resort to biting myself and inflicting pain to get rid of rage. 

This has been going on for a number of years. I’ve also had trouble managing stress which also adds to my frustration.

27,"Hi. I'm a male, teenager, 18. Almost 19. 

I'm very worried that in the future, possibly the near future, my health, especially mentally, is going to decline. Maybe the reason is because of my own health, but I'll try to summarize some information about me first:

I lost my home and my childhood in 2012 after Hurricane Sandy. It's had a toll on my mental health. I also dated an emotionally abusive girl for six months long distance.

I have never been diagnosed with anxiety, ADD or depression, but that's mostly because either I've never known how or my parents have insisted it's not necessary. To their credit, this is usually because we most likely couldn't afford it.

I've also developed a speech impediment that make sounds, such as plosive sounds, difficult for me to convey.

My daily mental health has been better, and I've finally working towards something I love. But I'm still not there yet, and I'm worried that I won't make it in time. Every day I am less productive than I would like to be, and you might believe that it's just worry and overthinking, but I literally do not do anything I want to do or that I care about.

My reliance on addictive, dopamine inducing activities such as eating sugar, sex, or sleeping has become incredibly unhealthy. I constantly feel dependent on these things to keep me sane. I've started to talk to myself a bit, but mostly as means of slowing my thoughts down because I feel I often think too fast about too much that it overwhelms my mind.

I can't help but feel as a person I have incredible potential. I understand a lot that others don't, and I have the mentality and attitude that could get me far in life. But my own health has kept me back for so long. I understand there's a physical aspect to it as well, but I can't help but feel I need to do something about my own sanity, own focus, and own state of mind before I can move forward at this point in life.

I'm here to ask advice from anyone who has been through a similar situation, or anyone who knows what they're talking about or wants to even try. I'm willing to elaborate on my experiences and answer questions, I just want to do something to help myself. Thank you.",21Nov2018,1
28,"I'm about to lose my shit. Ive just completed the final(I think) evaluation session with my DBT therapist at the DBT office I just started at. I haven't been told my diagnosis yet. And I thought I was going to be diagnosed with quiet Borderline Personality Disorder.

But today my therapist read back the notes she took about me: I dont always finish my sentences/answer questions w/ bare minimum info, tap my foot alot, and have intense emotional mood swings. I also tend to be pretty numb and emotionless.

Taking all my symptoms into account, I felt like I very likely have the quiet form of Borderline Personality Disorder. But after looking at the criteria of autism spectrum disorder online, it seems like she read off alot of symptoms from that autism diagnosis list when she read my ""patient evaluation"" to me.

I'm so fucking angry. I have a LONG family history of Borderline Personality Disorder, so my chances of having that are pretty high (70% genetically). Im about to call my therapist and go the fuck off. Shouldn't have been fucking honest with her cuz now she misinterprets me.

29,"I’m sorry if this is long or incoherent it’s really hard to figure out how to convey all my thoughts but I’ll just talk about how it started. 

I’ve been diagnosed with a anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder and been taking medications to treat such for about 6 years now and all has been good. Now the past 4 months something has changed and something new has started. 

I keep on having really vivid hallucinations that scare the shit out of me, not because the hallucinated person or object is scary but because when it happens I kind of realize that my life isnt real and that I’m in someone else’s movie or this is all scripted and I’m seeing out of it. I keep on having messages sent to me through the TV or through people telling me that all of my future actions are basically prophesied and it’s on some biblical scale. Sometime I’ll get really really paranoid for no reason at all and I’ll believe that someone knows something about me or knows what I’ve been doing all day like they have been watching me. I can’t stop sleeping and I can’t ever feel rested. My energy levels are one giant pendulum that are one minute I’m ready to learn everything there is and then the next I can’t do anything but lie in bed. 

It feels at times like I’m not in my body and I’ll get these delayed input reactions. Like when I normally look around I am looking at a perfect quality and everything is very responsive and easy but then when these episodes happen it’s like someone is taking pictures through my eyeballs and manually trying to select the next photo and it causes this really slow flip book affect. 


I swear I’m not crazy and I know what I’m saying sounds crazy but I’m used to just having depression and usually anxiety, I’m not used to whatever the hell this is. My doctor is booked for the next month and I’m trying to get in sooner but I need to know what I’m experiencing or at least get a word for these symptoms I’m having so I can figure or how to cognitively treat them until I can get medication.

i have just recently turned 18 and i’ve had zero motivation for pretty much anything in my life. i’ve been depressed since i was 12 and even though i may not have had the absolute worst childhood, it definitely wasn’t the best. my parents divorced when i was 7 and i live with my mother. she can be so kind at some point and the absolute devil for others. from 2 when i was age 2 to 15 my mother had a thyroid and other gland issues which made her constantly stressed and angered and she pretty much took it all out on me. she belittled me and beat any confidence i had into dust. i’ve pretty much become a shell of a person and i can rarely think positive of myself. in the past months having a rare conversation with my father, i learned that he came within one pull of the trigger away from milking himself 3 times in his life due to how my mother treated him and barely being able to see his kids after the divorce . i love my dad a ton and it really hurt to think about my life without him, but i can’t say he hasn’t contributed to my problems either. he went to prison 3 times when i was growing up and would work 10-12 hours 6 days a week and i lacked a stable father figure growing up. he’s pressured me multiple times to do ‘manly’ things that have ended up scarring me for life. one of them when when i was 9 out hunting with him. i was just there to see what it was like and watched. he shot a goose and didn’t quite kill it and it was laying on the ground unable to fly. he ordered me to go up and finish it with my co2 bb pistol. i was about 2 feet away and looked it dead in the eye and immediately started to cry. he cussed me out and said to just shoot it. i turned my head and shot until my finger wouldn’t allow me to anymore and i looked back and saw the goose dead. i cried for 3 weeks straight even in school and it still haunts me today and there is where i never could figure out how someone can willingly take another life and enjoy it. but me constantly crying and my dad telling me to just ‘man up’ really belittled me as a kid i always felt like i wasn’t good enough for either of my parents. come middle school i really struggled to make friends. most of my closest friends left me and went to others. i slowly met new people but never felt close to anyone. i now really started to feel like an outcast and started to not talk to anyone including my family. i was involved in so much drama in 3 years that i had no one to help me and i was always causing trouble. all of this made me very depressed and i really started to shut down at 14 or 15. then came high school. everything has continuously been downhill to the point that i’m at now. my cat was hit by a car at 5 years old that my family adopted after being in critical condition at only 7 weeks old. i loved him to death. when i was 16 my dog that was my birthday present for my 5th birthday was put down almost exactly 11 years after i got her. my mother was just taking her to the vet as she could cough and lose her ability to breathe and would panic. i didn’t bother going with as i thought she’d come back and be fine but after my mother left it hit me that i may never see my dog again. later that night my mom came home without a dog and i lost all control of myself. i was crying in my room for almost 12 hours and skipped school the next day without permission. my dog always knew when you were down and needed something. she always favored me out of everyone in my family and she was what seemed my only friend growing up and now she was gone and i didn’t even get to say goodbye.i cussed out my mother for not even telling me she was put down when she came home as she said she was staying the night at the vet. she didn’t talk to me for 3 days and called me pathetic for not even going with and leaving her alone for an hour car ride and it’s all my fault that all this has happened. all this on top of high school bs has not treated me well. 



this all leads up to current time. i don’t do any of my schoolwork. on weekends i sleep 12+ hours with ease and have no motivation to get out of bed and i will rarely do anything. i’ve lost all interest in things that once mad me happy and i get frustrated and angry very easily. i’ve always been considered advanced in school and i’ve just lost it all this year. i can’t remember anything short and long term. i can’t focus for more than a minute or two on anything. i’m so shy i can’t even talk to girls or make any new friends. i’ve never had a girlfriend or any meaningful relationship and have been beaten down to the point where i feel like a failure for not getting anywhere. i don’t think i’ve gone a day in the last 4 years where i haven’t thought about suicide but ive never even attempted it as i’ve always hoped things will get better. my family’s pretty religious but i have absolutely zero fate as i have had no reason to believe it anything anymore. i always try to stay positive and that things will work out somehow and in some way but i just can’t keep that mentality anymore because the world feels like it’s against me. i feel like i have absolutely zero control over my life and i’m just on autopilot now. i’ve always helped people that i’ve seen struggle with depression and talked a few people out of suicide and stuck with them until they were better and every single one of those people had left me. it feels like a mistake i helped anyone as it seem to have just broken me i have no one to talk to at all. i’ve gone to a therapist and just wasted money as i didn’t change at all. i feel to aware of shit going on in the world and i’m way too honest with myself and it’s embedded into my mentality that no therapist could fix that. i’m always at war with myself and any time something good happens, when it’s over i immediately feel hollow again. i just feel like i need one good thing to happen and everything will slowly fix itself but i’ve waited so long for that one thing i honestly believe it will never happen. 



i hope someone can at least read this and talk to me or something. i haven’t brought any of this up to anyone for well over a year and it’s been killing me. i apologize for being all over the place and probably saying shit that didn’t matter like giving my life story. ",21Nov2018,1
31,"it’s been 5yrs since I last cut myself and things were going great for me, until this year happened and all the absolute shit and pain I went through this last past couple of months, and this months for a couple days I now started to cut myself again cause I cannot take the shit as well the depression I face and the anxiety I have, I don’t know what to do.

32,"I had a breakdown a few hours ago and it put me the closest I've been to suicide in years. I want to get better but each time I get to the breaking point it's harder to stop myself from ending it. I don't know if I'm going to be able to stop myself next breakdown. I've told my new  Dr that I felt wrong and I was worried about my PTSD but she didn't listen. I swear to God she doesn't even believe me when I told her I had it. I'm so sick of going and telling them some things wrong and them not listen. I'm going to end up dead before 2020 because no one is listening. 

When I was driving I couldn't feel my body, I felt like the car was going faster than my soul could fallow. I could see me driving into a tree and ending it all. It felt like I was already dead and just replaying my last seconds. I felt more than I had in weeks but also I felt nothing. I don't want to live like this, I want to be normal and happy. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm so scared.",21Nov2018,1
33,"Basically I’ve struggled with anxiety my entire life and I’m not feeling well. I have Harm OCD where I unfortunately have violent intrusive thoughts, urges, feelings, etc. Obviously these thoughts, feelings, whatever caused me a great deal of distress. I don’t consider myself a sadistic person. I’ve worried things like:

&gt; What if I go insane one day?

And:

&gt; After I’m done here, I’m going to go kill someone.

Obviously we know that I shouldn’t be held accountable for random things that pops into my head, and I don’t get any pleasure or satisfaction from these thoughts. 

I was worried about going to a therapist because I worried the therapist would assume I’m a danger and hospitalize me.

Basically I relayed that I’d be going to bed, and I’d be *sure* that the next day I’d wake up and be in a psychotic trance. Sounds ridiculous right? The therapist empathized me and said I’m just feeling waves of anxiety, basically.

Basically I’ve had pretty bad intrusive thoughts. I know that the more I ask for reassurance, mental review/check, the stronger the obsession gets.

I’ve never hallucinated I don’t think, and I’ve never made a plan to hurt someone nor do I intend to. My fear is the *hypothetical* fear of the future. I know
I’m not ‘crazy’ because everyone has intrusive thoughts... and while we’re on this topic, I know that behaviors define me. So if the thoughts bother me, then that clearly shows my moral character, which I try to pride myself on.

There have been moments where I’ve expressed some thoughts where say violent criminals or people who abuse others should be punished... but I think that’s ‘normal’ and in line with what society/the law says?

Basically I have Harm OCD and a fear of psychosis. What’s the next step for me? I know I’m not crazy but I can’t *implement* that, it’s so hard.

34,"My therapist seemed to get slightly offended, mentioning shortly after i said this how he is in the ""position of authority"". I said ""I dont like psychiatrists because I feel like they just push pills on people to make money. But I like psychologists like you because I think they don't have ulterior motives, and I think they deserve to make more money than they do."" Was that a hostile thing to say? Dont even trust my own judgement anymore. ",21Nov2018,1
35,"At work, a couple of people I talk with are relatively often absent. They both often have headaches, from a health condition they have in common. They leave work early sometimes, get lots of empathy from coworkers and higher ups, and when they come back the next day you have people making sure they are okay.

I have that same health condition, from birth. I also suffer the same symptoms as them, and when I walk, my backpack shakes with medications. So far I have taken a single day off of work because I thought someone near and dear to me had died (thankfully, they are still alive). But the numbers of days off they have is not the point.

What gets to me is the amount of care and empathy they get. They rest their head on their desk and they get half of the office (including me, mind you) asking them if they are okay. They take a longer break and they get the same questions. When they tell a supervisor what's going on, they get hugs and random people giving them their phone number to be available whenever they need someone. 

It's childish and all, but I am jealous. I can sit for an hour crying at my desk and I get awkward side eyes at most. I could spend an hour in the bathroom and the most I would hear when I get back is to let it be known on my timesheet. I have been so honest about my depression and anxiety with some people (when they ask!) but idiot me never realized that they were just feeding their curiosity, not really trying to help. I think 7 higher ups know about my anxiety (because I requested a new work station to cry alone lol) but not a single one has cared enough to send more than maybe a frowning emoji. They were all very polite though. I appreciate that. I don't want it to sound like my higher ups are dicks. They are angels. But they are just nice (job titles). But not acting in a sincere human to human way, if that makes any sense. 

Anyway. Going back to work is not enjoyable because I'm a big jealous baby. I want to be vulnerable too. And I know mental health is super taboo and awkward but it kinda gets me even more salty that the two person I talked about have the exact, and even a slightly milder form of my condition (since they don't need to take medication for it while I do). I don't want to be strong and I do want to be noticed sometimes when I'm not feeling well. I just want basic human empathy that isn't fuelled by curiosity. 

Oh well. I'll have to get over it. ",21Nov2018,1
36,"Well I decided to post this on here for some advice so here it goes.
I’m a 19 year old male and ever since I was in 8th grade I’ve always been nervous and a worry wart. I guess it’s when I came to the realization that from here on out my future depends on it. And every class I was in and I didn’t feel sure I was gonna pass it I would tell myself that it’s impossible and that I’ll never amount to anything so my future is ruined and now that I’m gonna start 4 classes in community college I’m telling myself that it’ll be to hard and I that I won’t pass. I always think ahead into the future and make it crappy for myself. My mom tells me to just stop worrying but I honestly can’t. I spent 3/4s of my time in high school worrying (mainly cause I had surgery and it messed my grades up). I just want to be able to stop worrying and have a better mindset and attitude from this point on. 
Any advice would be awesome. ",21Nov2018,1
37,"Since I can remember, I have HATED my body. In fact I've hated myself. I'm quiet, I'm shy, un-confident in myself and find that I give myself a hard time, a lot. 

I've worked so much on being a better version of me, I used to be a bit chubby. Then I started working out and doing yoga 4+ times a week. My body is probably the best it has ever looked, I can even see my and now! But I still look in the mirror and want to cry at what I see. Is that a reflection of my past self? 

How can I overcome these feelings of inadequacy? When all I see around me is perfect bodies, perfect life's. I barely use FB anymore and I've really limited myself as to what I look at on IG As when I do look at it or notice what my bf is looking at I get so depressed. I feel inadequate again. All the hard work of building up my self confidence goes out the window. Bad thoughts come rushing in, I'm not good enough, I'll never look like that, I need to lose more weight. 

To all the girls who feel insecure in themselves, you're not alone. To everyone that feels the need to starve themselves just to 'fit in' with the way that society wants you to, you are not alone. I know it's hard to talk to someone, I know I don't. 
Just try to hang in there, it's really tough sometimes but you get stronger and the tough times become less often.

I've struggled with anxiety for all of my adult life and most of my childhood, which I believe stems from the years of bullying and teasing I endured growing up. 

Now, as an adult, I feel like I haven't shaken that. I have huge fears of being abandoned, particularly by my husband. I become extremely anxious when he goes out with his friends, most of the time it's just grabbing dinner in the city after work. I lash out and accuse him of not wanting to spend time with me. 

I really want to move on from this. I'm often told I'm a very nice, kind person, but one thing people always tell me is that I make problems out of nothing and overthink/overreact to almost everything, which is true. In the moment I freak out and overreact. Then, as the day goes on I realize how ridiculous I looked by acting the way I did.

I've had a sever anxiety problem for many many years but recently things have just gotten so much worse, i have these almost attacks that seem to last 4-5 days where i just cant function properly and right now im having my biggest one yet. usually there's like a trigger that sets it off and i cant stop thinking about that one thing for the entire 5 days and every time i start to feel human again my mind just starts thinking about that bad thing and it drags me back down...

So last night i was driving home after seeing some friends in my new car when i started having an attack about something that happened years ago like something stupid i said to someone i loved and i lost concentration next thing i know i see a parked police car in a hidden pull in when i went round the bend and look down at the speed dial and i was doing 57mph... in a 30 zone... i didn't even realise. i slowed down and kept driving and the police car didn't follow and i was left thinking hes surely going to come he saw me right in front of him. He didn't follow or pull me over and then my mind triggered and i started thinking oh god what if it was a mobile speed camera, i couldn't help myself but turn around and go back to check... The police car was gone.

so now im left with this fear of getting a letter saying i have to go to court or coming home to police at my door and that im going to loose my license and in turn loose my job because i cant get there and then i wont be able to keep payments up on my car so i loose that too. its crippling... i cant stand up straight and i keep vomiting i didn't even sleep last night. That one simple mistake is going to Ruin everything ive worked hard to achieve. The anxiety is killing me and its going to be like this for 14 days while i wait to see if i get summoned to court or if nothing happens.

Life with psychosis can be like this.  And we never talk about it. Which leads to living a life where we can't talk about the realities of our illnesses.  We learn to mask it with as much normalcy as we can pretend so that we aren't seen as a threat.

I'm 5'2"" and around 125 pounds.  Not exactly big and intimidating.  And yet I have seen, time and time again, that dawning fear in people's eyes when I talk about it honestly, when I say the words, ""I have hallucinations.""  They stop listening then.  They don't want to hear that my hallucinations are completely harmless.  There is no threat in hearing knocking or classical music.

No one would bat an eyelash at a person with any other kind of illness talking honestly and openly about living with it.  Not diabetes or leukemia or any of them.  But the second it's a mental illness....

I'm not really open about it irl, I've been generally quiet and distant since always.


But recently I made the realization that following the far-right only made me more marginalized, more miserable and It will certainly only cause problems for me in the future (on finding a job, a partener and all that). So I want to change but It's not that easy, leaving all those beliefs behind. I'm open to questions and suggestions

62,"I have gone through alot of shit in the past five years and have been getting the appropriate help for the past 6 months. The past 10 days have been incredibly hard but me and my partner were going through IVF treatment. I stopped taking my depression medication in preparation for IVF around 3 months ago (my pdoc helped me through it, he did not agree with me taking it from the beginning since a general physician was the one who put me on it) but I continued using my anxiety meds and was seeing a psychologist. About 5 weeks ago it was time to decrease using the anxiety meds and it went much better than expected and my psychologist was pleasantly surprised to see how well I was doing and I was able to stop using it. Then we got a negative pregnancy test last week, 2 days prior to testing I should have met up with my psychologist, I had not met her for around 2 weeks so it was very important for me to get that appointment to help prepear myself if things didn't go as we hoped but she had to cancel and her secretary told me she was going to be out of town for 2 weeks. So the whole waiting to test was hell, the getting a negative test was even more hell but what is driving me crazy is my obsession and anxiety towards the future, when will we try again, how am I going to plan the next month's and so forth. This is something that my partner can't help me work through and has been a big part of therapy to go through these destructive thoughts towards the future and talk it through and learning to use CBT. But right now I am not doing the smart thing and using what I know but I am basking in my despair and literally dragging myself even further down. I am so annoyed that I can't see my psychologist and being a dick head I have not even started taking my anxiety meds again to try and give my self a push to start taking care of myself, I just keep spending my days crying (literally bursting into tears every time I start thinking about what could have been) and having anxiety attacks.

Number one, I’m a hypochondriac. I always have obsessive fears of illnesses, even if they do not make sense. This summer, I hyper-focused on a mole, and I was convinced it was skin cancer. Last summer, I had an obsessive fear of needles and contamination. Now, since the mole was disapproved by more than three doctors to be nothing more than that, just a mole, I’ve started hyper-focusing on my headaches, scared of them being a tumor. There was also a brief time that I was sure I was experiencing symptoms of Fatal Familial Insomnia; but that was just my intrusive thoughts not letting me sleep. That’s not the only ocd related symptom I experience. Living in my head daily is hell, but I don’t want to seem ungrateful. I’m so happy for everything, but my mind makes it so tiring.

70," 

I'm afraid of this sounding like schizophrenia or something more serious because I'm fairly confident it's nothing like that. Sometimes my thoughts are just really loud, like I'm screaming at myself or something, and I can't control it at all. It's not like I'm hearing voices, it's my own internal voice and thoughts, just loud and rushed and maybe even a bit hostile.

I've had serious anxiety issues in the past (although I haven't had anything as serious as a panic attack in probably years) so I'm wondering if this is a manifestation of that or if it's something else I should see a professional about?

Also to further elaborate, I can't think of anything that might trigger it. It'll happen when I have no reason to be anxious, when I'm just sitting at my computer playing video games, when I'm reading, any time at all.

It makes me feel hyper-aware and more sensitive to everything as well. It's a little hard to describe exactly what I mean by that, everything in general just seems more ""real"" like it's as if I can take in more information than I normally could.

I'm not taking any kind of medication although I used to take medication for my anxiety and depression years ago. I should also mention it's very rare, like once a month maybe that it happens. It usually lasts about an hour, maybe less.",21Nov2018,1
71,"Hi. So recently I got the following problem. I never coped well with group tasks due to fear of humiliation, mental or physical abuse.

Fast forward, I started studying and because I thought it was education for adults, I thought there wouldn't be any forced group work anymore. Oh boy was I wrong.
4 group tasks per week. I just want to off myself whenever the comparison of our results approaches. Or when we're about to get our results back. 2 days ago, it was severe enough to induce catatonia in me again. I had it a few times already but it was long ago. 40 minutes of not being able to move and not being able to talk feels longer than it sounds. I was still able to notice everything around me, but my body was a cage.

My doctor, who is very new to her job, just keeps throwing the term ""therapy"" at me. I've been to different psychologists and psychiatrists since the age of 6. Now I'm 22. I'm sick of it and I know their answers and procedures so well I could become one of them myself at this point.

73,"During my middle school years, I was really sad but I never told anyone about it. I was fine when I was with friends but I was empty. I had no emotional connection with anyone but I was still social and made friends. I still went on with life and did what I needed to do even though I wanted to die. I never told anyone so I don’t really know if it really was depression but I honestly felt miserable at home and with myself. I never called myself depressed, just really sad. I hated myself even though my life is not hard at all. Home wasn’t the best but I can bare with it. I was really social. It was kinda how I coped with things I guess. Plus I had no choice in school but to be the quiet loner or the social butterfly. I wanted to be the social butterfly because I didn’t want to be the loner like I was in elementary. I forced myself so much to socialize with people, especially in highschool. I felt more happy. I was glad I had so many friends and joined so many clubs. I joined a sport for every seasons and joined all the big clubs. I was happy for awhile. In the moment I was happy I guess. I have problems with my parents but everyone says I should love my parents so I learned to do so but I don’t know how I really feel about them. 

How I socialized with people was way different from who I am when I’m alone or with family. There’s two different me, the social one and the empty one. They’re both me though, it’s not like I’m pretending or faking who I am to people. 

I helped friends with their depression and suicidal thoughts. I was the leader, the one with the best advice, the entertainer, the giver, the one everyone goes to. I was fine with just being that.

When I’m home I feel suffocated. I feel like there’s no purpose for me because I’m doing nothing at home. I’m sad when I’m at home with my parents. I have the desire to always do something because if I’m not doing anything, I feel like there’s no purpose in life and I’m wasting time and I don’t want a meaningless life. I hated myself and I was really sad but I’m able to go on. 

I went past my phase of being depressed and not being able to do anything because of it. I went past the phase of wanting to kill myself and hating myself. I’m over it all. I’m happy I guess. But why am I so empty. I’m sad but I’m happy. I thought I was fine. I have the great friends, the good grades, the best classes, and being the leader. I have no reason to be sad. I just can’t stop myself from feeling empty. I don’t want to go back to where I was sad and wanted to die. I don’t want to feel this way but I’m empty. I don’t even know how I feel. I got over my depressing phase because I knew I was gonna be fine. I was avoiding being sad. I don’t even know how it is to feel sad. I know when I’m happy but everything else is just numb. I rarely get mad and sometimes I cry out of nowhere (it’s embarrassing I know). I’m very self aware of the value of life. That’s why I didn’t do it. I forced myself out of it. I didn’t want to be sad so I told myself to be happy and I was. Everything is just so disconnected and empty. I really don’t know how I feel. What’s wrong with me?

My 23 yr/o brother has an explosive temper. He has a GF for a year now (of which I am very surprised) and I don't understand why they are still together, but maybe he is nice to her. My brother is mean, and smokes a lot of weed. I can't get him to stop... and he HATES talking about it. He's very secretive and does not share a lot of information with me about his life (we live in different states). When we were kids he was not as secretive. 

Anyways, how do I approach talking to him. He sort of does not care about rules and authority and I'm afraid that one day he will do something that will land him in a lot of trouble. I can't start telling him what I think he needs to change, because he immediately starts to yell - I think this is caused by years of smoking weed.

81,"Shes 18F. Says she was diagonesed with borderline. She was thrown out by her therapist for losing weight (how stupid is that?). Eating disorder. She has a serious issue with substance abuse (not THAT serious - I got to know worse in the rave scence) and other means of impuls release like cutting herself and sex. If she breaks down she is suicidal (not without reason tho). Yet she is otherwise incredibly cheerful, open and empathetic (she is also on mood stabilizers - might be part of the reason, which she said she wants to drop. I might wanna ask if that is her idea or the one of her doctor.). It feels like she needs to help other people because she thinks she cant help herself (i have seen that in action - such people are rare. I only know two actually. They always seem to be rolling on M if you can relate.) - or maybe she doesnt wants to help herself. She also doesnt wants help. She is happy if you take her as she is and she can take care of others. Shes an indredibly good actor, which sometimes makes me question if she is as happy as she seems to be and if she even is who she seems to be. But if you speak to her there is no reason to believe otherwise. I cant place her, i cant judge how she truly feels and that worries me. I know that she has tried to kill herself multiple times already. The thing is she is very selfconscious about all of this. All which i know she basically told me up front and others she trusts (and she is very quick to trust you if you are just take her as she is). People like her. Even people who first said ""that girl is crazy"" quickly grow to like her. You just have to. She also said that she doesnt know if she buys the BPD diagonsis. She knows that there are symptoms overcrossing with it but many which dont. She very clearly knows who she is. She is much more empathetic than an average person. What she has for sure tho and this she told me as well is OCD and heavy impulse release. I am just confused about her in multiple ways.

My aunt (not blood related) has borderline. Hardcore borderliner. Heavy alcoholic. Manipulative as hell. Abusive to her children and entire family.

83,"I’m tired of being tired. I used to be a very optimistic and happy person. I loved to laugh and do spontaneous things but I’m so different now. I left college five years ago to pursue my dreams of being a musician. I thought I would be able to just go play gigs on the weekend or after work but that never happened. I moved in with my parents and started working 50+ hours a week and barely made enough money to survive. My mother wanted a portion of all my checks that I got. She knew I wasn’t making much but she didn’t care. I wasn’t even making $1500 a month. On top of that, everything that could possibly go wrong in life did. Every time I took one step forward it felt like I was thrown 100 steps backwards. Every time I tried to do something that would bring a little happiness to my life some soul crushing, life breaking thing would happen causing me to not be able to achieve whatever I had planned. Recently I applied to a job with the government and they gave me a job offer in the city I always wanted to live. The city has a huge music scene and people get discovered there every day. For once I thought life was looking up. I was packing my stuff up and was fixing to get an apartment to move out of my mother’s house when I received an email saying they rescinded the job offer. During the background check I couldn’t remember the names, emails, and addresses of old coworkers from my very first job so they said they couldn’t do a full investigation and therefore rescinded the offer. I had already quit my other job so I found myself unemployed. Upon reading the email I started having a panic attack. It was so hard to breathe. I was so tired that death honestly didn’t scare me in that moment. Death seemed like a way out of my nightmare. I had more panic attacks through the remainder of the week. I was so afraid to tell my mother that the job offer was rescinded that I kept it a secret for a few weeks. I knew the moment she found out she would start treating me like a good for nothing mooching rat so I didn’t say anything at first. When I realized I couldn’t hide it anymore I told her.

I can’t take it anymore. I’m so tired of fighting. I feel like I’ve been running non stop to keep my head above water and no matter how hard I try it’s never enough. Recently I was planning a trip abroad to meet some long lost family but like always my plans have been ruined. I no longer have the funds to go visit them and I don’t know how to tell them I can’t make it. They are literally planning a city wide celebration for me and I don’t know what to do. 

I’m at a point in life where I don’t even like being hopeful anymore. I hate getting my hopes up only for life to crush them. I feel cursed or jinxed. If I wasn’t such a coward maybe I would’ve killed myself by now. I used to be one of those people who would try to encourage mentally ill people not to kill themselves but I finally understand why suicide is an option for people. Its an escape from the trauma and nightmare that life puts you through. 

It’s been years since I’ve been happy. I can’t remember the last time I woke up feeling happy. If I had insurance I’d probably speak to a therapist about this but I’m broke so I’m on here. The can’t even go back to school. The college I went to said that they want me to pay $700 before I can re enroll in courses. Smh What’s the point of life? ",21Nov2018,1

87,"Hi everyone. I'm currently on a mental health program that connected me to some amazing therapists, whom I trust very much and have been helping me immensely since we started working together. I also have been going to group therapy sessions, where I've been able to open up a little bit with other people.

Throughout my whole life I've been the type of person who doesn't share much about my problems, even with close friends. It's gone so bad that I haven't been reaching out to my friends at all. My goal at the moment is to learn how to rely on other people more, and not feel like a burden while doing so.

But my problem is that this fear of vulnerability I have is physically paralyzing. I had a group session yesterday where I didn't share much at all, but in my head I had so much to talk about. Even when I WANT to do it, it's almost like my mouth isn't connected to my brain and won't move. The worst way this has manifested was during a crisis in which I was feeling so depressed and anxious, that I was basically stuck in my bed for days, barely moving at all, and dissociating away. 

Does anyone goes through something similar? I'm going to bring this up with my therapist but I want to hear from other people too. Any advice on how to cope with this would be awesome. Cheers!",21Nov2018,1

I live in a 3rd world country where mental health is looked down upon, can't even therapy. Only video games and internet make me forget these feelings.I tried to kill myself once but I stopped, thinking maybe life will excite me once again,it's been 2 years since. At 21,i feel like I've done it all( I know I did not)  and I honestly don't think I have anything to look forward to. I'm burnt out. Any help would be appreciated, Thanks. ",21Nov2018,1
93,It's a very uncomfortable feeling. But sometimes I feel like I'm well on my way to achieving my goals but other times I feel anxiety almost as if I'm lost.,21Nov2018,1
94,"I'm in a rough patch because this is the first Thanksgiving since my grandmother died. Even though she was too fragile to host the family the last couple of years, she  is a Thanksgiving fixture for me.

95,"I feel like the real me is trapped somewhere deep inside, desperation seeps out and poisons me. It’s surrounded by a void with a casing of apathy. 
I used to be someone, I used to engage, I feel I still have a personality somewhere but I only have flits where I can access it.
I want to be how I was, I was sad and angry but boisterous and full of passion and life. 
I don’t care about anything unless I’m moaning and can’t be bothered to do anything. When I force myself to do things and socialise I’m so impatient and bored and want to leave but have to pretend like I’m not. 
Some of my mates tell me I’m boring, “what’s happened to you”, “you’ve changed”, “you used to be fun” etc.  
I don’t know how to find myself

96,"I'm 24/M. I've had schizophrenia for 3 years. I take my meds &amp; I stay away from drugs and alcohol.

But over the past few days I've changed. First I completely stopped eating. I haven't eaten in 3 days. I started to get paranoid that someone could hurt or kill me. The voices have been surprisingly quiet.

I go for walks when it gets dark. I live in a small town. The last two nights I've gone out with my hood up and a neck warmer concealing most of my face except my eyes. I've made myself look as intimidating as possible. Now for the worrying thing. I've started carrying a knife with me for protection. This guy was walking behind me tonight and I kept my hand on the knife in my pocket incase he tried something.

The last two nights have been hell. I've been shaking, having panic attacks, racing thoughts. I feel like I've become a monster. The thought that I could be capable of hurting someone almost makes me sick. I hate myself because of these daydreams of threatening people with the knife. It's like everything is getting out of control and the only way I can regain control is by making myself feel big, feel tough, feel important. Nobody will mess with me.

I want all this to stop. I don't want to go to the hospital since I've only been out of hospital a few weeks. I equally don't want to go to prison and that's what I'm terrified of. If the police catch me with a knife it's a €1,000 fine and going to court.

When I feel really like I'm losing it I've thought of calling the police on myself so I can't hurt anyone. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. If I tell anyone it's likely they'll call the police or detain me in the hospital again.

I'm seeing my psychologist tomorrow but I'm terrified to tell her because I feel so ashamed that I've become the kind of person who behaves and thinks like this. I really don't feel safe at all and I can't talk to anyone about it because I know there are consequences. If you have any advice please please tell me I'm so alone with all of this.",21Nov2018,1
97,I am a 16 year-old male who has a decent amount of friends and likes meeting new people. I have a great group of friends and a great family. However I still feel this built up anger inside of me from when various people have caused me emotional pain. This has led me to just “snap” when talking to people and get extremely angry and anxious. I don’t know any ways of solving this problem and my therapist is on leave currently. If anybody has any advice or experience with a situation similar to mine then please comment your opinion. Thank you for reading this.,21Nov2018,1
98,"O dont know if this is the place to put this, but I am fairly new to reddit and I dont know many boards here...

I'll just start by listing the basic problem at hand. My boyfriend has told me hes been diagnosed with BPD (borderline personality disorder) which I was completely familiar with before I met him, and I'm fine with it...but I'm scared that the affects people with BPD typically have, will start to affect me in a negative way... I dont want him constantly trying to avoid a breakup with me and I want to make sure if he WOULD be ok if we ever broke up (god forbid...I really like him)) 

Now heres the details


He has a therapist, whom he talks to on a regular basis, he claims his family has a history of mental health issues

I just want a regular relationship, and to feel comfortable in said relationship, also he hasnt demonstrated any of the symptoms of BPD towards me of corse, I dont think hes gotten too attached to me, i just want to know if i should have my guard up or not...any advice helps. Thanks guys

99,"I was bullied, the bullying changed me. I believed if i'm quiet and not in the center of attention i wouldnt be noticed and safer.

Slowly overtime it escalated to becoming an introvert and i always blamed the readon for my depression back to the time i was bullied.

I now think while yes the bullying was the spark that set it all ablaze. I have a much bigger problem. I cant seem to snap out of how i was shaped as an effect of being bullied. Being an introvert is safe and comfortable but it's also making me sad. 

I am writing this to get my heart out and hopefully some support. I dont know if this is the right place and i dont really know what to do. 

Is it always possible to snap out of depression? It feels sort of engraved in my brain for over 7 years now. Little over 7 years ago i was a happy social kid enjoying making friends laugh.

100,"I'm a mid 20s male trying to help my mother in her 50s get help. Trying to make a very long story short: it's an extremely complicated relationship that hasn't been great in years. She kicked me out during a college winter break about 5 years ago. Since then she has had a more tenuous relationship with her second oldest child (I'm oldest).

A bit on my mother: she has always been a bit socially isolated (very few friends, rarely visits her own family) but it has gotten worse this year. She was 5150ed with poor reasons earlier in the year initiated by neighbors who are old hacks who just like messing with her. It spiraled out of control from there - delusions about the military, police, poisoning, etc. The kicker was when she kicked out my two youngest siblings (now college age) who had dropped out of or not attended college to help her/be with her. The two people most loyal to her (and unreasonably so IMO which I think they've started to realize) my mother claimed, out of the blue, were trying to kill her.

I've told her (and so have her other children and ex-husband) that she needs help. We've all tried in our own way but she creates this smoke screen of business (literally busy-ness) to avoid confronting the issue. Her brother who is in a different state offered to take her in but she found a creative way to make him think everything is ok. Her sister says it's hard to do anything because she's so stubborn (true). I'm physically closest to her and am still a multi-car hour drive away. I haven't seen her in a few years because I found her to be verbally abusive and didn't want to be around it. My other siblings and her ex-husband are a full day drive away.

I have no idea what to do and she has said many nasty things to all of us but we want to help. I believe she would be diagnosed with schizophrenia but she doesn't trust medical professionals either. I just have no effing clue how to do it and she is successfully further isolating herself. She thinks she's being poisoned and recent texts have said things like ""it's too late."" I personally feel like something bad will happen without intervention. What can I do?",21Nov2018,1
101,"I really don’t think I have any. I can rationalize that I’m a fun person, I’m attractive, I’m not worthless. But I can’t bring myself to be confident enough to feel this all the time. I often feel a crushing sense of defeat, like I’m not doing enough for anyone to be proud of me. I get nauseous if men in my life talk to other women or have intimate friendships with them. I just want to feel confident and happy with myself. ",21Nov2018,1
102,"When someone gets angry or upset, I never think they are being genuine. I think they are just acting or doing what they think they are expected to do in that situation. But I'm starting to realize that I might only think that, because it's exactly what I do. 


I never get angry, and rarely upset. In fact in most social situations I pretty much just do what I think is expected of me. I'm not saying I don't have emotions or that I'm blocking them out. I would say it's the opposite of that, I have to try if I want to  feel them.


I don't enjoy smoking cannabis because it makes me feel things the way I remember feeling when I was young. So I'm not really asking for help on fixing this, but I would like to understand it better.",21Nov2018,1
