Because from what I've seen, a lot of times, the problem isn't a disorder of any kind but lifestyle, low EQ, not knowing how to deal with one's emotions, and/or ignorance of personality, human communication, and/or cognition.",26Jun2018,0,
2,"Hey there, there are a lot of threads bouncing around my head so apologies if i get lost.  
  
I'm depressed and have been for a long time but I typically think of it as minor pity-party bullshit.  I've been happy for the last three days and the difference in my daily life is more than I would have anticipated. Not sure exactly what question I'm posing but I'd like to get an independent perspective on how down I am typically am. Relevant is that my current happiness is temporary and unhealthy. Of course life is great when your on cloud 6, I'm just not sure whether I live on floor B1 or B5 normally.  
  
Here are some things consistent in my life for a decade versus the last days:   
- I walk slouched, head down, hood up, slack facial expression, staring at a fixed point or phone. I've been walking head up, hood down, half smile, and realize its been longer than I know since I looked at the sky.  
- I do laundry the day before I need it, sometimes dirty clothes get worn. I've done everything but the odd instruction washes and am going to buy a hamper.  
- I spend endless hours every day lying in my bed reliving prior events in life, obsessively checking my phone, or fantasizing about not being me. I spend a few hours every day lying in my bed feeling content and even a little tingly thinking about normal life stuff or fantasizing about getting my shit together.  
- I take a kind of pride in looking bad. Took a few hours to tidy up and you know what I'm not that bad looking.  
- I fap constantly, like teenager level. I find things arousing but just don't need to.  
- I'm a hermit, no social life, no friends, no events, etc etc. I'm a hermit but have actually been talking to people and feel like continuing.  
  
Yes I know and that it us stupid to feel even a bit bad and address it (professional help) later rather than earlier but I'm simply not there. I get by decently in life and at work I appear to Life™ fine, well sans a frankly horrible attendance record.  ",26Jun2018,1,

4,"I'm a  straight male but my father is gay and I've always been an advocate for LGBT rights. I feel like the movement has become disrespectful to itself but that's a story for another day.

I took this last week off of work, went up to my friends in Nevada (I leave in the East SF Bay area) shot some guns, played games, had a good time. I had my birthday while I was up there and his father cooked us all amazing steaks. I also got a really bad ticket while I was up there which stressed me out quite a bit but I've kinda just surpressed it.

I took my motorcycle and the ride back down just sucked so I decided to stay at my grandmothers house about 3/4 of the way to my house. My mother is living there for a few more months while she saves for a down payment on a house. We went out to dinner and I just slept over and did my own thing(TV/computer). Was going to stay a second night but a friend called and asked if I wanted to go to pride with him Saturday morning. I said yes and left home early.

We went to pride with two of his friends, didn't really hit it off with them but they seemed like good people. We got a reasonable amount of liquor in us, I'd say 2-3 beers worth and danced some for like an hour till it started wearing off. He kept meeting new friends and being hyper-social (and suuuuper gay lol) but I couldn't keep up, I felt like I was third wheeling myself. Alot of nothing new happens and eventually the two girls who came with us left.

We both wanted more alcohol, maybe some weed later on but those girls were our hookup. My friend, who I'm going to call J, figured we'd just find a new friend group who could buy us alcohol. We danced, met some people but the whole time I just felt awkward and uncomfortable. I danced too but like fuck, I felt out of place. This was my first festival but I've gone clubbing 5 or so times and am not afraid to dance there, even when sober. 

I just didn't feel happy like everyone else. I couldn't  get myself to smile for pictures but that's more because I'm self conscious about my over bite, didn't wear my bands often as a teenager so I'll need to get braces again.

I saw myself in some photos and I just didn't look attractive at all. I'm used to how I see myself in the mirror, body needs alot of work but my face always turns out okay.

 I'm kind of rambling on at this point but it's all what comes to mind.

So eventually we land ourselves with this group of 3 very pretty girls, jorgie is having alot of fun with them and it's all high energy. I just can't keep up a conversation. I just wanted to be a part of it but anything I felt like saying just wasn't good conversation. I just don't know why. I've had people I should be a politician and that I'm a great conversationalist, but those were all in heavy conversations. I just can't do high energy talk even though I want to.

At this point I don't know where I'm getting with this, so many issues, so little organization but that's how my mind feels as of late. How's it go? ""The inner machinations of my mind at an enigma"" - Patrick Star

We all chugged a box of wine become stupid and was still acting blatantly nervous. J, for some reason I can't remember, had everyone kiss each other and even then I wasn't comfortable because in my mind I felt like he's trying to do it for me and that I'm incapable of accomplishing these feats myself.

Time goes on and me and jorgie are drunk, I need to take J to a hospital and get us a $200 uber home lol. J was okay but not in good shape, the girls had to split with us which was okay and I was honestly feeling OK, a little upset with myself for socializing so little but that's it.

Then since last night and all of today I've just been falling. I started typing this after having a long debate within myself of whether or not trying to find happiness is worth it. I'm sick of the ""yes of course it is"" mentality. I'd wager most people, even successful people, are unhappy. Finding happiness is a gamble. I don't know I'm just lost right now.",26Jun2018,1,

Until I'm out of it. But it's gotten to the point my partner no longer wants to deal with it and says he wants me to leave if I don't get better. This has been going on for years. I have no idea what to do. I don't care about this. I think it's all bullshit and doesn't matter. But then my partner yells at me about how it makes him feel. And for some reason I feel no remorse.

6,"We are both in our mid 20s. My gf has depression/ high anxiety. We have been together for over a year and a half. I have been with her from the awesome times and the horrible times. 

During this time she has completely changed my life. She has made me a better person (harder worker, more caring, more loving to family) she has helped my own depression. She is loving, smart, funny, beautiful, and awesome. She never fails to turn me on. I love her and want to show her off to the world. I want to build her up and show her how special she is to the world. 

The problem is she gets depressed very often. She gets cold, distant, and theres nothing I can do to get her out of it. I listen to her problems, give her hugs and give her a shoulder to cry on. I have been in depression a few times so I understand what she is going through. I want to help her out, she is 100% worth it.

Two months ago was the worst one yet. She got all distant and then started refusing sex/ any intimacy. Even worse than that, she got very short and sometimes even rude with me. It killed me. I do everything to help her and she seemed like it didnt even matter to her. When I asked her for sex she would deny me and make me feel like an asshole for asking.

I've suggested therapy but she gives excuses for why she can't do it. 

Near the end of this rough patch, I go to a party. I get very drunk and flirty. I end up kissing and getting a hand job from a girl. I go out every week with my friends and I never even tried to cheat.... why did I do this? I hate myself for this. Its been a month now and I am still consumed with guilt. I have always thought of cheaters as horrible people, I never thought I'd become one myself.

What do I do? Should I tell her? I feel like if I do she will never trust another man again and she might fall into a deep depression she cannot get out of. I love her and this past month she has been great. We talked about her issues and she finally agreed to get help and we both have been working on getting better.  I do not want to say goodbye to her. I do not want to break her heart.

10,"First I want to start off by saying I'm on 10mg Adderall+ 20mg Fluoxitine (Prozac).

On days when I know it's going to be a long day at work, I increase my Adderall to 20mg. It's not my prescibed dose, but I'm doing store cleaning that has to be done in a few hours or else. Plus I only work 5 times a month, so I rarely end up going over my prescribed dose. It works okay.

My concern is fluoxetine. I know it comes with the risk of Seratonin Syndrome, but my psychiatrist prescribed it along with my Adderall anyways? Well needless to say, I haven't had any weird symptoms of concern that would make me believe I have Seratonin Syndrome. However, after two months on it, I am no longer getting the benefits. I've struggled with low self-esteem and binge eating, and could never stick to a diet for longer than a few weeks. I also have body dysmorphia, so binge eating worsened my deppresion. But after starting Prozac, it was like a weight lifted. I was motivated, and I stuck to my diet, and in two months time I lost ten pounds. I'm so proud for making it this far. But after three weeks since my two months progress, I lack motivation and am constantly tired, bored, and wanting to eat whatever. It originally started when my period came, but after it left, the symptoms stayed, which tells me it's unrelated to pms. I almost thought it was ovulation spotting, because it was so light, but it's been 18 days since, so if I was ovulating, I should have gotten my actual period by now, so that means it was my period I had 18 days ago, but just a really light one. No, I'm not pregnant, I'm not sexually active. Assuming my tiredness has nothing to do with my cycle, but I put that in, in case someone else thinks it does.

The prozac still works, but only for a few hours. I still have more weight I would like to lose, so I'm far from my goal. But I just can't do it. I wanted to be at 150 by August, now it doesn't look like it will happen.

Do you think it's safe to increase my Prozac to 40mg, even with my 10mg Adderall dose, or should I wait to see my psychiatrist?I don't want Seratonin Syndrome. Idk if I can wait until then, it's on July 12.

11,"Seemed to me like all the girls labeled as “sluts” in my middle school/high school would post this all over Facebook,
Seemed to me like I was one of those girls posting the same thing. 

And later finding out, I didn’t even know my whole story at the time. 

Hyper-sexuality. 
A very common and very life changing symptom of mania. 

So yes, me being labeled as a “slut” in school growing up, and everyone knowing my name and not giving me a fair chance to even get to know me because, uh oh, I had sex,
It actually was an undiagnosed mental illness symptom, 
So thanks for bullying me all throughout school, and making me seem like the scum of the earth.

The fact that high school doesn’t offer a class to the students dedicated to learning about mental illnesses makes me upset. 
Learning at a young age that mental illnesses are actually a thing, and they aren’t something you should be ashamed of, or judge people on (because there is so much help offered to make the symptoms more livable) would be so beneficial. 
There’s such a huge stigma on mental illnesses because people DONT talk about it.
So many kids in high school literally have an undiagnosed mental illness that they don’t get officially diagnosed with until later on in their life, and if they would have known about their illness earlier, they could have gotten help to make it not so terrible, or unfortunately for some, finding out about it a little earlier could have saved their life. 
Parents always say, “they are in high school, their hormones are changing, that’s probably why they are acting out”, and sure that could have something to do with some things, but for myself personally, if I was educated a little about bipolar symptoms in school, I could have literally pointed out that mental illness myself and say, “wait, I do a lot of that extreme stuff and I feel those extreme ways sometimes.. maybe I should get this checked out.” And getting diagnosed early could have saved me not going through suicide attempts, being hospitalized, and i could have found the right medicine that worked for me earlier... and just my ups and downs would have been more tamed, and I wouldn’t have been doing such terrible things at such a young age. 

Of course high schoolers will be savage towards one another, and make each other feel like shit. 
However, as adults, we should really stand up and try to make a change for the younger generation and try to find a way to get the education system to open a class that would help kids learn about mental illnesses to be able to end the stigma, by possibly starting by helping themselves.

I work about 60 hrs a week and I just notice I don’t enjoy even spending the money, I feel I have nothing to even spend it on. I tried going on Amazon to see what to spend money on and everything to me just seemed pointless. I tried playing video games the other day to unwind and I just feel so indifferent towards it. I don’t experience enjoyment anymore really.

Her and her brother tried setting me up to have sex with someone they knew without telling me anything (I didn’t but it was still embarrassing). She did a whole bunch of horrible things while telling me she was my only true friend and it’s very hard to live with. People around her knew what she was doing but they didn’t warn me, they let her.

It's just so frustrating that there is this pervasive lack of empathy from her. It's like she's still half in denial that there is something wrong with me because I hold down a job (barely) and participate in most of my kids' activities. It's like I've oversold my lie that everything is fine and she's fully invested.

She just walked out and it sounded like it may be for real this time. Is a person like this worth trying to salvage a marriage with? Do some SO's just never really ""get"" mental illness and the sufferers just have to look for support elsewhere?

23,"Hi guys. A little background: I’ve had depression and bdd since high school and it really comes and goes a lot. I recently graduated from a good university and am continuing my education in the same major for grad school (in the US). Being an only child I decided to spend time home with my parents since I feel like I haven’t seen them or lived at home in a while. The town I live in is really small so I’ve been consistently bored/frustrated living there and my parents both work so I’m pretty much alone in the house all day besides weekends. I am no longer friends with a lot of people in high school. Some have moved away and the remaining I have found that I do not get along with them as well as I used to. They don’t understand me and I don’t understand them. They don’t really do much (or want to do much) either, I guess thats just what happens when you live in a super suburban city. Since I’m paying rent at my apartment back in uni I decided to drive back once in a while for a change of pace. This city is small too and I have a few friends here over the summer but I’ve come to realize running away isn’t really working. I still feel extremely lonely. I have great friends but how many times do I bore them with my issues? They can’t help me and I can’t tell my parents much. I tried getting a job but turned it down out of the fear of being stuck in my hometown with a pay thats not worth the independence of me being able to live at uni sometimes, even if that isnt rewarding either. 
I graduated but I don’t feel accomplished. I generally feel gloomy about my future and my heart pounds and I get so anxious thinking about where my life is going. I hate it. I hate the idea of getting a desk job. People tell me not to think but its a cycle of me having way too much time leading to way too many thoughts. I decided on grad school on the pure basis of getting away from a desk job. There are so many emotions in my head that I’m having trouble piecing this together. I’m just really lonely and my depression is coming back. I have days that I wake up early and close my eyes because there isnt anything to do. I have no motivation for personal projects.

28,"So, my wife has been struggling for over a year with major depression, panic attacks, anxiety, and self-harm. It's been a rough year+ for us. She tried Zoloft (sertraline) a couple months ago, but eventually weaned off of it because the dosage started causing some anxiety and definitely anorgasmia (which she literally found extremely frustrating). The sertraline somewhat pulled her out of the depression and her drive didn't exactly come back, but she would get excited during ""activities"", but absolutely could not orgasm. Well, after weaning off, it's looking pretty grim and she thinks she needs to go back on Zoloft. Is she just doomed to a life without orgasms? She really depressed at the possibility since we are long-time married people and have things (sexy time) figured out. We pretty much take care of each other almost every time.  

I'm not going to lie. It's been a pretty rough year for me too. I never tell her how isolated and alone I feel. She doesn't need to hear this right now.

29,"Hello,
I'm a 15 year old cisgender pansexual male.

Symptoms:

Long periods of sadness alternating with occasional unexplainable periods rarely lasting more than a few minutes where I'm extremely happy with no explanation.

When I'm sad I usually self-harm (this is a relatively new habit so I don't go really deep) and feel suicidal. I feel worthless, unlovable, and stupid.

If I don't cut myself when I need to I get really restless.

I think that when people are being nice to me they have hidden motives. Like my friend is only my friend to keep me from talking to her sister bc she somehow knows I liked her in the 7th grade and she thinks I'm trying to hit on her.

I also think whenever someone laughs at something they are laughing at me; because they can read my mind. I also occasionally feel like I'm gonna die for no reason. 

I don't know who I am. I feel like every day I'm a completely different person. I might change what I believe both religiously and politically up to 25 times a day.

I also cannot go on front of my classes for presentation because of an intense fear. I have difficulties paying attention in class bc when I see someone move it distracts me and I cannot pay attention. I feel like I have no future because I'm stupid, weak, ugly, and skilless and often get suicidal over it. ",26Jun2018,0,

I still have a desire to learn and I haven't let my studies falter, but whenever I think about changes I want to make in my life or things I want in the future and should start taking steps towards now, I just do not care. It's so strange. I just want someone to be able to relate to me on this because I have scoured the internet and various psychological and philosophical sources and can't find anything quite nailing what I'm feeling. The biggest part is ""I do not want anything"", that sentence runs through my mind several times a day, and I can't make the feeling stop. Has anyone else felt like this before?",26Jun2018,5,
32,"tl;dr: I'm 90&amp;#37; sure my dad who I barely talk to is mentally ill and I'm nervous about getting what he has. I want to find out what that might be but I'm also not sure if maybe I shouldn't care. He's anti social, paranoid, sees weird reasons for everything/connections between everything, and has never had a ""real job"" in his life. He might be delusional.

There's something wrong with him, and I think it's worse now then when I was a kid. I barely communicate with him anyway so maybe it shouldn't matter, but I spend a lot of time thinking there's something wrong with me, too, even though it's different. Sometimes I worry about developing whatever he has. One time I did intake paperwork for counselling and they asked about my family history of mental illness and I didn't know what to say.

In our conversations my mom and I vaguely acknowledge that he ""has something"", but we've never talked about it more than that. I don't know what she might know. I don't know if he knows.

Should I just try to stop caring about it? I feel like I have to find some general idea of what he should be  ""diagnosed"" with. I don't know why.

He has no friends and I don't know if he's ever had any friends. He has no social skills. He is loud and blunt and argumentative constantly--he tries to get into debates with everyone everywhere, and he doesn't realize how threatening he can come off. (He has been asked to leave events by people who have felt threatened by him and he mocks this as liberalism/safe space stuff gone out of control). He has always been unemployed or self employed and has never worked for anyone else. I don't think he's capable of it.

He sees patterns and meaning everywhere (he writes down the numbers on the clock whenever he wakes in the night), and connects this either with spirituality/religion, or quantum physics, or the government spying on him/censoring him. He's big into conspiracy theories. His bedroom wall is covered in newspaper clippings and sticky notes and bible quotes. One time when I was a kid he took a dog we had briefly for a walk off leash and she was hit by a car and died. He hid her body under a tarp in his truck for hours? days? (Too long ago, I don't really remember. I think it was one day.) before he admitted what had happened to my mom and I. He's like a teenager or child in a lot of ways, very emotionally immature, teasing my mom and I by calling us fat. 

He has a strange incoherent writing style and he spends a lot of time writing on the internet. It used to be commenting on a news/blogging website and now it's twitter. He was frequently banned on the blogging site and had several accounts and was a well known ""troll"" even though from his point of view he was just trying to rationally debate. He used to be a spiritual-ish atheist but now he's fully obsessed with the bible and with native american religious beliefs. On his twitter account he describes Trump as a wendigo and I don't know how literal or metaphorical that is.

When I was young we went for a walk once and he lowered his voice while we were walking past one van and afterwards told me that was CSIS spying on him/the area in general. I was too nervous to find out how serious he was being. He asked me to write a book about all of his beliefs so it could get out there because if he wrote it then they would arrest him/come for him/whatever.

In an email from five years ago he mentioned seeking a psychiatric referral and regretting not communicating ""his issues"" to my mom better, but I don't know if anything ever came of it. He also mentioned that I was ""old enough to face this music, a dance that is genetically programmed within you, so beware. Prepare."" He didn't elaborate further. I would have been 18 or 19, which in my understanding is the beginning of the perfect time to develop stuff like schizophrenia. I did not read this email at the time, so I never asked him about it. Honestly he can be pretty intimidating and difficult to deal with and I am and have always been nervous about insinuating he's ""crazy"".

Sometimes I think there's nothing wrong with him and he's just a kinda weird dude and I'm just obsessed with being ""special"" and none of this is a big deal at all. My sense of normality is maybe kind of screwed up from living with him til age 17. 

Does it even matter?? I think this stuff might be relevant to anyone I wanted to talk to about my own crap but I don't really know how to describe it. I call him a conspiracy theorist but people don't seem to take that seriously.

35,"oh boi, here goes....

first of all, I think I messed up...

I have a long term stress/anxiety disorder which I am controlling with meditation/doctors/psychologists over the last 18 months so that I can lead a normal life again, which I am really happy about. I have found new friends through my university degree that I am doing and am really happy about that, as that is something that I find really hard to do. We meet up on campus a lot and go on random coffee meetups which is great, but lately, one of these friends who has a Bipolar disorder has been asking me out on a date for about a week now. 

The problem is, other than the fact that I see him as just a friend, is that he's only just finalized his divorce at the end of last year and has had a short-term girlfriend in between, and I'm guessing he's on a relationship rebound at the moment. As well as this, he often talks about his past drug and alcohol addiction and attempted/suicidal ideation also creeps up in his conversations a lot, and the rest of us have spent a lot of time with him on the phone in the middle of the night when he has his ""lows"". I unknowingly agreed to go and have coffee, thinking everyone else was going to come too, but when I found out that he was asking me on a date, my anxiety crept in, and I didn't end up giving him an answer. 

Now he keeps pursuing the matter, and I really want to tell him no, but am scared that I'm going to lose all my friends over this - as I am certain that he has consulted them about asking me out. To make matters worse, he has asked me again on a Facebook group chat with all my other friends in it, so that I feel like I have to give him an answer - which I haven't yet - making me feel like the evil person who won't go out with him. I have also tried to talk to family about this, who is currently trying to hook me up with anyone and any dating site they can find, and think I'm stupid for not giving him a chance, but I really don't trust my anxious self around a bipolar person - even my psychologist told me to stay away from him. I've only recently stopped beating myself up about every tiny detail in my life (and sometimes still do), and am looking for another part time job which i quit due to my anxiety. The fact that I sound like a complete bigot in this post makes it even worse.

I told him about my experience with my ex and I breaking up and how that changed me; how it worsened my mental health and caused my eating disorder. I have never really gone that in depth with anyone before, not even with my current girlfriend.

We had dated for six months and she cheated on me with two people. I took it really hard, since she lied to me about it. She told me she just needed ""a break from me,"" and kept telling me she was having a hard time with her mental health. I kept trying to help her and gave her a second chance after I found out about the first person she cheated on me with. Then she kept telling me she wasn't worth loving and I finally found out about the second person, from that person herself. This ex was everything to me at the time. This was just over two years ago.

Now all I want to do is call her and let her know I forgive her. It made me really think about everything that break up caused, and how I got over it and have became a stronger overall person even though she did kind of throw me into a downward spiral when it happened.

40,"First post ever. So, thank you all for reading through my stupid stories. I really appreciate it. 

In the past year I have been suffering from 'depression'. The reason I put the word depression in quotes is because it is self diagnosed so I am not sure if I should be really using that term. But here it goes: 

I cannot find happiness. Nothing makes me happy. I have small moments of happiness here and there but I am not happy in life. 

My experiences: 

1. Last year I lost one of my best friends to depression. He committed suicide.  That took a huge toll on my mind. 
2. I have recently lost my job because I could not focus at work. I did not show up on time once since I started the job. The reason for that is because I did not feel like waking up. I did not want to go to the job. I lost all my motivation to work. I would show up only because it was a really well paying job. Money was good. I was not happy. I am glad I lost the job though. 
3. I thought that would help me find happiness. It did not. I have started to work on my own ideas related to teaching because I love tutoring. But I am having a hard time keeping my focus. I am scared that I will lose interest in that too and fall into something that I don't understand a.k.a. depression.
4. My body is slowly falling apart. I have IBS so that sucks but that is not even the biggest issue. Apart from waking up to a bloated stomach every single morning, both my knees are misaligned. That happened from sports injuries that were never taken care of. Now I cannot move properly. Every other day some new pain starts. I get headaches and colds very easily. I have joint pain as well. However, I am a very active person. I workout 6 days a week (nothing heavy). I love exercising.
5. I have had anger issues and to a certain extent, I still do. But nowadays I am frustrated because of everything that is going on in my life. I just cannot find happiness or the source of my mental pain. That makes me frustrated. But i cannot express myself to anyone either, hence this post. My family, friends and girlfriend all know me as an angry person who easily gets pissed off. So, they think this is normal and all are very annoyed with me. No one realizes this is significantly worse and I am having issues. I don't feel comfortable talking about it with anyone either because they won't understand. In fact, I am scared they might think this is just an excuse for me to always staying pissed at them. And because of this frustration I am pretty much rude with them all the time. Because of this, my relationships are getting ruined. I am afraid I will lose everyone before ever understanding what my problem really is. 

Summary: 

\- Lost in life

\- Feel lonely

\- Cannot find happiness

\- Cannot find source of sadness either 

\- Feel frustrated all the time 

\- Losing out on good relationships because of that",26Jun2018,12,

42,"So after my last visit with my therapist he told me that I should be ready to stop my meds sometime in the summer. He did say that we'll do it the same way I started. I took them for moderate depression and anxiety I've been suffering since high school. I remembered how good life feels. As I ran short on money I couldn't help but do it in my own exactly as told (really gradual dose reduction). I did experience some brain zaps but a couple of weeks later they're almost completely gone. I had no other negative effects and felt more energetic than ever. My emotions are more intense (in a good way) and I feel somewhat better.

Fast forward to the past week, this passive feeling of agitation is back. It does not impair my daily life for now but it sure is annoying. I use video games to cope but they don't seem to do anything anymore, I even think they're making it worse...

44,"Hi,
I have been struggling with this problem for years. I am really uncomfortable with holding eye contact, but only when people are talking to me. I have no problem with it as long as I am talking. As soon as being talked to I get really self conscious about the eye contact and don't really know where to look. This also forces me to lose focus on the topic at hand and therefore sometimes really stops me from talking to people freely. Curiously I am otherwise not a shy person and when in the right mood am actually quite outgoing. Another interesting part of it is that the severity of this seems to come in periods of time. So some weeks I can't think about anything else and sometimes I can even talk to people without thinking about it . This condition has a real negative impact on my life and I want nothing more than to overcome it. 
I am already doing different things to work on it. I meditate regulary which helps a little. I also noticed that concentrating on what the other person says sometimes let me forget about the eye contact and makes it easier for me. Also I am currently reading a book about better eye contact. I also thought about looking for professional help and contacting a therapist.
Have you experienced something similar? It would already help me to know that I am not alone with this. Also do you have ideas tips how to overcome this?",26Jun2018,1,

47,"I [20M] have known this girl [20F] for about 7 to 9 months. We're from a North African country. I developed a crush on her and **got the wrong idea** that she had mutual feelings, so I got enough nerve to tell her after I got to know her better. Unfortunately, I got rejected, but we remained friendly(zoned). In fact we were very close to each other. Basically best friends.

Neither of us wanted to lose the other because of my attraction to her. Even before my confession we were getting along well, we shared a lot in common.. She could see in my behaviour how much I liked her but we opted for letting go. *""And then who knows maybe ignoring it will eventually make it end""* I thought. 

However, it didn't work out. As time went by I grew  obsessed with the crush. It went from a muse to a consistent thought that haunts me all day. I feel down when she's not around, as we usually chat all day and meet on occasion. Only when she's around do I feel relieved. I try to control myself, and at this stage coping with these red flags is getting draining. And I fear that if I don't better the situation I might start acting hostilely towards her. 

I'm considering meeting her to tell her everything that's in mind. That I love her beyond healthy boundaries and that we're better off walking different paths. That I don't want her to hate for giving up on her, because I'm doing it for the sake of my mental well being... And from that point on try to better myself and get over it. It had already affected my life badly enough, putting me on the verge of a breakdown. 
 
But I'm not feeling ready.. I'm not experienced with this (never been in a relationship). Separating with her will be another heartbreak, but I don't know of any alternatives. It's a dilemma. The rational part of my mind is asking me to walk away, while I don't want to let her go. She's someone important to me after all. 

Should I talk it out as planned or are there other ways I can handle this obsession without having to separate with her?

49,"I'm 16 and have had depression since 13 but always been troubled, then I started smoking weed at 14 and honestly it made my anxiety so much worse and even though I don't smoke it anymore, this strange hyper-observatory effect still lingers to this day. When I'm out in public places I will be paying close attention to everyone around me, where they are, thinking they're looking at me and I've become so incredibly skittish. When I quit smoking I felt so incredibly depressed, I had no social skills and my anxiety had become a malevolent behemoth, so bad I couldn't look people in the eyes and would get scared of intruders all the time and getting stabbed in the back literally. I don't know if any of you guys can relate to this paranoid type of anxiety but it really sucks.

56,"I filled this story out under a survey called “memorable vacation arguments” for my favorite mental health podcast. Like the title says, it’s essentially the story of how I reached out to a stranger about some shit I was dealing with, and how that stranger came to fall deeply in love with me regardless of my issues. I’m coming up on the two-year anniversary of this unforgettable argument with my father, and I’m feeling particularly shitty about it today so I thought I’d share the story here too. 
...

My family used to make a yearly trip up north to visit our relatives every fourth of July. These trips consisted of myself, my brother, and my mother and father all rushing to the airport at ungodly hours of the morning, and staying at my aunts two-hundred-year-old beach house with no air conditioning for a week. Making small talk with judgmental relatives was already hard enough, but adding my secret mental illness to the mix made these vacations really difficult. 
Not to mention, I’ve had an ongoing rivalry with my father that has lasted for years. 
For a short summary of our relationship, we have spent long periods of time arguing and have occasionally gone months without speaking, even though we were living in the same house. He’s been an unemployed couch potato for as long as I can remember, while my mother does EVERYTHING. I should also add that his only hobby is watching political nonsense on TV (and let’s just say his stances don’t necessarily match mine). 
Anyway, the last time my family ever made our fourth of July trip was two years ago. My father and I already weren’t on speaking terms when vacation time came around, but my mother insisted we go and enjoy our trip. Ironically, this particular argument between my father and I was started by me self-harming, and him screaming at me to “cut deeper”. We hadn’t spoken in weeks and it was time to take a vacation with him - you can imagine my excitement. (Note that my extended family was not aware of the rocky relationship between my father and myself either.)
I was having a particularly difficult time dealing with the situation. I had a panic attack on the flight and fought back tears the whole way to my aunts house. Once we settled our luggage there, I flopped down on the bed and just wailed into the pillow. The whole thing was making me so uncomfortable: being hundreds of miles away from home, knowing I was going to have to sit and chat with all my relatives and pretend nothing was wrong between me and my dad. 
Eventually I managed to muster up my strength and get back to socializing, but my father unexpectedly pulled me aside to talk. What I hoped was going to be an apology was actually just a scolding about how I need to be more “normal” and stop embarrassing him in front of the family. This of course turned into a full-fledged argument, which led to me hysterically running down to the beach and trying to slice my wrists with seashells. 
Nobody came looking for me, and I sat there on the beach crying and shaking for god knows how long. I felt so, so alone, and extremely suicidal. I needed to talk to someone. I frantically scrolled through my contact list on my cell phone looking for somebody I could talk to....but my mental illness has been notorious for pushing people out of my life, so unfortunately I didn’t have any friends I could call. But I was desperate so I called my boss at work, an older guy who I barely knew, but had exchanged conversation with a few times and seemed like a nice guy. 
I tell you, I’ve never had a hunch work out so perfectly. My boss patiently listened to me ramble and cry, opened up about his own experiences with mental illness, and made sure I was safe before ending the call. We had talked for about an hour before I felt sane enough to walk back to my aunts house. My mother threw her arms around me and said she got us a flight back home that night. Jesus fucking christ I was so relieved. 
As soon as I arrived home I went to see my boss and thank him for talking me through my crazy episode. We ended up spending the day together, and then we spent the rest of my vacation week together, and now we have been dating for two years. He is the absolute light of my life, and to this day I don’t know if he realizes how much he saved me that night. He sees me in a way that nobody else ever has, and he loves even the darkest parts of my soul. He has helped me through some really tough shit, and has taught me SO MUCH about myself. I am so, so, SO grateful for him. Coming up on our two year anniversary, I can’t help but think that if it weren’t for that vacation argument with my dad, I might not be with the love of my life today.

Vulnerability is a scary place for all of us because it leaves us with nowhere to hide. I think there  is simply enough to be scared of in the way the world is right now and that should not include  being open about what is troubling you or to speak out.  

As for me there are so many things going on in my life and so much that has happened that has affected me in a big way and these things will continue to do that. Consciously knowing that I will never be able to change these things is hard. I really struggle to swallow the idea that aspects of my life and aspects of myself that I hate will always be that way, like forever and have always been that way for me. When I am in the mist of these curve balls that life throws, like when these things are actually going on in that moment, I can find them overwhelming. Sometimes while in that moment not even aware that whatever is happening is affecting me in that way. It wasn’t until it happens again that I become more aware of how it is impacting on me. 

I always feel like I am forever walking a fine line from pushing myself forward to pushing myself over the edge and that for me is the worst place to be. It can come over me suddenly and it doesn’t matter where I am, sometimes I don’t even expect it coming but all of a sudden this feeling takes me, To a place where I dont want to be and I will be kept there while im immersed in the feeling.  

I worry so much about people that don’t for themselves and make absolutely no conscious or physical effort to change. No matter how hard I try to convince myself that ‘they’re adults, their issues are not yours and they should look after themselves’ they don’t and mean while in the back of my mind all i can hear is ‘what if what if’ and I am absolutely powerless to change that. It is so draining and It is a feeling I am so desperate to shake but am  some what unable.

People say to me ‘you’re doing well and you should be proud of yourself’ proud of myself for what? Surviving? I should be proud of myself for something many people will never have to deal with in their whole life. It’s crazy! As although I have had this feeling inside my soul for the entirety of my time on this earth, it’s still an alien to me. It’s,what fuels every fist i throw at the wall, why I scream in my car when I am alone, when I come in from work and want nothing more than to sink into the ground. I wish that I could feel proud for my actual achievements and I dont want my existance on this earth to be classed as one of them, because it isnt

I didn't just one day wake up and behave this way, this isn't because of my mind pulling me down, this is because of what is going on around me. ",26Jun2018,8,

60," Sorry for the long post. I think I’ve always had a few different problems, but certain ones have gotten worse over time while others have gotten better.

My mother has always been a social person, and often threw parties when I was young. I was scared of all of these strangers and often would just spend time alone in my room and avoid them as much as possible. This is still something that happens, and I start to feel very anxious when I hear everyone talking downstairs and know that at some point I’ll have to go down there. There have been times when I stayed in my room until 2am, because the party went on for a long time, not even eating dinner. Sometimes I’m able to go down for a brief period, other times I just feel sick thinking about it.

My father has been absent for a lot of my life for different periods of time, and because of that and other things I always feel like I’m alone and everyone will eventually leave me (this has sort of been proven a lot as I’ve lost many best friends for reasons they never told me). My parents divorced when I was young, and that was when everything else started. I was extremely depressed when we moved and started seeing my first therapist. I felt uncomfortable talking to him (possibly because he was a man?) and stopped seeing him after a few sessions.

So, I started talking to the counsellor at school and really liked her. I even went to group sessions, but then things sort of fell flat and I began to get uncomfortable and I went on to high school at that point anyways.

Things continued, I still felt depressed and started to actively self harm in later middle school and in high school. I tried to kill myself one time but it was a really pathetic attempt. I started seeing another therapist after this, and I had more sessions with her. I liked her ok, but then it felt like she never listened to anything I said and sort of disregarded how I felt about a lot of things. I eventually stopped seeing her because of that, and because I felt bad having my parents pay for it.

Now we’re on to college. My anxiety can get through the roof sometimes, and I am incredibly insecure about a lot of things. One of them being what I feel like is body dysmorphia. Sometimes I can’t even look in the mirror because I hate seeing my skin. Other times, I’ll think about a certain body part I hate and start crying and hurting myself because I wish I looked different.

I started seeing one of the therapists through the school’s counseling service. At first, I had a terrible experience. Scheduling was a nightmare and they kept cancelling my appointment, and it already was scary enough to make the appointment for me so that made me even more distressed. Then, they changed the person I was talking to. I really liked the new woman I was talking to. I felt like she was listening to me and she even suggested some things to help that I had never heard of before (one of which was used to help people with PTSD?). But then, I had to cancel one of the weekly appointments because of something urgent, and then she began to just never answer my emails about making another appointment. 

I want to go back to counseling at school when the semester starts up, but I’m terrified. I feel like she’d be disappointed in me for what honestly feels like maybe I just gave up. I am really skeptical of therapists. I have never actually felt like they could help me or ever were helping me. I guess I just can’t think logically about how it could work. I want to though. I really, really want to and have tried to give it a chance so many times.

But I need help. I still self harm. I still hate looking at my face and at my body. It makes me feel sick. I still sometimes lock myself in my room because I’m too scared to talk to people. I still think I don’t deserve the good people in my life, and that nobody loves me and I’m just an inconvenience. And when people reassure me that they truly do love me, I know that it’ll pass soon and eventually they’ll leave me and despise me just like all of my exes and best friends did. I still feel a lot of things. But every time I’ve tried to get help, nothing ever comes of it. I just feel like I’m talking to someone who doesn’t care about me in the slightest bit (which is totally fair). I hate repeating every single one of my problems every time I talk to someone new (it’s been 5 different people, 4 of those I’ve spoken to more than once).

I also have a problem where I have a moment of realization where I go “I need help. I can’t be like this anymore” but then once I go to my therapist, I forgot everything I was going to say and end up talking about something else where I can just feel them rolling their eyes at me.

I don’t know. I just don’t know how to get help.

(Sorry if this is long, I’m just desperate at this point.)

**TLDR;** I’ve tried seeing 4-5 different therapists from middle school to college; I never really felt comfortable, and now I’m scared to go back to the most recent one after not hearing from her in months. How can I go about getting help when I’m scared of the people who are supposed to help me.",26Jun2018,1,

64,"Long story short, I tried to quit sertindole slowly (4mg to 3.5mg, the slowest I could drop) and fucked it up somehow.

I was hospitalized and treated with bromazepam twice a day. I got better quickly. There were some other medication changes such as switches from sertindole to ziprasidone to aripiprazole (current) and an SSRI, sertraline, was introduced, which I've steadily climbed off of in the past month. I'm still feeling bad from the SSRI withdrawal, but not emotionally. More that it exacerbates the evening issues I currently have.

My psychiatrist took me off bromazepam about 3-4 months ago, and that's about the time the evening dizziness started. I'm not EXACTLY dizzy. It's more of a general feeling of not being well and conscious, most prominently during the evenings (as I'm writing this). I'm still allowed to take bromazepam as needed, but I really wish I didn't have to. However, I'm open to the idea of being on bromazepam a little while longer.

There's a lot I have to tell my psychiatrist, but it seems that he also doesn't want me to be on bromazepam, even though it seemed to be greatly helpful. I feel like he doesn't understand what exactly is wrong with me, and I won't be able to word it any better for him either.

My current thoughts are:

- Return to sertindole and increase dosage as needed. NOTE: it didn't help much after I tried to withdraw from it. And, no, it wasn't malignant neuroleptic syndrome.

- Return to the previous dosage of bromazepam.

What do you think? I feel like I'm probably not going to get an answer online or offline at a psychiatrist. I really do feel stuck with this.",26Jun2018,1,

72,"Hi.

I've suffered with anxiety and depression since I was a teenager. I'm 26 now, and I recently found a medication that helps a lot since giving up on finding one for some time. It helps with the suicidal thoughts and intrusive thoughts to the extent that both of these things are quite rare now.

But every now and then I'll get into such an awful,angry mood were I feel so intensly angry I want to break things. I won't be able to explain why, but I'll get surges of anger that come then recede throughout the course of this mood. I can be sitting there doing something then anger will all of a sudden assault me. Sometimes these moods last for a few hours, but sometimes they can last a whole day on and off.

It's really strange and worrying, to the point that I'm concerned there might be something physically wrong with my brain, like some kind of tumor on the part of the brain that helps regulate anger. I know anger can be an issue with depression, and I've definitely had issues with it before, but in the past the anger would usually coincide with being in a very low depressed or agitated mood. Given that the medication helps with other aspects and even the anger associated with low or agitated mood, but not the moods where I get cyclical anger surges, It sounds a bit hyperbolic to say I'm worried I might have a brain tumor, and I think it's unlikely but it's such a physical and intrusive experience that I don't quite know that I can consider it a part of my depression, especially given that the medication helps so much. The only thing I can think is that the medication is changing my experience of being in an agitated mood so much that it feels like a new mood to me? The cyclical nature of this anger could just be that there's a threshold which under, the medication can help, but above, the medication stops helping, giving rise to a cyclical experience of the anger and agitation.

Does anyone have any similar experiences, any advice or explanation for what this might be? I've been doing so well on this medication and really thought I'd be able to get my life in order, and have been, but these moods are a real problem. They're not too frequent at the moment but I'm worried about what I might do if I get a really bad one or if it coincides with something bad happening in my life.

78,"Reposting this from /r/schizophrenia, since I did not get many replies and it's more suited for a place that gets more questions about mental health advice.

I am a male,  26. I am scared of some very recent symptoms I have had. I am going to a  psychiatrist soon (it's long overdue) but I would like some help  dealing with this in the short term as well. I have read the FAQ and I  do not feel that it has answered my questions (more clarification  below). I think I would benefit from the experience of the posters here.

In  the past I've always had schizophrenic-like speech patterns and  thoughts, and my mother does as well (not diagnosed by a professional).  For instance, both me and my mother have extremely disorganized speech,  have interrupting thoughts, speak non-linearly, do ""clanging"", and much  more. This never worried me, although it does sometimes impact my life. I  have been described as a ""schizoid"" by others. I have had  hallucinations under stress, which I recognize can be caused by anxiety,  which I have been diagnosed with in multiple forms by different  professionals.

However, I've never had  delusions, which is what really scares me. However, yesterday, I had a  clearly delusional thought. I was in my room recovering from a migraine  with my eyes covered, and I thought ""I should get (my girlfriend's name)  to turn off the Google Drive link that connects directly to my brain,  that's probably causing this migraine"". I pretty quickly recognized that  this was not rooted in reality and became afraid.

I  have hypnagogia (mental anomalies close to sleep) like everyone else. However, I did not have any  hypnagogia-like symptoms prior to or after this, and I sat up right  after this. I could have been a bit tired, but I am not sure if it was  just the migraine. This is also way more schizophrenic-like (thoughts of  being under control, distorted view of reality) than my typical  hypnagogia thoughts (entirely different dream-like reality and logic).

I  am going to a psychiatrist regardless because of my anxiety problems  and speech/thought patterns that I mentioned, this is just the catalyst.  From the research I have done, including the links in the FAQ, my  symptoms fall into really ambiguous territory. I would really like  someone with experience to weigh in on this. Was this thought as  schizophrenic as I'm imagining it to be? Do thoughts this schizophrenic  occur with hypnagogia, or is it usually more mild? Do people with just  anxiety get thoughts like this? Could the migraine have been impacting  my thought process? Can one thought be a symptom of schizophrenia, or  does it need to be more? Is schizophrenia always prefixed by a psychotic  break, or can it get slowly worse over the years?

Thank  you for reading, and thank you if you can answer one or more of my  questions. I'm sorry if you get questions like this all the time. I also  searched the sub for other questions about hypnagogia and anxiety, so I  hope this hasn't been asked exactly before. I just don't know where  else to ask.

I am NOT going to take advice and walk around saying I do/do not have schizophrenia or other mental health problems. I am just wondering if there is evidence of this being normal/not normal to put my mind at ease until I can see a professional.",26Jun2018,2,

Isn't that the whole reason we are here? We are offended by abuse and exploitation. At some point many of us were abused and or exploited by medical professionals.

I think a lot of us make the mistake of thinking we are somehow exempt from protection under that law or we think we were suppose to ""put up with it"" as part of our ""punishment"".

My advice to all people who have been abducted by psychiatric facilities is to stop putting up with it. They don't have a ""right"" to punish you. You don't deserve it.

They are abusers manipulating a system in order to provide themselves with undue force and undue influence over your life.

They need to be reported, not just through anti psychiatry channels, but through the usual channels that we all forget are there.

94,"People who know me consider me very talented. I mastered various hobbies in my past (sport, technical stuff) and could have genuinely become a professional athlete or something else.

But mental illness has always got in the way affecting my self worth and focus so it was never long before I derailed or had a breakdown.

Surely there are people who can relate? After all mental illness is often the illness of intelligent people some say?

96,"Ok so I take Zoloft (sertraline) and I am also kind of terrible at staying organized and remembering things (probably because of my mood disorder or my learning disability or my shitty upbringing, who knows, I'm just generally not the most functional tool in the box). So I have been through this thing before where I run out of my pills and can't get more for whatever reason, and I know the discontinuation symptoms that I get. Sure enough, this month I forgot to put the cap fully back on my pills and spilled a few down the sink, and my doctor is taking her time sending the refill to the pharmacy. Meanwhile I feel super dizzy and lightheaded and it sucks, especially since I have a whole bunch of work to do in the next couple of days. Has anybody got any tips for dealing with this until I get my rx refilled? ",26Jun2018,2,
97,"Hello,

I’m asking for advice. 

Here’s the story:

In may I took a temp job at a university doing QC (quality control). Every spring the students move out and a small army of contractors fixes their on campus apartments. I’m the dude who makes sure the contractors are doing their job. 

I have severe PTSD and marked on my application that I have a federally protected disability. I informed them when I started and they were accommodating me by letting me come in late on Wednesday’s so I could attend my weekly therapy session. 

Things were okay until I was triggered by the complaints about how I was driving the golf cart they gave me. Nearly every day for two weeks one of or all the QC staff were getting complaints. It seemed like we could do nothing right and I had severe anxiety and panic attacks as a result. So I explained this to me boss and asked if I could ride a bike. It’d be faster than the golf cart (they’re purposely throttled so they go slow) which means I’d get to my QC calls quicker and all the issues with the carts wouldn’t happen on the bike. 

My boss told me the university wouldn’t let me ride a bike or use my personal vehicle. Then he said he’d see how they could accommodate me. Then he sent me home and told me to come back the next day. When I did he asked if I could drive a golf cart and I said I could try. My boss apologized and bought us all pizza and then ice cream. Magically afterwards none of the QC staff got anymore complaints about how we were driving our carts. 

Flash forward to the last few weeks. I’ve been getting more calls than any of the other QC members. I know because I was numbering them. Three weeks ago: 40 two weeks: 60 last week: 80 and after working the last two days I’m already at 35. They’ve been calling me while I’m in another unit then getting aggravated when I tell them it’ll take a while. But the last few weeks have been stressing me out. Stress triggers me. I become curt on the phone or speak in low monotones. It’s been hard to try to keep up. And confusing when my QC counterparts are saying that they’re not getting as many calls as I am. 

Yesterday morning they had a meeting telling us we’re taking too long to get to our QC units and the contractors were complaining. I raised my hand and said that I’ll definitely try to get to them sooner but was wondering why they were saying this because usually when I get there the contractors are still finishing up the job. Today a nice woman from my company (I’m a contracted employee as well) called me after work and told me I was fired. 

She said it was because I was smoking on campus and because I couldn’t follow directions or I wasn’t listening to them. I’m in a right to work state so they can fire me for any reason.

I told her that I was never talked to about the smoking and would stop immediately. I also told her about the increased workload and how it triggered my PTSD. She became very nervous and said she’d contact the university and inform them. She said she’d call me tomorrow. I told her that they may not be fully aware of what my symptoms are and how the increased workload would trigger me. But if they were made aware I’d have no problems coming back and finishing the assignment. 

As of right now though I feel like they discriminated against me for having PTSD. Especially by assigning a ton of extra work to me as if they were hoping I’d just quit. Which if true is awful-trigger someone with severe PTSD in hopes they’ll quit? I’m a suicide risk ffs. 

Honestly I just want to know how the federal law protects us and what you think my best course of action may be. I’m very keen to hear from you if you’ve gone thru something similar and had to file a complaint. Thanks in advance. 

Tl;Dr: Work at a university as a contractor. They know about and accommodate my severe PTSD. But they’ve been stressing me out by assigning me more work than my counterparts. It triggered my PTSD and I was short with them on the phone. So today they fired me. I know I’m protected under federal disability laws but not sure how.
