0,"I am worried for the mental health of a friend of mine. She suffers from violent moods wings, and she is incredibly indecisive. She wants to improve her decision making and I don't particularly want to see her fall down the path I have seen many other friends go down, ending up in almost complete isolation and suicide attempts. She has contemplated the idea of a 'commitment contract' but has no idea what to use as her leverage. I have thought about talking to her about seeing her GP (doctor) about this issue. I am pretty stuck on what to do any advice is helpfull, thank you all",24Jul2018,1,
1,"I have to see my Nex for a final criminally enforceable protective order hearing in a couple days. I would already have one of these in my state if a year ago I had not been so afraid to face this man, and still somewhat brainwashed. I instead stupidly got an agreed upon injunction, in where it is mostly written like a restraining order but one line in it actually gags me from talking about my abuse to ANYONE. I got this because I was able to just sit in a tiny room alone and never had to testify. 

At the last court date his lawyer was on “vacation” and the pushed it all back. His lawyer made it sound on the phone like I had been breaking the order just as badly and the judge admonished us both saying the next person to break it goes to jail. Without even reviewing the order or case, or looking at all the evidence. (I’ve already been informed by multiple friends in law enforcement that the part of the order against me that I agreed to is not enforceable, without reviewing the order the judge didn’t realize this, and it is actually against the constitution.) 

I’ve already had this man hit me and threaten my life and his with a cocked gun. A situation I had to call police for. I’ve had him impersonate me online and get over 1000 contacts concerned. I’ve had him follow me to therapy and send my therapist crazy emails. I’ve had him take pictures of a personal diary entry (about depression nothing worse) and send them to my bosses, friends, parents and family. I’ve already had him trying to defame me with insane projection and reversions of past events in our mutual work industry for over a year. I’ve had him stalk me all the way to Hawaii. I’ve received hundreds of harassing contacts from him and he’s even tried to extort my friendship back by threatening to expose sex tapes. I’ve already endured years of his psychological abuse and him physically raping me in the ass while we were together.  I’ve already endured seeing him and the fact that he brings another man that raped me (and he knows it) to every hearing so far. I’ve endured him harassing our old mutual workplace and every individual mutual contact we had when it first fell apart. I’ve had him flip friends on me and had to move twice in the past to years to hide my location from him. 

And because now I’m standing up to him (by seeking REAL legal protection), it has all settled a bit, yet we still have to have this final hearing.   All the people that I NEED to believe me already do.  My lawyer is going to try and get me a real protective order and the injunction I agreed to about being silenced removed. I’m TERRIFIED to have to face this in a couple days. To face HIM again and see the other rapist as well. Yet I’ve already been through the worst and come out smarter and stronger. I’m not so afraid that I’m just running and not fighting it anymore. So WHAT exactly am I afraid of? WHAT is the reason of this fear? I mean what’s the worst that will happen and how can it be any worse than what he’s already put me through. I mean I’ve woken up from a bad accidental injury bald and confused in a hospital told that two weeks went by before and I recovered and pushed on. It can’t possibly be as bad as that so WHY am I so afraid now? ",24Jul2018,1,

5,"I've never posted on Reddit before. I don't know if anyone is going to read this. I just have to get this out somehow before I put another hole in the wall. Walls can be patched but I still have a scar from the last time it all became too much. I can't tell her, she's scared enough. I went to a bad place and bad things happened and ever since then I can't let good things anywhere near me. Some times when she tells me she loves me I have to clench my fist to stop myself from hitting...myself. I hurt myself in the strangest ways. What hurts more is that she sees it and I see that it hurts her. I lock myself in the bathroom some times. I hit myself over and over. Today it was a lighter on my wrist. Last time I told her it was the cat. Lost one of my best friends today and I'll make sure they stay safe and away. If only I could get them all away from me I could just do it. Even in those moments when she's the only one trying to save me from myself...my mind tells me that she's plotting against me. I remember not feeling this way. I remember not being this way. Am I going to be this way for the rest of my life? How long does that have to be? It hurts...every single day. I say bitch a LOT but only because I think I'm being funny. I apologized to her the other night when I said it and actually meant it. I get so angry now. I say things I don't mean and make threats I would never follow through on. It's not that I want to push people away, I just know it's for the best. Keep them safe, keep them away. Keep them safe, keep them away. Keep them safe, keep them away! I would never hurt her but now I fear going to sleep. I wake up most nights scared and screaming or across the room without a clue. They think it's funny. I think I'm broken. They diagnosed me with PTSD which always seemed kind of lame until they gave me a medical marijuana card because of it. It only takes the edge off. So I drink too. All I ever want to do is slow the thoughts down enough so I can hear my own. I check out. It's comfortable there, lulling. I think I'd actually rather stay there but I always know I have to come back. She isn't scared of me, she's scared for me and it breaks my heart every day to watch her try to save me. I'm so afraid that I'm going to destroy everything I touch that I want to RUN just to keep her safe. But then I know I'd get far enough away to just finally do it and then that would ruin her anyway. I'm stuck with the living. It always sounded like just a whiny line often spewed by an emo kid...""they would be better off without me"". Now, it just really makes sense. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go smile for a camera that hates me.

6,"Hey everyone, this is the first reddit post I've ever made!

I've been dealing with mild depression with typical ups and downs for a few years now, and the biggest issue I've had is dealing with this super-tired-no-motivation feeling I get. I'm a double major student and have kept my grades up so far, but this summer I'm taking 4 classes and I have to use all my energy just forcing myself to do basic assignments. I know I can do them, and I know when I'm done I'll look back and think, ""wow, that was easy, why was it such a big deal?"" This fall I'm taking a few pretty difficult classes, and I need to be at the top of my game when they start.

Let me know any tips you have for this! Just thinking about some assignments bugs me now and I really want to kick this feeling out before it becomes too big of a deal. 

Thanks,

7,"So i started dating this girl months ago that claimed to have depression and anxiety. So i thought she would understand me since i have similar problems. My anxiety tends to make me extremely worried about things that are totally untrue and have no facts or evidence behind it. So i haven't seen her in a week and didn't know why and she would not tell me why so of course i get super stressed out. Like is she mad at me? Is she cheating on me? Is she thinking about dumping me and she doesn't want to hurt my feelings. Another 3 days go by and i literally am having entire day anxiety attacks over it and could handle it anymore. And just flat out asked her wtf was going on i cant handle this anymore. She trys to again avoid the question and lied about not getting my texts asking her what was going on the day before. So i  just ask if she was planning on dumping me. Shes takes the complete wrong way saying ""i love you so much how could you even possibly think that?"" And tells me it was because she hadn't seen me in so long she was really anxious about seeing me again and didn't want to hurt my feelings. I fully understand what she was going through, but she did not extend the same understanding to me and now she wont talk to me because i hurt her feelings. She has anxiety and refuses to understand how i could of possibly come up that i thought she was going to dump me. Even though she made up similar scenarios in her head and asked me and i was completely understanding and made sure she knew it wasn't true. How can i explain to her how much of a hypocrite shes being without hurting her feelings even worse?

8,"24f and recent college grad of a year ago. I moved back to my hometown where I got a job. Problem is, I can’t afford to move out. The cost of living where I am is extremely high. 

Because of that I have no choice but to stay out at my parents place. But my mom especially is making my anxiety and depression worse. She thinks I’m upset with her and gets upset at me when I’m quite and is constantly yelling at me to do things (ie; pick up clothes off the floor in my own room) that maybe is a bit hard for me with how I’m feeling. It’s gotten to the point where all I do now is lie in bed when I don’t have work. Seeing her is starting to become a trigger. What do I do?",24Jul2018,2,
9,"I don’t know what to call what happens to her. She has been diagnosed with conversion disorder, non-epileptic behavioral events. It’s been going on since May.

It started as just “seizures” in which she would tense up one side of her body for a few seconds. Now when that happens she says something that makes absolutely no sense and then completely forgets about it a minute later. Sometimes she is nauseous right after.

She is seeing a specialist once a week and will start seeing a psychiatrist in August, after a couple different medications did not work for her. Lorazepam made her a zombie, and zoloft somehow fucked up her sodium so bad she went to the hospital (again) for almost a week. I don’t think she is taking anything psychiatric right now.

I don’t know how much care my mom really needs but I am worried that there is so much more my family can do. I feel like if I had some idea of what might be wrong with her, besides “conversion disorder,” I might be able to move us in the right direction for help.

She acts almost like someone with dementia, from what I know of how my grandfather who had it acted early on. She is 64 but no one has ever suggested dementia before and she was pretty normal up until one random day in May.

They say this condition was probably brought on by stress. She went through about 6 deaths of family and friends since January so I believe that. I just cannot wrap my head around what is happening to her. 

If anyone has any idea of what these weird dissociative/amnesiac episodes could be, or if anyone has any advice on dealing with conversion disorder/PNES/pseudoseizures, please let me know.

11,"There is someone currently in my life, work life to be exact, who suffers from some sort of emotional or mental problem but I don't know what it is and what to make of her actions. 

She is in her mid 50s, lets call her Daisy and Daisy is always crying about something. Every time something happens in her life, her husband twisting his ankle, having an argument with her daughter, her grandson being ill, Daisy comes to work and has a complete breakdown. She cries and cries, talks about her problem to everyone, including the customers and is highly anxious/activated the whole day. She also has a terrible coffee addiction and drinks around 4-5 cups (each double shot) within a few hours. She really wants to stop, her therapist has been trying to get her to stop but she will not quit. She has abandonment issues and I know this because she told me how her parents sent her off to another country for 15 years when she was only 4 years old. She broke down crying explaining this story to me within the first hour of knowing me! I was pretty weirded out by it until I got to know her over the years and realised, she does it with everyone. She absolutely hates our manager but does everything in her power to suck up to her. She will do extra times and days just to be her favourite so she can get her own way later when she needs something. One of the things that she demands is that she always has the Sunday off. If she sees our manager being nice to anyone one of us or if we have a little private chit chat with our manager, she has a mental breakdown, starts crying (secretly) and then she will come up to you and beg you to tell her what the manager said. She is super paranoid that everyone is talking about her and nobody likes her when in fact, she is extremely charismatic and everybody asks for her when they drop over. I watched her for a good few years to see where she gets this great ability to just bond with people (even though its very superficial because she is very lonely and has no friends) and I realised that people love her because she makes herself so vulnerable. She will just cry to you about her problems and they are usually problems that most people will never admit to in a million years to a stranger and this really attracts people. For example, she will cry about how she worries for her grandchild, how she is lonely or how she feels really unloved by her manager and people look at her just utterly heartbroken. She gives you a feeling of wanting to protect her, basically. No matter what she does, no body can be mad at her because she apologies and cries instantly so you can't do anything. She gossips about everybody in the work place (we are 7 people) and she does it knowing that there is no way we will not find out lol but when we find out, she is the one crying and saying, ""I never said that"" and then we have to hug her and say, it's ok Daisy, it's alright. She has major breakdowns but she is so, so two faced that everybody has started to hate her without being able to show it or do anything about it. She just gossips about everyone to everyone basically and then expects us to not do anything about it because... you know, poor Daisy. 

What is wrong with her? Also, what is the best way to protect myself from her? She will act so nice to me, call me like I'm her daughter and even says things like, ahhh, you remind me of my lovely daughter. She is super, super nice but the minute the manager walks in, she will go and bitch about me to her and say 'oh, she isn't do this enough or enough of that' - which is completely untrue because my manager will tell me and we laugh about it. Also, she is given special treatment due to her age, condition and having a big family where the rest of us are single, young women and we do everything that needs to be done.

I have been with my fiance for 2 years. I love him with all my heart, and we have a 5 year old who I am step mom to, and a 3 month old. The birth of our child was extremely traumatic. I won't bore anyone with the details, but tldr version: I had to have an emergency c-section at 36 weeks, the epideral migrated so it didn't work. I felt the entire procedure, and both my son and I almost died. This was especially traumatic for my fiance who had to stand in the middle as we were both close to death. He wasn't the same afterwards. He couldn't stop crying for weeks. He just kept getting worse. A few weeks ago I had him admitted to the mental hospital in town after he admitted he was suicidal. He was there for 4 days, and seems better. He's in counseling, and taking his meds. He has a long list of diagnosis, depression, ptsd, ocd, and paranoid schizophrenic. Obviously, I'm scared shitless. I know very little about this illness other than the worst stories. Is anyone else in this same boat with a loved one? What can I expect? What should I expect from him as a father?

14,"My ex and I broke up over a year and a half ago but I still feel like I’m dealing with the aftermath of the trauma that he put me through. He cheated on me lied to me for months, I found out through someone else, he denied it, I pushed got the truth out little by little mostly through other people, he gaslighted me at every moment and yet I was so wrapped up in him that I stayed for another 6 or so months when I went through his phone and saw he was texting other women secretly. He tried lying to me again but I didn’t believe him and I was sick of all the emotions and the jealously and the crying. Actually being broken up felt so much worse since he didn’t move out for like a month. I spent almost everyday during that time just crying. 

Fast forward to now doing a lot better I feel like myself again and haven’t been suffering from symptoms of my depression for a little while. I’ve been seeing friends, getting outside, doing well at work. But as soon as I get a little interested from men and I pursue it I feel like I fall apart. I get insecure, awkward, like everything I’m saying is wrong. It makes me want to stop trying to date. And it affects my mental health, I start to think bad things about myself like I would if I was going through an episode of depression. 

I’ve been told that I’m above average in looks and I know that I’m a nice and lovable person I know that I could successfully date but I just don’t know how to trust men romantically anymore. I don’t know if it’s actually possible for me to be as close to someone as I hoped would be possible. Everyday I see on r/relationships one half of a couple finding out about their SOs infidelity. It makes me want to re-examine what I think will make me happy in a relationship. 

I know that I can be content with life on my own but I really was looking forward to a life that I could share with someone but I can’t do that if I can’t trust them. I always assume the worst so I can protect myself and prepare for the worst and I think that puts me in a box.

19,"I’m 16 and going into junior year of high school and all of my adolescent life I have felt rejected. I felt inferior to my peers and have struggled with extreme social anxiety. So as you can imagine I struggle with awkwardness. I feel absolutely awful about myself at school and feel constantly judged. I can often think about times last year where I felt so awful about myself that it will cause me significant emotional distress to the point were I will get dizzy/depersonalize more than I usually am. I just feel so awkward and like literal trash. It’s amazing how I have managed to maintain a surprising amount of friends. Anyways I also struggle over massive amounts of anxiety about the future which has resulted in mental breakdowns before. I can really get anxious about anything if I feel it is slightly important to me. Since this stuff has been going on since the sixth grade for me, I have developed heart wrenching depression and feelings of helplessness. I have been suicidal before. I find little pleasure in doing things besides listening to massive amounts of music everyday. I also struggle with persistent depersonalization ever since I was 14, it’s worst symptom being the fact it makes everything feel meaningless and I’m constantly ruminating about free will vs determinism. I’m very emotionally intense, angry/bitter (with my situation and what i feel is my loved ones lack to support me) and I constantly feel on edge or like some amount of adrenaline is pumping in my body. I have very chaotic relationships as well. A lot of that coming from my low self esteem, my parents divorce and mom moving away.  During the summer I feel more confident and liberated socially but I’m becoming more panicked as the school year approaches do to my horrible insomnia I experienced last year and my absolutely soul crushing feelings of social inadequacy, like i felt no more valuable then literal shit. I’m also a perfectionist when it comes to my grades and it stresses me out as well (4.2 gpa, but and F in social skills lol.) I feel like I’ll be chewed up and spit out by this stuff once again. I’m going to miss the summer in which I can choose to socialize with the people I feel are good friends. But I recently got a job and now it feels similar to school.

I just wanna feel I can relax for just one second, see the world normal again, feel like people love me etc. I feel like I can’t take this much longer.

So.... The past month I've been feeling worse and worse and losing my ability to take care of basic things. 

I used to cook and do meal plans for the whole week but now I just let my food rot in the fridge cuz I can't be fucked to prepare it, then I'll buy some shitty fast food for lunch and eat not much else. 

I let the dishes sit for like a week and my laundry all over my floor without the energy to pick it up. 

The energy is pretty heavy around my house. I live alone, and although it's so sunny it still feels like a dungeon. 

I never used to miss work but I took today off after staying up the entire night feeling shitty. I also called in sick to my volunteer job after AWOLing for the past 2 sessions. 

I'm sitting in my car now having a beer. I think my cat is dead. I'm gonna go drive an hour to check on him, and then I don't know what I'm gonna do. I have to work tomorrow morning.

So a little background on me before i discuss and elaborate my problem is that i’m almost a sophomore in high school and i dedicate a large amount of hours playing video games (Rainbow 6, Fortnite) and watching other people play video games via Twitch and youtube. I’ve been riddled with anxiety and sadness ( im weary to use “depression” because it’s over used and over simplified in most cases on the internet) this past year. I’ve cut contact with all but 2 friends who i sometimes talk to. I used to be very well liked and was usually on good terms with everyone, was in every sports team and cared a lot about my social stigma. But within the first few weeks of high school everything kinda changed, i stopped going to school, i didn’t talk to anyone, teachers were always concerned about me being too quiet or not participating, i  didn’t try out for any sports team either.  I basically got kicked out of my school and i enrolled in another one.

I’ve had this feeling, ever since when the high school started, the feeling of when i looked up and tried to notice the details, everything looked fake, like it was artificial, but for some odd reason, it didn’t resonate sadness in me. I don’t know if this is a side effect for a mental illness or that I had engulfed myself into my hobbies that the real world looked foreign, that it didn’t matter. I’ve gone to therapy once but i never spoke about it and stopped going once she wanted to get my family involved in the therapy aswell. 

I know this sounds and looks really stupid and you’ll probably write it off as me being a drama queen of a teen, but i’d appreciate insights to this problem i’m having and i’d be happy to answer any questions you have or want to clear up.",24Jul2018,1,
28,"I'm a mid 20s male. Likely always been on the spectrum, and have dealt with anxiety since 16. I was wildly socially oblivious before 16(and still am somewhat), although I taught myself how to socialize through psychology books and practice and always managed to make friends. A few years ago I started to get depressed and it nosedived pretty fast. 

Over the course of dealing with the depression, I essentially lost all of my social relationships -- either I cut them out due to a perceived slight, got cut out, or just lost contact. Early on I deleted social media. Then I realized that most people who hadn't dealt with mental illness really didn't care that much or understand. I got closer with friends who had dealt with mental illness. Then eventually those relationships fell apart as well. I was also diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago, and the medication for that sort of helped push through the depression/anxiety and keep my life somewhat together, but also made me develop a bit of an indifferent attitude towards losing friendships, and I sort of lost the ability to tolerate people who weren't able or willing to be understanding/empathetic. 

I seem to be sort of pulling out of the depression now. I stopped taking the ADHD medication, as I sort of started abusing it and it didn't really help that much. After a while of pushing through with the basic advice -- eating well, sleeping, exercise, trying to groom, etc. -- emotions seem to sort of be coming back. The only problem is there's a lot more sadness than any other emotion. It strikes me that I didn't really feel sadness during the worst of the depression, just emptiness and a lack of desire to live. So now I think I'm pulling out - I feel a lot more like myself. But the experience of existence isn't exactly any better, as I'm just left trying to pick up the pieces of my life. I know I could go through the effort of meeting new people and building new friendships, but I struggle to see the point. I thought I had a variety of people who I was close to, but it's like when things got bad people just didn't want anything to do with it. What's the point of friendships when people won't be there when things get bad? I used to think that if I put my all into relationships, if I loved, if I tried to always be there for people, that the relationships would sustain through anything. But now...I don't know. It seems uncertain that it's worth investing so much time into building relationships when I know that mental health can crash even when everything is going well, and when it does -- if it crashes for long enough -- I'll lose those relationships. 

Because of how long mental health issues kept me from working, I can't really afford therapy. And I've tried 7 SSRIs/SNRIs, all ADHD meds, benzos, etc. Nothing really helped. Benzos sort of did, but they aren't sustainable long term so that doesn't really help. 

I just...don't really know how to approach rebuilding. I know I can make new friends, but I don't know how to ever feel security or trust in my friendships/relationships again. It feels like no matter how many ""good"" relationships I have, I'll still always know that ultimately I'm alone. I know now that actually sharing how I feel just pushes people away. And if I just bottle up how I feel and deal with my issues myself, people will just think I'm being an asshole since I'm not able to communicate. Like it's not possible to fake being okay. 

Just hoping someone has dealt with similar issues and can offer some input. I just want to get better so that I can add value to the world, but the safety net for dealing with mental health issues is absolutely atrocious. ",24Jul2018,2,
29,"So I’ve heard that when you smell a completely obscure smell out of nowhere it’s a sign that you are about to have a seizure. There have been a few times that I smell weird thins, for example once while walking home from a friends house, I smelled a sort of toothpaste mint and then began to hallucinate things on the ground. Spiders, snakes, lizards. Some of them just turned out to be things on the ground but I could have sworn they were moving. I had smoked weed before this happened. The other night I smelled something really weird I couldn’t explain and then saw my cat walking around my room. Also earlier that night I saw something in the bathroom but when I turned on the light it was gone. The cat included. What do you think?",24Jul2018,2,

31,"So, I finally got in to see the psychiatrist for a diagnosis today, which is needed so that they can change my medication, and etc. 

After talking to him for an hour, he concluded by saying that it seemed to be a personality disorder, with many other factors, and that he would send a letter to my doctor.

Is there any reason why he wouldn't have an actual diagnosis, or wouldn't be able to tell me?",24Jul2018,1,
32,"Ever since I was a little boy I was never comfortable in my own skin. For every person I met, I became whoever I thought it was they wanted me to be. And to take part in such a practice from a young age can really mess you up, because over time it causes you to lose your own voice; your own sense of self. I was always ""the fat kid"" growing up and this caused me to miss out on a great many experiences growing up- specifically, experiences I believe to be birthrights for every young boy. As a result, I had hardly any things in common with the other kids and mainly kept to myself. I did have friends- usually other loners-, but never felt truly comfortable with anyone. My childhood was, from a familial perspective, was- I think- good (even great), if not unremarkable. I was closer to my parents than anyone else and spent my summers in Europe visiting family and seeing the continent with my mom while dad stayed back in Canada to work. 

Then a few years ago my dad started getting sick. He was diagnosed with a very rare, specific, and aggressive type of dementia called semantic variant primary progressive aphasia. I won't go into the details of it, but, in short, it caused him to completely forget how to communicate and care for himself. There is no way he can communicate with us and no way for us to communicate with him- it all goes completely over his head. The best analogy I can think of is that of an astronaut who was out on a space walk whose tether to the spacecraft got cut and off he drifted into a completely foreign alien world, whose means of communication are completely unfathomable to the poor astronaut. Keep in mind communication isn't just a verbal thing... it includes gestures and other things as well, so those are meaningless to him, too. Eventually people with this horrible disease die because they forget how to breath and swallow. Writing that really hit me. So dad got sick... really sick. 

I started therapy because of him. And along the way I made some stuff up about having a horrible childhood, which wasn't true in the slightest. Sure, my parents fought- maybe even a lot, and very vigorously-, but they were always the very best to me. There were times when they were together and all hell would break loose, but individually they were always incredible and I wouldn't trade them for the world- they are the two people I love most in this world and I will never love anyone as much as I love them. They have always been extremely supportive of all my creative endeavours and have done much more for me than most other parents do for their kids. Being an only child (my twin sister was stillborn) I was spoiled. 

There came a point in the last few years where I feel my mind started to slip. I got so caught up in wanting to seem depressed, because I thought it'd make me more interesting. I had no real life experiences to draw from, so I just played the depressed failed artist role. That is, until I got so lost in that real problems started to materialize. I don't know how I could possibly begin to verbalize this, but I got so caught up in my own mind, living in deranged fantasy, that it has become my life in a very real, frightening, and paralyzing way. My fathers health has rapidly declined over the past couple years to the point where we're \*completely\* unable to communicate even the most basic things to him. He hasn't been out of the house in about five months, which is also around the time he completely gave up on personal hygiene, which has just added a whole new dimension to the hell that is my (and my mothers) life. His scent is absolutely maddening to us. His routine is the same day in, day out- spend about 18-20 hours a day on the sofa aimlessly staring at whatever is on tv (on mute), going to the bathroom about 5-6 times (each time pissing all over the floor), eating only two specific things twice a day (most of which he spits out on the floor), then going upstairs to his bed and watching more tv aimlessly. He hasn't showered in five months or shaved his beard (which is now absolutely massive and repulsively unkept) or done anything else having to do with hygiene. Life was already hard enough with his quickly failing cognitive function, but to have this deeply vile stench now penetrating every surface of our home, constantly lingering in each room he frequents, has really taken things to another level. I promise that you can't even begin to imagine the stench... five months of every possible bodily secretion built up all over you... he even refuses to change his clothes for months at a time. We literally don't know what's beneath the clothes- it could be anything. We've had special nurses and workers come to try and help with him, but even they have never seen a case so far gone as his. He is extremely resilient to all of our efforts. No doctor or nurse or speciality worker or family member or anyone can budge with him. 

Of course it kills me to see the man who gave me life slowly die in front of my eyes like this. I fucking WISH he got cancer or ALS or ANY other sickness instead... because no matter how messed up he'd be, he'd still BE THERE mentally until the last moment. Sure, they all have ramifications on your psyche and affect cognitive function to some extent, but nowhere near to this level- this is orders of magnitude worse than any other sickness I can think of... because when you're on your deathbed, surrounded by your loved ones, you won't know who the fuck they are. And I just can't imagine any worse fate. Even if you die alone in a hospital bed, you died under the illusions your sickly brain was feeding you, unaware of the full magnitude of your reality. His body feels- he is noticeably in pain-, but he cannot communicate it in any way... he can't even point to where it's hurting, because pointing to your left or right shoulder or your chest assumes you know where right or left or your chest is. This disease completely scrambles your receptors to the point where the very simplest (and seemingly fundamental) of things become great big battles, which you never overcome. 

Seven months ago, as a direct result of seeing her husband in this state, my dear mother became very sick with extremely high blood pressure... she could of died... and if she had died, I wouldn't be here typing this. She is my everything. There is no greater love story on this plane than that of my mother and I. She is my impetus for being, both literally and metaphorically. She was my first best friend and has remained my only real best friend throughout my life. She has shown my a level of love that nobody else on earth ever possibly could. The day I was born she put her life on the back burner just to make mine as comfortable as humanly possible. She has sabotaged herself too many times to count just for my own sake. It kills me to know how incredible she has been to me my entire life and how horrible I have been so often to her. I am a real piece of shit. Scum. I never deserved a mother or a father like that. They came to this country and madly slaved away so that I could have a great life. But I took it all and flushed all the incredible opportunities they made possible for me down the toilette. I ruined everything. And now it's too late and I will have to live with that for the rest of my miserable life. Don't you dare tell me things will get better or that I'm not a bad person- you have no fucking idea what you're talking about and all you're doing is giving some tired standard reply you give to every single down and out loser to post on this page. My situation- my life; our life- is so very far beyond repair that I/we have nothing left to do but ride out the wave until it crashes into the rocks and dissipates into thin air. I never would of thought a human life could go so astray, but alas, here I am. 

When I was going through that whole artsy depressed phase, I forced myself to think about suicide, because it's what troubled artists are supposed to do. Boy how stupid I was to force that onto me, because now that's become my reality- my inescapable reality. And you may think ""he'll be fine- people who talk about it seldom carry it out"" and you may just be right... but can you imagine living with those dark and heavy thoughts rushing through your mind 24/7/365? It is absolutely maddening. I fucking wished myself into this state and now there's no escaping it. I wished myself insane. You can't even begin to imagine the shit that's constantly running through my mind... multiple thoughts running simultaneously during every waking moment, from the moment I wake to the moment I sleep- and then even in my nightmares (which are nightly and extremely vivid). I can't sleep until 6 or 7am because of these paralyzing thoughts. I want out so badly... but I don't think I have the guts to do it. Back when I was just faking I'd hold a knife to my throat every morning, trying to sell the illusion to my own self... but now I can't do that, because I don't know how far I'd go. The thought of ending it and eternally being at peace is so alluring, but the delusions of grandeur that I've suffered my entire life-- that is, my great dreams and ambitions-- keep me alive, because I'm a selfish piece of shit who on some level (even if just a very small level) believes he will one day become someone that legions of people will adore for his work, which will be unlike that of anyone else previously. I vacillate between thinking I'm the biggest piece of worthless shit this world has ever seen and thinking I'm gods greatest gift to this planet. There is no in-between- it's either/or. I know I have greatness in me and maybe could of even materialized it under different circumstances. But now... now it's too late for everything, we will all just die and be forgotten. I only recently regained the will to live... there's so much I wanted to see and do and experience... I only saw the beauty of life recently when I was way down low. But what good is it that I saw the light- it was just a tease; this whole life is just a tease.

I bury myself in video games and shit online because when I'm not doing something that 100% engages me I'm scared. Scared that someone is in my house trying to kill me, scared a demon made of smoke with bright red eyes is standing behind me and looking at me, just waiting for me to turn around so he can drag me to hell.

Basically the more time and effort I spend on any task, and the more I practice, I actually get worse at that task.

The more I write, the worse my calligraphy gets. The more I cook, the more disgusting my dishes are. The more I drive, the more I do stupid shit and incidents. The more I type, the more typos I make. The more I speak, the more I sperg out and bite my tongue.

And don't tell me that ""it's just the beginning, keep trying and it gets better"" because I have been trying to write since I was born. And I know it's not dysgraphia because people with dysgraphia cannot even understand other people's writings, while I do.

• flip flopping complete words or parts of words with randomness (""I palked to ba wark"", or I'll say ""I walked to the block/I blocked to the park"" since I may have walked a few blocks to get there), 

• or being unable to start a sentence entirely or complete a sentence, to the point where it sounds like I'm making dramatic pauses for no reason. 

I also get stuck on certain consonants and vowels so bad that I have to restart the sentence (""I wa..aa..aa–ugh, I can't talk today! I walked to the park."") It's mostly the flip flops and stuck consonants/vowels, though. 

It's so embarrassing and extremely frustrating, and I get really down on myself about it. I'm sometimes made fun of for it (my friends making jokes – still hurts) and it happens almost constantly.

I have a high reading score and I don't have dyslexia, don't have troubles with spelling, and can usually write pretty well, although when I'm writing I'll sometimes forget a letter or two in a word by mistake. I don't usually have that problem with typing/texting, though.

42,Rn I'm just lying in bed scared my boyfriend will come back. It's almost 1 in the morning and he had what I guess was a bad mental breakdown. He's been going through a lot the past week with his dad in the hospital due to a failed surgery. I understand why he's stressed out but I've never seen him like this before. It all started with him getting upset when I was cracking my knuckles before he went to sleep. The way his voice sounded when he groaned 'aghh fuck' sounded nothing like how he sounds normally. His voice was distorted and I asked him if he was okay and a few seconds later he was snoring. I thought he might have been talking in his sleep so I don't put much thought into it. A few moments later he was getting pissed that I had moved and was groaning again. This may sound normal for anyone who's really stressed and tired but my boyfriend is the exception....normally. He usually passes out and I'm a light sleeper so I move around a lot but he never minds. I wanted him to be able to sleep well so I decided to sneak off to the guest bedroom so my moving around didn't bother him. I was relieved when I could hear him snoring because he really needed the sleep. About 45 mins later I heard him stand up and stomp out of our room looking for me. He came into the guest bedroom immediately and asked what I was doing. I told him that I was gonna sleep in there  because I know he wasn't happy with me moving around and I wanted him to get some rest. From here on was like a scary horror movie blur and I'm having a really hard time even gathering my thoughts to type this out. When my boyfriend told me to come lay back in our bed I wasn't sure if I should because I knew I'd just keep him up( I can't help if I have rls and move all crazy in my sleep) he was looking panicky when I said I think he would sleep better if I slept in the guestroom. Mind you he's usually very emotional and passionate but is strong and able to handle those emotions or so I thought. Out of nowhere he had a full breakdown and screeched in a demonic tone 'come in the room'. This all happened in less than a minute from when he woke up. I was so scared from never hearing my boyfriend speak that way and I told him you're really scaring me and I said please let me sleep and I want you to do the same because I know you have to work early. He started making crazy sounds and I wa s really freaked out at this point that as soon as he was out out of the room I locked the door and asked him to calm down because I wasn't feeling safe with how he was reacting. After I closed the door all he'll broke loose and I heard all sorts of pounding and throwing and yelling it sounded like an animal was being sacrificed in our living room. About 2 mins later it feel silent. I was gonna come out of the room but then I heard footsteps down the hallway. I heard him say I need you please open the door in a normal/sad tone but I was so frozen scared I didn't respond. He asked for me to open the door again and I told him I was really confused and scared and that if he does that again I'm calling the police. As soon as I said that he started screaming and crying and saying open the door I need you and he repeated this for about 10 mins and I was feeling so devastated for his state of mind but still weary about opening the door because he was just beating up the house and I didn't know what to do. Sometimes he was just screaming OPEN THE DOOR!!! and my name. He finally stopped and I called his phone and told him to please stop yelling because I was afraid of him. He was crying and said he doesn't want someone who's not there for then when he needs them and that his fist were bleeding because I pissed him off. I explained to him that if never seen him behave that way before and it scared the shit out of me and made me feel in danger. He pretty much just repeated that I'm not there for him and I'm not the one for him and hung up. I could hear him putting on clothes grabbing the car keys and roll a joint in the kitchen before I heard the car screeched speeding up our hill. I love this man more than anything in the world but I feel like I know nothing about him now. I also feel terrible for not being there for him but I was truly scared for my life. Please any advice would help he'll prolly be home soon and I'm just hoping he will feel better since he took a drive and smoked. Thanks for listening,24Jul2018,1,

44,"# Here goes nothing - this is my story of how I tried to get help, I live in the UK, so any questions, please ask!  [(Read original here)](http://instituteoftalking.spill.chat/nhs-talking-therapy-a-review/)

I decided to make this article to address the elephant in the room. The NHS is a service struggling to survive, with an obvious lack of funding leading to headlines like [**NHS funding cuts 'will lead to 100 avoidable deaths per day'""**](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-funding-cuts-100-deaths-per-day-public-spending-squeeze-british-medical-journal-a8058101.html).

This is not a review of the idea behind the NHS. It is a review of my experience, including how it made me feel. And my opinions on my experience are not the same as my opinion on the *idea* of the NHS. This is important: it means I believe the NHS has potential, even if it hasn't tapped into it yet.

**Mental health spending increased by 3.9% from 2016-2017.** Hopefully this means the service is on the up, but I can't help but think that mental health services from the NHS require a 40% increase in investment, not a measly 4%.

### My review

I started by going to my GP, and after a call to a NHS helpline style service, a man - tasked with the job of assessing me - arrived at my home. I remember feeling scared that an unknown man would be infiltrating my safe space. (At this time, I found it hard to speak to anyone about anything. So opening up to a stranger was scary.)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The man came a couple of months after the helpline call. He handed over a wad of paper, of which I was obedient in filling out. Pages and pages of self-assessment questions. Some time was spent with my parents in the room; some time it was me and him.

After filling out a classic ""I have felt \_\_\_ in the last week"" form of about 50 questions (felt like forever), the assessor counted my ticks. He compared my score to his table, and basically said that - you might, maybe, possibly have a problem, but I'm not too sure.

And that was that - after months of feeling terrible I might be ""at risk"" of some mental health issue. How could I not be angered at what seemed like an effort to completely belittle what I was going through?

In just 60-90 minutes I had been surveyed, had my life story and upbringing recorded, and discussed how I felt about a number of problems.

My initial post-meeting feelings were of relief (that it was over) and a little excitement. Even though the survey result was inconclusive, I was surely on the path to some kind of help/support to get me back on track, right?

In the meeting, ""CAMHS"" was mentioned, there was no convincing ""you should definitely do this"", but instead a ""there's an option of this"". Nothing was rooted in certainty, it was as if I was supposed to know what was best for me. How should I, a child naive in the field of mental health, know what is best for my own mental health?

At this time, I owe thanks to my mother, for without her being there to push me in the right direction - and convince me to sign up to CAMHS - I doubt I would have ever done it without her. And as a side note, I have only recently discovered what ""CAMHS"" stands for (Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health Service), and this is testament to the uninformative way the program was advertised to me at that initial home assessment.

This is difficult to explain, but at the time my mindset was that no one could help. After being told ""you'll be OK in a few months"" a few months previously, and a few months before that, I had it drilled into my head that I had to fight my own demons. The longer it went on, the harder it was to open up. The more I alienated myself from other people, the more I convinced myself this was a problem with me, and that I shouldn't 'bother' people with my issues.

So why would I bother signing up to a six-month waiting list for a service I didn't know was right for me? I had seen counsellors (in school) before this, but they seemed to only reinforce my problems; why should I bother again?

**When you're in a state of crisis, you don't want to have to make a decision, you just want to be told what the best option is.**

Imagine you're about to enter an exam on something you have very limited knowlege about; your teacher approaches. They tell you that they believe the first question has two possible answers, one is right and one is wrong. The teacher knows which is right and which is wrong, but instead of telling you, the teacher just tells you the two possible answers.

Six months later, a year after I started feeling bad, and my CAMHS course is about to get underway. My mum gives me a lift to the location, which is reminiscent more of a mental asylum than of a centre for healing.

### The review starts

I have to open the first set of doors via a buzzer, then speak to a receptionist to get through the second set of doors, then speak to another receptionist, then take a seat. When I speak to the second receptionist, she asks for my name; I feel uneasy. There are four or five sets of eyes burning a hole in the back of my head; I hesitate. I say my name, give my appointment slip in, and then I can take a seat. As I walk to the seats, I look around the dimly lit room. Faces are glum, and I feel out of place.

At that point, I was extremely nervous and apprehensive. Thank goodness I didn't get help when I actually needed it, because I wouldn't have been able to handle the described environment then.

I get called through, the lady (let's call her Jen) introduces herself as a counsellor, and we start talking. For maybe the fourth or fifth time, I have to reel off my life story, how I felt and when, my relationships, particular events, my interests, and every other detail that comes with those. That was the first session, an hour long.

I had started a new school by the time I started the CAMHS program. Our sessions were always on a Thursday morning. My classmates asked where I was, I would say I don't do Thursdays. This was not an experience I wanted to share with anyone else anytime soon.

Over the next few sessions, we talk and we talk some more. I was hit with a full arsenal of CBT, mindfulness and interpersonal therapies, Jen got inside my head, and kept poking around until she found a problem, it was hard work. I was always really tired during and after a session, and I remember wondering how much longer I had to do this for.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I may seem ungrateful, but I saw no difference in my mood, I felt like things were pointless, I had little to no positive feelings and had no friends or relationships outside of those whom I lived with. And even in my own home, I couldn't stand conversation, it was so irrelevant. With no change in my experience, why would I want to continue?

Too often, people feel pressured into telling their counsellor they are making progress. I did this. I felt like I should say it is working because if I said it, maybe it would? Or maybe I was too afraid of speaking out and saying I didn't see the benefit?

But I persevered. Every week I put as much effort as possible into the hour-long session with Jen. I tried to imagine I was on a desert island in a peaceful environment, and I tried to imagine a glowing orb passing over my body, but Jen's exercises were some of the hardest things I've ever done.

About half-way through my CAMHS program I started seeing a CBT expert (let's call him Paul) privately, at great expense of course. I wasn't getting enough out of one hour a week - there was just not enough benefit. I am fortunate that my parents can support me in this way, but surely the NHS should offer this kind of service?

Paul was quite full on, he recommended books and CDs and told me exactly what to do - e.g. write a letter describing how you feel when 'X' happens. This was different to Jen. Jen's sessions always felt sluggish, whereas Paul's were to the point and always relevant.

It was when I was seeing both Jen and Paul at the same time that I started to notice a few changes, mostly in my outlook on things around me. I was less cynical and less sensitive to the world around me for the first time in a long time.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe these changes were from Jen, or from Paul, or maybe it was the combination that helped. It is impossible to tell now.

Jen kept telling me we're trying to ""fill my toolbox"" with ""tools for when I need them"". But when we had two sessions left, I was somewhat panicked. Jen told me to trust in our toolbox - I guess I had no choice.

I filled out a form concerning how I had found the course, which is great. Not so great was the fact Jen was a metre away from me, and read what I wrote immediately after. A hint of bias, maybe?

And that was that. I'd gone through the NHS system and come out the other side; it only took two years. Of course, I was under eighteen at the time, and this meant I was somewhat prioritised. The area I lived in was also pretty good when it came to mental health support. Basically, it could have been a whole lot worse.

### Reflecting on my experience

Reviewing my journey, it is difficult to pick out how much my NHS counselling actually helped me, and I felt a bit like there was a 'one-size fits all' approach. But to be fair, with the limited resources they had, they did a decent job.

&gt;*""I got support, but not when I needed it.""*

It goes without saying that there must be more investment into mental health. But I can't do that myself. Instead, we have to invest in creating an environment where it's okay to seek support, and people aren't judged for receiving it.

### Beyond the NHS

Together, we can build a society where mental health problems are respected, not feared. One where I can tell my peers I am seeing a counsellor. And where I don't have to use the ominous excuse ""I'm going to see a man about a dog"".

Maybe this is the job of the NHS outreach team - to craft a more accepting society. Or maybe it isn't. Either way, each one of us has the potential to help someone when they need it, instead of getting help a week, a month or a year later, when it's too late.

I was latery prescribed with xanax for my panic attacks/compulsive behaviors/anxiety but i always fuck it up with meds and thats what happened tonight. 
Long story short, i'm a ""campleader"" in a volunteer project for which i live in a house with 30 other volunteers, they left a mess yesterday evening and the boss was gonna be here this morning so i stayed up all night to clean the whole house and didnt taxe my xanax because it would have made me fall asleep. Plus the dog of the boss shat on the floor because his owner changed his food without telling us and he had diarrhea. I went to sleep at like 7 am, woke up at 9 and started having random panick attacks. I went to thu kitchen to have breakfast but when i saw the other guys i started yelling at them, then i yelled AT MY BOSS for not taking care of his dog. They tried to calm me down and i started crying and hyperventilating and didnt stop for like 2 hours. 
Now, i'm a really fucked up person but i never EVER yelled a someone (social anxiety makes me care too much about what people would think about me then). It's the first time in my life something like this happen and while it was happening i actually really wanted to stop but it was like seing myself from the oustide and not being able to do anything. It happened like 3 hours ago and im still shocked and can't stop panicking, even though i've taken my meds now. 
I don't want people to think im a burden but i actually am, i'm someone to take care of and they already have too many things to think about.

52,"Hello all!  As a mental health professional, I thought I should post answers to some common questions regarding therapy.  This post is not intended to promote my services, and is only intended to provide information.  If I haven't address your question, please feel free to ask me!    

Note: This is meant to be a general overview, as some things can vary depending on your state or your specific circumstance.

**Q: What can a therapist disclose? Is everything I tell my therapist confidential?**

**A**: In most states (likely all of them), everything you tell your therapist is confidential and is protected by HIPAA (Health Information Portability and Accountability Act). There are a few exceptions: 1. If you have knowledge of abuse to a minor child or vulnerable adult/admit to partaking in abuse to a child or vulnerable adult, a therapist is required by law to report it. Therapists are one of many state mandated mandatory reporters. 2. If you express with serious intent that you want to harm yourself or someone else, your therapist will perform a risk assessment to assess the risk/likelihood that you are going to follow through with said intent. If the therapist deems that you are at a high risk for following through with your intent, your therapist will recommend a psychiatric hold (in Florida it is called Baker Act and is a 2-day involuntary hold in which you will be evaluated, but the terms of the hold vary from state to state).  3. Lastly, if your therapist identifies you are severely struggling with your activities of daily living(ADLs) to the extent they are concerned you are not/cannot care for yourself, they will recommend a psychiatric hold. Some examples of this are rapid weight loss due to not feeding yourself (due to mental illness and not inability to buy food), deterioration of good hygiene practices (again due to mental illness and not choice) to name a few.  Again, this also can vary from state to state. 

**Q**: **What if I don’t like my therapist, how can I get a different one?**

**A**: The foundation to successful therapy is a good therapist-client relationship. If you are not connecting well with your therapist, you can ask them for a referral to a different therapist. They will not be offended and it won’t hurt their feelings. But they will ask why you want the referral and what you think you need different compared to what they are currently providing. This is so they can refer you to someone that better fits what you need. Often times, a therapist will notice that you are not meshing well and will recommend that they refer you to someone else. 

**Q**: **What if I don’t have insurance?**

**A**:  This one is tricky in that it will depend on the resources in your area. A lot of therapists have what is called a “self-pay” price, which is generally a discounted price if you are not using or don’t have insurance. Many providers are moving to this model anyways, as it is less hassle than dealing with insurance companies. You might try a community behavioral health clinic in your area. They often work on a sliding scale fee based on your income. The best way to know for sure is to call your potential provider’s office and ask if they have a self-pay rate because you do not have insurance. 

**Q**: **Will my therapist prescribe me medication?**

**A**: Therapists do not prescribe medication. However, they will want to know which medications you are on, as some medications have rebound effects of the symptoms they are meant to prevent. EX: Ativan, which is often used to prevent panic attacks, can cause rebound panic attacks. If you are wanting medication, you will need to see a Psychiatrist or your primary care physician. 

**Q: What is the difference between a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW but can depend on which state you are in) a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), and a Psychologist?** 

**A**: So each of these do very similar jobs, however they differ in their training and their treatment philosophies. An LCSW or clinical social worker will look at all the elements in your life and take a big picture approach to your treatment in relation to your mental health. I am a registered clinical social worker intern which means I have completed the education requirements to practice, I am completing the required clinical hours to become fully licensed. It is very similar to the residency a doctor does. A Licensed Mental Health Counselor and a Psychologist both work under the medical model in which they diagnose you and then treat the diagnosis. Although, a psychologist can perform certain assessments and testing that all the other mental health professions cannot. One example is the IQ test. Another difference between these is the training they have. So Clinical social workers have a master’s degree in Social work, Licensed Mental Health counselors have a master’s degree in mental health counseling. Psychologists will have a master’s degree or doctoral degree in psychology and can specialize in counseling, clinical psychology or school. Because licensure requirements for all of these professions differ from state to state, I will tell you to research the licensure requirements for the above professions for your specific state. As I am a clinical social worker, I can only 100% speak to the requirements for my specific profession. So this is just a general overview of each. 

**Q: How does my therapist know if therapy is working for me?** **How do I know if therapy is working for me?**

**A**: So most therapists will do assessments throughout your treatment to determine if the interventions they have in place are working. So they might have you fill out a questionnaire at the beginning of treatment which asks specific questions about the symptoms you are experiencing, and then a few weeks after beginning therapy they may give you the same assessment, and then compare the two. If it is working, your scores are likely to improve and the therapist will continue the treatment plan. If your scores stay the same or your scores decrease, they might try the current therapy for a few more weeks or they may try different interventions. They will also take into account your thoughts on if you feel you are improving or not. As far as you knowing if therapy is working or not, think about how you currently feel in relation to how you felt when beginning therapy. Then have an open conversation with your therapist. Your therapist might notice some improvements that you did not. But being open and honest with your therapist is KEY to successful therapy. If you aren’t seeing improvement, ask yourself, “have I been completely honest with my therapist, have I withheld certain information?” “Am I working on my treatment goals outside of therapy?” “Am I clicking well with my therapist? Do I feel like I can be open with my therapist?” “If so, why or why not?” This is also a great conversation to have with your therapist. 

**Q:** **How important is my diagnosis to my therapy?** **Do I have to have a diagnosis?**

**A:** So if you are using insurance to see a therapist, unfortunately we have to provide insurance with a diagnosis and a treatment plan. However even then, the diagnosis is for insurance purposes only and really have little to do with your treatment, except in some circumstances. Because most interventions can be used to treat many different things, the diagnosis is really just a starting point. So for instance, if you are having issues with emotional dysregulation, sure that is a symptom of ADHD/ADD, but there are still certain things we can do in therapy to help you become better with emotional dysregulation. Emotional dysregulation is a symptom of many mood disorders, as well as a few other disorders. So really, the diagnosis isn’t as important as the “symptoms.” However, if a provider is not billing insurance, they may be slower to attach a diagnosis as it isn’t needed for reimbursement. It really depends on the type of provider you see, though. There are times when the diagnosis is important, say for instance, you have a certain disorder and you need to have the diagnosis documented for school so you can get the resources/accommodations you need to succeed.

With all being said I will tell you about the situation I am in. My fiancé says she has GAD and I believe and respect that in most situations I would ask her how she feels about doing certain stuff and I am okay with cancelling almost anything she is not okay with. 
Nowadays, I am getting the feeling she is just using this as an excuse to not do stuff she does not want to do. Here is the last thing happened which pushed me writing here. We have our wedding this friday and my mum is just running all the errands making sure everything is okay and she is exhausted out of this. And in this process we never saw my fiancé getting excited for any of it. She doesn't feel like doing anything (i.e. looking for dresses for herself). Today she told me how she can't do the first dance cause of her anxiety as well. I tried to convience her to begin with by saying how it will be our night and she can just focus on two of us but after I noticed it is not working I stopped insisting. I was left with being called selfish and not helping her. 
I do respect the anxiety disorder and I slightly know what it is capable of that is why I don't insist on many matters but in return I don't see my fiancé making any attempts to get better of it. She doesn't go to any professional about it and when I tell her to she just ignores it. 
I feel like I am reaching to my limit since I am not seeing any attempts from her.

I'm a 15 years old girl and since I was 12 I had some problems with, what I thought at the time, was depression. I talked to my aunt who is a type 2 Bipolar about it and she told me that the symptoms I described her reminded her of the ones she has. 

Of course, I'm not saying that I am bipolar since I haven't had any consultation with a professional yet. I'm just saying it so that you have context.

My question now is: Is it normal for me to feel guilty if I laugh after crying ?

Let me explain. I tend to never cry until it's too much for me and I just burst out crying at any minor problems (Example: Last time I cried for 10min after my mum told me that I would have to wait before talking to her because she had to put my brothers to sleep). That is not the problem even if it is indeed somewhat of a problem. I will feel dumb after crying because of such a little thing ven if I know that this isn't the ""real"" reason for why I cried. 

I will also feel guilty when I laugh after crying, like if I am watching something funny to cheer up. I will feel guilty for cheering up even if I wanted to.

62,"Hello! I am in the US and started seeing a new therapist a few months ago who I see every other week. I was seeing a different therapist previously every week for a few years but found my sessions really unproductive, just me rambling, and there were other reasons it was not a good match too. It took me a really long time to quit even though I knew early on I was not improving.

  
Now I am finding myself falling into the same pattern, just rambling my entire time. I want to stop that before I start feeling lost again like the first time. Sometimes I leave with a new way of thinking about something or a suggestion of an activity (usually something like ""make time each day to be grateful even about a small thing"") but I may do them for a day or two and then have a hard time keeping it up. Usually it doesn't get brought up again in a future session so there is no reason for me to do it except for myself, and I just forget about it. I need help to put some direction to my sessions.  


I am not sure how to best ask for her to help with this. I don't just want to talk at her for an hour and I want to feel really productive and like my sessions are being effective for me. I get that every once in a while could just be a talking time, but I don't want it to be every time. Could I bring her a workbook I want to do or ask her for a suggestion of a workbook or worksheets or some kind of homework? I think that might help me work out some things. Once she gave me a worksheet (it was more like an information page) but I liked it. Could I ask her in advance of my next session in an email, or wait til I go in?

I have great friends, i do alot of activities, im in school at the moment and i feel like everything is great.

But still, i feel some kind of guilt, sometimes i cry fo no reason, i ususally just feel no emotions all the time.
I am always tired, for no reason. Im healthy, i get enough of sleep, enough of vitamins, why am i tired?

Ive recently lost all my sex drive, i used to be a sex freak, now i just dont care, too tired to deal with it.

My parents split up about a year ago, but i dont remember feeling any different back then.

This probably doesnt make any sense, but im just so confused, because i dont feel like i should feel like this.

70,"I have been fired several times from jobs such as being a cashier and waiter due to just not being ""incompetent."" I never cause problems at work, in fact, people love me at jobs, but I get terminated just for being bad at them. It's to the point where previous managers would feel so bad about firing me, but I'm just ""bad for the business."" I would make constant mistakes and whenever I learned something, I would just forget it shortly after.

I used to love video games, but I stopped after realizing I suck at everything I played. I could not even beat Breath of the Wild due to not being able to take on the Lynels in the last part of the game. Online games kick my ass and puzzle games stress me out.


I graduated college with a 2.2 GPA after switching majors like 4 times due to the other ones being my definition of ""too difficult.""

I managed to get a job as a bank teller, and I'm on the verge of being fired. I started training a while ago with 5 other people, and they are all doing well and being promoted, while my manager keeps having to reteach me stuff. My manager even sat me down to ask if anything is wrong with me and if I'm on drugs, which I'm not. I constantly make mistakes even when I try my best to focus and avoid them. It's to the point where customers will come in and obviously avoid me and go to the other new tellers, which is extremely embarrassing and makes me feel even worse.
 
What is my deal? I will never be successful if I can't even do that basic tasks right. I know something is wrong with me due to other people around me being able to grasp stuff well.

71,"This is absolutely weird, is it not?

(Somatic Experiencing Trauma Specialist)

My therapist asked me what I needed once.  I said encouragement.  She said she'd send me some encouraging emails while she was out of state for a couple weeks.  I felt awkward accepting this, but I did.

A couple weeks later, I noticed she would miss days and then apologize for it.  This made me feel really guilty.  I felt just strange and guilty from the beginning, even if I wasn't fully aware of that uncomfortable feeling.  The emails were not exactly encouraging.  They were these little snippets, kind of odd, like, ""There was a great downpour last night.  Today, the flowers look rejuvenated.  Take good care."". I mean, I really did appreciate the intent...

But when she began apologizing for missing days, I just told her that it was no longer necessary.  This was like a couple weeks even after she got back.  I felt they would be temporary, even just an encouragement right then and there in her office when she first asked.  What I could not communicate at the time was that all of this therapy stuff was difficult...I just wanted some human encouragement, like something real.  Our sessions often felt so clinical (even if effective on a physiological level.)

So what happened when I told her she could stop?  Nothing.  She ignored me, and just kept sending them.  Like two weeks later, I brought it up again....at this point I was confused, trying to figure out what the reason was, like did I need these and wasn't aware that I needed them?  What happened when I brought it up the second time?  Nothing.  Ignored me, kept sending.  So 4 days later I am very vocal about it.  

Suddenly, she describes these emails as a ""care plan"" and that she can't discuss a care plan outside of a session.  (We had had at least three sessions since I first said to stop.). My next session is in like 3 days and, what does she do?  Keeps sending them up to the session.  

A month after my original request, she finally talks about it.  She acts all professional and clinical about it, doesn't even acknowledge that she ignored me twice, doesn't acknowledge that the whole thing was weird.  

But next, right after she asks me (lol), ""so you'd like to end the emails?"" she starts telling me that she is my therapist, not a friend...so if I send her emails she will just reply, ""thanks for sharing."". This made me dissociate big time, because it reminded me of my cult....how I was shunned essentially for growing so dependant on them....

But the weird thing is that I told her early on that I didn't like how this daily interaction was making me feel dependant.  Sometimes I'd reply to her encouragement with a reply.  Sometimes I'd send an email just sharing something in general.  Our sessions we did no talking about stuff, just working with the body.  That whole time I had all these things I was needing to talk about with someone (in another thread about her refusing to talk about an ex partner).  Her encouragements actually began making me have breakdowns..,.they made me feel very sad.  I felt guilty that I began sending her my thoughts or questions, and then she called me out on it.  It was a cult flashback, I guess.  

Before the encouragement emails, we didn't interact by email except very occasionally. 

When I told her all this was weird, she said these things were misunderstandings but offered no explanation.  She offered to explain in a session, but that she ""understands if it would be too much for me."". Then she agreed to answer by email but never did.  Just silence.  She was ""sorry for the misunderstanding."" 

Thank you for any thoughts you have about this.  Was it valid for me to think the situation was incredibly weird, and even disengenuous when it got to having to halt the care plan in person?",24Jul2018,3,
72,"So let me just start from the top. I am a 19 year old college student home for summer break. On July 25, 2017, my mom had a terrible stroke and has been left seriously ill ever since. She has had extremely bad depression and anxiety and she’s suffering every day. She works hard with her doctors and therapists to stay strong, but at home she still has a very very tough time.

What’s been hard for me is that I’ve been away at school for most of the time she’s been going through these things, so I didn’t really see how bad it was until these past few months being home. I feel so bad for her and constantly worried about her well being.

On top of this I have been working 40 hour weeks, and doing online summer classes at a juco. It’s been very overwhelming for sure.

Two days ago I think a ton of the stress finally caught up to me, I think I had a panic attack right in front of my girlfriend at her house, and got very emotional. I get worried easily about everything (have been almost all summer) and now I’ve felt very depressed. I’m eating less and just feel completely out of it. I can’t tell if this is just a mental breakdown or something worse and that’s what scares me most. 

I’ve never been in a spot like this, and I don’t know how to react. I’ve told my dad and my step dad about the issue and that I want to talk to a counselor or somebody about how I feel, but I’m still scared about everything. If anybody has any advice, or has gone through something similar and wants to share, I would appreciate it",24Jul2018,3,

75,"While there are many home remedies to relieve the symptoms of depression, however, in this video I will show natural remedies that I personally tried and always works for me positively when I am down.

Of course, if you feel very depressed, you should follow up with a psychologist, along with these recipes that will help you overcome depression and frustration. Or let me say that these foods will give you a feeling of happiness.

Depression is the disease of our time, most of us passed or experiencing depression in his life of low level or even high because of social pressures and other reasons. A person’s concern is no longer just his family and his livelihood, or study.

Although the entry of technology and the Internet into our lives made it easier, but at the same time it turned it upside down and accelerated the speed of life. One of us Carries burdens that we did not experience decades ago. Social pressures that were small and did not surpass the family, work and friends environment of a person multiplied due to the Internet and social connections.

This is a result of the strong competition between people on the social sites to lead and compete with each other. Of course, we can not forget the economic pressures and other responsibilities that have become a heavy burden on us today; by the time a person solve a financial difficulty, he immediately will be faced with ten like it.

Therefore, we must pay attention to our mental state so we have control  our life and move forward in our lives. These home remedies that I have tried may be a help for you to cope from depression and frustration and give you a boost of happiness.

Depression is often a biochemical imbalance, a hormonal imbalance, or a lack of nutrients. These are some of the foods that help overcome depression.

I've been having a general slackness to my approach in things start creeping into my life. It's hit a point now where I can't follow a fucking schedule to save my life, and not for lack of trying. In the moment I need to do the thing when I need to do it, there is nothing I want to do less than the thing I need to be doing. For everything. EVERYTHING. Scheduled recreational time? No. Scheduled work time? Fuck no. Scheduled social time? Fuck off. Alarm goes off? Fuck it. My desire to drink, jerk off, and do nothing but sit and clear my head has become so uncontrollable that the best I can manage is to not drink or jerkoff or smoke... and do nothing else either. It's not like I'm falling into addiction, rather the call of the void for it is tugging on me abnormally hard to the point I'm just shutting down rather than giving in.

I used to have hobbies, and time scheduled for hobbies, but now I'd rather browse reddit for two hours, do nothing, eat, and go to bed early. I used to have gung-ho approaches to work that follows me home, but no, now I'd rather do 5 minutes of work at a time peppered with 10-20 minute segments of dicking around and a nonstop berating of myself that I could have had this done in less than an hour and saved an hour for actual hobbies.

But i just don't feel anything, joy, sadness, i don't even feel fear.  It's not a huge deal for me as i can fake quite a lot of these to suit the situation around me.

I faked happiness obviously as i worked kinda hard to get it and it is a cool opportunity. I've been told by my own family how its weird that i don't show emotion and what not.

79,"Hey all, for other info, check my post history, idk what the fuck has been going on with me since I tried LSD, but here's a few details about me and the experiences

* I'm 16 (I KNOW IM TOO YOUNG, I KNOW LSD ISNT A DRUG TO BE FUCKED WITH, I GET THIS, I JUST WANT HELP NOW, I beat myself up everyday for taking it like I did)
* I've done LSD 4 times (no issues until the last trip, which was June 23rd)
* I've only had one good trip, this was when I didn't smoke weed with it (I smoked weed on the rest of my trips, and I think that's what caused a few issues)
* My 1st bad trip in April was about me getting arrested (I could see police lights, police officers, and hear sirens)
* 2nd bad trip was another scenario with police, and a bit of a mindfuck as well as I saw images of myself going crazy
* 3rd bad trip was of me being in the 1st trip again, not the good bit, but the bad police bit, I went home after seeing this at a friend's house, and then I saw an image of my dead dog in my lap, as if I had killes him out of psychotic rage (this is one of the things that baffles me as I don't know why I would see any of this, I love animals and would never hurt my dogs)
* I have non stop deja vu, every conversation, every thought, sometimes things I see are deja vu as well, and it scares me, idk what the fuck this is
* DPDR like symptoms (feel like I'm living in a dream or I'm in like a coma)
* See dots of light every now and then, slight visual static, and more floaters than normal
* I've quit all substances, I've quit weed, I'm never doing LSD again, and I try not to have much caffeine, but i still have chocolate

I'm only here for advice, don't berate me on using LSD, i do that to myself everyday already, this deja vu and everything else sucks, it's as if I've already typed out this paragraph, as if I've already typed this post once before.

Idk whether this is anxiety, DPDR, HPPD, psychosis, PTSD, or exasperated history of schizoaffective disorder.

When I was on LSD for the 1st time, I had a vision, and it was almost like a vision of everything I'm going through now, as if I've seen myself go through this already, and as I live through it, I remember it, and that's the deja vu, I'm scared I'm gonna just, slip, and wake up in the separate reality, or in my 1st trip, because it's either like, there's a whole other reality where I'm insane from LSD (I've seen images of this as well either when I was high or tripping) or the 1st bad trip happened, and i created this whole reality to escape from it, and one day, I'll just, wake up in that trip... IDK

Whenever I think of the enigma, it just makes it feel more, surreal, I guess, idk, I just want this to stop.

Can anyone relate to these symptoms after doing LSD and having a string of seemingly connected bad trips? I just want help with this, I'm gonna try to see a psychiatrist soon",24Jul2018,2,

Recently I got this idea that I'm supposed to be a writer. I was remembering some stuff from a long time ago and I thought I have so much insight about what happened, I could write a book. I got really hyped about it and I stayed up all night writing. I realised how much I actually like doing it and felt relieved that I finally found something I'm not too lazy to do. I used to write as a teenager, but just poetry. I was really happy about my first pages, but is not creative writing so I have to be accurate about a lot of introspective stuff of that time, for the story's purpose, and is not that easy for me to put them in writing. It's been two weeks and all I got are 10 pages because I constantly re-read them and improve them and I was pretty proud of them(first time doing something like this). I wrote everyday in this time, but yesterday I restarted a job I used to have before. For the moment is still the best job for me, but it drains me. I think I just hate the idea of doing something meaningless for me, 8 hours everyday, just waiting for the day to get by so I can get back to my life. Yesterday I was really low when I got home and I didn't write anything. I know I sound spoiled, but that's just how I feel. I couldn't even watch a movie or eat icecream. Today I tried to write, but when I read what I wrote until now it just seemed like a big turd. Two days ago I thought it was good. I still want to write it and I kind of know what I want to change about it, but I can't get myself to do it. And is not just the book.

Immediately, this person saw me, listened, and came up with a plan moving forward to help me pinpoint what makes me happy and things I can do for self care. She also encouraged me to go to her support group for fellow moms with depression and helped get my doctor to start me on an antidepressant regimen.

85,"So a few months ago my dad suddenly became extremely depressed. It was like a switch was flipped, because one day he was fine, and the next he was talking about how people were acting ""weird"". He believes that everyone is dropping hints that they hate him, including all his family members and friends. For example, my grandma said they had some termites in her kitchen, and he thought that was a subtle way of calling him a pest and saying that he needs to be exterminated. He's even pointed out instances where I acted ""weird"". I explained to him that I didn't mean anything by my actions and I think he trusts me for the most part because I've been sitting with him every day and trying to help him. It's even gotten to the point where he'll see words like ""skeleton"" or ""targeted"" at random on people's phones or computers, and think it relates to him. I've tried for hours to convince him that it's mental, and explained to him logically how none of that could be true, but he can't get rid of the anxiety. He asks me if other people are talking about him behind his back and I tell him no, because I legitimately haven't heard anything. All of us just want him to get better. Now the last few days he's been thinking that he's possessed by a demon or something, because for a while he was into yoga and new age ideology, and he thinks he might have summoned something dark on accident. He's convulsing involuntarily and he thinks it's because he's possessed and something is causing him to do it or something. I was gonna go to a friend's house today, but I'm afraid to leave him alone. He wants me and my brother to leave the house anyway, because he's afraid he might hurt us unwillingly. He's afraid to drive himself anywhere, and I'm afraid of letting him drive himself anywhere too. He's been seeing a Christian psychologist, and they recommended he see a priest or something, but he chickened out because exorcisms are pretty horrific. I don't know if I believe in that stuff, and he may just be severely mentally ill, but I feel like he should go see a priest anyway. Unfortunately he's too afraid to, and I don't want to go with him and witness that, because that shit scars you for life. I have to go back to college in a month, and I'm going on a week long vacation with friends in two weeks, but I'm really scared to leave him alone for that long. He's scared to go to a hospital or have medication because he's had bad experiences with meds before (giving him tremors, etc.) and he feels like mental hospitals only make things worse. I don't want to see him deteriorate even further but I feel like he needs meds or something, he just can't be sitting around in our house all day trapped in his own mind. I'm at a complete loss. I also don't know what to tell friends if I do take him to a hospital. Should I just be honest with them? I don't want him to be judged for it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

86,"My mom was diagnosed with conversion disorder a few months ago after she was admitted to the hospital for uncontrolled body movements she called “seizures.” They are really non-epileptic behavioral events, most likely brought on by stress and grief. 

It’s been a struggle. She is retired, but she used to be active. She would walk the dogs almost daily and spent a couple hours at least on various projects around the house. Now she spends most of her time on the couch, sleeping, watching TV, or using her phone.

For a while she has been saying strange things every now and then. I don’t really know how to describe it. She is usually aware that she just said something nonsensical and tries to brush it off. Lately she’s been having these episodes and then feels nauseous immediately after, and does not remember the event.

She is seeing her doctor often, a psychologist who specializes in conversion disorder once a week, and she should be getting in with a psychiatrist early August. All attempts at psychiatric medication so far have just made her worse in some other way. 

I am just wondering if anyone recognizes these symptoms as something more, or if anyone has experience with conversion disorder like this. I need advice. My family is having such a hard time coping.",24Jul2018,2,
87,"Hello redditors, I've come here to seek your help - not regarding me, but my little brother. I'll try to keep it as clear and simple as possible and truly wish that someone could help me.

So, the problem is that I believe he is mentally ill. The reason to this is that he gets angry very easily, and has a few fits every day. He's also been acting very strange for the last year and lies a lot (every day). He never listens to anybody, wether they try to help him or not. He won't even listen to family members in his calmest moments, like me. 

My brother isn't a normal guy for his age too. I believe that weird is good, but not in all cases. I'm extremely scared when he's a round knife, due to a few reasons. One example that happened today is that he came to me with a knife today and showed me where he had cut his finger. I asked him why he cut his finger and he answered with ""idk""... that he is so young too makes the thing worse as well. I'm not scared due to him possibly hurting himself, but also due to the reason that I believe he is able to hurt other people.

That are not the only reasons to why I believe he's mentally ill, but it's also because me and my other sibling have (had) mental issues as well. I've had my depression for two years, and my anxiety a little longer than that. It has gotten better for the last two months though. My sister was also depressed but got treatment for it. It might be a genetic thing.

I've tried talking to my mom earlier about him getting help, and they got an appointment at the psychiatrist too. When they came home my mother told me that the psychiatrist said that he is perfectly fine. I wanted them to go to another psychiatrist and talked to my mom again about it, but she told me no.

88,"I have been on Pristiq for a little over two months, and it has caused my depression and anxiety to increase a lot. I’m finally getting off of it. I’m going to be on the lowest dose for 2 weeks, then stop.

I have really been in a black hole lately. I’m at a point where I can’t really picture it getting better. I have so many things I need to do. I’m technically “self-employed,” but I can barely manage to do a handful of things every day, if that. So, it’s more like “unemployed.”

When I went to see my psychiatrist last week, I knew I wanted off of Pristiq, and I was almost to the point of not wanting to try another medication. I was contemplating trying over the counter stuff, like more vitamins and maybe CBD oil, I don’t know. I also wanted to see what he had to say, since it was my first time seeing him due to my regular psychiatrist having left for maternity leave.

He gave two suggestions. One was trying another antidepressant. That made me very nervous. I can’t deal with another two months or more of this extent of depression. I know that you are just supposed to try different ones, but I’m not sure if I will be willing to try another one in the future (this is the fifth one I’ve tried, and only the second one I’ve been on long enough to get more depressed).

The other suggestion was an anxiety medication, buspirone. He made this suggestion after I mentioned my hesitance over another antidepressant. He said that it is for anxiety, but it could help a bit with depression as well. It is supposedly a lot lower risk than antidepressants. I took that option.

I have the filled prescription, but I’m hesitant to use it now. I’m scared of taking it, I’m scared of not taking it. I keep coming up with vague reasons to postpone it, and I kind of wonder if taking it is the right thing. I have no confidence in my own decisions right now, I feel like nothing I do is right. My head hurts, and I don’t know if it is the lowered dose of Pristiq or the headaches I am prone to having, but either way, I’m nervous about adding another drug to the mix. Despite all of that, the very fact that I have this rambling going on in my head may be a good reason to take an anti-anxiety medication.

Part of me feels like I should just follow the doctor’s advice, that’s why I’m going there. Part of me doubts that advice due to having nothing work in the past and the knowledge that some doctors are drug pushers.

I suppose I’m just looking for a second opinion. I think that my anxiety is combining with my self doubt, and I don’t feel like any decision I make would be the right one. Either way, thanks for reading, and sorry for the rambling.",24Jul2018,3,

90,"I have this problem of knowing what needs to be done to make myself feel better and not doing it. I enjoy bullet journal (r/bulletjournal is a great place) and making mood trackers, which I know helps me visualize my depression as a gradient and not just as one drawn-out bad day. I also used to love doing bikram yoga because it always made me feel so great to release energy that way. And I knew that taking my medications for depression and anxiety, as well as going to therapy, were all things that made me feel better and motivated to be better. 

I keep telling myself that I know the type of lifestyle that helps me feel energized and better because I had it before. I knew the habits I did to be better, but I have no motivation to do them. I want to do them, but I just lay around tired all day. I want to go back to therapy, but I don't want to commit the time of finding a therapist right for me. I want to bullet journal, do yoga, take care of myself, etc etc etc, but [insert excuse].

94,"I’ve been crying so ferociously that I feel as if I’ve been dunked underwater and left for dead. The physical implications of pent up, twisted emotions are undesirable in every aspect of the word, as the previous sentence implies. I thought I’d meet my breaking point, if at all, early in the summer while wading through work schedules and such; I never expected to reach rock bottom with less than three weeks before the move to my new beginning...life as a college freshman. Where is the absurd beauty of anticipatory excitement?? They seem to have evacuated the premises in light of the demolition…the demolition of the almighty brick wall constructed to protect my sanity and possibility of contentment. The ruble will most likely yield jeopardized relationships and unsteady well-being of the self for the time being. My condolences; however, there is an unforeseen light at the end of the tunnel. I’ve begun to build sturdy relationships with my future peers. These next four years require every ounce of focus, and this has the potential to be strengthened by friendships and an alliance with positivity. From where might the source of the efforts required to push forward emerge: insurmountable dedication, focus, and tenacity. 

    Refocusing on a related subject, why is it that I have suspicions regarding my parents’ dedication to my collegiate success? Could it be possible they’re dedicated to the idea of a successful daughter rather than to a living, breathing, feeling individual with a fragile heart and an inability to retain self-confidence? These last couple months it’s felt like all has been considered when college is relevant…pardoning my mental health, which pertains to my physical health in the long run. Where is my embodiment of the ability to feel emotion? Amidst the money and impending soccer season, I am nowhere to be found. I’m too tired to fight anymore. I’m saving everything I have left for creating my own foundation for the life I choose to live. I’ve tried innumerable times to relay how I’ve felt about various circumstances. Words never failed to fail me when I tried to explain anything to my parents, partially because the words were not warranted to leave my mouth, but they’re not failing me now. I feel more at peace. I feel content with my decision to write this. I am choosing to look only forward.

95,". Lately it’s been getting worse and worse. I don’t feel like I care about anything anymore. I’m not sure how to really describe how painful it is. I have extremely severe anxiety, I’m always scared that I have something really wrong with me, and I’m scared that I’m never going to find a job or be able to pay for anything because I’m too depressed to work. I barely have any work experience, I worked in a fast food restaurant for a month and I quit because my anxiety became too overwhelming. So I’ve been out of a job since April. I’ve been trying so hard to find another one, applying every single day. But I get no calls and no emails. The bad days are starting to outweigh the good days. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts, and thinking of ways I could kill myself. Every day it feels like it becomes more and more severe. I recently graduated high school, and school was my main source of stress and anxiety and I thought I’d feel better when I finished but I don’t. I’m always worried about what I’ll do next. I did counseling and medication for years and nothing worked. I’m just back at square one. I’m always bored and nothing is enjoyable anymore. I don’t tell anybody that I have suicidal thoughts, because who the fuck wants to hear about that? I don’t know. I’m a fucking mess. I’m open to any advice at all, I just need help... ",24Jul2018,2,

I've still had issues with depression, and keep getting nervous that I'll never get better. I sometimes have emotional outbursts, and times when I'm really depressed and others when I'm active and motivated.

How can I stay positive? I've tried meditation, keep exercising, eating healthier, taking up hobbies like woodworking and I'm on Buproprion (doesn't seem to be helping). Do you have suggestions to help stay motivated? Thanks.",24Jul2018,2,
98,"Hey, it's hard for me to start this, but I'll try to get to the point as quickly as possible. 

So, a while back I was diagnosed with depression and an underlying personality disorder. I expressed my thoughts and worries about this diagnosis back then, but it was mostly brushed off.
When I would say ""This isn't fitting to how I percieve myself, how I feel or how I act"" I just got something like ""Even though you're diagnosed with this personality disorder, it can work different for you and show itself differently"" as a reply. Obviously I wasn't happy about this, but I learned to accept it, since most of the things that are connected with this personality disorder would fit me. Basically an *I guess* and trying to shrug off my worries. 

Recent events made me look into another personality disorder, though. One that seems to fit me a lot, even though I do some of the things described in it subconsciously. I know that some of the feelings and actions in both of the personality disorders *can* be similar, but it still worries me. Especially when I see myself in so many points that are made. 

I'm obviously reading into it more, thinking that *that's what a personality disorder is, right? It doesn't matter if you do it actively or subconsciously in the end.* 

By now I feel like a bad person, broken up and not sure anymore who I am or how I should feel about myself. I think to myself ""What if that is what I'm actually struggling with?"" and it makes me scared, seeing how many people think bad of it and how it is associated with abusive behaviour. 

I don't want to be a bad person. I don't want to hurt anybody, yet I'm afraid that I do and will. 

And what even is the difference between the obsessive behaviour of a person with BPD that searches for validation in their action and can display narcisistic tendencies, and the obsessive behaviou of a person with NPD? 

Do I just go to my psychiatrist and tell them something along the lines of ""I worry that I might be misdiagnosed and I have NPD, but some of the things I do happen unconscioulsy. I don't want to be a bad person, I want this fixed.""? 
I worry they'll just brush me off and say ""Don't worry, a person with NDP wouldn't even bring this up, you definitely had BPD."" 

How the hell am I supposed to deal with this? ",24Jul2018,2,
99,"Over the last year and a half I’ve had a really hard time making myself take my medication for depression. I think I’ve figured that if I’ve managed through of shitty stuff, that I don’t need it. But over he last few months thing have gotten progressively worse. I’ve had a panic attack, which I hadn’t had in years, I’ve self harmed, also hadn’t happened in a long time. Lately I’ve wanted to self harm. I think about it often and that has never happened before. I have resisted due to promising someone that I wouldn’t and if I wanted to I would tell them. 

Last night I did tell them, via text and instead of feeling better I feel worse. I’ve always said suicide isn’t something I could do to my family, but the thoughts of “well, if I died today, it wouldn’t be bad”. I have NO intention of taking my life, but these thoughts have been heavily present for most of the day.

What is concerning me the most is my apathy. I’m not as upset about these thoughts as a healthy person should be. I’ve said it a lot recently, pretty much to myself, that something is wrong. Something isn’t right. But I’m functioning. I’m doing my job, eating and not physically self harming. I’m starting to get scared. Last night I looked up the Employee Assistance Program that is available to me through my job and got so frustrated that I couldn’t figure out the website that I never called.

I don’t have anyone I can tell without freaking them out. I’ve been such a burden on my family as they don’t understand mental health issues and depression. I can’t justify asking for help when I’m in such a calm state of mind. Am I crazy? If I’m calm about it, it can’t be that bad, right?",24Jul2018,2,
100,"Hey everyone !

My diagnosis requires I keep a regular schedule, especially wrt sleep. I was doing well for over a year, but my partner is on mid shift (3-11) with TH/F being their days off. They frequently work extra shifts so they come home at 3am. I need to be up at 6am and go to bed at 9pm. I need to eat at about 730-8, 1130-1230, 430-5pm. They wake up now at 10am and eat, then again at 2pm, then dinner while at work.

I am really slipping with my health with this. I normally cook 3 meals and snacks. And I work out at home (saves money). But their schedule doesn't match mine. I am losing all my motivation and sense of time. 

What can I do to maintain my mental health and sleep? I HATE sleeping alone and my insomnia is medication resistant. Them coming home always wakes me up and I may not be able to fall asleep again. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? Any tips? I am so lonely now ugh...",24Jul2018,2,

102,"At this point I'm not sure if I'm posting it the right place but if I don't post it somewhere now I'm gonna give up and just never try again. I probably shouldnt post this at all. I think it's important to learn some of my past just so to sum it up quickly. Primary school: Corrupt and the teachers didnt care about the students. To give an example: I basically just sat there drawing for two years without anybody caring. Part of the family stabbed the rest in the back for some land. Psychiatrist (I'm not really sure what the difference between these names are) that I grew attached with abandoned me when I struggled to be able to go to sessions. Unable to leave the house, barely anyone who I considered a friend visited me. Home school teachers gave up on me and didnt try to teach me and they left one by one. This is the important part: a man who worked for the government came and visited me and acted nice. He later called me an idiot and violated my right to education. My therapist/psychiatrist (I might be messing up which of the numerous ones it is) knows that this man basically stated all these things. The therapist stated that he didnt understand how this could have happened and the reasoning. The problem is that the therapist works at the same place where the man who did this to me works. I finally after years now dare to confront the therapist about this lack of trust. He responds by saying he speaks with this man (as in the normal work talk stuff) and chuckles after naming some examples. I still have the sessions with the therapist.
I have no idea if I'm being paranoid and in truth I'm afraid to hear that I might not be but I never can get this thought out of my mind and reading alot of reddit posts hasnt helped. The major problem is that I want to trust the therapist because I find relief in having these sessions however I can never get this idea entirely out of my head. For further context, I havent opened myself up like this for a very long time (not even in sessions) As for how I'm going insane, I have basically become that cartoon villain that thinks up every possible way to take over the world, if you replace the world with testing the trust of the therapist. 
I am rambling at this point so I'll just stop it here. I expect this to probably break a rule or something so if that's the case then I atleast will probably be able to stop me from doing this again. 
Any advice would be welcome and if this broke some rules then atleast I hope the moderator has a nice day. ",24Jul2018,4,
