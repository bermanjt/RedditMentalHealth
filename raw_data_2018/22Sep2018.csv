1,"I've been on 100mg of Stertraline and 120mg of Propranolol for a little over a month now and I just wanted to share my experience so far.

A little background information first. I have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember and I attempted suicide when I was 19 (26 now) which luckily I survived. I tried therapy and it only made me feel worse. Over the years my life has became less complicated and I have a wonderful support system, things in my life are actually going really well but I just have this thing weighing me down. I seem to have stages of feeling down and stages of feeling okay. I've not felt as down as I did when I was 19 but recently I felt like I was getting there so I went to get help from my doctor. 

She recommended antidepressants, I was very against them at first because all I have ever heard about them is bad things. I've always been told by my Mother ""they're bad, they're addictive"", which I said to my doctor. She insisted that they don't have any addictive properties but I still declined. A few months later I still wasn't feeling better so I went back and we discussed things again and I finally agreed to try anti-anxiety medication and if they weren't enough I was to come back for antidepressants.
I definitely seen an improvement on the anti-anxiety meds but I knew I needed the antidepressants.

When I first started taking Stertraline it was awful, I was so dizzy, I was shaking, I felt sick, I felt like I was going to fall all the time but I powered through. After a few days the symptoms lessened and I was starting to get used to them, then something weird happened. In the last few weeks I have felt like someone else. I'm so calm and relaxed. Nothing seems to phase me, I've had a few family issues and I've just taken my time and found ways to sort them. I'm so rational and confident. I feel like I could do anything. Before I felt like crying all the time and I would dwell on things. I wasn't able to get through the day without thinking negatively, without feeling angry and sad, without feeling low and worthless. I feel like this is what normal is, like I've been given focus. 
But in all the excitement of this new person I feel like I've become, I have this thought at the back of my mind and it all started when I went to the doctor's for my medication review. She told me that I might only be on them for 6 months. When she said this I felt worried (for the first time in weeks), then I started to think about what my Mum said. She said antidepressants are addictive but the doctor said they aren't. Maybe both of them are right, maybe the antidepressants aren't addictive but the feeling they give is. 

I'm feeling the best I've ever felt right now and I hope that when I come off these I'm not at rock bottom again. Has anyone had this experience that's since came off of the medication? What's it like, how do you get used to it?

TLDR; depressed all my life, suicide survivor. Skeptical about antidepressants, told by my Mum they are addictive, doctor says they aren't. Go on Stertraline and feel amazing, realise that at some point I will come off the meds and concerned that I will be back to my old self again.",22Sep2018,2
2,"Long story short. I had a crappy, lonely childhood, autism, and OCD. I was seen by a crappy psychiatrist at 13 who dxed me incorrectly with bipolar and put me on risperdal, lithium, and lamictal for five years.

She was...good lord, was she awful. She was condescending, rude, insensitive, and would dance around my questions. Her definition of bipolar was laughingly ridiculous, (she said that my episodes could cycle by the second), she never seriously looked into my OCD, she was completely nonchalant about trying to put me on four different meds, she never discussed the dx with me, and the whole time, I felt like a bacteria under a microscope around her. My mom liked her because my mom's a narcissist, but I felt awful.

In addition, because of the dx, the school tried to keep me in an alternative Ed school, where I was bullied and abused by teachers and kept from extracurriculars and sports. 

Now I'm reading about the long term effects of risperdal on the brain, supersensitivity psychosis, and frankly, I don't know if I'll ever be okay. I'm lonely and struggling in college now, and I don't think things will ever be okay. I'm all anger and resentment and fear. I can't stop thinking about that woman, I can't stop hating her, I can't stop being afraid. Plz help.",22Sep2018,16
3,"I started an antidepressant (SNRI for depression/adhd) a while ago and since then I feel like maybe something is ""off"". I noticed some emotional/mental benefits definitely but can't say it justifies anything more than a low dose. In a nutshell benefits are less moody, 'quicker' thinking in social situations, and less mental anxiety. My issues are probably more on the anxiety side than the depression one and I was always on the fence about medication. If I had/do have minor depression I've dealt with it far longer than I've ever been on meds for. So maybe it's not something antidepressants can resolve? 

All that aside and regarding the title of my post; there has  been this subtle feeling where something seems off but I can't put my finger on it exactly. It's like my emotions/inner thinking is lessened (maybe with minor depression this is more noticeable?). What most people would probably describe as being emotionally numb. I feel like I actually care less about many things which is obviously undesirable. I feel content doing nothing, staring into space wasting time, being unproductive. 

tldr Do antidepressants make you a zombie just content enough to go through the daily grind?",22Sep2018,2
4,"This may be rather long, but I thought I'd describe it here. My grandmother has likely been schizophrenic since she was a child. Somehow, she managed to barely raise 3 kids - my mother and two sons. They had horrible lives growing up. She made awful decisions, got fired/quit from basically every job that she had. She moved them from apartment to apartment claiming that she ""couldn't afford to pay the rent"" and just did all sorts of crazy things. 

For decades, she has heard a man's voice, musical instruments, loud music, singing, sexual talk, etc. She never saved for retirement at all. She was in some nursing program at one point, but quit because she claimed that they said she would probably end up with AIDS working in a hospital. So now she's 83 and gets the minimum ocial security ($750/month) due to low work credits. She has grudged every family member and stranger that has worked for something because she didn't end up with anything. She was on the street at one point when I was a kid (she lives with her daughter and grandson) and was living in her car in a plaza parking lot. She's physically capable of doing things, but sometimes I think she sits there all day and doesn't eat or eats just once. She won't clean herself very often. She hates everyone and just rattles nonsense all day. She rants at the TV thinking that the news people have some sort of conspiracy. Her anxiety is to the point where she'll stand and ring her hair over her index finger while standing 3 feet from the TV or cramming her hand into her mouth to bite her nails. I take our dog out every night at a certain time for the last bathroom time and my grandmother is awful. The dog is scared of her. She'll kick her feet on the floor thinking that she's ""keeping the dog from going to sleep."" It's an older dog, so she kind of grumbles when I asked her to get up to go outside. My grandmother will be running around having a severe anxiety attack and saying spiteful things like, ""Oh well, just don't worry about it! I wouldn't bother with taking her out!"" as if she was the one trying to get the dog to go out. If she can't get her way, she'll become childish and say something like, ""I'm going to bed!"" even though she wouldn't normally go to bed for another hour or more. One time she just grabbed a flashlight and went tearing out the back door walking around in the dark for a few minutes and then came back in and want to barricade the door by putting a chair in front of it. She wants to put a dining chair in front of the back door every single night. Her anxiety is unmatched by anyone I have ever seen. 

Something that just grates on our nerves is she jumps up looking out of the window every 2 minutes all day long. At night, she leaves the curtains open in the living room until it is pitch black and runs over every two minutes looking out at the house next to us with her hands clenched behind her back. I don't know what she's even looking at and she won't say. She'll just say that she ""has a right to look out of the window"" and doesn't reason anything. I think her reasoning is gone. So all day long, she runs from the living room side window to the living room front window looking out. Then she goes to the dining room window and looks out of those curtains and to the kitchen window and looks out of those curtains, then back to the living room again. There is no telling how many hundreds of times she does that every day. She also gets up really early in the morning sometimes to go to the bathroom (say, 4 or 5am) and will open the kitchen blinds, dining room curtains (right across from the bathroom in the hall) and such. Then you get up in the morning, turn the light on and - bam - you're exposed with the curtains or blinds open. It is just so odd.

She does odd things like sit with the bathroom door halfway open and the light off while using the bathroom. Family members have accidentally bashed her with the door years ago because they didn't expect anyone to be in there. She always got offended when they told her to shut the door and turn the light on. Her response was always, ""Well, I wasn't going to be in there but for a minute!"" She'll go to the bathroom, then go sit on the couch for about 2 minutes and get up and go tearing for the bathroom again. She does that all day long and it doesn't seem like just incontinence. She always says that she ""didn't finish"" the first time. Probably because she was so anxious that she literally could not sit down on the toilet for long enough to finish peeing, and that's pretty sad. The kicker is that for things like the bathroom and kitchen, she won't get up UNTIL she hears someone else heading into the bathroom or shutting the bathroom door. The same thing for the kitchen. She gets up only when someone gets into there and wants to get in there bumbling around in the way. She suddenly has to pee her pants when she hears someone go into the bathroom. Otherwise, she'd sit there for sometimes an hour or two watching TV, so I'm kind of reluctant to call it incontinence.

I don't think a nursing home would take her, honestly. A mental health facility, they'd probably taser her to get her to take meds, and I'm not kidding. She's just flying apart at the seams constantly. It is like her brain partially works or something. She'll bring a package to us with a big ""OPEN HERE"" on it and say, ""Do you know how to open this?"" She doesn't know how to open a ziploc bag with lunchmeat in it and will grab a knife and tear a hole in the side of it. She doesn't have any specific tasks here to do. We do everything, but she used to try to wash dishes and for most of her life she literally didn't know how to wash dishes, utensils or cups. They would all be dirty when she got done and have to be washed all over again. 

She has no emotions. It is like she's dead to having any kind of empathy or compassion for other people. Her face has a blank, lost stare most of the time with wild looking eyes. She frequently walks around with her mouth open for no reason. Sometimes she walks with a little bit of a stagger and other times she doesn't, so it is hard to tell if that is dementia-related or just a little clumsiness from old age.

With all of that going on, she's still ""there"" enough to refuse any sort of doctor visit (and she has a conspiracy about each one of them that she has seen throughout her life), any mental health visit, etc. 

Paranoid Schizophrenia combined with dementia? Sometimes I wonder if it isn't some kind of odd psychosis. You'd think she's possessed sometimes, seriously. I seriously wonder if she hasn't had this since she was a kid. She has written what she calls ""books"" - lots of random statements like, "" I remember when we lived over on x street and x happened"" and just jumps from topic to topic like the reader knows her already. It makes very little sense and she stated that she was in a field with other kids and counting for them to play Hide-And-Go-Seek and she mentioned that, ""All at once, it was like she was counting over her head."" Most of her stories are so odd that they do not make sense and likely didn't happen. She's a compulsive liar and will say that the TV and newspaper said something that they didn't actually say. If you call her down on it, she'll become angry and accuse you of something.",22Sep2018,2
5,"Greetings, fellow people from /r/mentalhealth

Before I start I just wanna say that besides the state of my mental health I keep reading this sub everyday and I feel for all of you, I wish you the best regardless of who you are.

Let me start by saying that I have an horrendous and boring job in wich I have to do a lot of work and being busy the most of my shift, I work for minimum wage and I rarely buy things because there's not enough money left due to bills and rent (I live with my gf)

I hate most of my co-workers, I really feel a lot of anger and hate about them, they often bullie me and call my names, maybe because of my looks, my face, I don't really know, but I feel a lot of pain going to work in the morning, knowing that I have to spend 8 hours IN PAIN, with a lot of anxiety, anger, stress and dealing with them, I often fantasize about punching them or quitting, but I need this job.

GF wants to have sex but I'm not in the mood to do it, she pressures me into having sex but I never seem to be relaxed enough in order to have some intimate time with her, I told her several times that I feel pressured but she insists saying that I'm being selfish and that she needs sex in her life.

I spend most of my days with a lot of anxiety, in the edge of panic attacks, I'm not medicated and I'm going to therapy next month, barely can afford it but nevermind.

I'm starting to have a lot of headaches and losing weight (lost 4kg last month) drinking a lot of caffeine and daydreaming about leaving all my stuff here, quit my job and going on a trip without telling anyone, just simply dissappearing and leaving all behind, I barely can stand this.

TLDR: I'm losing weight, being overall angry, anxious, filled with sadness and fantasizing about hurting people I hate and leaving all my responsibilities",22Sep2018,2
6,"Hi everyone,

I’m about to start Uni this coming week and I’ve had this issue for a while, and I just want it too stop. 

I really find it hard to describe, and I think that’s because it happens in so many ways. Whenever I’m alone, or not distracting myself, my brain begins to wander to thoughts I don’t want it too. Problems I’ve had in the past, people I miss, regrets about things I’ve done all come to my mind and it feels so overwhelming, and most of the time it ends with me in tears. It’s honestly getting to the point where I try and avoid being alone at all costs because it’s happening so frequently.

Another way to describe it would be constant worrying. How’re these actions going to affect me now, what if this happens with this person now, that kind of thing and I think that Uni creeping closer has made it worse. I’m always thinking “what if my flat’s dead and I don’t get on with them” or “what if I break up with my girlfriend cause we drift apart”. I don’t know, when I write them down now they seem so normal, but then when I start imagining scenarios of this happening it really starts to get to me and the worrying just escalates even further and I hate it. I try to talk to people about it, but I don’t like the idea of them knowing and worrying about it themselves.

It’s really getting to me, and I don’t know what to do in all honesty. I don’t even know if this is a good place to put this to be honest, but I figured I’d give it a go. If anyone had any advice on how to stop this I’d love to hear it, because I don’t want to go through Uni being a constant worrier and over-thinker.

Thank you

7,"Hey r/mentalhealth. I’m doing a fundraiser walk for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention this Sunday, September 23rd. I could sit here and just post a link and be done with it but that’s rude. Instead I’m going to tell my story in the hopes that it not only gives you all a better understanding of why I’m doing the walk but also hopefully my story will cause others to have the courage to come forth with their stories. 

I would not have started walking with the AFSP if not for my father. My father committed suicide via self-inflicted gunshot on March 19th, 2001 at the age of 21. He, to the best of my knowledge, did not have a history of mental illness. But he believed it was the correct way out of a bad situation. At the time of his death he had two small children, 4 (me) and 1 (my sister), to two different women, whom he could not pay to fully support, despite working several jobs, and because he did not seek further education he had no clear path in life. At the time, I had no concept of mortality, as I’m sure most toddlers don’t. But I had a long battle with mental illness ahead of me. 

I was formally diagnosed with anxiety and depression at 8 years old, though I remember having thoughts of wanting to be dead as early as 6. Around the same time that I was diagnosed, I was also starting to be molested and raped by the children in my neighborhood. I never came forward to anyone back then because I did not know it was wrong, but I was told not to tell anyone about it or they would not be my friends anymore, so seeking validation and acceptance I didn’t tell anyone until very recently. These kids ranged from a year or two older to about five years older. This went on for about three years. It wasn’t until I was about 17 that I realized what had happened to me when, and at that point the statute of limitations had long since passed, and because I am not straight some in society deem that because of that, I cannot be sexually abused by another man because of my sexual orientation. But at the same time that I was being sexually abused, I was also being physically abused by my mother’s ex husband. That lasted until I was about 12, at which point they divorced and we moved out. 

When I was 13, I was involved in a physically abusive relationship with my ex. I won’t pretend like I was a saint the whole two or three months that we were together (one month if you take out all the time we were arguing and temporarily broken up), but occasionally being an idiot doesn’t permit someone laying hands on you or clawing or biting you. 

When I was 14, I was a freshman in high school. I went up to a group of kids I was working on a project with to talk with them about how their research was going. Now, I wasn’t popular in high school, but these kids were. And they convinced a kid to come up behind me, wrap his arms around me and dry hump me. Because of the trauma I had experienced earlier in life, I was triggered into a violent frenzy and ended up whipping the kid onto a desk and punching him repeatedly in the chest. School administrators decided to just make him apologize, despite the fact that I was afraid to come to school because of the event. 

Events like these culminated in me having post traumatic stress disorder, something I live with every day. I have nightmares about the things I have suffered in silenced for over the last fifteen years. 

On June 26th, a few days before my 22nd birthday, I attempted suicide via asphyxiation, and the only thing that pulled my out of the trance was a very, very good friend calling me. I have not attempted suicide since then, which I am proud of, though I still have a long way to go in an effort to better myself. 

I hope that this gives you a better understanding of why I choose to represent an organization like the AFSP. It gives me joy to stand up and say that I survived the lowest point in my life. I can’t say that my life is perfect or even that great, but the love and support of my friends lets me know that I’m going to live to see another day. I hope I inspire some of you to come forward with similar stories, whether it is just anonymously here on Reddit or in your personal lives to your loved ones. I’m not going to put a link in this post as it would feel disingenuous, but if you would like to donate at all in my father’s memory I can provide you with a link. ",22Sep2018,1
8," 

I was having a big depressive episode from my bipolar (triggered by the events below) &amp; was drinking excessively so went into hospital as per my psychiatrist's recommendation for just over a week. 

The hospital experience wasn't that bad because the entire time I was on valium and the staff were all very supportive. Now I'm out... I just don't know where to go from here?

I'm not as depressed as I was when I went in &amp; don't have the desire to drink at all but I have nightmares every night about everything that led up to me becoming that depressed. People have suggested that maybe this is my brain finally processing everything. When I am awake my brain is on autopilot &amp; cannot make any simple decisions eg. eat, make a coffee, get up to pee, read, listen to music etc..I just sit here.

Only about 3 people know where I went &amp; the rest of my friends/other family think I went on a 'holiday' &amp; turned my phone off. This is something I will never share with my larger circle of friends/family as I do not want to be pitied or mildly stigmatised. I have absolutely no desire to reconnect with anyone at this point in time. I have also dropped out of college but only for this semester &amp; have took 3 weeks off work.

Many events lead up to this break down, multiple operations, family problems, failing a subject, falling behind at college &amp; my long term partner cheating on me (which was the breaking point). I had no emotional reactions to any of it, I was completely numb &amp; was drinking excessively to purge those feelings/try to process the torture these events were causing me (I am completely aware that alcohol is never the solution but anyone in that headspace isn't thinking about the science &amp; facts)

Anyway my partner still thinks I'm in hospital and I can't bring myself to speak to them yet because I'm concerned that it is going to fling me back into a spiral however right now all I do is just sit in hiding at my friend's apartment doing nothing &amp; will be leaving the city today to stay with my parents for the next few weeks. 

Sorry for the TMI but **any suggestions!?** ",22Sep2018,2
9,"I'm a junior in high school. I used to have a best friend who I was essentially sisters with, but for one reason or another, we became distant and I now feel lonely most days.
I have bad and sudden anxiety that often causes me to lash out on people when I don't mean to. I think this is why I don't have a lot of friends or know people who show interest in being my friend. 
I have a very supportive boyfriend, but it's different. I miss having platonic relationships and female friends. There's something so pure and nice about sleepovers and long talks and gossip. Boyfriends are so much different and often emotionally exhausting. 
Of the 2-3 friends that I do have at the moment, most are friends of my boyfriend because I often just leech off of him. I feel like this is very unhealthy. So far this school year (and the whole summer / latter half of my sophomore year) I've only hung out with him + his best buddy from elementary school.  I honestly can't remember the last time I went out with someone other than him. 
How do I make friends so far into high school, when everyone is super busy and/or has established friend groups? How do I stop leeching onto my boyfriend to temporarily patch the lack of friendships I do have?

-Feeling numb/a deep sadness all the time 
-My head is blank, no thoughts just numb and grey
-Having trouble remembering anything I did recently, for example I’ll eat a meal and completely forget until someone reminds me and even then I have to think hard to remember 
-Skipping meals/binging after not eating for 24 hours
-Always spaced out 
-hard to concentrate on anything
-All the things I used to enjoy are dull and don’t make me happy anymore
-I have panic attacks
-Low self esteem/feeling horrible about my looks, artwork, writing, grades, etc. 
-Getting exhausted very easily 
-No motivation
-Feeling lightheaded/that nothing is real all day 
-Vision is just black and white swirls sometimes
-Having passive thoughts about suicide, like I wouldn’t care if that car hit me, I wonder what’s it like to free fall from this building etc

Greetings all. 

I have been suffering from schizophrenia for a year now. I struggle with suicidal thoughts and hallucinations daily. I took it to myself to find outlets and gateways towards improving myself. I went and bought a drawing tablet for the computer having never drawn before, let alone on a tablet. 

This is what came out. Not much, but it’s mine. I love video games and chose Cuphead. 

‘The Hand You’re Dealt’

It represents the struggle of daily life to find the silver lining. Even if you’re down on your luck, out of health, and the worst enemy you could imagine is laughing at you in your own head, take a look at the hand you’ve been dealt. It’s an Ace of Diamonds, your last card. The strongest card in every way possible, indestructible and formed under pressure like the human will. 

I hope collectively society can look more deeply into mental health instead of offing us and we can create a more loving and wholesome planet. I love you all. 

Cheers. ",22Sep2018,1
12,"I know I don’t have any legitimate problems, but I’m still not good. Tonight is the worst I’ve been in a while. I haven’t cut for years, and the last time I self harmed in general was months ago. 

The most concerning part is that I wrote a letter. I wrote a letter to my best friend, apologizing to him and wishing him the best. I’ve never written a suicide letter before and not been scared to send it, but this felt different. This time I felt like I was ready. I had half a mind to send it to him. Goddammit I was so ready to write two or three more letters to other people, and then go. It’d be easy. My family has already retired to their rooms for the night, and nobody is going to check on me until the morning. 

Everything is going down the drain. My grades, extracurriculars, social life, motivation, everything. It’d be easy. I’m tired and it hurts and I need it to stop and I’m so so so close to ending it all. 

But I don’t want to die. I’m too scared to. I don’t know what awaits me in the next life, or if there even is one. More than that, I know my friend would never get over it if I did kill myself. He worries a lot. He’d ask God why this happened. He’d blame himself for not being more insistent on me getting help. He’d spend the rest of his life angry at the world or himself, wondering if it was something he said, if there was something he could’ve done different. He’d never forget me, sure, but he’d never get over it either. This would break him, and I can’t do that to him. I cannot drag someone down with me, especially not somebody who’s been through so much already. 

Please help me. I don’t want to die. But everything hurts and I don’t know why I’m so weak but I lied to him earlier today. I don’t really know how much longer I can hold on. I just don’t want to hurt him. ",22Sep2018,3
13,"This isn't a whiny post but something just happened to me (internally) and I think see the scope of my illness. I am most Definitely not faking it. This feeling was too real to deny.

I was laying in bed just now, having just finished recording a game for my YouTube channel...and to help me sleep, I visualized a nice big fire. Don't ask. I also wanted to see what I would feel in my heart of I thought about fire. Well...I felt the undeniable excitement that I feel when the urge to burn is building up. Then k felt sort of a sick dismay when I realized that I felt excitement and pleasure, just from visualization. Yep. My subconscious is telling me something alright. I wasn't ready for the strong pleasure I'd felt, but I am still grateful that happened.

I think the diagnosis is 100% accurate, and in a way that makes me feel sick because if I don't control this now, I can and will eventually cause destruction (not trying to hurt anyone though) and heartache for my family. 

I guess this could be considered a breakthrough? I am tired from recording (it takes a lot out of ya) and I didn't even attempt to edit tonight. That can wait til tomorrow and I will be able to publish the video tomorrow afternoon. 

I am going back to bed now. I took my Clonidine and my anxiety is almost nil. I feel pretty good in fact. Happy for once.

I'm an 18 year old male, and the vast majority of the last 6 years of my life has me been sitting in my room. It's interesting, really. When I was a kid I remember being very hyper and I always had thoughts in my head, mostly about random subjects. I told myself I wanted it to stop. It eventually did for no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had no friends to hang out with, I've gained a tremendous amount of weight and over all the world just felt different from when I was 12 years old, I can put myself in my own perspective from 6 years ago, it feels better that way. It's just a thought though.

I don't feel like I'm personally talking to anyone. Almost like I'm just responding in a sort of muscle memory manner, which causes me to say stuff without thinking about it at all. I don't really think. It feels as if all of my thinking is just my subconscious. I laugh, and I'm happy when I'm laugh, at the same time I feel no emotion. I say rude things to my family a lot of the time thinking nothing of it, which I really want to stop doing.

15,"Hey !

My name is Gabriel, but you can call me Gab. I was in a toxic relationship for about 2 years (whole 2016 and 2017 til november) and it really got to me. REALLY. As a toxic relationship that was, it involved roasting, depression, more depression, huge amounts of dependance and lots of self loathing. It ended around 2017 with her call in the middle of the night telling me that ""that guy"" that i shouldn't have been worried about and her are starting to ""date"". Basically she kissed him that night and she told me that in a mix of guilt and desperation. 

I couldn't feel more depressed that night, although i was in a toxic relationship, it destroyed me. I want to point out something here that will be of much use later: We never had sex. We kissed and fore played a lot but we did never had sex. This information will come back to haunt me in the future. Each day that passed was just terrible. I felt depressed, lonely, unwanted,unloved and all kinds of things. Later on, i got info that she and that guy started dating, rumours were spreading that she was having sex with him. Aaaand that's when things just got even worse. I don't know if it is an specific issue but that just made me feel worse than ever, i started to hate every inch of my physical self (My emotional self is already destroyed). I played videogames and ate a ton of food to cope with anxiety. That was for about a year until a couple of weeks ago. I cried a lot, stayed overnight a lot, downloaded tinder, failed miserably to match with anyone, my mind was just not right. I didn't had a job and my parents were always sad and mad with me. A week ago, i started a job. My first job ever. I am working as a TI Analyst on a big company. ( You boi has the pc skills ) And my whole word turned 360. I started to eat healthier and waking up pretty early in order to get in time to job, stopped crying and sobbing everyday, interacted with people, learn some new things. Before i end with the ""punchline"" or ""outcome"", i want to talk a bit more about my ""ex"". Over the course of the year, in desperation and loneliness, i tried to contact her a bunch of times. She did the same. The few times we actually talked and met in person, we cried, laughed and so. The reason im mentioning this again is because in the last 7 days, ive been having recurring thoughts about her, for no absolute reason. I.e: i wake up, my mind tells me : remember her ?. I eat breakfast , mind: she exists, ya know, take the bus: remember that laugh ?, arrive to work: the way she teased you?, even when working, mind: DONT FORGET TO THINK ABOUT HER, FOR NO ABSOLUTE REASON WHATSOEVER. Dude. i even think she has totally moved on or something at this point. I been thinking about her 24/7 for no reason in a constant basis and im terrified. This plush few hours of sleep was the perfect concoction to get heavily stressed. 

I want to ask a few questions to you guys:

Will the recurrent, obssesive thoughts, stop? At this point im more scared of them not stopping rather than anything.

What to do? Today, right now, i opened up to my mom. (Notice that she is happier these days due to me getting a job.) However, i didnt tell her the whole thing about her. I told her i was feeling heavily stressed due to working for the first time and that i was overthinking everything. She hugged me and suggested me to go to a therapist. I told her: will the obsessive thoughts stop? 
&gt; Yes, in time.

I am currently thinking about her for no absolute reason while writing this. Guys, help. I want to live life, feel work as much as i can ( work is great so far ), even planning on dating once i get over this but currently im scared. Will the thoughts stop? :(

Spanish is my main language in case anyone notices why my grammar is so bad.

16,So yesterday in my college pottery class I was working on some stuff and these two girls next to me started saying that they think kids should always respond to their parents. Directly after saying that she asked me what my name was. I told her my name and immediately felt pissed off because I thought she was talking about me. I assumed she had said something to me and i didn't hear her. So that's why she went on a rant about kids responding to older people. Btw I'm 18 and these ladies were in their 40s. I kept thinking about it the whole class getting more and more pissed off and thought of going up to them and telling them to shut the fuck up or something like that. I thought about it the entire rest of the day and couldn't sleep last night because I couldn't stop thinking about it and got infuriated. I thought about it a lot today but towards the end of the day today I realized they probably weren't even talking about me. They were probably having an unrelated conversation and I for some reason assumed it was about me. The reason I ask if stress is bad for your brain is because I noticed my mind felt a little weird and tingly when I was endlessly thinking of it last night. I've gotten easily pissed off before and have had a lot of anxiety before. But upon reflection of my recent feelings I've never really felt anything thus random or extreme before. I don't really know what the purpose of this post was. I guess I just wanted to say something about it. ,22Sep2018,2
17,"I’ve lost touch with reality I think. The last few months I’ve had these weird thoughts where I wonder if I’m human, and I feel more and more that I’m not. I don’t really understand what that means. I just feel that mentally I’m not human. I don’t really exist. 

There’s this strange dichotomy in my mind where I know I exist and I’m a real person, but I feel like as time passes my mind keeps pushing this idea that I’m not real. And in my day to day thinking it has evolved to where that’s typically how I feel now.  I don’t know if that’s necessarily bad or harmful, I’ve just watched in a detached sort of way as I’ve become less real. At the very least it’s interesting to me. 

I don’t think there’s anything in this world I want more than to simply stop existing. It’s almost all I think about now. I was thinking about everyone that would show up to my funeral recently, and it honestly made me angry that family members would show up. I feel like it’s forcing me to exist and play a part in something that I want no part in. It’s stealing me away from nothingness and one last moment of being reminded who I was. 

I don’t care anymore about what happens in my life. I think as I become less real, nothing has any consequence and thus it can’t bother me. Anyways, I don’t have a real message, I just wanted to express myself ",22Sep2018,2

I love her so much but it just really hurts to see her suffer sometimes and i just want to be able to help more. We've been together for about two years and it's reached a point where my words dont really hold and weight because it sounds like biased nonsense to her as of now. I am clueless and not really sure how to approach it.

 Sometimes i get really frustrated too when she doesnt listen and makes a lot of mean remarks but i get that its just her condition and ive learnt to be more understanding but it still hurts when she says things that really dig into wounds that are healing.

So my question now is how do i support someone who has clinical depression emotionally and be there for her when my words of assurance have sort of lost weight and talking to her only seems to aggrevate it?

22,"Hey, I'm 18 years old and I've never been in love or in a relationship although I desperately want to be. I have recently come to the conclusion that if I can't get into a single relationship that lasts at least half a year, I will kill myself on the day of my 30th birthday with a shitload of cake and Vicodin. I'm not currently suicidal, if anything I'm happy as all can be, but I question whether or not I should think about seeing a doctor at all. My main reason for deciding on this is that I truly desire to be a father and a lover. It is the one thing I have always wanted in my life but I've never had, likely due to a lack of confidence. I would like to point out that I have asked a woman out recently but know that if I get rejected I will not be ruined. I've also never been in a relationship, but I don't look ugly. I also work out enough and care about my physical appearance enough to be called sexy by a few people, but have wasted a tremendous amount of time researching topics that are very useful such as lockpicking and pressure points. BUT I am very bad with words when it comes to asking people out or relationship talk, even though I can fully detail a story about something bland and make it interesting.

Well, before I go into detail I will quickly add that when I was on these nasty meds for five years for illnesses that I had never even been diagnosed with I used to see and hear stuff on them but when I took myself of them two years ago I never had any of that (I never had it before the meds either). So, yeah recently I've been hearing things and seeing things. The most common thing that I see is white fluffy bunnies (it sounds cute and it is but it's scary when you only see half of them before they disappear) and then I have seen a couple or maybe even a few times a big and bulky spider (like those remote control ones but just a real version) running towards me only to then disappear and I get scared. So, I don't know what it is and I've been extremely low for months before and I'm nowhere near as low but it has been for a while again.

30,"Hey guys. I am a 28 year old student from Denmark, and I need some help dealing with some insecurities.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First a little context. When I was younger I didn’t have a lot of confidence. I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and went to a special school. When I left the school and went to the Danish equivalent to high school, I gradually gained more confidence as I did well in subjecs and people seemed to take a liking to me. However, when I went to University I got into a major depression, which I spend some years getting over.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I haven’t really gotten involved with girls in the past. When I was younger I didn’t have the confidence and during depression and afterwards I focused on myself and on getting back into studying. However in the past years, I have started trying to get involved with girls. I actually think I have a lot of things going for me. I get told that I am good-looking and intelligent a lot, and I seem to do well socially in the sense that I can talk with most people and am generally well-liked. As far as I can tell girls also generally seem to take an interest in me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem is that getting involved with a girl awakens a lot of insecurities in me that I have a hard time dealing with. Right now I am in contact with a girl living nearby. We spend some time in the end of the summer but now that vacation has ended she has gotten busier, and it is stressing me out and making me anxious. I think this is partly a good thing as exposing myself to these feelings can help me deal with my insecurities in the long run, but right now the stress is pretty intense and it has starting to result in depressive symptoms. For example, if I write to her on Facebook her and don’t hear from her right away (it takes one to two days), I get really stressed out.  Most importantly, I have a hard time motivating myself to do and focusing on other things such as during my bachelor and engaging socially.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think my main problem is that I don’t have any good way to deal with the anxiety and stress that my insecurities awaken in me. Cognitively, I can rationalize that nothing serious is going on between us yet and that she has a lot of things on her plate, but it still activates my whole anxiety system. If anyone have coping techniques to help me relax and/or stop thinking so much about it and help me engage in other activities, it would be greatly appreciated. Other advice is also very welcome",22Sep2018,3

I had been coping with my mental illness for a long time, to the point where I forgot who I was outside my illness.

32," I've been struggling with this three headed monster on and off for twenty plus years. Sometimes it's just a feeling of uneasiness that eventually subsides when I remove myself from a situation. Other times it can feel like full blown madness. I'm talking the kind of madness where you have no logical explanation of why your thoughts are racing and trailing off into an uncharted and darkened path into an oblivion's death spiral. These thoughts terrorize my mind into an incapacitated state of submission. I've felt like I was dying. I've felt like I was going insane. I've tried to talk myself out of it only to fail 95% of the time. It is dehabilitating. It is distressing. It is defeating.

One of the most difficult things about dealing with anxiety is how people who don't experience full blown anxiety and panic attacks will never, ever understand the torment we go through. There are different kinds, frequencies and intensities of anxiety. Some experience triggers and others have them completely out of left field in a completely safe environment. Some people like to be comforted and others want you to leave them alone. The complexities are baffling. 

I've been treated with therapy, meds and most recently, CBD oil. Talking about it can really help me, but in others talking about it can trigger it. It's a nasty beast that can affect every aspect of one's life as well as people close to them. All we want is to be normal. We want to be able to go to large events without the fear of it triggering an attack or just to enjoy some simple pleasantries of life without fearing an attack. It's truly a difficult thing to deal with.

I've been off of meds like Prozac and Xanax for years. It was a personal choice and I'm feeling better. I'm not saying anyone should ever stop their meds without consulting their doctor because it can truly create an even bigger problem without their guidance if it's something you've been thinking about doing.

At a time when I had no fallback and was having a really nasty episode, I remembered that my wife had some CBD oil she was using for her own physical issues. I was scratching to find something to stop this terrible attack. I put some drops of the CBD oil under my tongue not really expecting much and low and behold if I wasn't completely calm after just a few minutes. I went from freaking out in my bed to feeling like getting up to play a video game. I played for a couple hours then crawled into bed into a restful sleep.

I know research is kind of ramping up for this stuff, but it's a legitimate, safe and natural alternative to medicines that rewire our brains so much that we have to be medically tapered off to avoid extremely uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms to free ourselves of chemicals that, for the most part, just mask our symptoms. I'm not saying that all drugs are bad. I'm not saying that your drug isn't necessary for your condition. Rather, I'm saying that I had an experience with a plant that made me feel better with zero side effects.

Have any of you had similar experiences? ",22Sep2018,9
33,"As of lately I wanna say like the past 6 months or so I think. I have had a long stretch of pretty bad depression worse than I have gotten before but I do try to keep my head clear of the bad realizations and I tend to accept them for what they are as just another step on an obstacle in life. I have gotten really good at staying optimistic and hopeful most of the day. That’s a great thing but the issue comes when the bad things creep in to my mind like right now lol. The phrase when it rains it pours can’t be more truthful in the way I feel when I’m down. I just don’t feel down I feel sunken if that makes sense. Anyways the issue with this isn’t the actual depression it’s something that keeps happening to me while I’m bad that just anger and annoy the living hell out of me. When I get really depressive thoughts there’s this voice in my head like an actual voice of me that I can never seem to lie to in the sense that it’ll say the complete opposite of what I’m thinking and it never fails to be annoying. Whenever I think of something bad like how I might want to do something I’ll regret it’ll say something along the lines of you don’t need to do that to make you feel anything different or it’s not that  serious.  Or if I say I’ll never change or do anything  with my life it’ll say something like everything In life is temporary . This may sound great to anyone reading this like I have a bright life in my head that provides clarity but that can’t be further from the truth for me. When I’m down and have to deal with all my thoughts being rejected by my own conscience it isn’t the best feeling on top of my mood this voice of clarity isn’t something I have had to deal with in the past and I have had multiple episodes in the past. One thing I kind of made a connection with was that since I’m no longer in high school and not in college or job my depression doesn’t seem to have a clear end point for when it should get better since there is not major end or goal to my limbo until  recently so I guess this was a different from my depression took since there wasn’t anything eventful happening in my life for a lonnnnnng time . But hey idk anyone else got a voice like mine at their worst?

Tl;dr at the end. Thanks in advance. Any help is welcome. 



I’m a 20 y/o girl and although I have a few friends they’re all male. 

I grew up with two sisters who became my everything. I didn’t went to kindergarten so they were really my only but best friends. They felt like sisters and they still do. They’re almost my age (21 and 18) but when I was 6 they moved pretty far away 20 hours with a plane). 

I went to school and I became friends with pretty much my whole class. The atmosphere in this school was the most beautiful I‘ve ever experienced (For example: everyone in class went to everyone’s birthday. Best times ever.) 
There was one girl who eventually became my first best friend besides the two sisters and I loved it. 

We did everything together, had a lot of sleepovers and played „Animal Crossing“ together like crazy. 

In the meantime the younger of the two sisters came back with her mother and moved in with my and my mother. I was so happy. I was 10 back then and this time was probably the happiest I’ve ever experienced. 



We moved away (20 minutes with the car so not really far but I couldn’t go to Highschool with my classmates as the town had another highschool. 

Luckily my best friend from primary school moved as well. We got in the same Highschool but sadly not the same class. 

She got popular pretty fast and got a lot of new friends and I got “bullied” in my class. It was probably because I was way to shy (still am). 
But she would still hang out with me then. 


It got better as the older sister of my two childhood friends came back as well and went to school with me. She was in the same class as me so I wasn’t as alone as before. 



Fast forward when I got 13: 
My childhood friends both moved away again (20 hours flight) and the goodbye was heartbreaking. 
At the same time I began to feel really depressed and anxious and skipped school a lot. 
My best friend from primary school who was one of the “cool kids” then didn’t wanted to see me that often anymore because she had so much to do with her new friends who were obviously a lot more fun than me in general. 

As I began to get really miserable she said that I was too sad to hang out with and she doesn’t have fun with me anymore so she ended our friendship pretty much without asking why I am that sad.
That hurt like shit to be honest. 

It got pretty lonely after that. 
I was friends with a boy in Highschool and I think I wouldn’t have survived these years without him. (luckily still am friends with him but we see each other only 1-2 times a year). 

I began to self harm and to drink alcohol and honestly it was just in a really fucked up time. 

When I was 14 I got friends with a girl but she lied about getting raped or that her dad has to go to prison in a month for example and I just couldn’t take that anymore. It was awful. 
(I now know she had serious mental health problems but so had I and after 3 years I just couldn’t live with her lies and her narcissistic self anymore. She called everyday for hours just to speak about herself (most of what were lies anyways) and when I realized how sick I got after 2 hours of speaking with her on the phone I just had to stop it.) 


After Highschool I got friends with a group of people (all male) and I have to say that I’ve never had such heart warming friendships for years. 
We saw each other still frequently but I moved to another country a month ago so there goes that. 

(Anytime they had a girlfriend we saw each other less because “funnily” girls just don’t like me. I never got along with their girlfriends and it’s even a “running joke” that I’m unable to speak with girls.

There still was one exception and although she isn’t together with my friend we still saw each other every 6 months or so because we get along quite good. But she has so many friends she doesn’t have time often and I have to write her in case I want to meet up. I’m just never as important to them as I would like to.) 

To get the end shorter now: I met a girl when I was 17 and she had the same mental problems than me (depression, anxiety and self harm) and we got pretty close. Even though I have many problems she was more insecure than me so I helped her a lot. After two years she got a boyfriend. She took him with her every time we met and after 4 months she hadn’t time to meet with me anymore and that was that. Didn’t hear anything from her for the last 1 1/2 years. I called and texted her but she wasn’t really interested in anything anymore. 


So even though I have some male friends (that i can’t see because I moved abroad, lol) I feel so fucking lonely. I want to, but it seems I can’t get along with girls anymore. 
I know that it’s not just their fault. Really I think it has to do something with me more than with them. 
But I just don’t know what. 

I can’t trust girls that easily and fast but I get there after time. It just seems that although I really want to care about them I just can’t. Not that much than I should... 

I miss being friends with girls. I miss sleep overs. I miss just speaking in general. And to care about a friend like it’s your sister. I can’t get there anymore and to be he honest it’s fucking killing me. 

Any advice is more than welcome. 

Thanks for reading anyways. 
I just had to vent I think. 



Tl;dr: I got a mess when I was 13, lost my best friend and now I have a hard time gaining trust. I don’t think that’s the only issue and I really don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I have many male friends but it seems like I just can’t get along with women anymore.

37,"I'm 18 and for pretty much my whole life (since before I can remember) I've had mental health issues stemming from emotional neglect and made worse by autism spectrum disorder. So I've got persistent depressive disorder, clinical perfectionism, and an attachment disorder.

I also have delusions with the two main ones being that I'm in a scientific study that's basically like the Truman show but science-y and the other one is that a certain group of people are watching on a projector everything I see and hear and are judging me for it.

My therapist thinks they developed because child-me wanted people to be looking out for me in some way or at least giving me attention even if I thought they were all judging me.

Currently the Truman-like delusion is the main one (they kind of take turns as to which is stronger) and I'm not constantly delusional but it comes and goes. But what I've realised is that if I ever got confirmation of that delusion being real I know I would kill myself straight away, no question. Obviously I'd never get real actual confirmation because it's not real (I believe it's real but for the sake of you guys it's not real lol). However, I've come close to things happening which I perceive as confirmation, say when I saw the Truman show for the first time and thought that can't be a coincidence that this exists maybe they've made it to taunt me.

So what I'm asking is this, should I proactively talk to my doctor about Anti-Psychotics? Because that perceived confirmation could come at any point. Honestly I've tried to kill myself like 60ish times (rough estimate, I was in a psychiatric hospital for two years for my other problems). But if this happened, I know that I would do it and succeed this time. By the way, I'm in the UK and do have an adult services team (even if they are pretty shit) so people from the UK might be more helpful but at this point advice from anyone would be beneficial.

38,"I lived overseas for a couple years recently with my partner. We dabbled in drugs a little while over there, but only safe amounts and with people we love and trust, from suppliers we trusted. 99% of my experiences were positive and are probably something I would do again given the chance. I have no regrets basically, except for one time which was due to poor judgement on my part. This happened about maybe a year and a half to two years ago.
We took magic mushrooms, my first time taking them, and stupidly we took them with only one of our friends and not the other two that should have been there to trip-sit and make sure it was a good experience. I was also not in a good state of mind at the time, as I've suffered from depression and anxiety for many years and at this point was unmedicated. I was also suffering very badly from homesickness.
Usually when I'm having a bad day, I can control my impulses for self-destructive behaviour and say no to drugs and alcohol, which I do 99% of the time. I can recognise when doing something would only exacerbate my state so I say no thanks maybe next time. 
This time, the two friends that normally would have said 'nope you're not in a good place you should sit this one out' and reinforced my unease weren't present and I made the stupid decision of 'fuck it why not'
WELL it turns out there was a very good reason why not, as I soon found out. We took way too many, especially me with my low tolerance. Usually I'd take half the amount my partner and friends do but on this occasion was obviously operating from a bad place and again, stupidly thought 'fuck it'.
So we took too much and shit got bad fast. Usually I don't really 'break through' on psychedelics so much as get visuals etc as I like to test my boundaries first and mostly enjoy the headspace and visuals that I get, and haven't yet been ready for a full out of body and leaving this planet kind of experience. This time I was determined to have one, and boy did it deliver. 
At first, everything was okay. I don't remember everything, which I honestly think is a good thing  based on what I do remembrr. I got some cool visuals in the flat around me and felt like I was melting into the couch and into my partner and friend. A painting on our wall looked like the ocean was moving. Cool cool this is great, good decision, I thought.
Then my idiot friend, because the other two weren't there to stop his stupid tendencies (he's a risk taker and is on the path to destroying himself with drugs), put on Hypnotoad from Futurama on the TV and we got 'stuck'. Then the idiot put on this playlist of fucked up videos of all sorts of fucked up things and at this point, the others would have been interjecting to put a stop to it and put some mellow music on or something like that. But they weren't present, so the playlist played on. I don't remember how long it went for, only that I kept saying '[friend's name] what are you doing to us omg this is fucked up turn it off' and laughing, but I remember I was still stuck staring at it and couldn't look away.
The next bit is blurry and possibly in the wrong order, but I remember we were all laughing and hugging and my partner went into the bathroom to pee and came back freaked out because the lights in there were off and there were LED candles on and he thought 'they're coming to get us', not too sure what that was about but I remember it being funny. 
At this point, everything was still mostly good, just those stupid videos being the only bad thing of the night so far.
I remember that I broke through and thought that the universe had always been just me, my partner and my friend, that we were the three ultimate beings that had created everything and that nothing else was real. That it had just been the three of us for eons and eons and the world around us was a creation made by us. I remember thinking 'but that can't be right, why would I have made myself so fat and miserable if I could control the matter of the universe?'
It gets blurry here again, I think there was a lot of 'this is so weird', 'i love you' and heartfelt confessions, which was the norm for our drug escapades. All five of us are an extremely close bunch and especially my partner (now fiancé) and I always tend to have massive D&amp;Ms while under the influence which is great for us as we are soulmates but gross for our friends to watch lol, they say 'we know you guys are completely in love omg come and hang out now'
I dont remember much after that, just that my partner and friend wanted to go outside for a walk and I was 100% against it because 1. we didn't have anyone trip-sitting to make sure we didn't make a public nuisance of ourselves or get into trouble or lost and 2. I was starting to feel really anxious at this point and knew outside was a bad idea when we were all completely and utterly off our heads.
So we stayed inside, which was also a bad course of action but I guess it could have been a whooooole lot worse outside based on what ended up happening.
I went to the bathroom for a wee and sat on the toilet, thinking I was trapped in my own mind and I would never get out, that the flat was me stuck in my own head and I was stuck. I kept panicking and cycling between this isn't real is this real? and I'm stuck and I can't move and weird visuals this whole time like pages turning across my vision so I'd be staring off into space just thinking I was stuck in my head and I'd never get out.
I dont know how long I was in there but it was long enough for my friend to come looking for me to make sure I was okay. I remember him opening the door and apologising when he saw I was sat on the toilet, but I said no it's okay I'll be out in a second. Not sure how long it took me to actually leave the bathroom but eventually I staggered back and plopped down on the couch.
I remember feeling like I was forgetting to breathe, my body kept not taking in breaths and I was scared I would die. My partner and friend were yelling all of a sudden but I only remember bits and pieces, my friend yelling 'you're making it worse than it has to be, you're freaking her out, she's okay ffs she's alright, stop making it worse!' and my partner yelling that he was really worried about me. They started shoving each other and I was worried it would come to blows so I begged them to stop. I was also vaguely worried at this point because it was hours after we first took the mushrooms, about 3am and we were all shouting in a flat in an apartment building and had probably woken every single neighbour up. I'm actually still surprised no one came and banged on our door tbh or said anything the day after.
Suddenly no one was yelling and they were both stood in front of me asking if I was okay, seriously was I actually alright. I remember thinking 'If I don't let them know how serious this not-breathing thing is, I am going to die'.
My partner freaked out and said to my friend 'We need to call an ambulance I think she's actually dying' and my friend trying to reassure him 'She's fine, you don't want to do that, they will send police as well, it's a bad idea, she's not dying she's fine'
Meanwhile, I'm blacking out and my partner had to slap me to wake me up and told me to stay with him. I honestly at this point felt that I was dying. To this day, I remember my chest not inflating and having to force myself to breathe while losing consciousness.
My partner called ambulance, which for us was a big deal as he worked for them at the time. I remember him frantically telling them 'you have to come now I think she's actually dying'
This majorly freaked me out because he is usually so calm under pressure and deals with situations like the one we were in every day at work and it's just another day of work for him. But because it was me, he lost composure and it totally wigged me out. I was convinced I was dying and that if the paramedics didn't arrive asap then that was it, I would stop breathing and die.
I remember us repeating our post code over and over to dispatch, and she kept saying 'yes but what is your address?' meaning she also needed the street number and flat number, but we didn't understand. My partner said to me 'tell her' and held the phone up to me and I remember thinking I was fighting to speak for my life and just repeating our post code over and over very slowly. That particular moment is pretty traumatic for me to remember.
Eventually we hung up or lost the call, I can't remember. But dispatch was suddenly no longer on the phone.
I remember after this that I was feeling really terrible and staring into space for what felt to be hours at a time, stuck in my own head. I thought I had trapped my consciousness in my own mind, that by not being safe with drugs this one time had fucked my mind up and that I had truly and honestly gone actually insane. I thought to myself that I was probably at home now, that I had never snapped out of it and my family had flown me home and admitted me to a psychiatric ward for the rest of my life, and that my consciousness was still trapped in my brain, reliving the night in the apartment over and over and over for eternity. It felt like I'd been stuck there for years and I remember thinking 'what have I done. one time, ONE time taking mushrooms and because I was stupid I'm now stuck here for eternity'. It honestly felt like my mind had fractured, like I'd lost little bits of nueral connections in the web of my mind that I will never get back. I still feel the loss of them today. It's as though something in my brain broke and I cant intuit or connect thoughts the same way, they now become scattered and I get lost in thought a lot instead of finishing my normal thinking process. Like where before there would have been a connection to a conclusion in my mind, there is now static or nothing.
After that, the next thing I remember is falling into bed, being scared and unsure if I would ever wake up, or if I'd open my eyes to find myself still stuck in the nightmare loop.
I'm most likely recounting a lot of this out of order, as I don't clearly remember the whole night and have since tried to repress it.
I find myself flashing back to pivotal moments of the trip and it ramps my anxiety up, I start to shake and have to try to snap myself out of it, remind myself that I'm not back there, I woke up, I'm okay.
I dissociate a lot nowadays as well. I've learned to still function while dissociated because I work full-time and can't afford not to.
For the most part, I find myself not dealing with any of it too well. My psychologist thinks I have PTSD, and I'm in a high state of anxiety 90% of the time.
I guess I both wanted to vent and write it all down to get it off my chest as well as ask if anyone knows any substance abuse specialists etc in Melbourne, Australia that I could reach out to? My psychologist is wonderful and CBT is helping somewhat, as well as medication, but I clearly have some deep-seated issues that I need to work on in a more targeted environment.
At this point in my life, I'm not experimenting with drugs and I won't smoke if I'm feeling down or anxious, so taking mushrooms again as a healing trip is currently off the table. 
I don't regret dabbling in drugs at all, and it's something that I may do again in the future, just not mushrooms. I feel like at this time, it would do more harm than good, at least before I've done all I can to fix it inside my own head.

TL;DR: I experimented with drugs, took too many magic mushrooms and had a really bad trip and now am not dealing with the PTSD it caused. I'm searching for a substance abuse specialist in Australia.",22Sep2018,4

44,"So, over the past four days I have been in such a good mood and have had so much energy. I have been working 8 times as hard at work, and actually got a promotion. I just don’t feel like me. I have had so much motivation and have been beyond talkative and i’m generally a really quiet person. On the fourth day I started to realize all of this. I haven’t slept in 2 nights, and my brain is not stop racing with thoughts. I have been extraordinarily irritable/angry and have been so much more sarcastic than usual. Now that I have come down from this “high” I am so embarrassed of how I’ve been acting, and I feel out of control. I really need advice. ",22Sep2018,8
45,"I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but for me, whenever I feel down, it never seems like it'll end. On the other hand, when I'm having a really good day, all of my self-doubt is gone and I think I'll be motivated and happy for days on end, just to realize that the next day kinda sucks.

I reckon this is a typical characteristic of people with adhd, since **we generally experience emotion in a more intense way**. Most people don't seem to understand this characteristic and often start questioning my reality when I tell them how bad I'm feeling. ""Oh, what? But you just did this and this just yesterday...blabla"". Yea well it just doesn't seem like it..

So, in order for me to keep my motivation level up, by myself, and in the meantime perhaps be able to help some of you help keep yours up too, i created a youtube channel, on which I post life guides, and motivational videos regarding ADHD. 

Over the last month, I found that self-discipline, out of all the concepts of motivation, has helped me get me ADHD under control a lot better, since I'm able to say no to things that aren't good for me in the long-run. Self-discipline basically helped me curb my impulses and I started to really think about what will happen **after** I do something. This in turn helped me become more successful when it came to sports, business and my studies. In my first motivational video, I share my secret to how I managed to do all that.. You see, I used to always tell myself to stop a thousand things at once on monday, which led to me being totally finished on friday, and throwing my progress out the window on the weekend. 

That being said, I just posted by first **motivational video on self-discipline with ADHD**, with special credits to **Will Smith (who btw has ADHD)**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpgj2pZCkAc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpgj2pZCkAc) Perhaps I'll be able to motivate some of you :). 

I would also be really interested in any specific motivational concepts, that work for you with ADHD..since I'm always looking for new motivational concepts that fit to my brain type \^\^.

Thanks guys and have a good weekend!",22Sep2018,1
46,"I (25F) grew up in a home where my parents raised us similar to how they were raised: with not so much affection as pressure to do really well. 

From a young age I remember having a lot of pressure to succeed at what I did. I worked hard. I got good grades, did really well in piano, swimming, running, or whatever extra curricular I was put into. I did pretty well, especially in comparison to my other siblings. My parents always looked at me as the “perfect child.” There was never a problem with this method because I always had as much pressure on myself as they did on me. It worked. 

Until it didn’t. 

I realized when I went away for college that my desire for perfectionism wasn’t translating into my school. I was studying engineering, and I didn’t really seem to be as good at calculus as anyone else around me. I tried picking a branch of engineering and every time I went into a major the advisor would look at me an go, “so tell me what really brings you here.” And that question was one I never had the right answer to. 

I ended up failing and picking a fallback major and my parents have expressed in not-so-many words their disappointment in me. I plan on going to grad school in something (probably Psychology) I’m much more passionate about that I actually picked for myself and I believe I will be more successful with that. This might redeem me in my parents’ eyes and it might not. I feel like they just want the perfect child and I’ve already proven I’m not perfect. 

With that backstory in mind, my question is this:  

How do you deal with the desire for approval from your parents that you will never get? I find myself looking for it in all of my other relationships. Work, managers and coworkers, female friends, romantic partners, pretty much everyone. I just want approval and affection from everyone. Looking back at a lot of relationships I’ve had I now see this pattern. I’m clingy and yet I have a need for reassurance that I’m not “bothering” someone. I work really hard to be a healthy friend, to not say hateful things and still be honest all the time.  I’m positive on my outlook and I don’t get mad unreasonably. But I still deal with this internal and unbalanced need for outside approval in everything I do. 

How do I resolve it?",22Sep2018,3
47,"My 17 year old daughter suffers from anxiety and depression. She has panic attacks. She says she feels like she is disappointing us. She says that she “feels like she made a bad decision at some point which has made things the way they are but cannot pinpoint what the decision is.” She acknowledges that she has a good family, gets good grades, has never been targeted by bullies, and doesn’t do drugs. She is an introvert and is satisfied with the few close friends she has but she usually makes excuses to stay home and when she is home she usually isolates herself in her bedroom. She says she is not suicidal and promised to let me know if that changes. I started taking her to a therapist before last school year and this summer she started taking medications. She started with a low dose of Zoloft, which was later increased. Then Buspar was added and later Wellbutrin. I thought the medications were helping a little, but she has had 2 panic attacks in the last two weeks. One was on September 11th. She worries about school shootings and her safety. The other was 2 nights ago when we were discussing the fact that she was invited to apply for membership in the National Honor Society but “couldn’t handle another thing.” My husband and I have said that unless things drastically improve, we want her college choices limited to local schools, but that still gives her 3 decent options including one in which we would let her live on campus in order to really have a normal college experience. We have a follow up appointment with her primary care doctor to see if her meds could be tweaked. I have an appointment with her therapist to discuss what ways I can react in order to help her when she has a panic attack. I spoke with her school guidance counselor to explain her increasing anxiety especially as it relates to school and the college search process so that she can help on her end. Is there anything else I can do? I am really not a helicopter parent but I see my girl withdrawing and I have to find some way to help her. What do you suggest?

52,"I hope this is the right subreddit to be asking this on, let me know if there's a better place to post something like this. I've also posted to r/advice

Anyways, I'm going to be referring to this problem as ""D"", because I don't really know what it is. D has been my #1 secret, for years, almost as if I'm purposely hiding it from those around me. I don't want people to notice it, yet I always hope someone will say something.  

I have always been aware of D, even at the age of like 13 (I'm 18 now for reference) I knew that something was probably wrong with me but didn't really think anything serious of it. This feeling I have has gotten much stronger now that I am older and even more so after my mother died when I was 16. I have a hard time doing things now, I get angry fast and make impulsive decisions in hope that I'll feel something from it (like buying things I know I can't really afford). Most of the time I just get mad at myself from doing it over and over, while knowing I'll just end up this way each time. I don't have any friends anymore, and I'm not sure if it's because I've become a class A asshat or if it's because I've graduated high school. Might be a mix of both. D has really been nagging at me as of recent, I get in these dark moods and I scare myself. I could never go through with these dark thoughts but it's always on the back burner of my mind. I feel so damn guilty all the time, I expect people to call me out on this shit in my mind.  

Everyone in my family believes D is made up, that it's all just for attention, so I can't get any assistance from them. They are completely oblivious to it. Plus, I'm still on my father's health plan so he might see that I started visiting a doctor. The only people that I might be able to get help from is some of my high school teachers, I grew extremely close to one of them towards my junior and senior year. She has always been there for me and is honestly a huge role model for me. She helped me get my current job and I even walk her dog each week for a few extra bucks. I could probably consider her a friend at this point. I think she is the only one aware of D hanging over me, but I'm too scared to say anything about it. If she does know why hasn't she said anything about it? This fear eats me alive and the cycle repeats every day, I'm just so tired. I really need some advice. 

Sorry if this is jumbled and doesn't make much sense.

53,"I'm usually pretty good at understanding and processing my emotions. I don't always have the healthiest coping mechanisms, but I am always able to identify what I feel and why I feel that way. 

Last night, though, I cannot figure out what happened or why I reacted the way I did.

I met up with some friends to go out. We were going to a club we frequent often. I like this club because it's got a large dance floor, but also a huge back patio area where you can sit and chill, which makes me way less anxious. I split my time about 50/50 in the crowds versus sitting with a couple friends outside. I was drinking, but didn't get too drunk. Never to a point where I felt out of control of myself.

We left and a friend went to get some food from a local place. I guess while he was in there, a group of people started giving him shit. I wasn't with him, so I don't really know what happened, but he came out kind of upset. He was also pretty drunk, which made him more reactive. We walked with him for a bit while he calmed down. Then he fell and hurt his ankle. Then his boyfriend, our DD, drove us all back to my friend's place where I was going to be crashing on the couch. It was all kind of stressful, but in the end, uneventful and nothing overwhelming.

In the car ride, they all talked about the jerks in the food place and I was pretty quiet. I don't know why, but I was in a weird place in my head. I couldn't identify the emotion, and couldn't identify a cause for it. Everyone else was laughing and joking, and I was just sinking into this hole. My friend next to me noticed, and asked if I was okay. I said yes, because I didn't really know what else to say.

We got back to my friend's apartment, and I made the split decision to go home instead of crashing on his couch. It was 3am and home was a 2hr drive, but I just felt really against being around anyone for some reason. I said goodbye and left. Walked to my car, got inside, and immediately started sobbing. I have no idea why. 

My friend texted me and said ""are you okay? You seemed really off when you left.""

I didn't know how to respond, because I wasn't okay, but I had no idea why I wasn't okay. I couldn't identify a single reason why I was breaking down in my car, and it had come on so suddenly. 

She tried to call me after that, and I turned off my phone. I couldn't answer because I had no words to articulate what was going on. Then I drove the 2 hours home, and went to bed.

Now it's the next day. I still feel... something. I still don't know why. I can't make sense of any of it. It's like there's a wall in my brain blocking access to my emotional awareness. ",22Sep2018,3

He is nonjudgmental and does not unnecessarily medicalize me. I feel like we have good communication and I can actually open up about my internal life. He is the first therapist I have cried in front of. 

However we come from the same minority community, which is quite small, and I worry about our paths crossing outside of therapy and that effecting our professional dynamic. 

We are both gay men in the leather scene in our city. This is good because, for once, my social and sexual experiences and desires are normalized and not pathologized. I worry because we have already narrowly missed each other in kink spaces (apparently earlier this week by a mere hour). It seems inevitable this will happen. (He has also said he looks forward to eventually seeing me in drag since that is something else I do.)

Obviously we wouldn't do anything with each other except perhaps say hello, but does this cross professional boundaries when risk reduction would involve either or both of us exiting our minority communities?

Whilst not formally diagnosed with anything, I have struggled with anxiety depression since mid-adolescence. The way I'd describe these past couple days would boil down to constantly feeling on edge and fear of losing control. I have been obsessively worrying whether I am becoming schizophrenic and have been taking tests to try and calm myself down but I still feel incredibly uneasy and can't get my thoughts to slow down.

What do you all think? Do you have any advice (besides seeing a mental health professional, which I already plan on doing as soon as possible)?",22Sep2018,2
64,"Hi. I don’t really know if this is the best place to post, but it’s the only place I really know to go to. 

I’m a CSA survivor, and trying to grapple with what I’ve experienced in the midst of what’s going on in Congress with Doctor Christine Blasey Ford. It’s scaring me shitless, it’s made me feel hopeless, and it’s also made me relive everything I’ve gone through. 

I just need advice, or a friendly ear. I need to know how I might be able to get better. To get over this. Anything.  ",22Sep2018,3
65,"Or at least i think it is. The best way i can describe it is that certain words give exposure to mindsets I've never really had before. For example, a few months ago i was watching a YouTuber talk about anorexia and how the experience lent to very **toxic** mindsets**.** I can't say I've never been a toxic person, but i always make the best effort to be kind and do good for myself and others but for reasons i don't understand hearing the word ""toxic"" left a mark and introduced another voice/mindset which began to do that exact thing. I began to have toxic thoughts of things even though i recognized the positivity those things attributed and now i'm having a battle between two very different mindsets. The positive stuff pulls through and i am a bit better than i was at the start, but i still don't understand it. It happens on other occasions too. The one in recent memory includes the word ""hypochondriac"" and so of recent I've become worried and convinced not just for myself but of others too that they may have a physical or mental illness from minor things. For example, when my Mom comments about not liking her appearance, eating very little and how she ridicules herself for being a certain size, i take that and assume she has anorexia while i assume i have depression when i have bad days. I'm not saying i'm not a hypochondriac (i actually don't know) or that any of the above might not be true, but the triggers come in odd forms if that makes sense. I don't know what to think of this.

69,"I have been feeling good on Sertraline for the last year and have been taking the same generic brand all year. 
I was in a rush in a different pharmacy and they gave me my prescription, but just a different brand. 

Fast forward 3 weeks and I feel horrible again, like I’m back to square one. It’s like the new generic brand didn’t work at all. I even got a crazy rash from either the regular brand withdrawal or the new drug. 

So I stopped the new generic to my regular one 3 weeks ago. And I still feel shit. 

Can it take a while to work again?

I felt so good on it and now I’ve messed it all up and feel so shit again. ",22Sep2018,2

71,"I cry every day, most of the times without reasonable cause. If I'm alone it doesn't bother me, it's somewhat soothing actually. But sometimes I start crying in classes because of something someone says or some post I read or something I start thinking about at random. 

The issue here is, I'm afraid this'll transfer to my workplace. I'm about to start my ""professional life"" soon, and this might impact my job (or, at the very least, the way people view me) in a negative way. 

This is something I can't control, for the most part, once it's going. Does anyone else have this issue, and how do you deal with it?",22Sep2018,14
72,"I feel inadequate. People around me jokingly make fun of me but they don’t see how much it hurts me. I have come to terms with my depression and social anxiety, but that doesn’t help.

When I walk into college feeling tired, worn out, and like giving up, people ask me why I look so depressed, which is followed by some laughs, which I usually brush off with my own fake chuckle.

I feel like any progress I make towards bettering my mental health or my confidence is constantly worn down by the insensitive people around me that don’t understand the power of their words.

I have never really voiced my problems like this before so thanks for reading if you have.",22Sep2018,6

74,"I'm now 18 Years old,from Germany and going to school right now, planning on study psyochologie. The only thing that seems to slow me down right now is chronic panicattack-like illness that seems to destroy everything I've build up for myself.
It is a constant strain of thought that I fear the most that developed from the time I was six.


Eversince I was six years old I started having weird forced habits like touching certian things for x amount of times or making weird noises. The older I got, the less I had these forced habits and the more I had something like a second ""voice"" in my head that was thinking of something entirely else and actually disturbing that I couldn't control. It used to be allright till the age of 17, where I started building myself a liveable life. The more I succeeded (I used to be a socially awkard,hyperactive kid without a school degree) the more fear I had of loosing it and the ""second voice"" kept demanding me to do certiant things like touching stuff walking back to certian places but from time to time more absurd and painfull stuff like doing a certian thing until I did it the way my ""second voice"" told me to what could take minutes to hours or even days or weeks.

 I used to masturbate alot what I can openly say but at this point I don't even want to anymore. But my ""second voice"" forces me to do it until I'd do it the way it wants to wich could take up to hours or even the whole day and threatens me with my worst fears to a point where I could actually say that I raped myself. The thing is, my ""second voice"" says absurd and surreal and nonsensual stuff. An Example is a close on getting a certian desease or existential stuff. Normally you should be able to know its Bullshit but It actually once in 2014 threatend me with a thing I refused and it actually happened. A certian close one got cancer who I exactly thought about (she survived lukily) but everysince then, I'm way to afraid to fight against my ""second voice"". 


When I rape myself I'm under constant panic, telling myself to stop but being to scared to stop. When I actually cant do it anymore I had to do it the next day aswell wich actually kept continueing. I rarely ""rape myself"" anymore but I still have other thing that my ""second voice"" demands that I still do for hours in constant panic. 


I tried getting psychologic help. Stationary and Therapistic help. When I'm at the Therapy I do not have enough time to actually explain what my problem is and there are no good Mental Hospitals in the range of 100 Kilometers as I'm Eightteen years old and to old for the Youghtstations and do not fit in into Stations for adults but I need help real bad.

I lost my job because I was unable to work, under constant panic I accidently destroyed valuable things of me and It's real hard to learn aswell. I'm to afraid to actually leave my house and am usually behind my PC on Afternoons and Weekends. I'm trying my hardest to motivate myself to go to fitness and am starting to develope depression due to failure. I actually experience many social issues right now and am usually under constant panic and pain. My Family is very worried about me and kind of suffers with me and the horrifying thing is, I don't seem to get any help anywhere. I tried telling friends of mine and they ignored it, when stationary I tried telling the nurses and they ignored me, I barely get enough therapy lessons and it will take months to get into a new hospital.

I'm suffering right now and I cant seem to get help anywhere than home.

75,"I was thinking of getting a mental health assessment, but where I live, in order to receive one, you have to get referred via your general practitioner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else gone through an assessment with a specialist? Does anyone know how the procedure actually works? For example, when I was in high school, I went through an assessment to test for ADHD, but it was an hour of answering trivia questions, testing my visual/verbal learning skills, etc.

78,"Today, as I sat in a poorly cleaned Walmart restroom I felt the familiar tinge of dread creep into my mind. The weight of everything sat on my shoulders like lead and I felt tears try to push their way out. I am 20 years old. 8 of those years I have been suicidal. For 8 years not one day has gone by where I didn't think about suicide at least once. I have spent a cumulative of one month in mental institutions and yet I am still unwell. I am tired of this, all of it. I know anything I ever accomplish will never amount to anything to anyone in my life including me. I would kill myself but I can't hurt my family like that. I live for them. I live for others. I live just so I don't have to hurt anyone with my death. I wish so badly to die and never have to wake up to this hell that my mind has created for me. I have blips of happiness but they are so greatly overshadowed by the immense pain I feel. I am sick of doctors, I am sick of diagnosises, I am sick of waiting for medication to kick in. I am sick. I don't remember what real happiness is like. I wish nothing but to be dead. ",22Sep2018,5
79,"I recently found meds that work. The last 3 months have been better than I could have imagined having been increasingly depressed for the last few years. I've been able to male more money, brush my teeth TWICE A DAY instead of being lucky to make it 6 times a week at night, ive taken on project, cleaned my beautiful cat's litter box every day, regained self esteem I could only remember having, gone on more dates more easily than I have since high school 5 years ago, been able to meditate. People have told me I have an ""unshakeable self confidence"" to me. Beautiful women have gravitated to me. I've put energy in to family and friends I'd forgotten that I had. It CAN get better. My substance abuse is naturally down, and that was a big problem. My depressing thoughts are receding more every day. Going on meds has given me room to do things. I'm volunteering. I'm taking on another hobby or 2.
