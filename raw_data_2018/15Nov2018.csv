2,"So I just posted [my first blog](https://medium.com/@samparks_21662/no-mans-land-i-e-my-parents-basement-4f1b48014dac) on Medium. The subject of the post is my personal experience of the now infamous millenial post-graduation struggle to figure out what path to follow in life.  I also go into my subsequent clarity on how I want to proceed in life/ my career. It gets pretty personal so if you'd like a deep dive into what Im experiencing at this moment in time go ahead and check it out. 

I am a huge advocate for Mental Health considering its prevalence as an issue in society today. I am passionate about the subject so I hope to be posting frequently. The goal of my writing is to provide value to readers. I'm young and I'm still learning, but I hope knowledge and personal connection can be found while you read. I'm open to any constructive criticism on my writing you guys might have. Also, if you are interested in the ideas I explored, I would love to discuss them with you guys. Let me know what you think!",15Nov2018,1
3,Thanks for taking your time to read this. For the last year or so I have gotten where in certain instances I seem to feel out of what is going on. This usually occurs in high pressure situations or on really bad days. I thought it was me just zoning out until I realized that I don't remember what goes on during these episodes and I can't seem to snap out of them on demand. What do you think this is and do you have any suggestions? ,15Nov2018,1
4,"I am 16 and have been diagnosed with Asperger's for all my life (as far as I can remember).
However recently I have been getting random phases of intense paranoia about random things going from phase to phase ; some of these things being so intense I believed I needed to kill myself and slept for days on end.(past 1year+ going through many phases)
In-between these phases I seemed to be fine but constant paranoia affects me in my life ; distrust of authorities in school who I believe are against me and in social interaction.
I seem to be fine usually in the day but at night or when im alone im racked with paranoia and fear.
Im wondering if im going insane or perhaps was misdiagnosed with Asperger's as I can't find anything about what im experiencing.",15Nov2018,1
5,"I’ve (23F) been struggling with my mental health since I was a teen, but the past few years have been getting a lot worse. I’ve been diagnosed with ptsd, panic disorder as well as major depression, and about this time last year I had to go on sick leave until March. I live in Canada so winter is starting to set in about this time. 

I had a relapse after going back to work (didn’t have any issues really solved but was worried about money because you know bills and life) so went back despite the fact that I shouldn’t have. I’ve been off work again since mid August and they figure it’ll be quite a while till I go back.

Most days my depression is like a numbness. I don’t necessarily feel sad, just kind of like a zombie. I tend to oversleep and it’s hard for me to find the energy and motivation to do things, but I’m usually still able to get some things done throughout the week and get out of the house every few days to see family or my good friend who lives near by. I’d even caught the writing bug again and had been writing instead of laying around or sleeping in all my spare time the past 2 weeks. 

The last couple days the snow has finally come to stay, and today I seem to have finally felt the affects. It’s almost like I’m in my worst depressed state again; I just want to sleep and stay in bed and hide away from the world, so I haven’t been able to write even though the need and ideas keep coming. I don’t just feel numb any more I feel, well, depressed, like maybe if I just stayed here long enough I wouldn’t have to deal with it anymore.

I’ve heard of SAD before (seasonal depression) but I’m wondering if it’s possible to have that along with an all year around major depression? Like is that what I’m feeling with the change in weather now? I’m not due to see my dr for another few weeks but do you think I should call and talk to her about what I’m feeling before then? It just sounds ridiculous to me that I could be suffering from seasonal depression along with everything else, like how does that even work? Or am I just having a down swing with my depression again and it’ll pass like normal?",15Nov2018,1

So I quit marijuana somewhere between 6-12 months ago, had been a heavy smoker for years prior. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with my inability to deal with all the stupid decisions i made/didn't make in the past. All these dreams I had are just delusions that I don't care about now. Its all caught up to me and I don't know where to go. I have racked up debts, no education, I hate my home and family, My employment terms are not even legal (sham contractor) and these people are tyrannical scum. Just everything makes me suicidal. I can't even go to the supermarket without wondering what all these people do for money. Im blank when it comes to job searching, I have no ambition or care. Im burnt out and I don't care anymore, I've had enough of this stupid game. I've even been dreaming of suicide lately.

I try to get out the house, go down to the river or something, it just comes with me, and then I have to go home. Professional help sessions are sparse. I wish I could go somewhere and resign from life.",15Nov2018,1
7,"I have been struggling with DP/DR and anxiety for quite a while. Things would get confusing for me, as if I have never seen or done things before---say going to the store. I would know that I had been in that place many times before, and that everything looked like it should, but I felt very far away. It was like I was stuck behind foggy glass. This still happens to me quite a bit, but now there's more issues that are somewhat the opposite...   
Now everything seems really monotonous and pointless. Minutes tick by at a snails pace. I'm getting tired of doing the same thing every day. I don't even mean like ""I'm sick of my day job."" Every little, necessary tasks (such as eating, sleeping, etc.) seem to frustrate the heck out of me. Anything close to being a routine puts me on edge, and it feels like that's all there is to life: *Wake up, do things, sleep.* The fact that we have to sleep every night for the rest of our lives seems crazy to me and I don't know why! There's no easy way to explain how I feel other than like an alien transplanted in a human body, every simple task seems so foreign, pointless, and repetitive.   


This last month I experienced something that really traumatized me, since then I have been having trouble sleeping. I don't know if my insomnia is contributing to the way I am feeling, or if it is a symptom of it, but I haven't slept for more than 3 hours at a time for 2 weeks now, even with medication. It's like a switch that won't turn off. My body is tired and my mind can't focus. I feel like I can't stay awake, but I will also just lay with my eyes closed for hours without falling asleep. I just have to stay up and listen to music until I pass out. Like I said, not sure if it is a contributing factor, but definitely effecting the way I function.   


This was more of a vent/rant than anything, but if you have any ideas *please* chime in. I have an appointment with my therapist at the end of the month, but not sure how long I can stay sane like this.   


*TL;DR -* ***Everything*** *feels either like I've never done it before, or I've done it so many times it's become annoying and pointless. I also haven't slept more than 3 hours at a time for two weeks despite OTC and Rx medications.*",15Nov2018,1

But the long and short of it is he is having trouble finding work. And in the mean time our credit cards are over 90% and I cant even keep up the minimum payments. Our car we owe two full payments as of now and I have one and a half from my paycheck this Friday. Our phones are off. If they werent we both could do uber, lyft, postmates and shit. 

All this has me at a breaking point. I have GAD. So this is my first time with pointed reasons behind the anxiety attacks. I also have depression and mostly diagmosed ADHD/ADD they are still defining which side I fall on. 

The suicidal ideation and disassociation have been happening a LOT more often. SO, friendos and family are aware and I have been forcing myself to communicate when these hit and I alao note them in my  planner.

I am utterly drowning in depression but I'm too cowardly to kill myself.

14,"Before you read on, I just want to make it clear that although I am slightly depressed and unhappy with life, I do not want to end my life. I'm just not sure how to move on. I recently just started university and it's at one of the best universities in my area for what I'm currently studying. However, I overestimated my abilities and realized that this program may not be the one for me, based on my midterm marks that I worked hard for. I failed one midterm and had to drop one of my computer science courses because I just couldn't do it anymore; I couldn't wrap my head around concepts and it was disrupting my physical and mental health because I wouldn't sleep just to work on it, to no avail. The courses are extremely difficult for me and my grades are suffering. Besides that, I recently found a boyfriend whom I love dearly. He's doing really well in school, and he makes me very, VERY happy. I am proud of him for doing so well in school too. Although I only met him two months ago, he feels closer to me than any friend I've ever had, and I can't believe he exists in my life. However, I always subconsciously compare myself to him, and realize how much worse I'm doing in school compared to him and think about how my depression is affecting my relationship with him. It makes me consider if he deserves someone better than me, someone who can bring him the happiness that he brings to me. I have distanced myself from him to try to bring up my grades, but essentially I'm distancing myself from that happiness as well. I recently realized that I have no true friends that care about me, all of them are out with new friends or their boyfriends, and don't leave much time for me even when I reach out first. I'm trying hard to find this balance to happiness and success, but I don't know if I'm on the right path. I feel trapped based on my position and feel that everything, good grades, relationships whether it's with my significant other or my friends, and happiness is beyond reach. And I having a loving mother who tells me everything is alright, but I want to give her the life and happiness that she deserves for raising me and treating me so dearly, by doing well in school, and then finding a nice job. I cry myself to sleep thinking about what I should do at this point, because I feel so lost, and so out of place.",15Nov2018,1

I am just looking for stories and people who are willing to share them with me. As a man who has struggled with traces of mental illnesses, I can assure you I am not trying to hurt anyone, just trying to be a positive force within the community. Do not feel like you have to call in or participate, simply do it because you want to, because I know there are some people who this would appeal to. I just want your story to be heard.

Prompt: Tell me a story of a memory that causes you great pain

I am currently working on an Experimental Art Documentary in which I source real people talking about memories that cause people great pain in their lives. I am looking for real people to tell me their memories, then from there I will be taking the audio that I collect and put it to different filming styles. Your stories are the backbone of this piece, and I know at times it can be hard to tell your story to a complete stranger, but your pain is in a safe place with me. I want the stories that you would be comfortable sharing to me, and eventually I will be submitting what I create to film festivals.

I want to cut the memories of many people into the film, so please try to keep it limited to 10 seconds to 2 minutes in time.

I look forward to hearing your story and having you participate in this project!

17,"***TL;DR: i started having depressive symptoms at around age 12, started abusing the fuck out of drugs like cannabis and LSD at age 17, went batshit crazy, was hospitalized twice, was diagnosed bipolar, then went through the worst depression ever after my ex left me, left home for a month and a half cuz I wanted to do drugs and my family wouldn't let me, then came back, started psychiatric treatment with Bupropion, Lamotrigine and Quetiapine and all of the sudden after starting this treatment I feel well and fine. I've started to feel a wellbeing that I hadn't felt in a long time, slowly I've started to rebuild my life, got a job as a graphics designer and am now going after another girl I like and who makes me even happier. I just feel glad to feel alive and glad I didn't kill myself in the process. I live in fear, however, of going back to my depression and suicidal tendencies. I'm also still abusing cannabis and ocasionally consuming alcohol, cocaine and clonazepam, which verified for me that my drug abuse wasn't 100% linked to my mood and emotional status. Still, I'm quite satisfied with just about everything right now. What do you think about this? Is it normal?***

alright, so here's the story. i was a really weird kid growing up, 0 social skills, used the computer all day everyday. had symptoms of anxiety, problems with anger and lack of tolerance to frustration. started developing depressive symptoms around age 12. there were times i felt decent and times where i cried a lot and was emotional and sad very often. it correlated with things happening in my life, of course. around age 14 i started developing extremely nihilistic and moral relativist thoughts which last to this day.

at around age 16 i started smoking pot, drinking, partying, and smoking cigs. shortly after i started psychological treatment with Christian, my old therapist, and it made things a lot easier for me in terms of making me come to terms with myself and reality in general, and improving my mood. i also started dating my ex, very meaningful and intense 2 year long relationship.

things were going well for about 6 months after that, then i started to snap out really quickly. started abusing drugs, mostly cannabis. second half of 2017 (when i turned 18) i barely had any energy for anything not drug related, smoked pot every day, even stole from my parents a few times to buy drugs. i also tried my best throughout this whole period to hide all my drug activity with my mother (who i live with and is very anti drugs includinng alcohol, also really overprotective, controlling and anxious about everything, had a terrible relationship with her). itried a lot of stuff including MDMA, LSD, 25x-NBOMe, psilocybin, DMT, clonazepam, codeine, kratom, cocaine, and probably a few more that i don't remember.

in like october or november of 2017 i started psychiatric treatment with Bupropion and Lamotrigine and stopped going to my therapist, which wasn't helping as much anymore. i remember it helping me a lot and even quitting cannabis for around 20 days after which i relapsed. around the end of the year i started doing LSD very often, since i used to buy that shit really cheap in bulk and sell it at a high price and i had a whole bunch of it, i also had a lot of fucking money. things weren't **that** bad at that point although i was very depressed, or at least not nearly as bad as what's to come.

beginning 2018 i was abusing the fuck out of acid, and becoming more and more unstable, even got caught doing and selling many of these drugs, all situations i got out of somehow. around the end of february i moved cities with my ex to study in a really good university in the capital city of my country. i started out really badly, classes were okay but had no motivation to read the books i had to read or study at home or in the library, socially awkward as fuck, made only 1 friend pretty much. i started having these really scary rage attacks for the dumbest shit where i would scream really loudly, cry my fucking eyes out, grabbed my hair as hard as i could as if i was trying to pull it off of my head, and after all that i used to calm down and started going on and on about how i hated my life and wanted to kill myself cuz i couldn't be happy. these happened mostly while i was on acid. the only thing that would calm down these episodes was smoking weed. i put my ex through fucking hell, i really regret all this shit.

at one point i snapped and realized i couldn't keep going like this, so i had my ex call my mom and tell her about my drug abuse problem. i was then voluntarily hospitalized for 16 days, in which i improved a lot in my mood and swore to never do cannabis again. when i left i started having the rage episodes again, this time in front of my mom and my family. i also relapsed on weed like 2 weeks after i left. i was out of the hospital for around a month before during one of the attacks i tried to kill myself taking every pill i could posibly find in my room. after that i was taken to a clinic, and then back to the hospital i was at before. this time it was a month inside, and it was fucking hell on earth, most boring shit ever. 

when i eventually got out, i started having the rage attacks again, mostly when i was on clonazepam which i was prescribed at that moment and which i abused the fuck out of. my ex broke off our relationship too, as she was no longer comfortable with me and she also had sex with a close friend of mine when i was in the hospital (we were in a sorta open relationship, but it still hurt me a lot when she did that, i still forgave both of them though). i was fucking destroyed and depressed as all hell. at that point i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was taking lithium, olanzapine and quetiapine, which didn't help me much and had god awful side effects. 

this was a terrible period of my life, until something amazing happened. my ex wanted to date me again. we started dating again and stuff was going pretty well, was completely sober at that point. however, i started abusing clonazepam around two weeks after we started dating again. she eventually found out and left me again, which sent me right back to the worst depression i've ever had to face in my life. months that went by so slowly, smoking cigarettes all day alone in my room with nothing i really felt like doing. 

around a month and a half after she left me i was slowly starting to get my shit back together, relapsed on cannabis and smoked nearly every day without anyone knowing, was well at this point. then my mom found out and i left my house for about a month and a half, lived at a friend's house for a few weeks while i got a job and found somewhere more permanent to stay in. kept smoking almost every day. i started living with another friend in his dad's house and started paying him like $150 a month to stay there. at one point, this girl that the friend i lived with was dating talked to me and basically suggested me that i should go back home, after which i thought about it and decided to do so.

after i went back home things started going pretty well, although i still had problems with my mom due to my ongoing drug use. i got psychiatric treatment again with Bupropion and Lamictal as before plus Quetiapine (although i don't really have any definitive diagnosis yet), started going to a new therapist, and have started feeling really good really fast. seriously, i haven't had this feeling of wellbeing in a long long time. it's been around a month since i came back home and got on the meds. i don't talk to my ex or think about her a lot anymore. i seriously feel happy to be alive now and glad i didn't kill myself in this whole process, i'm now dedicating myself to enjoying the free time i have left until i go back to college next year, making music, working as a freelance graphics designer, and going after this girl who i've known for a long while but never talked to often until now. she's also the ex of this friend that my ex slept with during the second hospitalization. she makes me immensely happy, for real. hopefully whenever i decide to reveal that to her, she'll tell me she feels the same. everyone tells me i look happier and way more positive, and that motivates me even more to keep on going like this. i actually like my life now. i'm definitely on the right path.

however, i live in fear that my still ongoing abuse of drugs (only cannabis right now, though i drink, do coke, and take clonazepam every once in a while) or any other factors will eventually make me depressed again. i've also realized that my substance problem isn't as linked to my emotions and mood as i've thought since the beggining, since i'm doing really well right now, but i still smoke weed several times a day. what do you think about this situation, r/mentalhealth? is this normal? how can i increase my chances of not going back to the depression?",15Nov2018,1
18,"I had an acc on reddit before but i’m a doofus who lost the password. So! Hi, here’s my first post! Sorry it’s an absolute bummer!

I’ve had chronic insomnia since I was a baby (as my mum relishes making me feel bad about). I developed anxiety at around 12 and it was bad but it became just a constant background hum mostly over time. I’ve always shown signs of depression too but I have a great support network.

During the day I live in a house with 2 great friends and my boyfriend who is my best friend of 12 years. We also have a wider network of friends we see a lot. All of these friends have experienced mental health problems to a degree and are an amazing support system. Even when my anxiety got worse and my jaw hurt a lot I thought things would be okay. We do take drugs and stuff but not to ridiculous extents and practice harm reduction really scrupulously. I only add this in the interest of transparency. I know it’s not part of the problem. 

But once they’re asleep and I’m awake and it’s been 2 days already, I cannot cope. I have no joy in doing anything anymore. My concentration is awful, I get bored immediately and worst of all I’m left alone with my brain. The sleep deprivation means I hallucinate all the time and while it’s nothing bad or scary (tentacles and stuff), I have a history of derealisation (3 full months) and I’m terrified of it happening again. So that’s targeted anxiety on top of severe GAD. I’m not doing well.

I’ve had something of a mental breakdown recently and am receiving treatment but the doctors don’t know what to do about the sleep thing as nothing’s worked and I have definitely developed an addiction to klonopin.

My dream is a local group of rowdy insomniacs that like to party and whom I can get up to some mischief with but I know that’s… unlikely.

Any suggestions are welcome. The sleepless lonely nights are making my other symptoms worse by the day and I don’t know what to do.",15Nov2018,1
19,"(I'm a High School Male if this helps with understanding the story)

For some perspective, I'm not a pathological/compulsive liar (at least as far as I know, there is one in my family though if it's anything genetic?) and I'm on of the most honest people I know except for simple exaggeration from telling stories, jokes or just the natural evolution of memories in your head as they become exaggerated over time. However, there is one big exception to this.

My friend groups have pretty much always been filled with members of the LGBTQ community, and for a long time everyone thought/expected I was gay (I have a rather flirtatious and flamboyant personality and I'm very carefree when it comes to pretending to be gay or making jokes to such an effect), and this actually made me very insecure because even though my friend group would have accepted me, it just seemed too expected of me.

Eventually, I realized that I had some degree of bisexuality within me, and it bounced back and forth, (still does a little nowadays, but I've found I'm mostly straight but open to sexual relationships with guys). I hid this from my friends and not long after, I had my first sexual experience and it was with another guy, and eventually I wanted to communicate my first time getting blown to my best friend at the time.

 However, I explained it to her as it having been a girl, and that it happened back in my hometown about 500 miles away (which I had been to a few times that year- in fact, my  first sexual experience almost happened back there so it had a bit of truth to it, however the situation was fucked in hindsight. I later told people it was the same girl I almost had relations with and did eventually).

 Concidentally, she had a very distant cousin who lived in the vaguely same area who was very similar to the imaginary girl I described (based off of the guy who I actually did shit with). She concluded that it must've been her cousin and was pretty sure about it. At first I acted like I doubted it but eventually since at the time having any kind of sexy time with everyone was a big deal, when we'd tell the story to people, we started telling people that it was in fact her cousin who blew me. 

Eventually I did come out as not totally straight to my friends and told them about my sexual encounter with the dude (and some people still give me a hard time because of who it was), but I guess no one ever connected the dots and realized how similar both stories were. Now almost a year and a half later, even after I'm no longer even associating with the girl who's "" cousin blew me"", the lie has continued and at this point if I don't think it through I believe it actually happened.

Is this a rather normal thing to occur with lies? I want to say a Nazi propagandist or someone of that sort said ""You have to believe in your own lies yourself for others to believe you"" and I'm at that point with the story. If not, the only reason why it occurs to me that this has happened is because the story is a merging of two actual stories and it's easier to visualize and ""remember"" in my head. Anyways, something to think/talk about.

23,"So to start this off, i've had OCD since I was five, Depression since i was 11, and anxiety for a nice lil garnish along with some hallucinations. It's been pretty shit. I've gone through a lot, almost tried to kill myself more times than i can count. I've caused so many problems for myself and the people i love most because of this stupid fucking brain of mine.

&amp;#x200B;

 I relapsed really badly earlier this year during the second semester of my sophomore year. It was horrible, disgusting, painful, etc. I had also just lost my Granny that march. She was like a mother to me. I wasn't even able to be at her side, my meds and my depression made me so numb i couldn't even cry at her funeral. It's been shit. But over summer I pushed past it again, somehow. I'm not perfect, i know i won't ever be cured. But i'm tasting happiness again. Then today happens and I think im falling apart a little bit right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I was talking with my history teacher about my 504 plan. I have never used it, but i needed to one time last quarter. She completely dismissed me and made my 98 percent on my midterm exam into a 78 percent. That's worth 15% of my grade. I can't help that I had a major panic attack, but i got up and kept fucking going. That was about a week ago though. Today i went up to her and tried to talk about it and she refused. She said that people don't make accommodations like that. She made me feel small. Worst of it all was that she told me if my mental illness stops me from completing assignments on time, that i should heavily reconsider her class and in fact my school as a whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was crushed. Utterly crushed. I go to a vocational school. I'm smart as hell. I work my ass off. How fucking dare she? How dare she say that I don't deserve my education because of my disabling mental illness? How fucking dare. She said it would be best. I'm top of my fucking class. I get amazing grades. I was happy, and now i feel like shit. Maybe im just fragile, but would she tell someone the same thing if it was physical. Would she tell a kid in a wheelchair to rethink taking her class because theirs stairs in the school? I think the fuck not. So why does she think she can do this to me? I need advice or maybe consolation? I'm not even sure right now.

&amp;#x200B;

TlDR: My teacher told me that i should rethink taking her class and going to my school (which i have attended for years) because of my mental illness. All because i had to turn in an assignment late with a 504 plan (which she still ignored)",15Nov2018,1

I think I need actual help. I spent most of today wishing that I could do anything right. How do I go about approaching my parents?

25,"     Hey all, scroll past this wall of text if you dont want the backstory or exit out uf you're not willing to give advice and whatnot. It's gonna be a lot. Not intedned to be a sob story, intended to make things presently easier to interpret. 

     To start, I am 17 years old, and I have been diagnosed with ASD, MDD, GAD, and alexithymia. I have had suicidal tendencies in the past, and have shown repeated patterns of self harm/mutilation. I take medication for the depression and anxiety, and it certainly relieves tension, but not all of it. 

     My mother was diagnosed with stage 3b breast cancer in January, but is rapidly recovering, as she finished radiation in late September. This took a toll on me and my father and brothers in prior months. 

    Shortly after, my ex had left me. I saw her as a savior, as she had saved my life, and showed me temporary sympathy. She had told me her past, and it was similar to mine. I felt a connection. She had abused me and belittled me during my times of struggles, and had encouraged self harm and suicide. She lied about her past to me. I thought it was okay, everything she did to me. I don't know why. I realized months later the magnitude and truth of the situation. I had been lied to about being loved and had been used for a year. I told myself every relationship with anyone would turn out that way. 

     My friend group for four years prior were people who changed me, certainly not for the better. They always made crude jokes, and went out of their way to berate others just to make them feel bad. They had abused me sexually, verbally, and physically. I tolerated it for four years, because I had nobody else to go to. I realized around April this year they had been toxic and harmful to me. I slowly drifted away, but they weren't done with me. They had told people around them I had committed various crimes, and that I was lying about my mother. They told people about my Autism spectrum disorder, alienating me in a sense. This ruined my already poor social standing with others. I told myself everyone was out for me. I had developed voices in my head around that time, as a defense mechanism, in a sense. They convinced me of that. 

     Now to the present troubles. I've always felt closed off from everybody, like I can't truly connect with anybody. I never let myself be vulnerable for fear of getting hurt. I don't quite understand social cues and whatnot, thanks to ASD. I feel inhuman, kind of like a freak. I often feel intense depressive episodes, and have a strong urge to hurt myself during those. I tend to feel the exact opposite, where I feel numb and empty, absolute nothingness. I have a girlfriend whom I love and care for dearly. She is kind, understanding, and honest. She and I are working to overcome my past and current worries due to my past. We are also working on establishing more trust. What scares me, is that I love her, and I know I do. I don't want to be hurt like I was in the past, and sometimes that makes me close off and shut down all emotion, feeling nothing. And it scares me. I love her, I want to love her, and I know I do for both statements. I just feel nothing in the moment, and it terrifies me. How can I overcome my past? Therapy isn't doing much, my ASD specialist and psychologist aren't really helping, and I've gone through a lot of therapists and psychologists. What can I do intrapersonally? I want to overcome my past, so I can better myself for my girlfriend, family, and self. 

     TL;DR- My past is afflicting my mental state and behavior. I want to help myself, but i don't know how. ",15Nov2018,1

28,"I don’t know if this is a right place to post, but I really need to vent. 
After failed two midterm and basically have no relationships, I’m addicted to masturbation. I literally have to jerk off every day to fall asleep, if not, I just feel like something is wrong with me and I feel nervous and upset. It’s been a routine for like two month, I masturbated in the past but it’s getting worse. It has intervened my normal life and sucked up my life energy. I am tired every day and I’m becoming skinnier. 
I’m an international student in Canada and I really hope to get some medical treatment. I don’t know if I have become a sex addict. 
In the daylight, I won’t think about sex or masturbation, only if I’m alone in the home and especially midnight, I’m forced to open open sites and jerk off. I will literally masturbated for hours to feel good no matte how sore my  genital has been. 
I’m more and more sensitive now. Especially when I have setbacks in relationships with others, like people being to me or I meet a really bad person. I will feel upset all day even I know it’s not my fault. I’m afraid to make new friends. I don’t dare to talk to beautiful girls even if I really like someone.
I really want to change all of this.

29,"I posted about this before so sorry if you already saw it. I'm hoping to get a bit more feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this weird? My potential new therapist called and left me a message today. I checked and my voicemail says that I am the owner of the phone (an automated message and I say my name during it). However, he still gave so much information that I'm uncomfortable about my privacy. I've never spoken to him or was formally assigned him before this interaction. He said...

""Hello, I'm (x) and I am a therapist at (y). I'm calling because I was assigned to be (my full name) therapist. Please call me back to schedule a therapy appointment. Again, I am (x), a therapist at (y) and I'm calling (my full name) to schedule a therapy appointment."" 

I do not remember signing a form saying they are permitted to leave voicemails of that nature. I wonder how he'd introduce himself if he got a wrong number/voice mailbox and the person didn't immediately identify they weren't me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also had an incident at another provider where they disclosed my diagnosis over the phone (to me) without making sure I was myself. This was the head of records as well. That may be making me more paranoid than usual about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking I might not schedule an appointment with him and talk to my new psychiatrist (at the same provider) about it next week. I appreciate your feedback.",15Nov2018,1

35,"I am a 22-year-old male and this is my first time making a public post about my mental health issues. I live with near constant anxiety, prevalent depression, and daily thoughts of suicide. I often avoid talking about my issues because for me they are not valid, meaning that I believe I shouldn’t want to kill myself because I live a fairly comfortable life compared to others I have known. Yet, in the same respect I feel as though my past is full of much more trauma than the other people in my sphere.

A little context, at 11 months old I was diagnosed with Stage 5 Clear Cell Sarcoma of the kidney. It’s a soft tissue cancer that often goes misdiagnosed as a Whilm’s tumor and occurs in any stage in less than 20% of infants. Stage 5 itself is incredibly rare and many say that I am lucky to be alive at all. I don’t remember much from the actual treatment, although my previous therapists have concluded that a number of my issues with trust and physical contact stem from spending those formative years in a hospital setting. What I have a clear memory of, however, is the pitiful looks and treatment I got from adults and other children when they would find out about my cancer. Survivors will understand. Additionally, I have been told by my mother on occasion that my cancer was a deciding factor in my parent’s divorce.

I was in third grade when I first began thinking about suicide. It was very rudimentary and I didn’t understand it as that in the moment, but with the news of my grandfather’s passing my first reaction was to—when my mom was at the store—climb to the top of the shed (only about 12 feet off the ground) and leap off in an attempt to make the confusion and hurt go away. It would be years until my next serious thoughts. I was about 13 and in Middle school, being bullied for my cancerous past and severe dyslexia (and the fact that I was the only boy with long hair and skinny jeans, thus a target for unsubstantiated and uncalled-for homophobic slurs) I would regularly cut and burn myself to concretize the emotional pain I was feeling. Physical pain is easier to deal with. One night, however, I branched out and decided to wrap my sheet around my neck and pull till I passed out. A few months after that, one of the foster kids my mom took care of was caught cutting herself and my mom sent her away to a rehab center. I was terrified she would do the same to me if she found out so I just buried the pain in creative ways, starting to do more extreme sports and kickboxing to have a reason for the bruises and cuts on me.

I somehow made it through high school without a serious suicidal episode, despite many depressive episodes and panic attacks.  I guess I can attribute that to my High School Girlfriend, who was probably the first person to look at me and not see an experiment. All good things come to an end though, and after months of emotional abuse (being ditched at the hospital by her, constant belittling, and gaslighting) she ended things with me and left me in the unknown horizon of College without a partner. It was during this, my freshman year of college, that I picked up the suicide trait again. After having a minor surgery and being prescribed opioids I immediately abused them and attempted to OD. It failed and all I discovered was that I could disappear into my room for 16+ hours without raising a single alarm in my house.

The following three years were filled with one-night stands, drinking, reckless stunts, and attempting to channel my suicidal nature into writing. I found comfort in the idea of writing one movie and killing myself by 30. It was my plan. Then one faithful night, I met the woman who I consider still the love of my life. Immediately we hit it off and began dating and I was happy for about six months, until my depression came back in full swing, affecting my relationship along the way. She stood by me though, like the angel she was. She stood by me through my suicidal thoughts, my fears of never making it as a writer, my fears of never living my dream of being a stand-up comic, she stood by me and it was good.

Recently we were faced with a challenge and she moved across the country for school, with that came unbearable strain and she broke, cheating on me after only a month apart (four days before my birthday and just a month after my mother’s second divorce). For reasons I still can’t explain I forgave her and wanted to continue calling her my girlfriend. But she ended things and with that I was back to hating myself and wanting to die. In my immature quest to get over her I found someone I thought I could trust until in a drunken fog I was taken advantage of, sexually assaulted and left confused and angry at myself. I almost hesitate to call it sexual assault for two reasons: 1. Initially I wanted it, changing my mind halfway through but being pressured and forced to continue going; 2. I don’t want to distract or take away from the stories of real victims who lost more than I did. On top of all that, I was finally beginning to have a decent relationship with my mom when she found a new boyfriend (which I was happy about). Once she started seeing him though, I became second priority, then third, then last. Now I haven’t heard from her in over four weeks.

With all of that I realized how pathetic I really was, I was only happy when I had someone else to hold my baggage for me. And that is what really drove me to my most recent attempt. A few nights ago, I wrapped my belt around my neck and tried to suffocate to death in my room. The only thought that kept me from finishing myself off was how guilty and bad she would feel if I died. It wouldn’t be her fault, but I know she, and others, would blame her so I stopped. I still want to die.

I’ve tried everything to be happy on my own. I’m writing every day, I’m going through TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) therapy daily, I’m going out with friends, and I even began living my dream and performing Stand-up on small local stages. I only ever feel happiness in small bursts that flee in minuets, leaving me emptier than when I started. I don’t know what I aimed to accomplish with saying all of this on a public forum like this. I guess it is a cry for help?

What do you all do to feel happy? Am I justified for feeling like I deserve to die? Am I just being dramatic and immature? I don’t know. You tell me.

 

TL/DR: I have been through a lot in my relatively short life, and I feel as though I am destined to die young and by my own hand. What can I do to help avoid these feelings? Am I justified or am I being a dramatic punk? ",15Nov2018,1

37,"Hey guys,

This might not be your typical post here but I need some help with my situation. I've been speaking with my best friend (who is also my ex) who opened up to me about mental health while we were dating (for 8 months until August this year). I've never had to live with mental health issues or work through issues of anyone living with them and I'm not sure what to do.

In August, things with her got out of hand and her depression (I use this lightly as I'm not sure if that's exactly what it is) and she had suicidal and destructive thoughts towards herself. We were not dating at this point and I tried to work through things with her but she kept on affirming that I've never understood what she is going through. And she is right. So I went to her parents and told them the cleaner version of these issues, which were her expressing not desire to kill herself but content with the idea that it might happen, and that I tried my best and have no idea how to help her anymore. 

She excused this when confronted as ""he's just mad about the break-up, don't mind him"".

Flashforward to tonight, I've received a text that I don't even know how to digest that reads: 

""I skipped class all day today. I haven't exercised in months but today it felt like I had run a whole marathon. My whole body hurts. There are physical aches and pains and I feel like crap. And I can't even complain about it because I asked for this. Two days ago I felt numb, like my body didn't even exist. I tried to sleep and it felt like my body and my bed were one. So I got up out of bed, walked around and tried to shake it off, soon realizing that I couldn't even tell the difference between my body and the air. It was both comforting and disturbing at the same time. It was the fact that nothing is happening to me. My life isn't bad, I know that. That's the worst part. There's nothing for me to be upset about. But there's also nothing for me to be excited about. I don't get excited to wake up anymore. I don't look forward to anything. There is nothing good or bad happening in my life so I felt nothing. There was nothing inside of me. And I begged to feel something and this is what I got today. Physically hurting. So I slept in. I laid in bed. I did nothing. I let a whole day pass me by because I was so overwhelmed by all the feelings inside of my body. I've been having nightmare after nightmare and I can't sleep. I'm not sleeping. My mind is always awake and I want to turn it off. I wake up every few hours and my heart is pounding and my chest hurts and I feel so fucking scared but nothing is happening to me!! It got pretty bad again today. Holding a pair of scissors in my hand and fighting the voice in my head that's telling me to push them into my skin harder. So instead I'm tracing the different blood vessels I know could end it all with the tips of my fingers and listening to Cancer by twentyonepilots because the hardest part of this is leaving you.""


Let me follow this first with this. She isn't the type of person to make a senseless cry for help just to pull me back towards her. I have no idea what to do. I want so desperately to be there for her but I don't even know what to say or do. 

Any advice or input at all is appreciated and very asked for. Thank you for taking the time to read this, honestly.

44,"I hope this is the right place to post this. 
I need help. 
I've had non bizarre delusions for a lot of my life. Mostly from middle school on. 
Recently these delusions consist of thinking people are out to get me. 
It's rare, but I may be at work (I work at a kiosk at a mall) and think a shooting is going to happen. When I take a break and leave my soda I may believe someone has poisoned my drink. 
When I was younger, these delusions consisted of thinking specific people wanted to hurt me. A short but specific example is when I went 4 wheeling with some people that were family friends that I didn't really know. I was on the back with someone else driving and I thought they were driving rough specifically to throw me off and hurt me. 
They're not just about physical harm though. I could be sure a girlfriend is cheating on me, or a more odd one is I was sure a girlfriend at the time had driven past my house while I was outside. That was it. But there would have been no reason to believe that other than that a similar car drove by and there would be no reason she would be near my house or not tell me. 
These delusions range in what catagory I'd put them in. Could be running through the halls in my apartment because I think a ghost is chasing me to someone wanting to kill me to anything else. 
I always logically know these things are most likely untrue, and have to stop myself from continuing these thoughts. 
Overall, it's infrequent enough, and I function pretty normally to anyone uninformed of what's happening to me. 
I'll also note depression and anxiety are normal parts of my life but I attibute those to my current life circumstances.

I have to ask though, what can I do to help the delusions? How worried should I be?

The some of the time, I am fully aware of my mental state and it's like I'm locked inside my own head and I can't control what goes on outside. I know I'm depressed or pissy or overly emotional and it's like nothing I do can stop the outburst or even curb them, it's like I'm not the one controlling myself.



I think I've been so aware this time shearly due to the fact that so much horrible stuff has happened. Within this last year I've lost 8 or so close family members including my own unborn baby.... that one was the hardest for me. I'm already a mother to an adorable little girl and she will be 4 soon, but I love children and I've always wanted more than one. Hell I had baby fever within 6 months of my daughter being born, but I wanted my kids to be more spaces out than my sibling and I were. I got pregnant again back in May right before my birthday, I was so ecstatic and ready... but then I started having serious issues, I couldn't eat and I was blacking out and falling a lot. I knew something wasn't right and I tried to get in to my doctor as soon as possible, but literally 3 days before my appointment I lost the baby, and just to make things worse it was my boyfriend/father of the baby's birthday when I lost it. 



Not even a week later he had to leave for job training, and in that first month after the fact I felt like I had no one. He wasn't with me, I didn't feel like I could talk to anyone because I'm just the kind of person that doesn't like causing other people pain even if I'm in pain. So I internalized it all, I don't talk about it much and I haven't really let on about the turmoil inside me except to my boyfriend once I actually had the chance. I've done what I've always done best, I put on a mask for the world. Everyone around me keeps telling me how surprised they are at how well I've done with this and all I keep telling them is, ""You just don't see how bad a shape I'm in right now, I can't even explain what's going on in my head."" 



The other family members that passed away, I wasn't close with all of them but they were big people in my family and life, well most were. One of them though, I was very close to even after all the problems we've had with each other in recent years. My pawpaw, my mom's dad, died on my brother's birthday in February. When my parents split, he was the one that taught me the things my dad couldn't because at that time I wasn't aloud to see him. He's the reason I like working on cars, why I like to debate, why I was always such a history nerd, why I know how to work the land, and do things most women never get taught how to do. He's the reason I can be an independent woman. I've seen dead people before, and not just spirits, but actual bodies. I hated it, it brought on existential crisis type scenarios and I never ever wanted to have to see someone I was close to like that. Then I had to and I can't get the images out of my head.



This has been the worst year of my life so far, mentally, physically, and emotionally. Just trying to type this right now, it's all I can do to keep quiet enough not to wake my boyfriend asleep next to me. I don't even know how he can deal with me anymore, I would completely understand if he just said enough was enough and kicked me out... but no instead he's been here however he can be, holding me and telling me it will all be ok and we will get through this. Even with the recent emergence of health problems that could leave me scarred for life, he's just right there holding me. I feel horrible for all he's had to go through and deal with because of me, I don't understand how he can stand to be around me at this point. I can be so mean and moody with him, but he just takes it in stride. Don't get me wrong, he calls me out when I need to get a hold of myself and we fight just like anyone else. But at the end of the day he still falls asleep holding me and saying he loves me. 



I know, with someone like him by my side, what right do I have to sit here and cry all the time or complain or really have anything negative. I can't help it though, even though I know things could be so much worse, I feel like I have no direction and no light to see the way out of the dark. I know it won't stay this way, eventually thing will get better like always, but right now it's hard to see things that way.



Okay, I think that's all for now, maybe later I can explain more about my mental health and why it affects me like it does. But it's late/early and I have to try and sleep again. Please don't feel obligated to comment, I just needed to talk for a minute to maybe help clear my head some. Goodnight/Morning.",15Nov2018,1
48,"  I am really need of some advice. I am not sure if my experience is normal or if I should seek help and where to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was sitting at my desk this morning and I felt the all too familiar feeling a descending into darkness. My stomach tightened with anxiety and my thoughts begin to be filled with the all too familiar self-talk. I am a piece of crap, I am rubbish, I am a failure at life, a failure at being human, pathetic, I wish I didn’t exist etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I am used to this. I feel it several times a week, if not most days. I really don’t like myself nor see the point of my existence. Sometimes I think It would be good to kill myself but could never go through with it. It would hurt my family too much. I would however like to have never existed. I have had Melancholy feelings for the last 16 years or so and remember them starting in my final year of high school.  

&amp;#x200B;

My life is a bit of a paradox. I should be happy. My chronic health problem has been under control for the past five years and I run my own design business which is going well. My family are great and I can even enjoy a laugh every now and then

&amp;#x200B;

But I am not happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no friends my age, am so lonely, no girl friend or prospects on the horizon. I desire friends but the mere thought or invite to a social event makes me so anxious. I know I don’t have anything to offer in a social setting to prospective friends or girlfriend. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere particularly around people my own age. Remember I am hopeless and a failure. I have learnt to put on the front needed to not be ‘that guy’ at work or church or another event. I can say all the things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most people probably don’t even realise I feel this way. I am becoming more and more a recluse. I can’t be bothered doing much other than work. I used to love to surf but in the last 6 months the enjoyment has gone from that. It has become a real effort to even be bothered. I really don’t get excited and enjoy much at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Is normal for a guy in his mid-30s to feel like this?

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to ramble now but would appreciate some guidance as to what to do.",15Nov2018,1
49,"I know this is such a long shot but... Jeez I've looked at what few options I could find online and essentially hypnotherapy specialising in food phobia is ridiculously expensive. So... A little backstory. 

I am a 24 year old woman, and I stopped eating most if not all things when I was 30 months old. I refused food and although my parents cared... They had their own physical and mental disabilities and my food issue was put in the background. 

Fast forward to me as an adult now. I love food. I love flavours, I do love textures funnily enough... and I love to cook for friends and family. Yet most things I have literally never tries or haven't touched since I was a toddler and therefore can't remember. Pretty much all veg, never tried. All fruit, never tried. The ones I have tried? My body rejects it. 

I know it's hard to grasp for some people because I get given a funny look, but even if I'm not feeling nervous about eating something new, even if I casually pop it in my mouth, my body heaves. My throat closes. My stomach heaves and heaves and pushes gas out. Refusing to let me swallow. And if I do, my body will reject it and I'll immediately throw up. 

This is NOT anorexia or bulimia. I do not have body dysmorphia. 

A therapist told me before that my fear is linked to a very primitive, subconscious part of my brain that has tied food to a very real danger that should be avoided at all costs. 

Now I may not have body dysmorphia, but I do also have a degenerative nerve disorder. Which is affecting my muscles and causing them to waste. 

Naturally, I should be eating very well and exercising to compensate. But I can't. 

I've tried. So hard. Wasted so much money on new food. My body never adjusts. 

To which I bring myself to my last ditched attempt... Is there anyone in the mental health field... Anyone that would feel qualified to try and untangle my unconscious brain? I can't work due to the disability but I feel like if I could just maintain a healthy diet I could be well enough to. It's a vicious circle. :(

50,"2 months ago I had an accident in which I dislocated my shoulder and sprained my foot. I couldn't do a thing and was in bed for 3 weeks. Because I was alone with my worst enemy (my mind) I was constantly overthinking and I started getting more and more depressed. Half a week later I tried to kill myself and failed

During that period a good of me friend helped me deal with my depression and suicide attempt. We talked day in day out for the remaining time I was at home and at the end we were much closer and kept talking to each other as much as possible.

A week or two later we became a couple and we were so happy together and for the first time in a long while I was happy without worries.

Last Tuesday he broke up with me and didn't  give any reason so I was constantly blaming myself. In the next days I tried to get things working again only to end up blocked and pushed out of his life.

This Monday a friend of ours told me he had another boyfriend and I confronted him about this only for him to play the victim, telling me he's already over me and that I need to leave him alone.

The next few days my mind and body starts suffering more, my depression is back and worse, I feel suicidal again and nearly tried again. I asked him 1 more time if he wanted to help me like he did before, only to be met with more anger, more hurt and no help.

Situation now:
-I can hardly eat/drink and sleep, I lost 3kg/6.6lbs in just a week and a half.
-Lack of energy, sleep and me being misserable make my job impossible
-I can't stop myself from bursting out in tears whenever I think of him (constantly) even at work
-My depression is getting worse everyday

My greatest fear is her suicidal nature, she has tried to commit suicide so many times i cant even count, if things are not going her way it ways so much on her that she trys it. i always have to pick her up, be there for her so she is sane and try to nurse her to health all the time. Now she has to go home, no job, no serious rship for marriage, and not a lot of money.

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study at the University of Chester, UK, on daily functioning and psychological wellbeing in cancer patients

Receiving a cancer diagnosis and all that comes after this can often be a distressing, worrying and confusing time. Our aim is to investigate how cancer has affected your daily functioning and emotional wellbeing. We are particularly interested in how this then affects decisions you make about your treatment. Our goal is to help others that might find themselves in your position in the future. To do this, we need your help.

Anyone who is over 16 years of age and been diagnosed with any type of cancer can take part. If you decide to take part, you will be asked to complete an online questionnaire that will take around 30 minutes to complete. You will be also asked whether you would like to participate in a phone or Skype interview at a later date, but you don’t have to agree to this to take part in the questionnaire study. While we hope that taking part will be a positive experience for you, we also understand that answering questions about your illness may be upsetting. You can always stop the questionnaire at any time. All your answers and data will be anonymous.

57,"Two years ago I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. Since then, I’ve graduated college, landed my first full-time job, moved into an apartment with my boyfriend and generally gotten my life back together. 

My anxiety is still pretty bad, but I’m much better at managing it now, and I’m no longer actively suicidal. 

However, sometimes I find myself missing the psych ward. I often think I left too early. Even though it was a pretty traumatic experience overall, I miss how it simultaneously provided me with enough structure so as not to feel lost AND with enough freedom to express my emotions as intensely and openly as I wanted, no matter how they manifested themselves. 

I don’t have that now. Outside of the hospital, it’s hard for me to feel normal — because if I AM happy/sane, I know how easily I could lose it again, and if I’m not happy/sane, then I feel like I have to pretend/hide it because I’m in the “real” world now, and I feel obligated to function.

61,"I’m reposting my post here since users recommended to me this subreddit ! 


Hi , so this is my first time posting on Reddit.
English is not my first language ,I’m an 19 year old girl from morocco ( a country in Africa stuck between Civilization and poverty ) 
And i wanted to share my story with someone bc I’m too ashamed to tell my parents about this !
As you can see I know that the ideas that sometimes passes into my brain are WRONG ! Since I’m ashamed to tell this to anybody ! Right ? But why I’m i always thinking about killing someone ? 
 Not someone in particular ..but anyone! I want to commit different murders and find fun ways to hide the bodies! .......so
My childhood way very normal my dad is an engineer and my mother is an university teacher, I’m their first child and i have a young sister ! 
 I assume people would think that I had a rough childhood , but no I was spoiled to the core I had everything I wanted yet I still did some questionable things ! For example I would break my dolls for no reason , hit my friends etc ...one of my friends ,when we were 8 had to go to the hospital bc of me ! 
When I was 12 I discovered the world of creepy pastas ! I passed all my free time off school reading them and even writing my own ones ! 
I didn’t want to go out ! I started to stay at home all week ! My parents started to worry about me so they took me to a psy ! He told them that I’m okey and their was nothing to worry abt !
But things only got worst when I got older for example at 14 my 10 year old sister got into my nerves ( I don’t even remember why ) so i punched her multiple times on the face and left her bleeding from the nose! 
My parents were so choked , and yes I felt remorse , i never did it again ! My mom was devastated and I took us forever to be normal again ! 
I don’t want to make this long.....
 but In general my attitude only got worst by the years I started watching movies, videos , gore stuff , learning about serial killers and famous murders ! 
And started wondering why those killers are dumb, how could they get caught I CAN DO BETTER 
And it just got stuck into my head ! 
I want to kill someone and hide the body! 
I spent nights planning different murders and different techniques! 
Now it’s a daily thing for me ....I would be with another stranger somewhere and suddenly have the urge to stab them idk how to explain this feelings! 
The closest I’ve been to killing someone was on an elevator, I was there going to the 12 floor with another girl ( my neighbor) she was approximately my age but we didn’t know each other well since I never leaved my house! 
She was wearing a red scarf and all my body was screaming to me to strangle her to death then drag her to my house! (I didn’t , I looked into the mirror and just taught about how much my parents would be heart broken if they found out ) 
Now I’m here to tell you guys what I’m going trough.....always battling with myself to not commit a crime ! I’m afraid to break! 
This is getting too long and I don’t know what should I say or not!

62,"     When I started this blog I wanted to help others to understand what it is like to live with mental illness. Although it is still fairly new, I'm committing to posting more often than I have been.
     I'm not going to lie, things have been rough lately. Work is rough, my personal life is rough. I'm adjusting to new medication changes. Sometimes it can all seem very overwhelming. Sometimes I just want to scream or give up. The two different people inside of me are constantly at odds and unfortunately, the negative one has a tendency to win.
     The time has come for me to have a renewed commitment to my life. I need to start taking better care of myself. I need to work out. I need to keep my hygiene at top-notch (a lot of people don't know this but when you are mentally ill and struggling this is one of the first things to go. I need to do more around the house and stop living like a slob. The time has come.
     I am married and I have an amazing husband but realistically how long can I expect him to put up with all of this. It is wearing on him and on us. I wish I knew the secret. I wish I knew the one thing that I could do to make all of this better. Unfortunately, it is going to be a lifelong struggle. My family was brought into everything last night, and I could not be more sad about that. Doing something that I thought was a positive and productive thing lashed back and became a major negative. To the person that I am speaking to, I am very sorry.
     Needless to say, I have a renewed commitment to share my story. It is my goal and my hope that it will not only be cathartic to me but that it will also help to serve others. I want those of us who don't understand what they, their family member or their significant other is going through. I want to help open a dialogue and finally end the stigma surrounding mental health. Too many people are afraid to get help because of what people may think of them, or because they are just too fearful. Let my life be a beacon of encouragement to find whatever it takes to battle your demons. Don't be afraid to go see a doctor. Don't be afraid to enter therapy; in my opinion, everyone should be in therapy. An outside unbiased perspective is invaluable at any point in life.
     I've said it before, but be kind to each other. You never know what someone is dealing with.

63,"Was originally inspired by a post in the lounge, which I would have never even seen if I did not receive a generous gold award on a post earlier in the night. Was going to post this in there, but did not want to hijack the post and didn't feel it was quite appropriate for that section.

Out of no where, the timing of this post mentioned above.... weird how things happen sometimes. Hit close to home, really hit me in the feels. 

Almost exactly 1 year since the day the most amazing woman ever entered my life. And it has really been weighing on my mind this past week. Meeting her in itself involved some crazy timing, as it was a year ago around that point where I was living in my parents basement after coming out of a 12 year relationship sometime before that and had planned to end my life once I ran out of money. I only had about 50 bucks left, no income and over 30k in high interest debt. I won't go into details about my life before that, you can probably guess it wasn't exactly cheery.

&amp;#x200B;

But lets go back a bit before that, originally came across her online in a video game. We got to talking and it wasn't long before we were talking to each other constantly through out the day, every day. Until one day she made a comment about flying over here to see me. She wants to see me?? What? Caught me off guard. Then later that night things took a real bad turn at home, as things tend to when you live with the people who did countless horrible things to you in the past. Fast forward to morning and she comes online and we get to talking. And I'm just feeling like an absolute idiot, because in that down state I started to think she wasn't actually serious about seeing me and I only made myself look like a fool with her. I told her this and apologized, told her things are going pretty bad. She told me she was kind of serious about it as well as being rather fond of me and she wanted to know why I was feeling bad, and I just let it all out. Told her my situation and some things I've never once told a single other soul which honestly I don't think I ever will again.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I really couldn't believe what just happened.... she had offered to let me come live with her to get me out of my situation. Now, she lives on the other side of the country, and well it just seems like a crazy idea to begin with. So I said I'd think about it, but really my only other option was... But now thanks to her I had an out and a reason to live, literally 2-3 days before I had planned to end it. It was at this point we 'officially' started our relationship. Fast forward almost a month she flew over here and we rented a vehicle together and drove eastward a bit over 3500km, much of it through horrible winter roads. All on her dime. I think we left on friday night and arrived on sunday or monday? Can't remember, it took significantly longer to drive due to some very bad weather. With only one stop to rest at a hotel.

&amp;#x200B;

I really thought I could start to move forward with my life and I had so much hope for the future. Never before in my life had I been this happy. But it wasn't long until I ruined things, I had trouble finding a job and couldn't control my emotions. In some ways I felt abandoned there, she was the only person I knew in this far away city and this contributed to my behaviour I guess. I was so scared of being abandoned, not that that's an excuse or anything. Earlier this year she ended the relationship, for good reason. She didn't deserve this. I tried hard to still move forward with my life there, which is what she wanted for me. I even had a job that I truly enjoyed doing which is something I've never had before. We remained good friends but it was just too hard for me to live there with the person I still loved. Plus I wanted to give her her life back, as she didn't have freedom since we had agreed not to bring other people over, so I quit the job and flew back. After one day of being here I ended up in the ER at the hospital because I just couldn't go on anymore. It was her that urged me to get the help I need. We remained in contact for awhile but eventually she didn't want to talk to me anymore for various reasons some of which I completely understand, others not as much. But I respected her wishes.

&amp;#x200B;

Still haven't been able to forgive myself and I'm right back to where I was before, stuck in this house with my abusers, broke and unemployed. Every day I can't help but hate myself for destroying that relationship and putting that emotional and financial strain on such an amazing person.  Every day I feel the void in my life that she had filled. I'd give anything to be able to go back 1 year and do things over. I'd give anything even just to be friends with her again and be able to talk to her again. Trying to forgive myself but I just cant, I really wish I could 'let go and grow' but I don't know how.  I don't generally open up to people and keep my life private, probably not very healthy. But was nice to sorta get this off my chest.

64,"I'll try to keep this short. I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 amongst other things. On Tuesday I went to the psychiatrist for the first time in months after having been off my meds for lack of insurance. I started on .5mg klonopin and moving back up on my lamictal. I felt a little better yesterday during the day. The last two weeks or so have been pretty bad, I was in bed a lot and going up and down through too depressed to get out of bed and then trying to spend time with my best friend. I have newly became friends with my best friend, we'll call her B. She is caring, understanding, goes out of her way to make me comfortable, etc. She's great. But I think my freaking out might be pushing her away even though it isn't. I emailed my doctor yesterday and he told me to go up to 1 mg klonopin and night and .5mg during the day. Last night, after about 4 days of crippling anxiety and staying in my bed I tried to go to my best friends house and help her with her new dog who has been causing her stress. My boyfriend was supposed to bring me home but wasn't answering so B wanted to bring me to my parents instead of my car, she asked to talk to my mom on the phone and she was crying and upset. She dropped me off at first and I was mid-meltdown (I didn't yell at her or say anything nasty/mean to her, I would never as she's too sweet). After I got inside my parents house and was bawling my eyes out my mom ended up calling her back and she came back over. She laid with me and I fell asleep until my boyfriend came and she went home. I'm really worried that I'm ruining things with her by not being able to be stable even though I went to my appointment 2 days ago, started the meds again, etc. Hanging out with her is something that makes me really feel better and I know it does for her too because I'm not always like this. We understand each others anxiety and kind of do our own thing. I'm scared that because of last night/me being so up and down the last week or two that she won't want to be my friend or come around anymore. I have many friends but none like her that I feel like I can trust and actually open up to about my mental illness. I just really want a hug and to know thing are going to be alright. I think my meds aren't right yet but I don't want to lose a best friend in the meantime because my anxiety is too crippling and my depression sucks me up.

72,"Is it possible for someone to have experienced trauma or something bad that they don’t remember that could effect them later in life?

Some back story:

When I was young I had really bad separation anxiety disorder (untreated because my parents are ignorant) and whenever my parents would leave me I’d start full on crying. 

Lasted till I was (embarrassingly) 12. I feared I’d be kidnapped, killed, or they would die in a car accident, fire, murder etc. Really irrational stuff. 

When I was young they would take me with them. After a while they refused and forced me to stay home even though I begged them (literally) not to leave. 

After a while it completely flipped and I hated being around my parents. I wanted them gone. Every chance I got I’d go out and be away from them. 

When I turned 14 I was already starting really and depression and social anxiety. I started self harming and developed an eating disorder at 15.

I get panic attacks triggered by really weird and random things, like someone confronting me about my disorder(s)

I have a few close friends that basically know and hug me to help me calm down. Which works. 
But I found that I don’t like being touched by anyone but them. But it’s mainly adults. ESPECIALLY my parents. When someone touches me, hugs me, gets to close to me, puts there hand on my shoulder, I feel like crying and screaming as well as punching them because I feel angry. I basically feel a mix of every negative emotion possible. As well as fear. 

They are generally good parents, I don’t understand what could have brought this on.

Many speculate that people can develop a stutter in their speech due to fear or a feeling of insecurity.

Stuttering is repetitive preliminary sounds of words and in many situations observed with the aid of an excellent style of speech hesitation. examine has shown that in many situations it happens using fact of a listening to impairment that reasons the guy who stutters to no longer good hear their own voice whilst they communicate.

I've come to the realization that there's something wrong with me... My wife of 10+ years just discovered that I haven't been taking very good of our animals or house while she has been away (we have separate houses), I have been feeding them and giving them attention, but I've only been doing the bare minimum to keep them alive. She says that I've been lying to her and I guess I must have, I never thought of it as lying but I certainly haven't been putting in enough effort with anything in our lives...

She wanted to see the house today and I was petrified, I knew it wasn't good, I left while she was in the bathroom and I didn't know what I was even doing, she called me and demanded I take her there so I did and she saw the mess that the house was... I know I shouldnt have left and I know I made it worse by doing it, but I just couldn't face the truth that our relationship would be over if she saw it...

The problem is that I let it get that far and I don't feel bad about the house being a disaster, I'm more concerned with my wife than anything...

She has severe depression and anxiety herself and has not been able to help with anything for a while and I just don't know what to do...

84,"Hey guys. So I've been having some serious problems with depression and anxiety for the past 6 years. I'm going to try and cram as much info in this, hoping that someone can relate to what's been going on if anything. I dont even know how i feel anymore, cant describe it very well. Feels like hopelessness I guess. I've been searching for some kind of help for a long time. Been to therapists, both of them told me they don't feel like they're getting anywhere and I need to look somewhere else.

Had a rough childhood. I was born under domestic abuse and lived by it for about 12 years, i wasn't abused too much, it was more verbal though. My mom did everything she could for me. I struggled in school a lot. Bullied in elementary. The usual. According to my mom, the teachers always said I showed signs of depression. Never said much, kind of a loner. I was about 13 when my dad got a restraining order. Moved into a safehouse, after that, mom got a government loan for abuse victims to get us on our feet. Got a new house. Things were steady, still rough though. Wasn't long until that was done for and we didn't have enough income to to keep the house we lived in. Had no choice but to abandon my two brothers and all the friends I had and move to New Mexico. I was about 14 at the time. It was a big transition. Like starting your life all over again. Started school over there, doing okay. Making a few friends. Slowly Got out of my shell. I eventually did. I had great friends, lots of fun, i was happy and I was very productive. I was still pretty anxious but I guess I learned how to cope with it after all that time. Did teenager things, would cause some trouble here there, break a law or two (who didn't) but I'm over all that now.

But things started to take a turn for the worst. I can't remember how this all happened or when exactly. But I started to sink. Big time. I was pessimistic. Negative thoughts in my head constantly. Severe panic attacks as well. Started to feel depression pull me straight to the bottom. My mom was very worried. We went to all kinds of doctors. Eventually I was put on zoloft and abilify. It helped out for a bit. But as time went on and on, i started to hate how it made me feel. I don't feel like myself anymore. Almost like a zombie. Made a big mistake by going off the meds cold turkey. I just stopped all of a sudden, didn't want them. Thought I'd do okay. There I am, going to the park everyday to meet up with my few friends. Enjoying life, at least trying to. Then it happens again. I isolated myself for about 5 months. Go to school, get home, video games, eat, sleep. Repeat. I just turned 15. Maybe it was 16? Can't remember anymore... felt my problems only get worse and sooner or later, there I am back on the same meds. Felt like a mask, as if it erased certain feelings so i wouldnt think about deprssion or anxiety. I eventually developed some kind of stomach problem. Throwing up often, bad aches. Back to a doctor and I'm diagnosed with GERD. It really sucks. Something to do with my eppogladus, causing stomach acid to reach the throat. Couldn't breathe well because of it. I don't even know if it's the exact problem at this point because I still have that to this day. Feels like it's only getting worse. Fast forward. I was in my freshman year when I got diagnosed with high functioning autism. Mom found her answer as to why I was so antisocial, and hard to talk to sometimes. Nothing changed though. Mom went back to college, got a bachelor's degree. Was happy for her. We always had a plan to move back with my brothers. We eventually did. So here I am again, Somewhere in New York, abandoning everything I know for the second time In my life. The dear friends I had left, and my dog. I loved my dog so much. Just had to mention her.

I am currently 19, living in the middle of nowhere and my problems are still affecting me. And it's much worse. I don't want to go out because I lost a bunch of motivation, and i dont feel comfortable outside either. I'll only get anxious. 
I'm Incredibily weak. Can't get out of bed, not eating right, and im often thinking about death. Not suicide but just death, like loved ones dying, trying to kill me, or me just dying. I get nightmares on occasions, or just very strange dreams. Can't remember it well but I know for a fact its the same kind of dreams all over again. I'm a nervous wreck and I'm not even comfortable with my brothers yet. I hate being alone, it makes me feel so strange. I don't talk to anyone anymore, most people just kinda disappeared. I feel 100% alone in this world and idk what to do. I feel so weak. Can't really vent anymore because idk how, I can't put the right words together. I sleep a lot, or just stay in bed a good portion of the day. Can't get a job anymore, because I'm not mentally stable for it I guess. I feel like I wouldn't be able to handle much. I feel overall weakness and hopelessness. I don't know how to accept help anymore. I refuse to see another doctor because they're always gonna tell you the same shit. Therapists gave up on me. I don't know where to go anymore. I have panic attacks just about every day now. I'm also off the meds again, since we gotta wait for another doctor to refill a script again. been over a month now. I'm drained. I've just about given up. Can't seem to fit anything else, head is starting to hurt and I don't want to stress it.

If there's anyone out there that wants to help a guy out, if there's anyone that can relate to this, i could really use your help. Advice, anything. I don't want to live like this anymore. I just want to live a normal and happy life. I can't do this by myself anymore and Idk where else to go. So I guess thats why I went over here. Please, someone just help me out. I just can't be happy anymore no matter how hard I try.",15Nov2018,1

87,"As I near 40 years of age, I'm just growing more and more irritable and having trouble meeting the needs of others. If left to my own devices, or given the opportunity to plan things as I see fit, I'm generally a pretty happy guy...but lately, I find any request that isn't in line with my zone of comfort to be aggravating.

For example, for most of my life, my entire family has lived within 5 minutes each other. No real commute necessary, just quality family time, and a short trip home. Last year, my brother upped and moved out to Connecticut from New York because of monetary issues with finding a home in our area and because his wife wanted a big house. As a person who hates driving, I've now come to dread invites to his house knowing it's an 1.5-2 hours on the road each way. No one in my family is happy about it, but I think I feel more of a resentment about it (which I'm not happy about). It's just not for me...and we're basically alternating holidays, and with kids birthdays, I'm making this trip once a month, with no end in sight.

...and most recently, a couple months back, I had agreed to go to a Giants game on this Sunday with my bro and a couple of others. I'm a fan so I said yes, turns out they're horrible, but fine, I'll still go catch a game since it's been a while. Now I'm hearing we're leaving at 7:45 AM to catch a party bus heading out there so we can pre-game. I mean, now in my head it's become about waking up a the crack of dawn on a Sunday to watch a hopeless team - and I don't want to do this as I basically never wake up that early, so the whole thing is irritating me. I can't bail because my brother is counting on me to go, but any notion of fun has been drained from it by this early hour thing. I'm hoping someone comes along wanting the ticket and bails me out, which I feel guilty about, but my alarm not ringing at 7 AM on a Sunday will make that guilt go away for sure.

I used to think I was an easy going guy, but I'm not sure how to get out of my own head on stuff like this. I understand irritating things happen in life, but I'm noticing a pattern here. Basically, I'm finding I would just like to be left alone most of the time and not have anyone dictate how and when I do things, and I don't know how to take anything outside of that in stride. For reasons like this, I'm SO much happier outside of a relationship than I am in one, so clearly it has a major impact on my life as I'm choosing to stay single. 

I rationalize it by basically never asking anyone to do anything potentially inconsiderate to accommodate me, so when I feel like I'm being slighted by others in that sort of way, it kind of gets me worked up. I'm not angry or raging out or anything, and really am a generally affable guy - but it all just makes me want to crawl into my quiet apartment and be left alone, and I'm not exactly sure how to cope or how unhealthy this whole thing is.

Ughm, for my last life around the age from 6-8 i was a "" Prodigy "" child with a mind of an avg adult, which made life harder for me back then because i could not enjoy my life with other kids who made fun of each other and acted very childish which is perfectly normal for kids of that age to behave like that, but for me it built anger, rage, sadness, and after a while early stages of depression which i did not really feel but i noticed some changes in my behaviour which made me feel useless about myself and i really did not care for people as much as i did before... few grades passed and i got to the point of being bored and all i achived was not really important to me but then i met my friend who died (i will get to that in a bit and that is the key to my current state), I met him completly randomly while i was trying to find a quiet place to sit at on the pause / launch break in school, long story short we became really close friends and basically the definition of Best Friends, He completly changed my life from that moment and i noticed that i changed his life as well and we both were having a good time in life while hanging out and only thinking about the stuff that we both suggested and it was really like magic that he knew what stuff i was thinking about and what were my life goals and dreams and he always knew how to actually make me laugh in life and i remember those moments like it was yesterday. The moment my life ended and i basically stopped completly caring about myself and about everything was the day that my friend died in my arms and me not being able to save him while he was begging me to help him, that scenario and the experience i had that moment was something extreme which really screwed up my life and probably every other person, i admit i was at my lowest at that moment which totally messed me up and just pulled me down to the deep points of depression. The point is the moment i couldn't feel his heart beat and see him breath was the most painful moment of my life which totally ripped me apart in two peices and pulled out the thing that was making me somewhat human and put me back together next day.. Ofcourse for a person of the age of 9 its most likely they will faint or pass out from screaming too much, and ofcourse my body being weak i did indeed pass out and woke up next day knowing my parents did not even want to visit me and see how i was doing, they came in a few days later and blaming me for all of that stuff happening, the moment that they told me that i started hating them out of the sudden and basically be a living visible ghost which everyone mocked, yelled, blamed at. All of that stuff kept pushing me deeper down and forcing me to create fake personas to adapt to humans who did not actually care for who i really was and them only caring for joy and happiness and positivity, basically i had to adapt to people who only knew and felt positivity which made me hate humanity even more knowing they are fine and i am not blah blah blaaa... Ugh soo i spent next few years finishing school while studying other stuff in the meantime as a hobby, some stuff i was learning was body language, human body anatomy, quantum mechanics &amp; physics, stuff that made me forget my current state of mind, after that i moved onto gaming, streaming, making music as a hobby as well and me finding a Sport which was handball, i basically tried to fill out my schedule just to not let my self think about my past which haunts me everytime before going to sleep and mostly as nightmares about that day.. But yeah... ugh i think i might have borderline personality disorder... also i am sorry for this much text lol.",15Nov2018,1
102,"Some quick backstory:
Started 25mg Zoloft for anxiety in April, upped to 50 in July, 75 in September, 100 in October. Insomnia, severe exhaustion, high scores on both anxiety and depression questionnaires at every appointment. Started bi-weekly therapy in September as well.

Dr and I decided Zoloft didn't seem to be right, so she prescribed 10mg Buspar and had me do 7 days at half my dose of Zoloft and then stop taking it. Now, I've tried a decent amount of meds before, including other SSRIs, with little to no withdrawal symptoms, so I had no idea what to expect. Now I'm wondering if that taper was too fast and I'm just screwed until it's out of my system, or could it be a combo of withdrawal and new med symptoms?

The timeline is: Oct 25th, start half dose (50) Zoloft, start 10mg Buspar. Nov 1st, just Buspar. Nov 3rd, highly elevated mood, unusual excitement and energy. Nov 4th, huge mood crash, logged ""anxious, angry, overwhelmed, exhausted, alone, guilty, disconnected, resentful"" in my mood app and haven't felt much better since. Brain zaps that take over my whole body, all day nausea and vertigo, intense misophonia, sensitivity to light. My depression has gotten much more intense, especially with intrusive thoughts and I'm so, so angry.

What. The. Fuck. What is going on?! I'm a parent to 2 little boys, and this is in no way sustainable. I have a therapy appt on Friday and am trying to gather the mental energy to call my dr and get a sooner appt for med check (next one is in 2 wks). I just needed to write this all out, I think, maybe for confirmation that there has to he a correlation with at least one of the meds. I feel incapable of driving some days with how intense the dizziness gets. It's super overwhelming.

I always dress the same, I never change my hair style, and I don't talk about anything that's happening in my life. 

I do this to the point of it being detrimental. I pass up opportunities and avoid achieving my goals just so my family wont see me differently.

My parents and brother are generally supportive. I'm not afraid of them laughing or criticizing me. I just feel like I'm such a private person in front of my family that I'm unwilling to do anything that will reveal my thoughts or dreams. 

Some other examples of this behavior:

* In high school I won an award. I received it at a ceremony that took place during class. My teacher forgot to mark me as present on the attendance so I got an automated call home after school about being absent. I let my parents think that I skipped class because I didn't want for them to know about the award.
* I try hard to not seem like I'm growing older. This has made my parents think I'm immature.
* I've always wanted to start a YouTube channel. I have an idea and the equipment to pull it off. I'd love to express myself creatively and share it with the world. But I am deathly afraid of my parents finding it and watching me share my thoughts/feelings.

Turns out my sister has schizophrenia. The paranoid subtype, almost textbook-like. We ruled out causes like trauma, head injury and genetics. The only possible solution that crossed my mind was prenatal trauma. I won't go into much detail but my father basically cheated on my mum when she was pregnant with my sis (even though he told her he'd stop). My mom is a sensitive person and also submissive so she kept almost all her anger bottled up inside and it really hurt her. And yes, my dad was telling her about the women he dated. It took years til they got divorced.

PLEASE do not criticize my mother for not dumping him. She is an angel alive and she doesn't deserve a single bad word spoken about her. I mean it. Don't. She keeps me alive.

My question is: is prenatal emotional trauma enough to cause schizophrenia in someone?

124,"Hi, so I'm a 20 year old female and I've had severe mental health issues that impact on my daily life since I was 10 years old.

I had a difficult childhood that undoubtedly traumatised me- my dad is a narcissist who emotionally abused all of my family and at times was physically violent also towards my mother. I got into an abusive relationship when I was 13 years old with another narcissist who was two years older than me, who isolated me from my friends and sexually assaulted me over the course of 2 years. I reported him to the police last year but didn't have enough evidence to get him charged with any of the crimes he committed against me, which added up to 3 separate charges. I am still traumatised by this ordeal. I was also sexually assaulted by one of my dad's friends at my 15th birthday party, and although I have no memory of my dad ever sexually assaulting me, he spoke about me in a sexualised way which deeply disturbed me. The worst my father has ever done to me physically, that I can remember was put me in a headlock (while threatening me).

My mental health issues started when I was 10 years old, I had severe OCD, and I'd have to make sure that I touched things etc a certain amount of times or I thought that something specifically bad would happen. I still have this.

It progressed to full blown depression when I was around 14, and it got to the point where I couldn't attend school. I would end up catching up with my life when I was doing better.

I'm now 20 and have made it to my first year of university, have an incredibly, loving boyfriend who I am deeply in love with and am making a load of great friends here. The issue is, I keep pushing myself away and sabotaging these things. It's almost like I want people to know how helpless I feel so someone will take charge for me and sort my life out for me, although that would make me feel very guilty.

I feel very paranoid, like everyone hates me and that me and my dark thoughts are ruining people's lives and burdening people that love me who are just trying to live happy lives, and the more I think about this, the more I beat myself up and the cycle continues. I constantly feel a strong compulsion to kill myself, that I have to fight all the time.

The negative things that people say stick with me and I can't shake anything off or be casual, I am always so neurotic. I am completely in love with my boyfriend, and he is everything I aspire to be, and his friends are people who in theory I should get on with brilliantly. However, whenever I'm with him and them, I always just compare myself to them and it reminds me how terrible I am at everything and makes me anxious and in that suicidal headspace, and I push him away because of that and put him down, which I feel so terribly guilty for. I have been transparent with him about this and always apologise and explain, but I feel that he shouldn't have to go through that.

Spirituality is very important to me, and the only thing that makes sense to me, yet I'm still so threatened by my egotistical thoughts and my ego always feels threatened. At the start of our relationship, he was very excited that he had recently become friends with his ex girlfriend again, and they had taken acid together and had a 'parallel trip', in which they felt like one person and he kept referring to her as his soulmate, saying he needed to protect her and that she is pretty etc. He also has a tattoo on his arm that she drew on him, signifying the permanence of their connection. This made me feel very upset and uncomfortable, as I was already in a bad place and I haven't been able to cope with our relationship since because I am so in love with him but I feel like he falls in love easily. He has spent the past 5 months making this up to me, assuring me but still maintained that I needed to make the effort to be comfortable with the situation because he wanted her in his life. I was very hurt by this because I felt like he was putting her before me, but I would never tell him not to see her or be controlling, I was never going to give him that ultimatum, I just want him to be happy and deal with the ramifications of that myself. It has driven a wedge between us and I am not sure whether to trust him, particularly because of my past.

He met up with her recently and kept this from me, because he said I would have been too upset, and he said he helped her through her recent memory of a sexual assault, which hurt a lot because I am suffering a lot with my own case and although he's been there for me, I haven't felt like he's fully engaged in this with me and we've been arguing more than we've supported each other. He also does the same things in bed that I told him happened to me, which are quite specific and therefore bring up a lot of traumatic memories. All of this makes me feel like he cares more about her than me.

I feel like, although I'm being transparent with him about the situation, the pain that it has caused me is making him feel too guilty to speak to her again, so even though I vowed never to put him through an ultimatum situation, it has led to that anyway.

Despite these things, he really is incredible to me. He cares for me so well, is such a fun-loving extroverted person who just wants to make everyone happy, and I feel like my neurotic, dark and complex nature is burdening him and everyone around me and I feel like I don't deserve anyone. 

My mum is also old now and it seems that she's beginning to lose her memory, and I cut my dad out of my life last year. My brother has only just come to terms with his own issues due to all of this, so I can't burden him, and I have pushed out any friend I ever had along the way in my life, and so the only people I now have are the people that I have met this year.

I hate that I analyse things to the point where I hate myself and affect others, I don't feel like I deserve to live because I haven't figured out how to change yet, and I hate that I still have this victim mentality when my life, externally is great right now.

I don't want to lose my boyfriend in particular or hurt him by focusing so hard on the reasons that he may not love me instead of just accepting his love and living a healthy, happy life with him. I am on the verge of searching for the right drug that I can use to function. My depression and anxiety affects me physically to the point where sometimes I become catatonic and cannot move and just fall asleep or freeze wherever I am, making it impossible to think or focus on anything i have to do, including my degree or a job. I feel so alone, and I am so scared. I am noticing that I'm starting to regress and act like a child around my boyfriend as well, and it's happening automatically, because I feel vulnerable and I want him to take care of me and love me unconditionally like a father figure would.

I feel every emotion ten times more than most people seem to feel it, love, guilt, shame, fear and happiness even. I feel like I am like my father and abuser and the cycle is about to continue, and I just want to chill the fuck out and not let this consume me every day. Can anyone shed light on this? Am I doomed? Am I a bad person? Can this go away? Will I ever feel less alone and will I ever feel like someone loves me?",15Nov2018,1
