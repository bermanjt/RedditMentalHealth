Hello! I am writing this in the hopes of gaining a  perspective on the relationship between bipolar disorder/depression/ADHD. I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 16, family history, etc. For a long time, I have also suspected that I have symptoms of ADD (not ADHD). My symptoms are as follows:
-periods of severe depression
-poor attention/distract-ability that interferes with my quality of life at work and home life
-impulsive behavior (drinking, gambling, eating)
-irritability and extreme emotions from one end of the spectrum to the other very quickly

I've been on antidepressants since I was in college and I'm at the point where it doesn't feel like they're helping anything. I recently was prescribed phentermine for weight loss and both my boyfriend and I have actually noticed a HUGE difference in my mood. It seems to be having a positive affect on my mood swings, emotional outbursts, etc. I started researching the effects of stimulants on bipolar depression and ADHD and noticed that the symptoms are very similar and it's very common to have both conditions simultaneously. Note: I’ve never been diagnosed with bipolar depression, but after reading up on the symptoms and how it oftentimes occurs in patients with ADD, etc I think it’s definitely worth looking in to.

I have a doctor's appointment coming up with a psychiatrist, and I want to be as prepared as possible. I have been living with these conditions for as long a di can remember and Nothing seems to help. I've also been in situations with PCPs over the years where I've mentioned my suspicions about the ADHD and was treated like I was just trying to get drugs from them, so I never brought it up again because that's obviously a terrible feeling. 

The phentermine is not a long term solution to these symptoms, but it is obviously helping me tremendously. I would really appreciate any additional information on these conditions occurring together along with medications used to treat. I want to finally get to the bottom of this with my doctor and find something that works.

Thank you in advance for your input.",26Mar2018,1,
2,"I have been taking Cymbalta for a few years, and have been slowly tapering off for six months. I made the mistake of tapering from 60 to 30 mg in one go and had a rough month. Thst was six months ago. Now, I've been slowly tapering down from 30mg to 0 using the bead counting method over the past two months. One 30mg pill had 180 beads, so I started with 150 beads for a week, then 120, 90, 60. Wasn't able to quit from there. So I went 45 beads, 30, 20. Two days without and I'm still having brain zaps and dizziness. At 1/18th of my original dose. When were you able to drop the meds all together? Also, does the capsule itself have medicinal properties, or just the beads? TIA for any stories and advice!",26Mar2018,5,
3,"Before I even say anything I just want to give a trigger warning because I mention sexual assault and drugs.

Okay so about two years ago I was in a really bad place in life, I had a girlfriend who I didn’t realize was manipulative and abusive because she was my first real girlfriend so I thought this is just how some couples were. Before her I didn’t really do much drug wise but she pulled me into parties and places with a ton of pills and alcohol, she really fucked me up but I thought I truly loved her so I just sat through it all. 
I also stayed with her and that bad group of people because they accepted me as trans, I’m a trans guy but other friends I had tried to come out to didn’t really get it but these people were accepting so I thought that made them real friends. I did horrible things in a short year and those were all horrible people I have finally gotten out of my life. 
Two years ago I moved and I left them all behind, I became drug free I got real friends and real support but those years and what happened still haunt me. Probably because I can’t talk about them to any professional yet because I’m not 18 yet and I’m worried they would tell my parents, my parents thought I was a good kid through all those years. 

The things that haunts me the most is my ex girlfriend, she pressured me into doing so much, I would even call some of the things she made me do sexual assault. She treated me horribly but tricked me into think she loved me so much and I actually did love her so much because I didn’t realize how bad she was. But she’s out of my life now, I have lovely friends, an amazing sweet boyfriend, I’m doing well in school and know what I want in life but my depression is getting worse probably because other reasons as well but I think it’s because I never really dealt with everything that happened. Recently I haven’t been able to be sexually intimate because I just remember the way she treated me. 

Every time I remember the past it makes me more upset and I don’t know what I am suppose to do, I can’t just forget it and I’ve been trying to move on for so long and for a little while I thought I had finally moved on but now I’m crashing down again and I feel like she’s going to come back and it makes me terrified. I don’t know what I can do to deal with my past. ",26Mar2018,5,
4,"I’ll start this off with your all to common disclaimer: I don’t know if this is the right subreddit to post to, so please go easy if this isn’t the right place. 

I don’t really know how to word the title in a way that conveys what I mean. I am not a controlling person, but lately, I’ve been having very controlling thoughts. The most recent is this: my girlfriend is at her grandparents tonight, and the thought crossed my mind that she might be staying there for the night. My immediate reaction was disgust and that she was somehow being unfaithful by staying at her grandparents. That kind of thought scares me, because I don’t want that to become me. I don’t want to be controlling, but I see that coming up way to often in my thought process. I’ve never voiced these thoughts, she has no idea I have them. But what happens when I slip up? Besides the potential consequences, I don’t like that I’m thinking this way because it displays a trait that I think is wrong and that I don’t want to have. Why should her staying at her grandparents effect me? It’s not like she’s avoiding me in anyway. 

I could go on forever with questions. The first one is my main concern, if you choose to respond to just one thing, please let it be that. But here goes the rest of it...

While I am undiagnosed, I can say with great confidence that I have depression and OCD. My father has both and I see a lot of those qualities in myself. I’ve been struggling with them both lately, and in combination with my Aspergers, it has proven very challenging to deal with. I struggle to recognize my own emotions, and while I can recognize others emotions, I have no idea how to respond to them. I ask myself all the time, why do I love my girlfriend? Why does she love me? She hasn’t responded to my text in an hour. She must be pissed with me. She hates me. I’ll bet she’s going to break up with me tomorrow. I analyze every little thing I do that has any relation to her. I analyze every word I say to her, and every word she says to me. Every action, every thought gets analyzed, and it’s just too much. I overthink everything and it is extremely difficult to let go. I need answers and there can’t be an ounce of uncertainty in it. It needs to be a 100% confident yes or no. This has started to effect my sleep, unless I go to bed absolutely exhausted (around 1-2 at night), I will be up forever running through every possible scenario of what could possibly happen with my girlfriend. She is my EVERY THOUGHT. She is absolutely the most important thing in my life, and at a stressful time for both of us. We graduate in a two months, and after that absolutely everything is uncertain. She is going to be going to a college that I don’t necessarily like. I worry that she will be unfaithful, or worse that she will be coerced. Her family is big in the brewery business and (probably largely in part to my family’s devastating experiences with alcohol), I worry that when she is out of the grasp of her controlling mother, that she will go off the deep end and make stupid decisions. I do not want her going to this college, but it’s not my place to say that. It also goes back to this controlling issue that I want to kick. I’m scaring myself. 

What can I do? I need help and I don’t know how to get it. Thank you so much if you’ve read this far. I would really appreciate your thoughts. I would include a tl;dr but I feel that this is to important for something like that. Thank you again. ",26Mar2018,2,
5,"I looked at the four subtypes, and I'm not sure where I fall. I want to say that I'm a mix of impuslive and self destructive. I believe impulsive because I like to pick fights, I'm not afraid to voice my unpopular opinions or vulgar comments, and I'm ""hot-headed"" but not violent. I say that I could also be self destructive because of past and present self mutilation, believes on death, and having an underlying urge to feel pain. Can anyone help me figure out where I fall?

7,"recently i have been feeling really guilty due to what happened to me when i was younger. when i was in first or second grade, i was molested by an older boy and he never penetrated me with his penis but he broke my hymen with his fingers. im not sure if i qualify as a virgin anymore and i feel really guilty about it. im in a relationship with someone i love more than anything and im afraid if i ever tell them or if they find out, they wont think of me in the same way. i also feel guilty because my family is strongly christian and purity is very important and i dont think i can live up to that. i live in constant fear of rejection. ive been sexually assaulted twice by adults after that event &amp; manipulated into doing sexual things for a man who was older than me, although he never touched me. i feel disgusting and i hate myself. i dont know how much longer i can live with guilt like this. i am considering ending my life very soon, i have tried once in the past and failed but i really think i am at the end of the line. i wanted to talk about this before i finally do it. i am still under eighteen. i cant talk to my therapist about this and i cant talk to my family or my girlfriend or my friends. im completely alone and i dont know what to do.",26Mar2018,4,
8,"I’m a 17yr old female with anxiety. I’ve always suffered from anxiety, and from a young age I’ve physically made myself sick when confronted by situations that are root causes. With age it’s gotten better, but there are still occasions where I make myself sick (this can be nausea or other stomach problems, or I will even start running a fever). I’d like someone to talk to, just for the sake of talking to someone in a non confrontational and non bias setting because I think it will give me clarity and make me feel better. However, I’m scared to confront my parents about this. They are not very understanding about anything regarding mental health, which i think is generational. When I was 15/16 I was feeling very depressed and confronted them about it, and rather than seeking help, they told me I was overreacting. I could really use some advice.

Shield myself from any more

My ass, don't ask if I'm
Fine or chilling,

My past been leaking 
Forced to see
Hurtful memories
Try to forget 
They keep reminding me
Say you care
But you really don't
That you speak the truth
When you really won't
Fuck sympathy
Until you get your way
Hurt me more more
Until I go away
People jump for joy
When I'm not okay
So they wouldn't care
If I died today
Fuck this world
And everyone in it
Except the ones
Who's hearts are hurt and diminished
Cause I'm just like you
We fight and fight back too

While in the dark
Yet wish for pain to end
And eternal happiness to start.",26Mar2018,0,

One hope is that this medium of communication - looking at the art of psychotic mental states and being able to get insight into the artists mind - can help to bridge the gap between the schizophrenia community and others.

If you make schizophrenia- or psychosis-inspired artwork, consider sharing your work here! If you don't, check out and comment on the works of others!

15,"So earlier today I had some sort of paranoid episode that lasted about 3 hours (I think). I had this sudden onset of extreme paranoia, starting with the thought that there's going to be this massive flood and I could not get it out of my mind. Then I started pacing and looking out the windows constantly because I was convinced my neighbor was a murderer and my other neighbor was going to burn my house down. I grabbed a steak knife and started walking around my house with it because I wanted to be able to fight off whoever is coming to kill me and my family. My mother took the knife from me and I started yelling at her telling her that ""I'm just trying to keep our family safe, you don't know what's out there there's could be a flood or we could get murdered or our house could get burned down."" As I said before, I calmed down after what I think was 3 hours. This has happened at least two times before this.  I'm scared  that I could hurt  myself or other people if it happens again. Should I admit myself to the hospital soon just in case it happens again?",26Mar2018,1,
16,"This may be lengthy and unsettling to some .. 

I have many problems with my head. Not physically, but mentally. I think so much it’s exhausting. They’re not good thoughts either. I often think about killing people and drawing scenarios in my head that involve me or one of my family members dying. I have this imaginary world in my mind that I basically live in. I used to be an outgoing child. Star basketball player, many friends, chatty ... but now I have no interest in sports, friends or communicating. I’d much rather stay at home, in my bed and live as a famous rapper in my head rather than going out and actually achieving that. This happened shortly after I hit middle school. That is when my self esteem plummeted. Although, I’ve always had social problems. I’d never engage in a conversation first. I was very anti-social around the people I didn’t know. Social interaction with people scares me in a way. Not sure if “scared” is the right word to use, but I tend to avoid social interaction because I see no benefit from it. What’s the point, honestly? Whilst thinking this, I also long for friends but don’t have the mindset or social skills to gain them. There’s a rope and I’m both pushing and pulling on it ..

I have the urge to hurt people, or at least that’s where I’m heading. I randomly have these urges to hurt my dog. To wrap my hands around her neck, but I don’t choke her. I make her stare at me as I do it. I believe I’m trying to make her afraid of me, to show her that I’m the one in power. When I was younger and got into fights I’d do that as well. Wrap my hands around their necks but with humans I’d actually choke them. But with my dog? No. I scream at her and call her names whilst telling her to look at me. I can’t control it sometimes. I have the urge to do these things. Like an itch that needs to be scratched. I feel good whilst doing it, I feel powerful. But right after I do this to her, I break down and cry. Probably because I don’t mean to hurt her, because I love her. My dog is my life man ... I don’t do this to her often. It’s only happened 3 times but I’ve never actually hit her. She’s never physically in pain but I’m not sure about emotionally ... She’s such a loyal pupper. She doesn’t leave my side and cries when I leave hers. It happened again today but once I got a hold of myself I began crying whilst holding and petting her. Telling her I’m sorry. I have these urges a lot, but I don’t always act on them, and they’re not always towards my dog. It’s honestly towards anyone who pisses me off which brings me to ...

Anger problems. When someone tells me no I get infuriated to the point when I, once again, want to wrap my hands around their neck. When my mom yells at me I get so mad I cry. Not because I’m sad but because the anger can be very overwhelming. 

It’s very, very hard to concentrate. I often get these urges other than the bad ones I described, to rub certain areas of things. For example: Right now I am holding my phone and I have the urge to feel on the upper left inside of my case until I’m satisfied. An urge, like an itch is me pulling towards the corner of my phone. It’s the same thing with the doorknob, the light switch and my PS4 controller. I go bonkers on my controller. Touching and feeling on all of the buttons until I’m satisfied, or until I can bring myself to stop. I’ve gone through 3 controllers so far ...

The lights give me headaches. They’re so bright I can barely think. The teacher not fully erasing the left over marks from the marker makes me uneasy, restless even. It’s a very strong annoyance and once again, I have the urge to erase that small marker spot. That spot will bother me for the entire class if someone doesn’t deal with it. I can barely look outside when I get out of school. I have to wear shades to function. They’re so bright I can barely focus on what’s in front of me. Funny thing is, I’m the only one who sees the light as a problem. This goes for sounds too. When my mom turns on the vacuum cleaner I get scared because the noise is very, very loud. But she, having the vacuum right next to her can bare the sound just fine. 

I have no will to do anything , although I wish I did. I long for a normal life, to have friends, a job... but I don’t have the energy to achieve those things. I used to be able to play videos games all day and night, 24 hours straight. Now? I can barely play for 2-3 hours without getting exhausted. 

There are times where I feel like I’ve run a marathon when I’ve been home doing nothing all day, and then there’s times where my heart is going a mile a second. My thoughts are racing faster than sports cars and I’m pumped full of energy. I shake my legs to try to “distribute” the energy. I also get this sense of “fight or flight”. Like that feeling you get when someone’s coming. The difference is I know no one’s coming ... 

I believe that’s it. There’s probably more I’m missing. I’m just a walking mental illness at this point. 

Additional Information: I’m a 16yo female. ",26Mar2018,2,

I should be used to it, but I'm not. Now, I don't want to kill myself and leave my family forever, but I want to run away. Something about my life is making me feel sad, and I don't know why. I just know I will never go to the hospital again. The mental health care here is horrible. I wish it were better, then maybe I would want to stay. I'm honestly debating on wether or not I want to actually kill myself tonight. I know I said I didn't want to, but when I get into this mood, I feel like that's my way out.",26Mar2018,7,
18,"Ok *sigh* so here I am , looking for help in reddit, because honestly I have no idea of what to do.
My life , regarding my parents, is a long  and messy story.

Long story cut short is. Mom and dad were both married with children when they met, agreed to divorce from their couples, mom divorces , dad doesn't because his wife develops a spine injury and feels like he has an obligation with her.

Between those two events I am born, 20 years ago.

Been living all my life with my mom and sisters who I love very much. Dad has , if you will, a double life. Lives with his ill wife (who most likely knows my dad cheated on her and made herself ill on purpose , i shit you not) but also has raised me and comes to visit every now and then, my dad has worked his ass off to support both our financial needs, and also his wife's (include medicines and hospital bills).

I could say an 80% of the financial support I have recieved comes from my dad, although, I started studying in public schools at age 14, and have lived in my grandmother's house since i was 12. I have been pretty much been raised by my mom (say an 85%) , and she'd cut her own arm off before I ever starved (pretty crude metaphore, but yeah, she'd do anyting for me, although I tell her not to and with time have become pretty independent, with the purpose of not relying on her and also saving her work and effort).

So, two years ago, my parents had a big fight, I'm not very sure to this date but I think my mom had an affair back then (I did not tell my dad because he started saying some delirious shit and there was very few evidence but he bribed two cops to chase my mom and stop her so he could take her car away, because he said she used the car to pick up his 'lover') , I suffered from a (thank god) very mild depression. I had mood swings, I started crying when i talked to my dad,  I'd feel angry, sad, I had low self-esteem, and I slept waaay too much.

Most of the time I'm an optimistic and extroverted, but on the inside I'm actually pretty hurt and still suffer from depression from time to time, although I manage to snap out of it.

My parents got back together for some time, then got split, then together again, and so on for like, 4 times. Everytime shit hits the fan mom asks me , agressively, to ask my dad for money , dad (who enters a very aggressive, stubborn and irrational state when they fight) most of the time says no and frequently asks me to talk to my mom about him, insults her, my sisters (They were born from my mother's first marriage and they stopped talking to him a few years ago), so I'm pretty much involved in it every goddamn time.

Ok so here's the reason of why I write here.

Recently, They got back together, although, to be honest, through the years I have learnt my mom will most of the time just be in good terms with tmy dad because that's the only way she (and I) will get money from him. I have realised she no longer loves him, and I am already used to it, it doesn't hurt anymore, and I have understood it, given the fact my dad and us have never shared a house, he comes ans stays a few days and we go on road trips and stuff, but we don't live together.

Recently they seemed to be in good terms, everything was 'okay'. But then I realised, mom is cheating on dad. I had a few suspicions when mom started telling me to ask my dad for money and even asked me to lie to him because he won't give me enough (which is kind of true). I was talking to her one day and noticed she was texting hearts to someone. That's when I realised what the fuck was going on, however, it didn't hurt. She had started a cars sale with a mechanic who works down the street, so I assumed it was him. I let things be and hoped for the best, but one day I went shopping with mom and she then dropped me at home, she said she was taking a neighbour to a shop. Honestly that was the lamest lie I've ever heard, I never saw her stop by her house. I snapped, took the car and drove to the mechanic's shop. And then, like a movie script, bam, I see the son of a bitch driving my mom's car with her inside. At that point it took a lot of effort and self control not to crash my car into them. I almost felt like getting out of my car and beating the shit out of him. But i didn't, instead i went to the park and smoked a cig. 

She comes back, pretends nothing happenned and acts like she did take our neighbour to the shop. I train MMA, so I started beating the shit out of a bag, she notices something's wrong and starts asking, I really try not to make a scene and control my anger. I have not told her I know although she is suspicious.






It's been a couple days and I don't know what to do. 

If I tell my dad, and I'm not joking this time, if i tell him, I'm very scared of what he could do, he could go homicidal, suicidal, or do something that would make things even worse than they already are, so telling him is not an option.

Beating the mechanic up isn't one either because one way or another dad finds out. I feel really bad about not telling dad and covering mom on this, and pretendig nothing is going on. I started having tons of bad thoughts. Breaking the mechanic's nose, vandalazing his cars at night, vandalizing my mom's car, telling my dad so the mecanic ends up dead or beaten ,etc. 

I really don't know what to do, in a way I understand my mom struggles with my father's absense (in all senses ,ugh) but I'm not goung to live from my dad as long as she does this. I don't work because I'm studying engineering and my parents have told me hundreds of times to dedicate to university only.

I really don't know what to do. If I tell mom to tell dad to go away, it'd break his heart and shit would get worse, and I hate lying to my dad. I don't know what to do. Please help. 


Sorry for the long post.

19,"Lately I been feeling very alone, I've lost friends to drugs and alcohol here. Many of which are occupied by partying or sleeping around, I've never shared their destructive interests, always been the lone wolf in that regard, rather read a book or go for a walk. After a friend died in a car wreck from drinking recently, and another to suicide last year, it has left me isolated and feeling down. 

Suicide and depression does run in my family. I sometimes feel like a failure, because I've always wanted to help others, never found the opportunity to truly apply myself, when I had to take care of my sick mother for years, who is also passed. All I can think about is leaving everyone and running away or simply leaving this body for good, both are appealing choices and I have almost no fear of death when I have a deep disdain for so many things in life, what hurts is I've never done anything to hurt anyone ever, yet it always hurts inside.

No congrats or anything since I really don't know. I believe I'll find out tomorrow so I want to mentally prepare myself for the just in case. 

I had my son when I was only 14 (I just turned 22 today) and at the time I only had very bad depression and anxiety. My mental health was very bad at the time but I refused to take my antidepressants because I didn't think it was safe for the baby (good thing too since I later learned that the ones I was on cause severe birth defects). 

Now I suffer from depression, anxiety, OCD, and psychosis (more likely schizophrenia but my doctor won't tell me my diagnosis). I've been in a psychosis intervention program for about 3 years and I'm currently taking Zoloft and Risperidone. Every appointment I have with my psychiatrist, he tells me that it is very important I don't get pregnant while taking the risperidone because it isn't safe... 

Which makes me wonder how doctors treat patients with mental health disorders when they are pregnant. The last time I was pregnant probably the worst my mental health has ever gotten so I worry of what will happen in the just in case.

25,"**TW: EMOTIONAL ABUSE, SELF HARM, ASSAULT**

I’ve made shitty decisions in my life because I didn’t say “no” or physically try to stop someone. It’s also weird that one instance was occurring for like 3 or so days and how the other occurred for.. basically a year.

The couple-of-days instance involved me Skyping with someone I’d met on a social media website. I’m in the bdsm community, and I was looking to be a submissive which is basically Someone who does things for their Dominant. I hadn’t a clue what being a submissive to someone took—immense trust, caring, reassurance, love, and most importantly communication. I was stupid and nïave, and it’s a very common problem with inexperienced submissives. Or hell, people in General.

Long story short I’d exchanged Skypes with this guy who would put me down and call me a failure (of a submissive) and incapable of being something to anyone. I should have blocked him instantly but I didn’t because I was hoping he didn’t mean it. Either later that night or the next day, he convinced me to cut myself. I’d told him about my history with self harm before and that I felt uncomfortable doing this, but he urged me anyways and I obeyed. In the kink community if you are participating in something that is absolutely something you cannot handle—physically or emotionally—you safeword, which is tapping out. I safeworded, and he ignored this and chastised me and said I should only safe word if a, im about to pass out from pain; or b, I’m seriously harmed and need to go to the hospital. I ended up cutting and cried on the call with him and he didn’t say anything to comfort me.

It was a stupid foolish thing for me to do. I guess I stuck it out because I was desperate for some sort of validation from someone..

That leads me to my next trauma I guess. I had this borderline emotionally abusive or at least manipulative ex boyfriend. He would get frustrated with my constant episodes of depression and lash out, saying I’m impossible to talk to, I’m a different person than the girl he fell in love with. After a year and a half of this, we broke up for the last time. I had realized later on that I was so miserable but desperate to not be alone and I clung to anyone I could because I was terrified to be with my thoughts and ideations.

Soon after our break up he left me for his best friend, but continued to visit me for sex maybe twice a week. This went on for 1 year. At one point we both got drunk and he made moves on me and I repeatedly told him no but he coaxed me into it and I gave in so he could leave. I hadn’t wanted to but I gave in. I should have forced him out immediately. But I didn’t... and what’s more fucked up is that after that incident, I continued meeting with him. I was desperate to be with him because he was firmiliar to me...

Its so difficult to realize that those stupid instances have made me so afraid to fail people—so I try to please everyone and keep them as happy as possible; immense fear of being yelled at or degraded for something I can’t help or should have done...

Its so hard to change this mindset because it’s been maybe 2years since all of that,..

I guess this is more of a rant, but I’m planning on talking to my therapist about all of this Tuesday... thanks for making it this far I guess",26Mar2018,22,

33,"I have diagnosed PTSD. I was diagnosed two years ago and have been doing really great ever since. I have recently been under immense amounts of stress and I think I'm going through a depressive episode because of it. I have had episodes since my diagnosis but this is the first one I've had where I have genuinely felt like hurting myself. In the past, I have been able to use coping skills to make the feelings go away. It's not as easy this time. I haven't hurt myself yet but I'm scared I will before this episode is over.

I experience some psychotic symptoms with my PTSD that not everyone with PTSD experiences. I have hallucinations, mostly auditory, and I dissociate pretty often and strongly. I also have nightmares often and they have increased in frequency over the past couple weeks. I am experiencing more auditory hallucinations tonight than I ever have before, and they are stronger. I also believe that I am feeling depersonalization for the first time ever. I looked into the mirror and I saw myself but I feel like it's not me. And if I look at it for too long, it makes me feel sick, as if I'm looking at a gory open wound. That's the best way I can describe it. Like I know it's me, but the fact that I can't recognize it as myself makes me nauseous.

My question is, should these new and worsening symptoms worry me? Is it urgent that I let my doctor know? Or do you think that these symptoms will go away after this episode, if I can just make it through?",26Mar2018,2,

This feeling usually comes about in certain situations or environments, most notably when I'm in wide open spaces I feel unsteady like I'm not properly anchored to the ground or something and I need to escape to somewhere indoors or somewhere I can hold onto something. and also in situations that are difficult to get out of without needing a reason (ie, meetings/interviews/at the cinema),or sometimes just randomly at home or work or anywhere really.
It isn't always intense, it ranges anywhere from just an uncomfortable feeling to an intense falling sensation which causes panic attacks. It has really started to affect my social life and work life because I'm actively avoiding situations that I know might trigger this feeling.
I've tried to look online to see if anyone has described this elsewhere, I've found some people describing similar symptoms but nothing exactly the same, it'll range from people claiming Agoraphobia/Casadasrtaphobia or even anxiety or an inner ear issue.

I must be dead?” And then, concerningly, I had the thought that I was Jesus.

58,"Mike, my boyfriend (28M) of five years, is going through a period of growth and self-realization, and I’m not sure whether I should be concerned about it. 

He had a very rough time a couple of months ago. He was going through a lot, including digging into his past and recognizing that he had been using substances as a coping mechanism. I was very worried about Mike’s mental health, and he began seeing a therapist during that time. He is no longer in therapy; however, his therapist indicated that he was comfortable with discontinuing their work together since he felt that Mike had gained the tools he needed to continue handling his problems on his own. 

Since then, Mike has become very interested in spirituality. This is something I have been supportive of, since I have also used spirituality to cope with emotionally challenging situations in my past.  At first, he began exploring Buddhist concepts, then Western and Eastern philosophers. He started practicing yoga, and believes that a lot of the emotional pain he’s been dealing with has been stored up in his body for many years. He now practices for varying amounts of time several times per day (I would estimate 5-8 sessions between 15 minutes and one hour each), and often exclaims about the realizations he has as he restores alignment in his body. This typically follows a pattern with certain noises and sensations, followed by an epiphany. For example, “You are never going to believe what just happened! I was moving my leg like *this,* and when I curled my fingers I heard a big pop and felt a shooting sensation go from the right side of my neck all down my arm. That’s when I realized what must have happened that time with my dad when I was 6 years old! It was like all those emotions just came flooding back and now I understand everything.” It may be worth noting that he has not received any formal yoga instruction, but is entirely self-taught. 

As part of his exploration, he started reading the Baghavad Gita last week. It really seems to have made an impression on him, and he often practices yoga while reading it. He is very interested in the concepts of consciousness that he’s read, and he believes it is helping him tap into his intuition. In fact, last night he told me he believes he is capable of what I can only describe as pre-cognition. He asked me to open up books with illustrations and then he tried to predict what the pictures were. He also believes he predicted that we would run into an old friend of his, that several of his current coworkers would be absent from work today, and other things. 

Mike doesn’t seem willing to accept the logical explanations that I’ve suggested to explain his sudden pre-cognitive abilities, such as confirmation bias. He says I don’t have to believe him, but he now feels like he is tapped into the universe and can trust himself for the first time. 

As this process of self-exploration escalates, I’m becoming more and more concerned. I don’t want to be close-minded and reject all of his ideas about spirituality and consciousness simply because they’re not for me or because I don’t understand them. I am trying to be open-minded and listen to him, but he has become borderline obsessive and his ideas are becoming extremely outlandish. I’m not sure how to describe it, exactly, but it seems like he might be experiencing something outside the normal human experience. I'm glad his emotional pain from a few months ago has dissipated, but am worried these new coping techniques have become a problem. I’m concerned about his mental state, but do I have a reason to be? Also, how can I best support him as he explores this spiritual side of himself without encouraging unhealthy behaviors?

TL;DR: My partner has become obsessed with spirituality and I am concerned, but I’m not sure if I should be. ",26Mar2018,1,

When I sleep perfectly I am in a really great place feel really great etc. But If I don't get about 9 hours of really good sleep I have pretty classic symptoms of depression. I tend to sleep well most nights because of good diet exercise I've done evey trick in the book to ensure I sleep well but when I dont sleep well I am kind of a mess and its harder the following night to sleep well.

How I feel when I don't get my 9 good hours of sleep.

Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood

Feelings of hopelessness, or pessimism

Irritability

Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness

Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities

Decreased energy or fatigue

basically just classic depression symptoms

Its weird because for most people 8 hours is a pretty good night of sleep but for me I feel like total shit. But if I get that 9 hours? I feel amazing. The problem is some days I wake up too early or if it takes me too long to fall asleep its hard to get 9 hours. TLDR I try my best but sometimes shit happens.

But what I'm talking about is specifically taking to *only yourself*....no aliens,voices,other people etc.My MFT therapist (most psychologists wont take Medicaid,ugh....) told me that she *knows* I am not schizophrenic because I *know* that I am only speaking to myself.But its still a very strange thing to do......&amp; *not sexy at all*,no offense.I will never tell anyone that I have done this or continue to do this.I have noone else I can trust to talk to,so why not just converse with myself?My father unfortunately *was* a paranoid schizophrenic himself but that alone does not mean it will be passed down to offspring.My father doesnt talk to himself but he is very much obsessed with sin &amp; religion....so much so that he has been on disability for most of his adult life.I lost respect for him in the past because our family of 5 (parents,two brothers &amp; I) were *way* below the poverty line.I couldnt understand why I got a rusted spoon at birth instead of a silver one.Well anyway I think that there isn't a person here that can tell me any alternatives to *self talk*.What?Join a group?Facebook?Chat rooms?Clubs at my community college?I live alone...I've always been alone.....I have no concept of how to form relationships with people at all.I was recently diagnosed with *social communication disorder* which kind of pisses me off for two reasons.One,I actually believe that I have autism or HFA but my parents,who were disabled themselves,could not send me to therapy or a psychologist because we were a poor,broken,dysfunctional family living with very limited means.My father is black.My mother is Arab.My mother depended on my father for everything because she was blind in one eye.My father was of the belief,I think,that women were beneath men &amp; could not be too powerful.He punished me for seeking out powerful female role models,declaring them inflammatory feminists.He would lecture on &amp; on &amp; on about the Bible until I begged him to shut the fuck up.That's one of the reasons why I hate hearing people talk.Luckily I'm also deaf in one ear so my fathers ""God"" fixed that for me.He made me atheist or agnostic.If he is up there....he can stay up there.I spent a lot of time as a child &amp; teen alone in  my room,no friends.I guess I eventually turned to talking to myself to avoid losing my mind with boredom.Sometimes you just need to say things &amp; I know I wont judge myself.I'm always open to *myself*.I don't know what sort of man would tolerate someone like me.I wont settle for anyone like my father.I refuse to settle for someone with problems worse than me making $600/month in an expensive city like Los Angeles.I don't consider that entitlement but common sense.I'm not moving anywhere,at least for now,because I refuse to give in to these greedy as hell landlords pumping the rent up so damn high that only Oprah can live near the subway,so the NIMBY's (Not In My Backyard) can go fuck themselves.Thanks to my father keeping me inside while letting my *brothers* roam free &amp; cause all sorts of hell......I think all men should be Disney prince charming.

The real world is so pale &amp; cold.I've *never* been on a date,*never* been married,*never* been kissed (no kidding) because I was isolated by an ex-communiciated Jehovah's witness who today,at 74,*still* believes we are in ""the END of the last days"".His words,not mine.If I ever did find a man willing to tolerate me,I would have two questions:

1. What's wrong with you?

2.*Why me?*

Sometimes people catch me chatting up the events of the day,my moods or whatever i feel like to myself &amp; I have to catch myself.It doesn't matter what they think.Maybe I'll try eHarmony again or maybe I'l find someone in my academic program that interests me.I'm extremely social anxiety so I wont hunt for any man.But I guess why I wrote all this is to know if it makes me really bad off if I talk to myself.",26Mar2018,2,

I wanted to post here about something I deal with. I wondered if any others could relate? I believe this is an okay place to post even though I don’t hang out here much.

I have two strong yet completely different opinions on everything. And both of them feel absolutely right. It is holding me back in life because I can’t make decisions. Does anyone experience that? 

Take, for example, people.

I definitely believe people are good and deserve respect, kindness and love. We consider, we heal, we forgive. We want a good, happy world.

But at the same I believe that people are cold. They are unkind, think of themselves and do appalling things. I believe people aren’t deserved a place on the planet and if they die do I care?

How do I have such opposed and deep opinions?

Or take my time at school. I am confident it was a beautiful time of joy and friends and positivity. I also definitely hated nearly everything about it and feel pain just thinking about it.

They are so unresolved. I cannot think clearly or move forwards because of it. Even as I write this it is happening. I am sure I need to share this problem. I am also sure it is complete nonsense and I am making it all up. My job, where I live, who my friends are - nearly everything has two different sides so I find myself stuck waiting for the clear feelings.

My only thought is that I was an emotional, sensitive boy sometimes. I came to hate that and remember being given very 'tough love' for it. I chose to switch off my feelings to become the hard manly type which I thought I was supposed to be. I was proud when I achieved it. Could it be at play in my experiences today?

74,"Okay, I've never told anyone about this but I suppose the best way to do so is just to straight up say how I've been feeling.

Up until mid-last year, I never gave my mental health much notice. I always thought my state was 'normal.' But recently I've begun to pay more attention.

I started to experience panic attacks last November, just straight up out of the blue. I went to a psychiatrist who confirmed I have Severe Anxiety Disorder. I've had 4 or 5 attacks in total. I was given some Cognitive Behavioral therapy work to complete in order to help me, but I never did it - and funnily, I haven't had an attack since or haven't been back to see my psychiatrist. I think this is strange, it's almost as if I wanted the comfort of knowing I had some disorder or else I finally understood what was going on so that settled it in me.

I should also add, I commonly have negative thoughts. I have absolutely no self-belief/lack confidence and feel like I'm destined to fail in every situation. This has had a major impact when surrounded by new people and when starting a new job. I commonly think 'this is not for me', 'I don't understand this' etc whilst at work. With new people, I feel as if I'm making a fool of myself. Maybe I pile so much pressure on my shoulders that I cannot cope, but I don't mean to do this. I don't want to do this. 

I feel like such a screw up sometimes even though im very educated and have 2 degrees so far. I'm 24 years of age I should also add. It's weird, because when I go to bed at night I worry that my phone which is on charge may catch fire or something. I also check that the front door is locked, then the back door, the front again as I ask myself 'was the front door actually locked?' or I say to myself 'better check the door again.' then I go and check the back door again. I sometimes do this 4 times. I smoke an E-cig and I often worry too if that will catch fire when placed on charge at night. These are just some of the behaviours I commonly express, there are more of course which I can't think of, off the top of my head. 

Anyway, I'm not happy with where I am in life at present, I hate my job and don't have the guts to tell my boss about it or of I should leave. The feeling of monumental failure or leaving will embarrass the shit out of me and I worry about what they'll think. I know that if I left it, I'd be happier but at the same time I'd be extremely worried I won't find anything else ever. I look at my friends and see they're doing quite well and I know I have it in me to succeed but feel as if I never will. I often feel lost, in life. 'What am I going to do?' is the newest thought.

I also need advice from everyone before making a decision. I don't trust myself. I always ring someone to ask what they would do or ask my parents before making a 'big' decision or a decision that's seen as big by others in life. For example 'should I meet my friends tonight?' or 'Will I go on vacation with friends?' then I'd think 'but that's 500 dollars then that will be spent, that's loads!' - so I need convincing. 

I also suffer mildly from torrets syndrome. It's very mild though and I can disguise it well from others. It's more 'ticks' than actual loud outbursts. For example, twitching of the eye or under the breath noises. Had it my entire life. I've come to know it's brought on by the following most of the time: Lack of sleep, stress, playing video games &amp; high intakes of stimulants such as coffee. 

When down, I sometimes think suicidal thoughts, but I'm also aware that I'll never ever act on them. I couldn't put my family and friends through such grief. So I'm convinced I'd never have the guts to do it. But again, I worry about this also.

Sometimes, i suddenly get images in my mind of disastrous situations - for example it could be me stood at the edge of a cliff or something and I fall over and bump into someone else that falls off. Of course, this isn't just a sudden image - I could be thinking about the grand canyon or reading about it and all of a sudden I get this disastrous image in my mind. 

Sometimes I tell myself ill be fine, but deep down I know I need to do something. Find an answer from somewhere perhaps. Hence why I'm outlining everything here. I feel quite embarrassed doing this or as if my friends will find out that it is ME posting this here and think I'm a freak. Well, I'm not - I have many friends &amp; take part in activities like most people, but inside this is how I feel. 

Listen, I'm not here to moan, but I just want to see if anyone has ever undergone similar symptoms to all of this. It's really hard to explain. I constantly strive to make changes in life and 'act happy' but it never really lasts long. I suppose I feel down sometimes, but I've always just got on with it. I look for answers as to who I really am etc but still feel lost as hell 85% of the time. I've never read a self-help book &amp; I'm not too familiar with mental health in its entirety - Just anxiety disorder.

Sorry that this is all converged into one big mess, I'm typing on my phone &amp; simply just expressing my feelings/emotions. If this post would be better suited for another Reddit thread, please do suggest. Thank you. ",26Mar2018,2,
75,"I've been travelling solo for a few months now but recently my gf and I broke it off. I had been having regular episodes of panic (not as bad a real panic attack) and in general am depressed. I'm planning on seeking therapy however I'm not sure if i want to do it where i have a good support network - Boston. I'm thinking of moving to San Diego however I am worried that it will be detrimental to my mental health if I am in a place with no support network. I would seek professional help in both cities so I guess I'm wondering if relying on the therapist would be sufficient for treatment of slight depression in San Diego without old friends and family in Boston. 
Thanks",26Mar2018,4,

77,"I have had mental health problems all my life but now at 32 I have bipolar, BPD, GAD, emetophobia and agoraphobia. I had a breakdown three years ago that cost me my career and then college career. I lost everything. And I then sought proper help and here we are today.

I take meds though I struggle to stay on them. I go to my appointments, I have a daily journal, I track my mood. I have my day structured for success and I still challenge myself too.

Then I found out about DBT. There is nothing for me within reasonable driving distance and it doesn’t matter because my health insurance won’t cover it. Over these last few years, my therapist has given me some worksheets here and there and I am familiar with a couple DBT techniques. But I am clueless.

So I buy books but I don’t have the attention span to read and the information that I do read gets forgotten as soon as I turn the page. I try to do the DBT workbook but I don’t understand and I get confused. This stresses me out so for three weeks I have been having emotional turmoil over this. I went to some websites and what is free is limited. This is practically a college course. I struggle in school and I always have so now I’m trying to teach myself this specialized therapy using books and websites and it’s not going well. 

I’ve reached out for help on forums but I get told that I’m not trying hard enough and I am choosing to be sick. Everywhere I turn, everyone is going on about DBT but I don’t have access and I’m trying to self educate but it’s not working so I’ve put the books away for now. I’m not sure what I’m going to do next. 

Thanks for reading!",26Mar2018,5,

79,"I'm scared of losing my job, or just getting laid off from lack of business. I'm scared someone close to me is really sick right now, and may not get better. I'm scared I'll lose everything that means so much to me. Is there hope? Can someone tell me anything that will help bring me peace?",26Mar2018,1,
