1,Like to just get everything out there. I just don't have the courage to say what I want .,15Aug2018,1,
2,"So this is probably going to sound fucked up and if you hate me for it, it’s understandable because I’m already a bad person. So I’ve been experiencing these “episodes” where I get hyper, easily irritated and I get urges to hurt myself and my pets. Usually when this happens I try to distract myself with food, YouTube, self harm or video games. I have yet to hurt my pets but I feel like sooner or later that’s going to happen. Last time one of these “episodes” happened I kept hitting, scratching and choking myself I also wrapped my charger around my cats neck (I didn’t actually choke him) and I kept pushing and pulling him. I’ve also noticed that I have a hard time showing empathy, one time my friend was crying right in front of me and all I wanted to do in that moment was to tell her to shut up and go away. Another time she was talking to me about her suicide attempt while drunk and I was only laughing at her in my head. I’ve been suicidal for 4 or 5 years and I’ve had multiple attempts, I’ve never been to a therapist and I’m still to stubborn to go. I guess I’m just asking for some kind of diagnoses? I just want to know what’s wrong with me. ",15Aug2018,1,

8,"TL/DR ; older brother snapped at me after I called out his mood changes and accused me of having emotional issues that apparently “everyone “ js concerned about . Very hurt

I’m sorry In advance as this is long... 

My brother has been in an unhealthy relationship for 2 years . It’s a long story but to give the cliff notes, he got with my friend or “friend” the week after he broke up with his ex of 14 years . Literally. My friend knew he was single and she doesn’t like being alone so she went in for the kill. Yes it takes two to tango and my bro was in a bad place.

My bro ends up moving in with her right away . The whole time I thought it was all very manic. My friend soon grew paranoid since she moved in with him so quick , it was only natural she felt threatened... he still had loose ends with his ex. She began making a lot of our conversations about his ex and me and my communication to her . 

All the while my brother begins to secretly vent to me he’s miserable . My friend has a good heart but she’s known to talk badly about people , judge , criticize , etc. it’s draining ..... incredibly draining..... my brother hates drama so it’s almost karma for him. One day he will vent how unhappy he is , then the next he gets this really angry voice and tells me he’s happy and I need to just get along with her. Then the next he’s unhappy again . Then I catch wind from his ex that he cheated on his gf with the ex . He’s put me in a weird tough spot 

The other day we have a phone call to catch up and his gf gets brought up . I tell him I am keeping my distance because he’s put me in a weird spot . He then basically loses his shit. Tells me / admits he’s cheated but that “ no one will believe you my gf will believe me “ ( he’s so paranoid about her finding out) and then tells me the most hurtful shit I’ve ever heard ... “ everyone thinks your in a depression because you never come to town, your weird , your this your that “ basically attacked me . I have gone on 6 trips this year .. I work hard . I’m dating . I have had a fun summer

He doesn’t specify who everyone is but I assume it’s his gf and her caught in high school friend.... because his gf is the type to always generalize ... 

I hung up on him .... I then remembered something his ex had told me . How he went to the doctor and they said he has depression and some possible bi polar tendencies ....

I’m just wondering am I the one with issues ? Maybe I haven’t handled this well but I’m not up and down . He takes me on a manic rollercoaster and I feel he’s only staying with her for shelter and convenience. 

I know I need to just stay out of it but am I being that unreasonable? He wants me to carry on a fake friendship with my former friend he’ admits to cheating on ........

10,"**Hello**, I am a 19 years old girl from Venezuela, since I was a little kid I've always liked to dress like a boy and play with boy's toys, I had a girlfriend during my early teenage phase, my parents *(religious)* got extremely mad with it but till today they haven't brought up the topic again so I assume they forgot about it.

My parents tried to force me to be ""girly and flirty"" multiple times by buying me clothes I disliked until I turned 15 and stopped caring about that, I've always felt more comfortable dressing like a boy or ""androgynous"" because I dislike dresses, skirts, sandals, adjusted shirts (I don't like looking myself on the mirror and watching my boobies).

Lately I have been fantasizing a lot (EVERYDAY) with being a man, even on my sexual fantasies I'm the guy, which made me wonder if I'm actually trans.

I have done things like pretending I am a man online when I was younger, I have taken it too far at the point of editing my voice in calls to sound like a guy, at some times I thought I was actually a guy, It's hard to explain with words, I guess when you tell yourself a lie for too long you start believing it.

I wish I could contact a gender therapist or something but:

1.  I can't afford it, the economic situation in this country is horrible.
2.  There are not gender therapists in Venezuela, the society is years behind, so even if I could afford it I can't get to one.

I wish I could find out if I'm actually trans or I'm just confused (maybe because of my depression), this situation gets me terribly bad, everytime I look in the mirror I mess up with my hair to see how would I look with a short hair (my mom doesn't want me to get a haircut), I see myself as a man, I don't like looking at my sexual parts, I feel they don't belong to me and I would prefer to have a -censored- penis. I came out to my grandma and my best friend but that hasn't helped anything since I can't start doing anything to actually feel better, it's sad having to pour my sorrow on internet but I'm really desperate.

11,"I just found out I have Depersonalization Disorder. It’s not transient, it’s not from using marijuana etc. I’ve had it chronically all my life from about highschool on. I never knew there was a diagnosis, I just thought I was “mentally tough.” 

I shut the world out at a young age because life was too much for me to handle, I was too sensitive. This past year was a struggle for me because I was freed of my depersonalization, I believe due to coming off my Anafranil. I felt alive. Again, I didn’t know I was freed from a specific diagnosis.

This last year was the best of my life because even though I had debilitating anxiety and depression, I picked myself up and used tools to get better without depersonalizing. 

Psychologists and Psychiatrists have told me depersonalization is a valuable coping device and I know where they’re coming from but I disagree. I’ve been suffering from chronic anxiety, pit in my stomach, nightly panic attacks, uncomfortable in my own skin for months and I can tell you without any trepidation I would chose that over Depersonalization. 

I’ve been dealing with it for a month now. Doctors tell me it arises from anxiety, which was probably  true for me during the majority of my life, amplified by marijuana use.

However,  this time it isn’t because of marijuana or anxiety. I felt alive and whole and beautiful but then I took ivermectin to heal a skin condition I’d been obsessing over (it didn’t heal it and I didn’t need the medication and never should have been given it). There isn’t much research on it but there’s cases of it passing the blood brain barrier. I’m confident this drug is what triggered this  depersonalization episode. From the little research I could find, one thing ivermectin does in mammals, is agonize GABA-A receptors. 

I woke up the next morning grasping onto emotion, feeling flatlined. I was out and felt dizzy, an intense out of body experience, intense brain fog for a full week, followed by intense hyposomnia.  I had no appetite for two weeks. It was difficult to get two bites down. The changes in my body and mind were intense and sudden and because the ivermectin was the only change to my routine, it has to be this.

——————-
My worst symptoms 

My memories do not feel like my own.

Pictures of myself do not look like me. 

I talk to my boyfriend of over a year who I am madly in love with and feel in an unfamiliar situation. 

I forget how I talk to anyone. I say things aloud and I think “is this what I would say?” 

My voice does not feel like my own, on the worst days hearing it does not sound like my own.

I do not have emotion I cannot feel connection.

I fake everything constantly so I assume everyone else is too.

I question everything 

Everything I do feels staged, phony

Hyper-consciousness/self awareness
———————-


Society, parents, teachers, they tell us to be strong. ""Train your mind to be stronger than your emotions or you'll lose every time"" I saw that the other day on Facebook. I feel like there's advice and  messages everywhere encouraging depersonalization. 

Weakness is not something to run from, weakness is what connects us. I can promise the whole world: life is empty, with non emotion. I am emotionless and I feel connection to no one. 

Theres a trend that glorifies “mental toughness” That language makes me cringe.  Tough sounds harsh to me, it sounds like you're pushing, blocking, knocking things down. Things that maybe you need strength to look at and process, make friends with instead of knocking down, INSTEAD of pushing away the same things that make you human, blocking the things that are real and valid and necessary. Instead, I’d rather foster strength. I think language is important and strength gives me a sense of holding onto character, not letting go, building up and being brave through weakness. 



I’ve lost my self. I want to be me again. I want my
personality. The last year of my life feels like a memory that isn’t mine. 

I want to feel.

14,"Okay so a quick background, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression my freshman year of high school and have struggled with it ever since. It’s really effected me to the point where i struggle talking to someone im not very close with. While I’m more introverted And have a lot of anxiety towards it, i really do like to talk to other people and have a lot of good encounters. However I’ve always struggled when it’s come to friends. I have 3 people I’m close with, everybody else I question if I could even call them a friend. I hang out with other people but only when I ask to, I’ll invite a group to hang out but never get invited to other things they are doing. People who I’ve always gotten along with throw parties and I only find out about it the night of on people’s Snapchat stories. I’m tired of this rejection. Since I started to notice the pattern my junior year my self confidence has gone down, I find myself questioning if I’m just not interesting enough or if I just have this cringey quality about me that only I can’t see. I try not to let it effect how I act in social situations, but it does. Now I’m going into my senior year of high school and I’m determined to have at least one good year,  but i don’t know how to meet new people or improve relationships with acquaintances. I don’t even know how to socialize any further than small talk and formalities at this point, mainly because that’s the entirety of the conversations I have with people. Being a senior in high school this is a weird and very late question to ask, but how do I make more friends? I’m not trying to be Mr. popular or anything but I’d like to be able to walk into a classroom and know some of the faces by more than just their name, get invited to go out, or even be able to see that people care about my presence. I’ve read up on it and it says to just be yourself, but that’s some pretty generic advice we’ve all been given since preschool. If anybody has any tips or ideas on what I can do to improve my social situation please let me know ",15Aug2018,2,
15,"I'm a 13 year old male. I don't have any illnesses that run in my family but I've been wondering recently if I have some sort of ASD and also anger management issues. I know I should tell someone or see  someone about this but I don't really have any courage to know how stupid I will sound if I'm just like everyone else. I also feel weird posting this here because a lot of the people here have severe depression/anxiety and I don't want to feel that I'm coming in with my quote on quote ""first world problems"". I have always been smart (Not condescending or rude like someone from r/iamverysmart) but definitely in advanced classes. And ever since the age of 9. I have had a complex of ideas running through my head that I literally think about more than once every hour that I am awake. It gets annoying but it can also keep me occupied (The idea is of a tv show/movie and I don't want to talk about it because I think it's kind of dumb.) My personality has always shifted from being that one kid who cried a lot to someone who just tried to be funny. I remember one time someone said something about another kid being funnier than me. And even though that is harmless, I ended up crying uncontrollably and in my mind I was so confused and tried to stop but I physically couldn't. I never could really act like a normal person. Which I know is the case for a lot of people. I never had any speech delays or problems with my imagination, but I liked to think of myself as a social person until I realized how screwed up my personality was. In the sense that I basically was nothing like what I depicted myself as to my peers. I was just acting out whatever impulse was on my mind even if it was self-depreciating or I didn't like it. It seems like I know what's normal in my head but I just act differently, I guess. I also don't have to much attachment to anyone in my family of 6 except for my Dad and my cat.  I've always been a little sensitive to sound as well. I'm sorry if I just rambled a bunch of different things but I also just really need to clear my mind. 

Next, I think I might have anger issues. I like to play video games a lot but I struggle greatly as I find that I get angry whenever I die, even if it doesn't mean much, like only going back a few seconds and losing absolutely nothing. I can just get uncontrollable anger. I have destroyed things in the past (keyboard, mouse, and punched a hole in my wall) but now I either just slam my desk with my fist, try to lift up something heavy, or just try to hold my anger in and feel like my head is going to explode. I know people would tell me to stop playing but it's my viable pass time other than youtube because I   feel really uncomfortable hanging out /talking with my friends anymore. I try to find ways to try and be more calm and passive but even if it works it only works for a day or two until I end up getting angry again. I haven't ever thought about hurting people but I've taken it out on people sometimes by snapping at them verbally. I have thought about harming people but my conscience quickly told me not to, which I agree with. I have also considered taking it out on animals, like my dog, but refused to because again, i understand how seriously messed up that is.

tl;dr I know what I could be experiencing is just puberty, but a lot of these issues have been constant my entire life, ever since I could remember. I don't know how to deal with these issues and I'm too afraid to tell anyone in real life.

Can anyone help me out here?",15Aug2018,3,

I've been going to therapy but that's stopping because I'm moving, I might try to see if I can get counseling through my University, I just don't know if I go the medical route or try to make myself grow by pushing myself through this even though it's hard.",15Aug2018,2,
17,"Hello ,

I was 18 when I first fell in love with my sweet heart (let's call her V) when I was a freshman at my University. Sure I had my crushes and feelings of attraction to some girls earlier then that but V was my actual first love. We first met as friends and it took us 7 months for us to actually start dating. In those seven months we exchanged memories and details of each other's lives from past to present. We both being part of an Ivy league University of your nation , it was not hard for us to cherish discussions which required science , logic , astronomy , what not! Our frequencies were resonating on intellectual level. We both got attracted to each other soon and we started dating.

In the initial 2 years we were spending 5-6 hours every day alone time. This time included good amount of talk, spending time with each other and physical intimacy. We both were so happy with each other and it looked like nothing could stop us. But in end of my second year of University I started to spend a little time with my boys in the dorm a little more and was eventually introduced to a PC game which is a MoBA known to be highly addictive. My 5-6 hours with her every day turned into 30-40 minutes soon. I would not pick up her phone, I would lie to her at 20:00 hours telling that I'm sleeping and cannot spend time with her but go on to play my MoBA till 03:00 the next day. 

Down to the final year of my University I would spend probably 15 minutes with her and say her to go away back to her dorm (both are dorms need to walked quite a bit to reach one another). I knew that she missed my company. I did not spend time with her, talking to her , making her feel good and spending physical time with her. I knew it all but the addiction had taken over me. She tried her ways to spend time with me trying to learn my MoBA and even trying to spend time when ever possible.

I was sincerely and honestly in love with V and she was madly in love with me. We even were sure to have a bright life together with a happy, stable family. We both knew it and we had spoke about it. I may have been addicted but only I knew how much I loved her.

Soon we arrived to the final semester of my under-grad program, it was time to go to Internships. On the last day on the pen-ultimate semester we sat down and spoke about the issues we faced. I have never cheated on her and neither did she. We knew how much pure our love was to each other and how much we meant to each other. But that night last night we mutually knew our road was bumpy in recent past. That night I said to her that we were not going to be with each other anymore and I did not see ourselves together in future so we took a break for a while.

During our internships working at good firms we got good exposure and were occupied with work. It is now when I realized that when working professionally, I did not face any sort of video game addiction. That was great news for me. I went on to have a great internship, so did V (at a different firm).

Let me remind you how sincere and pure our love for each other was in former years. But during my Intern days I earned laurals at my work. At the same time she started talking about a guy she met recently at her internship. Soon they were dating. Initially for a few weeks I was cool with it because I knew we were on a break and anyways I did not provide her time earlier. Now time had come for my internship to end and slowly I got used to professional routine. Now I started the need and feel to have a person/human in my life , a companion. But I knew what was happening on her side, though she was only having flings and hookups.

Now I smiled at my past with her and started to look ahead towards my life. I met few amazing women soon. They were really good people , some smart, some attractive, what not! I dated, been in short term relationships, tried to make some long term relationships, hooked up. But the only reason I did that was because I was never happy. I was never satisfied. I didn't feel love. I know what love feels like, that was not being felt now.

I stopped dating in all forms with women because of what I was feeling. I started to feel lonely and soon fell into depression. Every day I begged for the love, which I once felt somewhere to be found. I started to die from within. I was teethotaler all my life till this point. Strong depression and loneliness hit me and I started to drink, smoke and did few drugs. Im the same guy who once promoted being sober and found intellectual/social achievements to be cool, now doing all the bad habits mentioned above.

There is not a single day now where I don't get flashes of memories of me and V together and all our moments. This only made my depression worse. To overcome this I removed her from all my social media to lessen the thoughts of her. It did help a little.

I am mildly depressed these days and am still well away from seeing any other woman. I think would not get love I wanted any time soon. I am fine with it. Last Sunday was our last day in University after being back from the internship and it was the convocation. I saw her first time again after 8 long months. I am sure she is happy and really satisfied with her life. I was totally happy to see her being happy. She had the natural glow of good life back on her now.

Last 5 minutes in the University when everyone were leaving I was  happy that we literally crossed roads once. My depression got a little less when I said Hi and she responded with a Hi and she had the happy look. I wanted wanted to ask how are you and she said bye a second later and swiftly walked away. This event, this trivial event. I do not know if she meant to be rude/ was in a hurry to leave back or just in a high energy of just being graduated. This event which is so small has been the reason I am writing today.

Post that event memory flashes of me and V flooded my brain like never even before in last 1 and half years. I started questioning myself. I knew this path. I know was going to get fucked by depression again, this time the flood was too intense and let me tell you, I cried like never before within minutes. I can assure for that in my 22 years of being alive I had never cried like yesterday. I am afraid what I'll think or do to myself if this continues. I am starting to feel mild chest pain and headache.

I know I did not spend time with her when it mattered. I know we mutually broke up. I tried to find my love again. All the past has happened and all I can control is my future.

This depression seems to not reduce at all. I am having all kinds of nasty and harmful thoughts all again now but with a greater force. I have taken 3 hours to write my story just because my body was shivering uncontrollably all this time. Today is her birthday. It made me come out and take a step to seek advice even though I never did. I am depressed to that extent.

Please , if you know how I can snap out of this, have a simple Happy and successful life kindly help me out. I just want to live and let live.  I know she's happy with whomever and where ever she is. I have no issues. But please I just want forget, I just don't want  these memories. I just want to live again, I just want to love again. Thanks you for reading.

first off i’m incredibly aware of this could be misconstrued as a common thing everyone deals. of course your voice changes depending on your emotions.

however, and i’ve noticed this about myself since i was a child, my voice seems to alter so strangely and differently depending on my emotional state that it’s gotten to the point where i feel like these different voices coincide with different personalities 

meaning the emotions themselves seem to alter based on which personality i find myself in, which is generally facilitated by the use of a different voice 

i don’t think it’s necessary to describe it much more in detail, but i’m incredibly worried this is either a sign of autism (apparently a key factor is drastic voice changes) or something like multiple personality disorder (though i’m not sure the switching of personalities is that drastic, i still feel like myself (sort of) while “in each” but it’s as if they highlight different qualities about myself

i would bring this up with my therapist but i’m tired of sounding like a hypochondriac ",15Aug2018,0,

I think I have spent so long stopping myself from crying in front of people that this is automatic now, but it’s not healthy for me. When I’m alone I cry a lot about the same things, but then I talk about them and am either neutral or acting like they’re lighthearted topics. 
Any suggestions on how to start to overcome this? ",15Aug2018,8,
20,"I’ll try to be as short and concise in my explanation as possible, however my situation’s complicated so I apologize if that’s not possible. There will be a tl;dr at the bottom.

About 6 months ago I got involved with this girl. We became more than friends but nothing official. Long story short as best I can tell we had an emotionally codependent relationship. She brought out the worst in me emotionally. She also lied about me to some of my closest friends and almost ruined some of my most valued friendships for good. I became depressed while I was with her.

I cut things off entirely with her a few weeks ago. This was during summer break. Now we are back at school, and with the amount of mutual friends we have, I end up seeing her a lot, but **never** talk to her. 

I recently started getting what I can only describe as vomit-inducing anxiety attacks at even the thought of her. 

If I think of her, my stomach begins to burn and I feel anxious and am unable to calm myself. 

If somebody brings her up in a conversation or I see her, the burning becomes all consuming and I feel this unstoppable urge to vomit. I can feel it in my throat. I’ve never actually thrown up, however I’ve had to call my mom to pick me up from school twice now because of it.

I get the same feeling even seeing people I know associate themselves with her. 

They say it’s not a problem until it starts to affect your ability to function normally and I’ve definitely reached that point. It’s constant. My grades are failing, I’m getting in trouble with my teachers, my relationships with my family and friends are suffering, and it’s holding me back from being happy.

I’ve always been able to solve my problems on my own, and I’ve admittedly got very good at it. But this is one thing I cannot fix myself. I can’t even figure out what the source of this feeling is. I’ve never had an form of anxiety before, I’m a very confident and outgoing person and I’ve always been in control of my emotions.

I’m at a complete loss here, I haven’t been able to find anything through research online.

TL;DR: I got involved with a girl. She ruined my life and I became depressed. I cut her out of my life, but I still see/hear about her due to school and mutual friends. I’ve starting having vomit-inducing anxiety attacks at the thought/sight/sound of her. They’ve become all consuming in my life. I’m completely lost.

I do plan on telling my parents and entering therapy, however not before I’m able to put a name to whatever this is. I’d be incredibly grateful for any sort of guidance. Thank you.",15Aug2018,2,

I say that because I've been to professionals and my head doctor says it's worth noting but that I'm coping really well, and because of how some people have it way worse than I do.

And yet I have this persistent feeling like I'm just not tuned in enough on what's going on in front of me to be as sharp as I could be.  Like many cascading things that go wrong in my day to day life, or places where I just don't perform as well as I believe I could, are the result of just not being totally 'there'.

22,"This might be normal but I'm going to write it here anyway just to check.  (15 yr old male)

I feel like I have some memory and concentration problems. I can't remember things at all, when I try to recall a specific event it takes quite a while for me to think about it and I cant visualize or describe it, and I can tell that what I do remember has quite a few gaps in it. For example, my pet ferret died on Friday last week (pls no pity comments), and I can't properly remember what she looked like even though I spent hours every day looking after her. I think my memories are now all based on pictures and videos. 

I also can't recall words when I need them. like if I tried to make a joke I knew that there was a word perfect for it but I wouldn't be able to communicate it.

I cannot concentrate properly either.

This might help so I'll write it. In school I'm doing good in maths, science and multimedia related subjects but I'm going badly in english, I also did a test (called a morrisby test) that said that I should be doing great in English. Im not concentrating in any of my subjects except multimedia.

My brother is slowly becoming more and more paranoid that the police are after him. It started when he began to think that information was being circulated around to his boss (because he posted online things about smoking weed occasionally, unreasonable but innocent fears) . A while later and he began to think his house was being broken into. He'd point out little papers with writing or doodles on it from many years ago and claim that someone was putting these to mess with him. This all climaxed to recently when he said my house was broken into. He called me and frantically said I was in danger and that my home was trashed. When I came home, the house was fine, but he pointed out random items that I had that he hadn't seen before.

I didn't really expect to see anything happening to my generation, but it seems like it's almost a reflection of their history. I'm seriously worried about his health, but I've tried to explain to him what he sees as ""proof"" for these break-ins is irrational and he is just so certain. 

What can I do? 
Also what do I do if I find that I'm starting to develop these sort of symptoms? It's common in my family, so how do I recognize if I'm becoming such paranoid?

25,"On the one hand I feel bad for him—that he feels the need to make up these lies to be more interesting but on the other hand I feel mad that he’s told me all of these useless lies. He’s lied about his family, famous people he knows, life experiences etc. I’ll talk about a random topic and he has a lie to go with it. In the interest of his mental health what’s the best way to go about this situation?",15Aug2018,1,
26,"So for my whole childhood I was emotionally neglected due to having an older sibling with fairly severe medical problems and the neglect only stopped when I ended up in a psychiatric hospital just after I turned 16 and they basically parented me until I left at 18 a couple of months ago. That's all known about by my mental health team and I've talked through that stuff but something's been bugging me the past few weeks and I wanted to see what you guys think about it because I don't know whether to bring it up with my therapist or not. When I was 6 or 7, I lost my virginity completely consensually with another girl who was the same age (we were classmates). That in itself never particularly affected me but what I've been thinking about is:

How did I know that much about sex?

Like even some teenagers still can't tell the difference between a vagina and an asshole but I knew that much about sex when I was 6? I remember knowing what a vagina was and I knew about the penetration and everything.

Then, at the age of 11/12 I started getting into talking to much older men online and a load of stuff that I won't go into but it never weirded me out in the way it would to a more normal 12 year old. And that continued right up until 16 when the hospital found out.

But what I'm getting at is, surely I must have been sexually assaulted in some way to explain that? Or am I overreacting? ",15Aug2018,3,
27,"My sister once mentioned that her husband doesn’t “believe in depression.” Apparently he just thinks whoever’s “depressed” is just lazy and doesn’t want to do anything, which is incredibly ignorant. This strikes me as a red flag honestly, because they have 4 children and if they grow up to have serious mental problems he wouldn’t be any help at all. And the way my sister talked about this stroke me in a weird way - she also asked our sisters if they “believed depression was real” as if it’s some weird conspiracy or theory. As if it’s something you just “believe” rather than an actual mental illness people have studied for centuries. As if it’s *not an established fact that depression is very much real.*

Hearing this (and many other ignorant tweets regarding Demi Lovato’s overdose - claiming *addiction* is a choice) made me think about how little awareness mental health has at all.  A lot of people are incredibly ignorant on mental illnesses and mental health in general. It’s pretty sad that a lot of people don’t realize that mental illnesses are real and harmful - if someone actually had the choice to “just be happy” then they wouldn’t have a mental illness to begin with. People with bipolar disorder literally never chose to have manic or depression phases. They *literally can not control those things.* It’s also stupid how these people will go on rants about how they think “mental disorders are a choice” as if they’re actually educated on the subject. Back on Demi Lovato’s overdose, I’ve seen *so* many people on Twitter say shit like, “I don’t feel sorry for addicts. They chose that lifestyle” or “addiction is a choice.” There are also lots of people that are *aware* of mental illnesses, but don’t understand them at all. For example, almost everyone is aware that OCD exists, but you’ll rarely meet anyone that can actually tell you how the disorder manifests itself and how it affects its sufferers.

Anyways, that was just my thoughts on mental health awareness. What my brother in law thinks got me thinking about how uneducated people are on mental illnesses in general and I wanted to share my thoughts on it. ",15Aug2018,132,
28,Was in a depressed state of mind for the majority of 2014-2015 due to the death of a friend. And I recently had a friend take her own life last year and it triggered a lot of anxiety in my life after (today). Does anyone who have Anxiety and Depression or just One of them want to give their opinion about what’s harder to deal with? For me it’s Anxiety.,15Aug2018,2,
29,"I struggle sometimes with the idea that my anxiety and depression are real. Sometimes it feels like mental health problems are a first-world problem that people just made up to feel sorry for themselves. The fact that it seems to be a relatively new epidemic fits with this. This is true especially for illnesses without a lot of really clear symptoms (symptoms like psychosis) or those that can be easily dismissed as ""sadness"" or ""nervousness"". To be clear, I really don't think mental health issues are made up, but when I'm feeling low I start doubting it, and believe I should just ""pull myself together"" like they did in the old days ... But I can't so I feel even worse. 

I read something about how in the past PTSD was called ""the horrors"", ""shellshock"" or even ""haunted by ghosts"" and it made me think.  Similarly people with poor mental health were  ""possessed by demons"" or ""hysterical"".

Knowing more about the history might help because it demonstrates that mental problems have been around for a long time, before we even had words for them. It's just the definition, diagnosis and treatments that have improved in recent years. 

So... Does anyone know any good books (or TV programmes, podcasts etc) on the history of mental health ?",15Aug2018,2,
30,"So I’m on 100mg of Sertraline (Zoloft) a day, and whilst nearly every aspect of my life has improved, sex has taken a bit of a tumble, the main problem being inorgasmia. Getting aroused isn’t a problem, I just can’t finish. 

Sex drive in general has decreased, but I’m even more frustrated now than I was before. Was considering viagra or cialis, I’ve read up and as far as I can tell there are no interactions to worry about, but I can’t find many peoples’ experiences, does anyone here have any advice? ",15Aug2018,3,

 your eyes meet mine but they see more
 and I am suddenly  consumed by fear that you see my blackened soul for what it is
 it begins again I almost speak
 but I cut my tongue  on the corners of my words
 that dont have the courage to leave my mouth
 the angst of you
 laughing
 leering
 mocking me
 consumes my tortured mind
 I look away
 and I stand there alone
 in a room of people feeling like I am nothing
 the heavy blackened bones that hold my flesh
 suddenly feel overwhelmingly tired
 dont let your demons
 make your heavenly body

32,"Context: I suffer from BPD and OCD

""Whoah. You're just overreacting and being too emotional."" - Like bitch really? I can't tell by the fact that I have an anxiety attack that I can't stop, thank you for being so fucking caring!

Maybe I should walk up to a person on a wheelchair struggling to maybe cross a road or something and instead of offering help just tell the person ""Whoah. You don't have legs"" LIKE REALLY? IS THAT HOW YOU TREAT PEOPLE?
DO YOU THINK MENTAL ILLNESS HAS A SWITCH? 

You know what's painful? When you're recovering and you're very well aware of what you're doing and how your brain is fucking you over. And then someone tells you to just stop your brain from fucking you over. Wow, really helpful. Go tell a stab victim they need to explain to their internal organs that they need to stop bleeding.

This hurts so much. Especially from family. Everyone, please cherish your social circle - your friends who support you and who you can support back. It's priceless and necessary to nurture these relationships. Otherwise you might end up having to rely for compassion and help on some people of the above kind.

33,"It's been 7 months since I was in a psyce ward after my 2nd psycotic break. 2 months after that I had my 3rd breakdown where I even ended up in jail for a quick stint (I'm lucky that it won't effect my criminal record since I'd been clean till that point). I was on debilitating medications for 4 months that numbed me and made it hard to get invested in anything.

I am a stand up comedian and was on my way to having it as a career. I still have the hour of good clean material I've developed over the last 5 years but I was getting pretty consistent work before these breaks (that has dissipated since I had to turn a lot of stuff down during the breaks). I was also the type that would write a new 5 minutes every week. 

Since these breaks I don't have my wit, I don't have my creative juices, and the time on stage that I used to value so much feels hollow. I haven't been able to find any material for the last 7 months. I'm not myself and I don't feel connected to anyone. Part of me feels like I don't trust my perception because of all the wrong things my mind came up with so instinctually and I've lost my own trust to react naturally.

That said. I have brief moments where I feel myself making good, funny and quick decisions.  I would even doubt whether I was even good at stand up but quickly I figured out that my material alone was very strong even without being ""on"".

 I am about to be in a small local film as the main villain in a historical satire horror film and playing this character has reminded me of the talents I had before things went downhill. I was one of the top people in a pretty big comedy scene and I'm hoping I can find myself a little bit with this ridiculous silly character I've developed. It may not help me gain material but hopefully it will sitimulate my silly side and get myself back on track.",15Aug2018,3,
34,"It may be strange to think of them as close friends, but I feel like without them I’ll be empty, or missing something in my life. They’re emotions that are tied so deeply to me ever since a very young age. Now the more I think about them, the more they seem they’ve been holding my hand like protectors all through the trauma and hurt of existence.
Does anyone feel similarly or something? Am I the only one who feels this way?",15Aug2018,2,
35,,15Aug2018,0,
36,"I just have this urge inside me to make myself feel bad, and almost everything I do revolves around it. I actively deprive myself of sleep hoping I damage my wellbeing, try to make myself sick, purposely starve myself at times, self harm, isolate myself from my friends and socialisation, try to push my loving parents away so that they might stop caring about and trying to help me, completely disregard school when I was once a high achiever. I also force myself to think negatively, like remind myself that I'm depressed or that I'm shit.

All of this is while I'm fully conscious and mostly self aware, and I've started to realise how inauthentic and 'fake' I might have been, which just makes me feel so pathetic and useless and leaves me with nothing to do. If I do something good for myself against this urge (like sleep early), I feel no fulfiment, just empty and like I'm ruining all my 'progress' towards suffering. But if I do something bad for me, then all I can think of is how much of a poser and attention seeker I am, romanticising things that other people genuinely struggle with.

Sometimes I fantasise about having worse life circumstances or even like a disease. Recently, I read quite a bit about borderline personality disorder, and my irrational self immediately started to wish I had it, as if it would validate how pathetic I am. But when I mentioned that to my psychologist he said that he hasn't seen any evidence of it, making me realise how fake all my actions and thoughts about myself are, I'm just a pretender.

I'm not sure if it has anything to do with my self image or identity, a lot of the times it feels like this is a movie, and I'm part of the audience watching it and I'm trying to make myself feel pity or sympathy for this character (myself) who is suffering on screen. Maybe for this reason I often like to be dramatic about and romanticise my suffering, but I don't know what to do about it.

Previously I thought that maybe I was trying to damage my mental state until I would finally commit suicide, something that feels inevitable.
I just don't know what to do anymore, and the only certainty I have is suicide.",15Aug2018,3,

38,"hey so i don't know if this is the right sub to post this in but it's related to mental health so maybe... I'll happily delete though if it violates any rules because I'm not sure...

But anyway, the other day I ran out of weed and for the first time in months I couldn't really afford to buy more. Since not smoking even just for a couple of days my mood has dropped dramatically - I've gone from feeling mostly numb but coping a lot better to just feeling so depressed. I want to go to bed early at nights which is abnormal for me but I have no motivation to do anything else. I was working on something I've been really enjoying lately but last night I just gave up and sat doing nothing until I could justify going to sleep without my S/O thinking it was strange. 

I can't focus on anything and my head feels so jumbled and I honestly hate being sober so much because I can't control my mind. I had a holiday booked off from work today but I cancelled it because my other plans got cancelled and I'd rather sit in work and have to be sober than sit at home with nothing I have to do and let my mind take over.

Maybe this is all just withdrawal kind of symptoms and it'll get better in a few days but I'm really not coping at the moment and I don't know what to do and I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced a similar thing? ",15Aug2018,1,

42,"I'm 22 and was diagnosed with ADHD this year, which being medicated for and finally understanding has improved my life immensely. 

However, my ADHD meds agitate my panic attack type anxiety sometimes, despite always decreasing my general anxiety. 
I also have a lot of depression and PTSD issues, dissociation, derealization, and intrusive thoughts (possibly partial OCD?) . 

So when things get really bad, I have a panic attack that lasts hours until I either fall asleep or longer if I can't or it's during the day, up and down and sometimes if I'm lucky all the way down and absent for a week or so. 

The triggers are as follows: pretty much anytime I'm alone or sometimes even around other people, and not fully distracted, I end up taking the usual ambient/not quite white noise of the house, and imagining that my parents are talking about me. 
Even if one of them isn't home, I imagine it's on the phone. 

So when I imagine it, and since they're very... Dissaproving of my lifestyle and pretty much all of my life choices, constantly invalidating me and making me feel like no matter what I do I'm never good enough (yeah the PTSD I mentioned is from them), the things I imagine them thinking about me becomes what I imagine theyd be saying about me.

When I do that, I get even more anxious, and my brain becomes obsessed with the thought that they wouldn't just possibly be saying these things, the must actually be saying them . Then I begin imagining the conversations they're having, the anxiety and ptsd making my obsessive and intrusive thoughts create an internal dialogue separate from my internal monologue, that feels entirely real.

Since there's plenty of ambient noise, always, all the time, it's very hard for me to separate the logical and rational knowledge that they aren't actually saying these things, from the hyperemotional, extremely real feeling that they are. 

I know for a fact I'm not hearing voices, like in a psychosis way, but my panic attacks almost always bring on full on terror, and feeling of immenent threat from worst case scenarios. 

I try listening to music, or distracting myself, but a lot of the time it doesn't work. 

A big part of it is the knowledge that they believe I'm an addict because both my parents were so I by default must be. I've been told this since 6 years old. I have done nothing to indicate I am one and actively try to display that I'm not. 

But I had an accident when I was first perscribed medication for my ADHD, and took way too much because my doctor told me to take it as needed and get a feel for the appropriate dosage. 

This, combined with extreme sleep deprivation, resulted in a full blown episode of hallucinations and the most terrifying ""every worst fear I have is going to and is already coming true I'm gonna die"" panic attacks of my life. 

They decided this meant I abused my meds, ones I'd never been on and had no set dose for. 

From there on out I've become convinced, by anxious panic attack after panic attack that not only must they constantly talking about me behind my back, but they also must hate me and be planning on doing whatever they can to gather evidence to send me to a rehab clinic, high security inpatient ward, jail, or find a way to take my meds or find a way to make me lose my perscription. 

Which would be a disaster, being medicated has improved my life drastically. 

So I know I have a lot of irrational fears but like I really don't know how far my parents would be willing to go. Security cameras? Looking through my meds? Searching my room? 
My stepdad bought a thermal camera recently, idk if he'd go so far as to use that too but I really don't know what to trust. 

Any ideas on getting this to happen less and making it calm down faster when it does?

47,"So... to understand this you need to hear a little bit of what happened in my life.

I told 3 people about my issues. At first, it was good to be able to vent, but: Sometimes I hurt myself with it. Maybe because I felt I was a burden, or felt they didn't care about me....

The worst thing is: I became co-dependent and I damaged some relationships... to put it simple: I hurt other with it and I don't want others to feel bad about me because of my problems.

2 of these people are still my friends, but the third... I sent a very direct message (might have been a little bit of a bad decision on my part) saying how I just can't live with this.

She texted 'I don't know what to say' and went off. From that point on I believed that she hated me or that she thought I was faking it, because she'd always ask me when she noticed that something was wrong and she never texted so little... maybe it was too mich for her, but I just couldn't ask her.

We didn't text much anymore and didn't talk much anymore. I did the wrong decision: Starting to hate her. Of course, I only realized my mistake a month later and now... it can't really be fixed anymore.

And here's the problem: I've grown close to a new friend and she noticed that sonething's wrong and said that I could tell her everything.

Should I? I don't want to make anything worse by telling her about my problems

TL;DR: I managee to make some things in my life worse by telling others about my problems. A new friend said that I could tell her anything but I'm scared.

50,"Will try to be as linear as possible. As long as I can remember i cannot remember before age 10. I knew life was traumatic in those days but I didnt know all. Lifelong apprehensions about visiting the core members of the family. Family trying to keep me away from certain cousins, especially one. Nobody ever said why. Not once. 

Decades pass with myself interacting with the cousins, never thinking anything of it. The 2 cousins would always ask if I remember a 3rd boy. They would say his name. They have said his name at least 100 times. I can not remember that boy or his name to this day. if they said it today I would block it out tomorrow.

So, Grandmother passed away. After funeral, talking about old times with the cousins mother, my aunt, I say,""Dont you remember that time I slammed his head into the pile of bricks?' She looked right at me and said, ""no. he slammed your head. it was really bad. they were just terrible to you.""

I was really confused. How did I flip a memory like that? A couple of days later, one of the cousins, the meanest of them all, said to me, ""hey do you remember when you used to suck my dick?""

I froze. Complete total brain freeze. I couldnt speak, think or react. He saw and he grew cautious, no doubt ready to defend himself in a fight after what he said. He said ""I shouldnt have said that."" All I could say was , ""No you shouldnt have.' shook my head and walked away. We had just buried our Grandmother and I didnt know how to deal with such a statement.

Now, over a year later, that info keeps circulating in my mind, with fractured memories of him as a boy, a very very aggressive impossible to control violent little monster. The kind adults try to restrain and he keeps pushing forward. The impossible kid no one wants around.

The other cousin I can recall at age 18...we got into a scuffle at the lake. He said 'Dont make me do you like we did when were kids."" It meant nothing at the time but now...

I dont understand how a mind can reverse memories, be unable to store repeated info about the memories (the boy I cant recall), and be able to spend time around abusers with absolutely no emotional reactions at all, even after the things that were said...Im angry because I know I should be as man. Ive been disrespected and I come from ppl you dont disrespect so..I know Im supposed to be angry...but i genuinely feel nothing at all. No recall, no emotions...its almost like the fractured memories and the statements made are an elaborate decades long prank. It doesnt connect to me really.

 But its real. And I dont understand. There had to be a split. What happened to the boy that split off? How could I think I injured the cousin when it was him that injured me (and worse from his statement)?

51,"Im 22 and male 

I am not well, (ill be talking about drugs and sexual deviancy but please dont assume the drugs were a big part of my life I only took them for a few years now and then so assume any effect of them on me is minimal as i do)

I barley ever get intense paranoia but it comes sometimes, flies are actually cameras, my phone is watching me, my parents are spitting in my food, the very rare voice, maybe once or twice a year I could actually say that is a real voice. I mainly got it in my teens when I took drugs but that makes sense so I dont think about it. I am 22 now so its in the past the worst for the paranoia.

It has been years since I had any of that, after I stopped drugs (mainly cannibis, amphetamine, mcat, alcohol) I would get it now and then a couple of times a year for a few weeks of intensity then nothing, itd vanish though not completely ever but enough to enforce logic upon it. Diminish is the right word. Part of it always stayed, the paranoia, anxiety etc

Idk if drugs made me paranoid and anxious cos i only took them for a few years and not all the time so I doubt it, maybe they sped up what was happening to me though.

Even when I wasnt stoned I wasnt that good, I was never addicted to anything but I still stole from people who pissed me off to get high. I wasnt always off my head on something often I wasnt and that was fine too, So as a teen I started to fall into all manner of things, sexual deviancy, different and wild beliefs trying to find myself. The deviancy itself was very mild back then just like stealing and masturbating in peoples underwear(yeah ik), having sex with men when i didnt want too etc.
But at this time I was still benevolent and good inside thats important as i rationalised my behaviour like that on the occasions I cared about it. Sex taboo wasnt very new to me due to a lot of incest, that didnt stop til I was like 16.


As a teen I believed all sorts of things, switching and switching looking for somewhere to fit in like I mentioned, though as I was falling into deep anxiety about age 16 17, i started writing magic spells and tortured a toad for an anxiety release ritual/spell to releive myself of the pain I was in, ive mentioned this before, though as anxiety got worse and I couldnt truly know what I beleived in I had to shut that door of my life and use logic to live out my life because I couldnt believe in it without believing in eveeything so I didmt want to go insane, i parted with my imaginary friend at that time as well.

Just to be clear id never do that again

Though now I say to myself none of that was real and i think I am right, but i want to know for sure but ill just take it easy for now and not try and force myself to beleive in something again, for fitting ins sake or any other sake. Though I do want to re learn about magic and the beleifs I had but only objectively.


So about 18-19 I no longer take drugs at all other than drinking now and then, I enter the working world and the anxiety is too much.
The paranoia was come and go but only petty things like that person is watching me etc so never bothered me. Though id start seeing things like ghosts and stuff but i can easily dismiss it because i have a little bit of amblyopia (lazy eye) and my vision is poor so ik it is my imagination when it happens. I did go through a weird phase of seeing faces in everything but that lasted like a week and it has never happened since

I take to crossdressing (something I did through out my life anyway) as an actual hobby sort of thing in private, it was entirely sexual at first though not anymore.

With that in mind feeling no gratification in life and being lonley from de personalisation and intense anxiety I started looking for more excitement. Like going out at night and following people just to see if i could, though very important, this lasted like a couple of weeks at most when i realised what the fuck I was doing. My anxiety is getting a billion times worse I am crippled. And i have not done that since or ever will again.

20-22 (now)

Alone, confused and not well, my sexual desired evolved over time to some very bad things id never actually do they are just fantasy and its all they will ever be.

I started going out at night to get off find some thrill to escape my stagnation and depression, like masturbating in the filth of church property and climbing into wheelie bins etc to get off as filth became a fetish. It was fun but i hated doing it and got paranoid id get arrested.

My anxiety has been so bad i havnt done that in about a year or 2, i started stealing from work and doing my sexual deviancy with the whole underwear thing i now realise my morals are quite off. ive quit my job due to anxiety and i have been drinking lots and struggle to leave the house, which is good because i wont do anything deviant but i dont really have the desire too now. I do however meet random men online to please sexually for fun and an ego boost. But thats it and im okay, the real problem is the anxiety and depression that is killing my life. 

But I'm writing this today because when i put my headphones on I heard a blurry conversation through them and for a split second i wasnt sure if it was real, obviously its my imagination but it triggered my memories so here we are.

Though just to be clear, the only thing i do now is meet people online for sex


Would love to  hear of anyone can relate as i have yet to find someone like me.

Thank you for taking the time to read.

I need help but i feel like im too fucked up

53,"Hi folks,

This is my first time posting here, so I'll provide some background. We have been dating for almost four years (male + female couple) since end of first year university (both young). We live together as well. At first I thought she just had a general fear of the dark and was bad with scary movies/horror related stuff, but I increasingly realized that the issue runs deeper than that.

It used to be that we just needed to leave lights on around the house at night and make sure to avoid disturbing films, etc, but in the past year or so, after she had her first serious panic attack, it started coming back on occasion.

I've identified four factors that can induce her panic attacks:

1. Darkness + thinking about scary/disturbing imagery she's seen in movies.
2. Being alone for too long + spiraling negative thoughts.
3. Talking about the issue itself and panicking because of thinking about the situation.
4. Large boisterous crowds that cram her and she feels like she can't breathe.

Keep in mind that these factors don't always happen independent of each other, and sometimes they happen in succession or at the same time.

The strange thing is that sometimes she can be in a crowded place and be fine, or be alone or outside in the dark and be okay as well. From time to time we also watch movies with some level of gore, and she is also okay. It comes and goes and depends on her mental state.

The symptoms of her attacks: Ragged and fast breathing, crying, body heats up, numbness that spreads from hands and feet.

Possible root causes: At some level, I am inclined to believe that the source is childhood trauma, since she mentioned she was already fearful of scary things, coupled with her strict upbringing (sometimes she'll get locked in a dark room as punishment), it's no surprise it has some impact on her psyche overall.

I guess my question is, how would I go about identifying what disorder it is? Why does it happen on and off? What therapist can she go to for help? What can I do, as a bf to better help improve her situation? I live in Toronto, so if you have recommendations, fire them my way.

TL;DR: GF had some childhood trauma and is scared of darkness, crowds, scary imagery, and prone to spiraling negativity. This causes panic attacks. What disorder is this, and how can I help?",15Aug2018,0,

I've had a handful in my adult life and some have been great and others were all about basic questions and paper handouts. I hate the task of explaining myself and thought processes all over again, mostly because I'm self-aware and the discovery side of things doesn't have to be that intense, it's more about how to be in touch with my emotions about it and go from there.

58,"Hi. I love doing introspective work... I always do it as a matter of fact and it's kinda unhealthy/obsessive a bit.

 Anyway, in this post I actually want to talk about something else that I don't know if I can directly link with mental health or anything, but it has affected my life deeply (i haven't been diagnosed, seen a therapist etc)

Now that I'm older and see things differently because I've learned about mental health and other stuff, these events in my childhood and some repeating patterns suddenly stood out. 

When I was little, 7-8 years old, I always felt alone. I used to be a bold child but never had many friends, everyone seemed to distance themselves at some point in the sense that yes, they liked me, but only distantly, just as a classmate.

 I remember this one time when we were getting back from the kids theater with the class, we were in the buss, i was standing up, my left hand on the bar to not fall and just thought to myself that I felt so alone, that no one really liked me and I couldn't form any deep connection. I just felt really out of place and weird. I felt far away. 

 I felt really disconnected and just alone... I don't know how else to put it, it felt like those hopeless sighs when you just accept your situation, you know? 

I suddenly remembered this and I think it's a pretty.. Out of place thought for a kid at 8ish years old.

I used to think like this a lot and think other things too, everyone described me as too mature for my age, but was it really that, I don't know.

Right now I'm struggling with self-esteem issues and social anxiety and I've looked back to see that it gradually built up to now where it's at its peak and it just sucks. 

I can't even deal with it anymore to the point of headaches when I'm with a group of people I'm not close with, I feel pressure all the time at college and i can't even be myself and be free.

There's also this feeling of ""oh wow so this is life... This is my house... This is me..."" and it's weird, cause i feel so removed. It's a sudden realization that I get sometimes. It feels really weird like ""i am really here"" like someone else has just awakened within and is seeing the world for the first time.

All the time I feel removed. I space out when with others, just like I did as a child. 

I guess this is just a public introspection, I'd appreciate your thoughts and experiences.

Trying to sort things out alone is really bothersome and even more confusing so that's why I'm posting here in the first place. 


Thanks.

59,"My question is if this situation warrants therapy for my friend.

I've been friends with a girl for about 1.5 years, and I would say best friends after she moved into my apartment for a few months and we bonded over talking about our shared significant childhood abuse situations. I'd say we have been best friends for about a year now, and she eventually moved out of my apartment into a shared apartment with her boyfriend of three years.

The issue is he yells at her. A lot, loudly, in public, in private. We were in the middle of a restaurant sharing dinner with another friend and he burst out yelling and calling her stupid because she didn't back up a lie he was telling and told the truth instead. He has a short fuse. She claims this doesn't happen often, but every time I hang out with them it happens. Sometimes I bring it up after the fact and she has forgotten (seems genuine) that it happened.

I brought this up to her the other day and she said my presence made him nervous which made him angry, and so he yells more when I'm present. I don't think this situation is healthy and she should go to therapy? Thoughts?",15Aug2018,1,

I spent the next 12 hours ruminating over that interaction, and fearing I may have ruined whatever acquaintance we had. Naturally, I didn't, but it has happened every time I have seen her since. And this happens with nearly every interaction in my life lately. 

I have lost a lot of friends because of my depression. I know I have been a downer and over time people don't want to spend as much time with me.

This is sort of a cry for help. My wife spiraled into severe depression after she had a hair dying go bad (it’s really not that bad but to her it’s the worst thing in the world). For the past 3 days she has been bed ridden, refuses to eat, constantly crying, and just can’t do life. Which is troublesome because we have a toddler, and she is 6 months pregnant. 

She received Zoloft from her previous doctor but refuses to take it because she doesn’t want to risk the newborn having withdrawals. I understand that but I feel like not eating and being severely depressed my have worse consequences. 

To get her to see someone to talk to, Kaiser requires HER to call in and schedule an appointment. Well that’s not going to happen. I’m considering just getting someone to fake act like her just so we can get an appointment set up.

Should I look into having a therapist come to our home and talk to her? At what point is immediate action needed? I don’t know what to do.

64,"One of my best friends was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in college. He had a significant psychotic episode then and ended up homeless for a while, but eventually he was sent to a psych ward and put on meds. He got back on his feet, graduated, got a good job, and then began to live a fairly normal life, which is about the time I met him (4 years ago). 

Over the past year and a half, however, I’ve watched him go from an extremely charming, clever, fun, sensitive, well-adjusted man to a completely unstable one. Im pretty sure he stopped taking his meds, and instead has been self-medicating with copious amounts of alcohol and caffeine pills. He lost his job and is now living on unemployment, but buys hoards of shoes, movies, furniture, decoration, and security equipment over the internet. He doesn’t shower or leave the house. 

The last time I visited him, he was drunk at 11am, the house was a wreck, and he had puppets strung up in various places around the house because “they protect the microphones.” He had also bought and was tinkering with some sort of radio/police scanner type thing that he said was for protection when the world ends. I tried to take him to the grocery store with me, he meowed the whole car ride there and talked to the car (as in, “no car, you can’t go now, it’s a red light”). 

To make matters worse, he’s convinced himself he’s in love with me. We dated briefly when we first met, and apparently he had taken audio recordings of us having sex — he recently told me he listens to them all the time, as well as YouTube videos of women who look like me. 

I’ve had my own history with mental illness and spent some time in a psych ward myself, so I know how much it sucks. I’ve tried to convince him to get help, but obviously it’s hard to reason with him at this point. 

Is there anything I can do to force him to get help? I know you’re not technically allowed to “force” people into hospitalization unless they’re a danger to themselves or others, but I can see him getting worse and worse and I want to interfere before he DOES become a danger to himself or others.

Ever since about Primary 6 (10 or 11 years old) I’ve not been feeling as upbeat as I usually am or in tune at all with anything, and it feels like someone else is controlling me. Obviously no one is, but it feels like my actions aren’t mine and it’s really been fucking with me as of late. I even tried to kill myself.
I told my mum a little about my feelings, but not a lot as I really don’t like opening up about nearly anything to anyone about this stuff.

I have only learned after leaving that they’re known for being horrible with helping people, and that they only help if you are going to kill yourself and outright say you are going to and it’s disgusting.

I'm also really hating being in a hostel, and my social anxiety is making it very difficult for me to socialise or meet any friends. I don't have any privacy and its chipping away at my psyche quite bad.

76,"**tl:dr** I'm a 27 year old dude struggling with ADHD, depression, and potentially narcolepsy. I""m looking for advice and support on dealing with comorbid conditions.

The backstory:

I've been struggling with symptoms of ADHD, depression, and hypersomnia for as long as I can remember. About 2 years ago I started to seek treatment for ADHD. Since then I've basically gone through a rollercoaster ride of identifying and dealing with mental health issues. I've known about my depression since college but was never on medication. After getting put on Wellbutrin and vyvanse my attention issues got better but then I started to spiral into deep depression. I switched medications a few times but nothing really worked. I asked my pdoc to be put on lamictal as an adjunct last September and it's been the only thing that I think has been consistent and effective. Earlier this year my pdoc suggested I have a sleep study done because of sleepiness during the day despite being on a high dose of dexedrine. The overnight sleep study came back normal, the MSLT(a nap study) showed hypersomnia, but no sleep onset REM (part of the diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy). I'm still suspicious of narcolepsy because of symptoms of cataplexy. I'll need to re-do the sleep studies to see if I get a different result.

Now:

I started taking modafinil on Monday for the sleepiness and I'm coming off the dexedrine. The modafinil seems to be working and I feel like my depression is lifting but I'm getting an uptick of attention issues. It's not surprising since I'm coming off the dexedrine but it's killing my confidence. I feel like I'm just bouncing back and forth through symptoms and can't get a handle on any of them. It's having a huge impact on my and I'm tired and frustrated from trying to work things out and never really making any progress. Funny enough, today has been one of the best days I've had over the past few months.

I'm switching up my meds to an antidepressant that can address my cataplexy symptoms but I'm not sure what I can do about ADHD. I don't want to stick with dexedrine or wellbutrin and would prefer to try something else. Any suggestions on something that's worked for you? or just advice in general.
