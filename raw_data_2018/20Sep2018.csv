0,"I am an 18 year old male. The past 2 or so years i've recognized weird behaviors. When I was 16 years old I began to fall in rot of sleeping everyday after school, through dinner. I started to become very sad with who I was. I gave myself hatred and blamed myself for multiple past mistakes and regrets. During this timed I gained weight and became out of shape, but after striving for it lost the weight gained, Throughout my life i've always tended to live in day dreams. I imagine myself as very successful and recognized and greatly appreciated by others. I also find myself making up scenarios where I have talents I do not have and finding a successful career and family etc. These fantasies often happen while i'm engaged in a different activity. I pace often and when I do pace I am usually brainstorming how I will handle future situations or unrealistic expectations. I find myself doing this most often when I do things like work, exercise etc. But i do this daydream stuff the most when I am anticipating a future event that I am either excited,nervous, or highly anticipating something. It procrastinates me from getting work done. My moods change often. One day I will want to and be more outgoing and talkative but others I feel like being a loner and separate myself from people. I feel as if i'm more closer to people then I actually am e.g past relationships. I will regard myself as a cool confident superior then an hour later I will hate myself. basically my assumption of myself changes often. lately i've been having thoughts that I have no true personality or character. With these feeling I have never had any thoughts of hurting myself. When i'm out with friends or doing something activity I can easily enjoy myself. I don't know if i'm just overreacting and these feelings are common and come with stress etc. If anyone has ideas/suggestions/thoughts It would be extremely helpful because i dont know what this is or how to find out. thank-you, God bless,",20Sep2018,2
1,"I have never experienced anything like this before and I'm really shaken by it. I felt like I was in a perpetual state of having a nightmare but I was awake. Even though my eyes told me that my cat was alive and fine and breathing and not hurt in any way, my brain kept telling me that he was dead and I had killed him. I was hysterical and inconsolable. My boyfriend, who I've been with for 9 years, couldn't even grasp what was going on. I just kept sobbing that I had killed the cat and he kept telling me over and over that the cat was fine and alive but I couldn't grasp it. I really have no idea what happened or why it happened and I'm terrified. All day I've been thinking about the fact 'I've killed my cat' and my boyfriend keeps having to constantly reassure me that I haven't. I know it sounds so stupid because to anyone else it's obvious I haven't killed the cat but my brain refuses to process that. I'm so freaked out by it and even now although my cat is on my bed with me at this moment I still can't grasp the fact he's not dead. I have no idea what to do... I think I'm going into panic mode :(",20Sep2018,2
2,"I don’t want to die, I just feel like what I’m feeling now is so incredibly painful, and literally no one gets it. I try to tell them but they don’t get it - and what’s more is I hate talking to people about my feelings and my

My mum told me today that I just need to ‘snap out of it’, and that I was ruining my life because I’m like this. They honestly don’t understand what I’m feeling - and I can’t tell them. How the fuck do you tell your parents that you think you’re becoming borderline suicidal? 

I’ve been sad loads of times in my life - this is not sadness, this is wayyyy more than that. This is debilitating and consuming. I feel like I’m not suicidal right now, but that it’s so serious that this where it leads.

I feel the urge to attempt suicide, but not so it kills me. I don’t want to die, but I want people to realize how much I’m suffering, and how serious this really is. I want them to stop saying these stupid comments and passing it off as if I’m just sad, or that it will all be fine. 

Everyone talks about people committing suicide for attention as if it’s some stupid thing that people selfishly do. I guess that’s what I want. Attempt suicide for attention. But I don’t think it’s necessarily a selfish or stupid thing to do - it means you are hurting so much, and no one understands, so you want to show people - you want people taking your pain seriously. 

I really don’t know what to do to be honest....",20Sep2018,2
3,"A year and a half ago I was living in a shelter, jobless, a drinker, on and off my meds, begging friends/family/strangers constantly, perpetually broke, smoking, not exercising at all, drinking a lot of sugary soda, and not taking my mental health seriously. I'm sure there's more. My kid had never been in the same school for the entire school year and had been to four schools in two years and was also having major mental health problems. 


Six months ago I started my meds and have taken them consistently since. I quit drinking at the same time. I've had stable housing since May. I worked a temp gig from March to June which helped me land this job I have been working since July. My relationship with my partner has never been better and we got married in August. My chronic pain has improved somewhat and sometimes I can even go for walks on my lunch. I switched to Coke Zero. My relationship with my sister has improved. 


I still am constantly bombarded by all of my past mistakes. I constantly feel like I'm not good enough. After years of not having money, I realized I don't know how to manage money. My husband and I together are middle class and we're still living paycheck to paycheck. I want so badly to quit smoking but I have zero willpower. I spend too much time reading on the internet, frequently about how to improve my life, but I don't do any of it. I want to exercise more so I can lose weight. It isn't for appearance but because losing weight would significantly decrease my pain level. I want to stop drinking caffeine so I am less anxious. I want to spend more quality time with my daughter. I want to read more so I can slowly work my way through my ""to read"" list.


Even though I am significantly better, I feel like a failure. I feel guilty. I feel like giving up.


I'm sure this could be worded better, but I'm super upset right now. I came home from work, flopped down on my bed and cried myself to sleep. I'm miserable. I want to be a completely different person, but it's like I everything to improve tomorrow and if that doesn't work I have failed.",20Sep2018,4
4,"I started university classes again and was hoping that I could get free counseling. I do, but I had my first intake appointment and the counselor tells me that they are so busy that I would only get to be seen every 2 weeks and that it is more of a short-term arrangement. My health insurance is ending soon and I am living on student loans. 

My intake appointment reminded me that i really need to get some type of regular, intensive therapy. 

What can I do to help myself in the meantime without having to go to therapy? I've been pretty miserable lately (for the past 10 years).

Thanks in advance.",20Sep2018,3
5,"Hey all,

I have been dealing with anxiety, depression, and obsessive thoughts. A little bit of background, my dad's side of the family has a history of depression and my symptoms only really surfaced within the last year because of a horrible relationship I went through. 

One of my obsessive that plagues me is if I am capable of love and concern. In the past I have certainly shown these things. When my grandfather passed away in 2005, I was incredibly sad, yet when my other grandfather died just this last christmas, I was not as affected that much, at least not a severely when I lost my other one. Another instance I remember is when my best friend was rejected from the college he wanted to go to. He was so upset that I immediately went over to comfort him. Another example was that I have shown concern over my parents weight and want them to slim down for their own health. 

But lately, I don't know if I am able, or I am possessive and lonely instead of loving. I mainly introverted, and I like to have time to myself, but I sometimes look to be with my family because I feel guilty that I am not spending enough time with them. To clarify, I love my family and we have spent quality time together every now and then, I am simply talking about day to day interaction that I force. I also have these doubts about how I would react if I found out if anyone I care about died, would I be sad, would I be accepting, or would I be apathetic? The introverted aspect of it all is concerning to me because I don't know if I value my close friends because they are awesome people and we came together naturally or because I value the fact that we are ""friends"". I also had this inner fight concerning my ex, whether I truly loved her or I was just lustful/lonely/desperate (she was my first serious relationship). I also tried to help her when she was suffering, but again I don't know if that was me genuinely caring for HER or just some stupid valiance/protection/paladin fantasy.

I also find myself worrying if I relate to the incel/neckbeard/niceguy community because they all seem so desperate/bitter and I don't want to become those callous assholes but I can't help but find myself relating to some of the emotions they are going through. 

I have also found that when I have talked to others on here, I don't know if I am genuinely trying to help them or I am just trying to show off/give unsolicited advise, because it feels like all of these motivations at the same time. The karma system does not work because I find myself anxiously checking if the people I have talked to have replied to me and given me feedback/validation (like when I try to text people, this was cranked up to 11 concerning my ex so there may be some correlation)

Thank you for listening and sorry for the long post, if this were 9gag I'd give you a potato (probably just saying I go on 9gag will get me lynched XD, this community does not seem like that though)",20Sep2018,2
6,"Recently I have been doing nothing but thinking. Despite all of the thoughts and ideas I think up, I can't ever bring myself to speak. My friends have observed that I'm not my normal self and I find myself going full days avoiding seeing people and remaining silent, but always thinking. After a while, as you can imagine, this all begins to build up. Today while driving home I experienced the effects of such buildup in the form of unstoppable and inexplicable crying. This has led me here, wondering if any of you have experienced a similar situation, and looking for any help or advice on how i should deal with my current state. Any input greatly appreciated.",20Sep2018,2
7,"I feel guilty even feeling suicidal. I have a great fiance, nice home, and am almost done with a super difficult but rewarding grad program. Mental health issues run in my family (addiction, BPD, bipolar) and I have generalized anxiety disorder. I will NOT hurt myself, but why do I imagine how I could painlessly die and leave my loved ones with the least pain as possible? I think I may be sick. I did have two glasses of wine. Could it be alcohol? That's not very much, but I'd like to blame it on something. If anything, I think it may have made me open up more and ask for help because I feel this way frequently and don't drink often at all. I feel very guilty for posting this as some people may be actually considering suicide. DON'T DO IT, reach out to me if you need support. I'm just very uncomfortable with these thoughts. I am incredibly high functioning. Just passed my boards, actually. I have an unsolved death case with my father and my mom and sister are mentally ill. I have an extreme pressure to provide answers and help for them on top of succeeding for myself. It's a hard act to juggle. I'm looking for a counselor, and being proactive. Recently getting engaged brought up SO many feelings of grief I have put off for almost ten years. I'm very educated in grief and psychology, I get that. I need some out of the box, personal advice please. Like I said, I am seeking help. Maybe just some empathetic feelings of how other people haven't conventionally gone through grief like me. I put it off for so long! My father died in 2010 and I'm just now entering the anger phase! I think it grew stronger with time! I'm just looking for anyone that can relate. Like I said, I'm a professional in the field and understand the stages. I'm looking for someone else who hasn't experienced them sequentially or is in the same stage as me.

8,"I just lost a really old friend of mine due to a stupid missed text... along with her not being able to deal with me anymore, which was suspicion I had for a while with other friends I lost. 

We had reconnected earlier this year.  I was terrified of losing her so I tried to be upfront and told her my brain has been having a wonky year, and sometimes now and then there will be a few weeks where I'm not myself, but because it's a cycle I perk back up eventually.  I let her know there will be a few days where I can't commit to plans because they seem terrifying...I told her I have trouble remembering things too... sometimes I hate myself and can't even shower. And she reassured me saying she understands because she gets anxious too sometimes. 

I shouldn't have got my hopes up. Don't know why i'm ranting on reddit...I feel like can't even say what I want to.

9,"My boyfriend (22) and I (22F) have been together almost a year and he believes he has been suffering from depression for several years now. Sometimes he seems very withdrawn and other times he seems fine. There were a few times a few months ago where I stayed up with him late at night, holding him while he sobbed for no reason. I have talked to him about going to a therapist and he says that he does not want to talk about it, nor can he afford it. Sometimes I feel like it is my responsibility to support him emotionally, and I feel upset when I can't make him feel better. This past week basically all he has done is sleep. He has overslept and missed several college classes, but after the classes that he attends he just goes to sleep again. I haven't heard from him much at all this week which is very rare for us because we usually always communicate throughout the day. I am going through some personal stuff and I really need him to be here for me right now and he isn't because he is just so depressed.

10,"My husband's friend committed suicide today and it made me want to share my story and to show that there is always light at the end of the tunnel, even though it is really hard to see. I had battled with lots of mental health illnesses between the age of 16-22ish. This included anorexia, depression, and self harm. I am now 24 years old and would say I'm much better now.

I grew up with a the typical Asian 'tough love' culture where my family never expressed our emotions or feelings but showed love in other ways such as mum cooking us food and paying for things we owned. Mental health was definitely not recognised amongst my parent's generation, their go to solution was to toughen up or just stop crying.. I'm not saying my parent's didn't try to help me but they didn't know how to, and I masked all my mental health illnesses so well that they thought I was okay most of the time, when I definitely wasn't. 

It started when I was 15 years old, it was school holiday break and I didn't have many hobbies. I started falling into the trap of anorexia nervosa, it wasn't because I wanted to be skinny. There was no real trigger for it, but I believe it was because I was so bored that I had nothing to focus on, and focusing on restricting my calories because an addiction. I got addicted to the scale, I measured my weight about every hour of the day. I also swam everyday for an hour and ended up losing about 12kgs within two weeks, couldn't stand up without fainting, hair falling out, not getting my period for years. My parents just told people that I've been exercising a lot and that's why I'm so skinny now. They knew that I wasn't eating as much as usual, but didn't know to what extent as we didn't eat dinner together. My secret was wrapping the food up in tissue balls and shoving it into my pockets, then flushing it down the toilet.

When school started again, everyone commented on how good I looked after losing all that weight. This only fuelled the demon further into restricting my food consumption. This all back fired within a few months which resulted in a binge-starve cycle. I didn't know what was happening to me, I wasn't educated and my parents just didn't comment as they were so happy to see me eating... I would eat so much I couldn't move, then the next day starve myself to make up for it. This was so torturous and only led me into a further deeper hole of depression and suicidal. I didn't want to share anything with anyone and kept it all to myself. It was so bad I wanted to end my life for months but didn't know how. At that time Tumblr community was really famous.. Some of you may know how toxic the Tumblr community was with the self harm and depressing reblogs which led me to trying out self harm. The first time I tried self harm, it felt so good and I couldn't explain why.. Where I was from was quite cold, so I always wore long sleeves to hide my cuts. It was so bad that the dried blood would stick to the fabric of my clothes, that feeling never goes away, even to this day.. All my friends and family never bat an eye because on the outside I would be so bubbly and continuously laughing, as this is me by nature.

I ended up dropping out of high school because I hated it. I was surprised I got into a course at my local University/College with my grades not being the best (average of C). Starting fresh was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I was 16, young, no idea what I was going to do with life but I got into a Food Science course. I was so surprised my parents let me go! I think it was because my older brother was at Uni and they'd think he'd take care of me. Going to uni let me isolate myself from society furthermore as no one knew me and everyone was a stranger, it sounds somber but I really enjoyed it, I loved just being a nobody. My favourite thing to do was to find small nooks and libraries that would have hardly any people and stay there all day. Uni was extremely hard, because I skipped a year of high school and I was in the same courses as students who were trying to get into Medicine. It was so hard I would go to classes from 9am-4pm then go home or to a library and study for another 4 hours as I was so worried of failure. I studied so hard that I ended up getting top of Chemistry amongst the students trying to get into Med School (lol it was a real shock) and my average GPA was A. I think I was so focused on passing that my starve/binge cycle and depression was almost gone because my brain had something else to focus on. I met some really amazing friends during the second semester of that first year.  I'm still friends with to this day, I don't think they know this side of me but they really helped me get back onto my feet in terms of socialising. Having said this, I was still cutting all throughout uni because of that euphoric feeling I got of release once it happened.. Once the cutting stopped everything came crashing back down to reality which was the hardest part to grasp.

I changed course at to study Optometry at Uni which was where I met my husband. We're both qualified Optometrists now 2 years out of uni. He really helped me with my grounding and seeing things from a different perspective. He's one of the few people that knows about my past and continues to support me. Although he has supported me from day 1, it was really tough on both of us whenever I would relapse and cut myself again, it almost led to us breaking up because he wasn't sure if he could handle it, I definitely don't blame him because I really put such a huge burden on him. As I mentioned above, I cut myself on and off throughout all of uni but slowly the time between each cut was getting longer and longer thinking I was getting better but only to relapse again. I'm not sure what exactly clicked but one day I told myself, no more.. I need to find release in something else.

I graduated university, yay. I had time to focus on myself. Self care, self growth and nourishment was the best thing I could do for myself. I became selfish (not in a bad way) and practiced a lot of mindfulness. I think I can classify myself as having High Functioning Anxiety but at least it's not everything else that I have gone through as this is so much more manageable and I can control it a lot better. I am now so happy with where I am now. It's been such a long long path but I am glad.

My brain is so easily swayed, I wish I was more resilient with all these things but I gave in so easily and let all of those things take over me. I want to have kids one day and I want to teach them as much as I can so that they never go through anything that I have gone through. I am now 24 and have been clean of cutting for round about 2 years now. The last time I attempted to cut was around 2 years ago, 'attempt' because it never happened. If you are going through any mental health issues I just want to let you know that it gets better, as cliche as it sounds, it will.

Thank you so much for reading. I hope this helped some of you.",20Sep2018,2
11,"Attention has been a really big problem for me. I keep asking my mom if I could go see a doctor for a professional diagnosis but she keeps denying that I have ADHD and it's really making me depressed. Because I feel like I do have it.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I've always kept to myself is that:

&amp;#x200B;

\-**It's hard keeping track of a verbal conversation**. Every time someone is talking or giving instructions, my mind just blanks out and I always ask them to repeat what they say. One time in P.E. class, my gym teacher was giving out explicit instructions and he told us not to ask him for help afterwards, I retained that part but as that instruction sunk into my mind I didn't catch the rest. When I went up to him for help he just ridiculed me.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I can't stay on my task. Every time I try to read, I don't retain any information. When ever I try to keep track of what I am reading, my mind starts to think about other things. I just start to daydream as I read. When I catch my self, I often have to go back from the top of the page and reread the whole thing, 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**What should take me 2 hours to do, takes me the whole day**. I just can't stick to one thing, I have tried but when I sit down and have my book in front of me, I would much rather just do nothing than read my book.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything is different when I am doing something that I like, such as listening to music, reading about how to make a brick oven and cook pizzas in it. When I am playing video games, I am also very alerted and attentive.  So is this just me being lazy? or do I have ADHD. Either way, can I please get any form of advice? please and thank you.",20Sep2018,4

13,"Here’s the run down. 

About 2 years ago I tried acid for the first time and the experience went well I suppose for a first time trip. Nothing scary happened and it felt good. 

I tried it 3 more times with months in between uses and 2 of the 3 experiences were bad trip; throwing up, anxious, thinking negative thoughts about myself, when I got separated from my group and I was alone I thought I was homeless and had made up everyone in my life. 
It was bad. So I stopped taking it. I haven’t done it in over a year and a half. 

About a year ago I started feeling anxious in my every day life, started experiencing tinnitus, and started feeling like I was going crazy because my thoughts were overwhelming me. 

I started exercising more and started seeing a counselor twice a month. I explained my thoughts and symptoms and she believed it was anxiety. 

I started to get better in the sense that I had less overwhelming thoughts, the top of my head didn’t feel like it was buzzing anymore, I didn’t panic when I did have intrusive thoughts, etc. 

I’ve been doing great until about a month and a half ago when I found out my wife kissed her co-worker who I was already suspicious about.

The first 2 weeks I felt like I processed it as good as you can considering. The last 2 weeks have been overwhelmingly hard and it seems like symptoms are back but worse with new ones.

I’m having weird thoughts. I feel super anxious and in the anxiousness start to question things:

1) I wonder if I’m crazy and everyone knows but doesn’t want to tell me.
2) what if I’m doing weird things in the car when I space out and I’m not aware of it and that’s why family doesn’t know I’m crazy. It only happens when I’m not around them.

Tonight I had a music gig and it got really bad. My wife shows up and we talk for a minute and I go up on stage. I start singing and about 2 songs in, I notice she’s not there. So I start to panic and think: 

1) what if someone took her
2) what if she’s mad and left for some reason
3) what if she’s with that guy 
4) woah...what if she doesn’t exist
5) no, she was definitely here and I talked to her
6) then where is she? Shit, what if she really doesn’t exist and I was never married.
7) that can’t be, I’m wearing a wedding ring...
8) what if she died months ago when i started becoming anxious and I haven’t coped with her death yet and this is why I’m anxious and feel crazy 
9) that can’t be! I would HAVE to know if she died, I can’t be that messed up. Check your phone maybe she texted you 
10) checked my phone and saw she texted me that she got a phone call and stepped out. 

She walks back in and I feel immediately relieved that she exists after all. 

This is where I’m at right now. I feel like a sane person wouldn’t think those kinds of illogical thoughts....right? Normal people don’t think that when their wife disappears that she never existed or she died and I haven’t coped with it yet. When I walk up the stairs I feel like someone’s behind me every step of the way and my heart beats fast. My eyes seem more sensitive to light lately. I second guess myself constantly. 

Someone help me please! Is it just my anxiety creating these thoughts or is it something worse? Schizophrenia? 

I did do a 23 and me test and it did say I had a slight risk for schizophrenia and my worst fear is “going crazy.” I’m tired of feeling this way and I’m worn out mentally. I cried yesterday for the first time in over a year because of how concerned I am by my thoughts.

I see charisma, connections, relations and intelligence in them, and I have none of it. My grades are less,possessions inferior, charm lacking, and good looks nowhere to be found. This is a daily thought routine that damages the soul, yet none of it is true. I live a fantastic life full of experiences and knowledge and yet I feel inferior in every way to those around me. There is constantly a need to prove I'm worth my mettle, and I don't know why. Why is there this imaginary looming cloud of judgement overhead? Living in the constant fear of being less is quite miserable, despite knowing no one truly cares if any one person crashes or burns; an even more lonely thought.

18,"When I was 17, me and some friends had the stupid idea of boxing each other at a friends house. I went up against a very strong friend of mine and he landed a really hard shot on me right to the temple and I dropped to the floor. Everything went black for a solid 3 seconds. I remember feeling very loopy afterwards but I didn't think much of it, and I never went to the hospital. 

In the days after this incident me and my friends rented a beachhouse for 3 days and basically just binge drank the whole weekend. I made terrible choices and got very very drunk all 3 days. Coming home from that vacation, I have never been the same mentally. My theory is that I got an undiagnosed concussion when my friend hit me, and when I added the drinking on top of that I did extra damage to my brain.

Today I suffer from a wide range of symptoms, mainly pain in the head and spine, and an inability to focus at all. My behavior is also much less in my control than it used to be. I look at football players and all thats been going on with CTE/brain damage and I relate so much to these men and their struggles. It feels like my brain is deteriorating  and its driving me crazy.

She offered to pay me $50 a week if I did this for her. My initial thought was “No, I can’t and I won’t”. But after a few moments, I started to think about that it wouldn’t be too hard. It could benefit me in a way because I don’t have much variety in food. Then I continued down the road that if my mom wants “healthy low calorie food”, I can join and maybe lose some weight in the process. I know that my thoughts weren’t rational and I have since corrected myself.

My mom said if my dietitian didn’t approve, I didn’t have to. I talked to my dietitian today and she flat out said that it wasn’t a good idea, but she couldn’t stop me. I knew what her reaction and answer would be. 

I’m really frustrated with my mom that she would even think it would be okay to ask that of me. I don’t want to blame her for having urges to relapse over a small request that she made, but she should know better after 2 years of me going in and out of treatment.

After I told her what my dietitian said, she tried to tell me that she didn’t think that it would be a big deal because I would benefit from the food prep as well.

I don’t know if i’m overreacting or not. Thoughts?

Also, I realize that a lot of people don’t understand eating disorders, but I’d really appreciate it if no one said “just ignore it and do it for her” or anything like that.

21,"Hi everyone. I am new here to this subreddit. I struggle really bad with depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. I was wondering if anyone her has gotten a medical card for marijuana (I live in Canada so it is not legal here yet) and I was wondering how I ask my doctor about it. I refuse to take medication for my mental illness because everytime I take it it makes me worse (I spent 4 years on medication and I am now 4 years medication free). Medication makes me really suicidal and I’m better off without it, but I also am more in my head and in my feelings without it. I figured marijuana might help. Can someone help me with this?

22,"As of now I'm cut for words so my apology for the blunt introduction.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 17 year old child in the Australian Air Force Cadets which is the premier youth organisation in Australia. Age groups from 13-18 are involved and we are built up into confident, healthy adults over the course we are involved.

Being a Leading Cadet and soon to be a Corporal at cadets, I have the role of teaching lessons, specifically aviation related topics. This means that I am teaching students anywhere from 14-16 years of age both male and female. 

As you would, throughout your time there you make some great friends. I have plenty of older mates that I get along really nicely with and then I've got a handful of younger friends that have trusted me enough to help them get out of rough situations. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it all starts....

One of my friends - 15 years of age - was suicidal and I had no choice but to step in and help her out. I guided her mentally and brought her up to good spirit and she was incredibly grateful for my actions. Since then, everything has collapsed. Last night I received a phone call from her mother. This was confusing as just five minutes before hand, this girl had blocked me on every single bit of social media. I'm ok with that because that's her choice. It's her mothers actions that have left me in a state of depression, hallucination, panic attacks and overall confusion. 

She bluntly refused to even let me speak on the phone. Nothing. She accused me of faking the recent death of my friend for ""attention"", she accused me of stalking her daughter, she accused me of being a creep and I'm just sitting there on the phone speechless because I know none of that is true and so does all my other close friends and family members. The daughter in question didn't even get a say in this. Her mother completely took power and had no fact or backup to her statements yet I'mm on the other side with no one. 

The very fact that the mother thought I was stalking her daughter because I ran into her daughter in the city during the day and said hello is just stupid. There is no way I could have known she would be down there and I think its safe to assume that living in a regional town, you're going to see a lot of familiar faces around.

Going on to the conversation though, her mother threatened me physically and mentally stating that if I ever try and contact or talk to her daughter again ""sh\*t is going to get real"", ""I'm going to get you out of cadets"", ""I'm going to get you kicked out of school"" (we go to the same school) and ""I'll come knock you down if I come across you"".

Inside I know, my family knows, my friends know and the girl know that none of these accusations are true, however I can't help feel wrecked inside. I was panicking because I was scared of the mother. She knows where I live and her attitude towards this tells me she's willing to play tricky and with a few words. 

Suicidal thoughts are running through my mind because I don't know what to do and how to do it. I feel abandoned and helpless and just annoyed. Going off her logic of 17 year olds can't associate with younger people, jee I may as well say goodbye to a bunch of my male and female friends because they are one or two years younger than me. My other older friends.... wow they better go because they're ""targeting"" me..... For goodness sake the attitude of this mother has wrecked me and I know I shouldn't feel bad because I've done nothing wrong but I do. I don't even know why I bother now.

My apologies for this rant... I have no one by my side at this time and I'm in the middle of massive exams.",20Sep2018,4

24,"I'm a freshman in junior college and I've been having this problem since I was in high school. It takes a long time for me to start homework. I can't stop putting it off even if its right in front of me. I'll start daydreaming and it becomes really hard to stay focused. Then it starts piling up and it makes me feel like crap for not doing it sooner. If it's close to the due date I'll start thinking down on myself with phrases like ""why couldn't I have started this sooner"". 

On top of this the class requires volunteer service. I have really bad social anxiety so the thought of calling on the phone or going to an organization to ask for volunteer service frightens me. I keep putting it off.

26,"First time posting anything like this so if it’s in the wrong place feel free to direct me to the right place.

I have a friend that I’ve known for 7-8 years now. He’s part of a sort of online group of people that im part of. We generally just chat, play games, etc. The groups met up twice and probably meeting up again next year.

Essentially without sharing too much detail he’s had a somewhat bad home life, ended up dropping out of education and isolating himself / consuming himself with games. We (the group) tried a few times to talk to him but he is pretty closed off about it so it hasn’t come to much. He lives about a 2 hour drive away so it’s hard to try visit him in person and not sure randomly turning up is the best idea. Not sure if it’s relevant but he is also the youngest in the group he’s 18, oldest is 25

Curious if anyone else has been in a situation similar and has any advice? Is there actually anything I can try to do or is giving him more space a better idea? I don’t think he’s ever hurt himself or would do but he definitely seems to be  getting worse over time and I’m getting increasingly worried.

27,"Hello

I’ve been listening to a podcast by Peter Attia with Paul Conti about suicide, trauma and mental health, and I came to realize that I need advice.

My story is not unique nowadays, but nobody around me (as I know) have gone through similar experience. 
12 years ago my father committed suicide. To say it was a traumatic event is basically to say nothing. I don’t want to go into details, but there was a lot before and after.
I have not thought much about an impact it had on me, until recently. 
For ten years after I’ve been in the state similar to depression: anxiety, fears, asociality, all sort of things…
To be honest I hardly remember myself in those years, and can’t completely comprehend this period.

But somehow around four or three years ago situation has started to change for the better. 
There were few things that contributed to this shift. 

At first, after yet another crash of the soul I discovered meditation, and at the beginning, it was just about relaxation and stress level reduction, but after 2 years of irregular practice, I gradually built it into a daily routine. I got a grasp of its transformative potential and started to take it very seriously.

A second thing was probably a combination of meeting some people who had an impact on me and ecstasy experience, which led me to realize that there is life outside my tunnel and I can be social.

I wasn’t able to talk calmly about it previously, but now I can and see it as a progress.  I never consulted with a mental health professional and never took any antidepressants or special medication.
I tried to have conversations about this with some of my friends but seems like people without similar experience or special training can’t understand you, and they have nothing to say excepts for “I’m sorry” (I don’t blame anyone). In our family (it’s just three of us) we also never talk about father death and impact it had on our lives. I never had a mentor or someone older than me whom I can ask for an advice.

Through meditation and sometimes rigorous self-reformation, I made some progress and I feel good, but I still don’t fully understand an impact traumatic experiences had on my life and how I should address them.

An obvious next step is to talk to professional, but the trouble is that in my country there is no such thing as a mental health system. And at first, I would probably prefer to talk to people who had similar experience and overcome them to some degree (If there someone here please write me).

Now, knowing about me more than most people around me, what advice would you give to me?

33,"Hey everyone. Please bare with me as this will be full of info but most of it just boils down to: I need reassurance that I’m not crazy.

im 27 now. I’ve had anxiety for most of my life. Some times of my life harder than others but I’ve always kind of dealt with it. Recently it’s gotten to be the worst it’s ever been to the point where I’ve been reaching out for professional help.

I always had social anxiety in high school, didn’t have many friends, the usual and so like most of us my self esteem has always been very low. I grew up spending a majority of my younger life online escaping the real world and talking to others. In high school I met my first girlfriend online. It was long distance, became very toxic but I was young and stupid, moved to her state anyway for a few months and that’s where I first smoked weed. 

I had never smoked before and still am not sure wtf happened to me...if I got stoned out of my mind or if someone slipped me something else in the midst of me being stoned, but I had this weird as hell trip about how money doesn’t matter, politics are a joke, and “god” told me my girlfriend and I weren’t meant to be (lol.) I honestly don’t know if I dreamt all of this or it really happened but in the midst of all that I had my first full blown panic attack and have been worse since.

All of my relationships after that were extremely unhealthy because of me being overly attached and paranoid about being left and cheated on because of my first girlfriend. I realize these are all personal issues of my own but I’m realizing just how horribly I’ve handled breakups because of my anxiety. Literally feeling like the world is ending and obsessing over “what-if” questions for months until I finally get over it. I’m talking literally years of healing until I’m normal again.

Anyways. All of that aside...I recently came out to my family with a secret about my identity I’ve been hiding since I was young. No one has been surprised as it is obvious and I thought this would be freeing but it has done the total opposite. Weeks before this I started hating my job and feeling depressed out of nowhere and it just kind of got worse.

I literally feel more pain, anxiety, and confusion than any other “rough patch” in my life has given me to the point where I can barely function. My current gf has been a saint but I know we need space so that I can deal with this.

My main issue: I feel like since I have no secrets anymore with my family or anyone- I’m realizing a TON of shit. Realizing just how bad my anxiety has been for years and how I’ve masked it with drinking for a long time (I’ve since quit.) and now I really don’t know who I am. I hid behind my coping mechanisms for so long that now I am having a total existential and identity crisis.

I had depersonalization after many breakups but this time it’s back and worse than ever. I have racing thoughts constantly that I can’t shut off no matter what I do. My girlfriend made me go to my primary doctor and ask for meds. They offered me lexapro and I was hopeful it would help.

One dose of lexapro and I was 1,000 times worse. This shit amplified my anxiety and detachment the FIRST day that I was fucked up for 4 days after and even went to the emergency room because I was so out of it the day after. I had crying spells and total confusion for about 48 hours.

We went back to my doctor yesterday and explained it all. I decided not to try another ssri because I’m terrified. The experience With lexapro  reminded me so much of what happened when I first smoked weed. I honestly can’t explain it. It was dreamlike and fucking terrifying. Idk if it was just a really horrible anxiety attack or what. My doctor offered me a klonopin prescription until I can see my psych which I’m (not surprisingly) too scared to even try.

I got a referral for a psychiatrist and have some medical leave off of work. I am doing OK but honestly. My mind is a total wreck. I’m having the weirdest thoughts ever and I feel like I’m going insane. I keep thinking things like “what’s the point of my existence, what even is life, are other people even real, am I real?” Etc. Constantly monitoring how I am. Mornings are the worst. Thru the day I have moments where I’m fine and moments where I lose it.

I’ve been like this over exes/other situations but never about myself or my mental health. I can’t keep laying this on others because I’ve been exhausting everyone I know for like 3 weeks. My girlfriend is going back home tomorrow and part of me knows she needs to and the other part of me is so scared to be alone. 

I feel like researching maybe amplifies my anxiety even more but it also gives me some relief. Maybe I’m searching for answers that don’t exist.

I had a cousin who recently committed suicide because of OCD issues and my mind won’t stop telling me there’s no way out and I’ll eventually end up like him.

I’m at a point where I’m functional and applying for new jobs and TRYING to get it together but I cannot keep living like this. My girlfriend tries her best to support me and understand but her experience with anxiety only goes so far. She doesn’t understand my DP/DR or existential dread.

My mind keeps telling me not to try anymore meds because “what if they’re a scam and going to make you worse.” (Who even thinks that???) I made the mistake of watching YouTube videos of people with adverse reactions to electro shock therapy today and it TOTALLY wrecked me and made me even worse.  I can’t stop looking shit up because I’m looking for answers but in turn I keep going down a rabbit hole of more shit that just scares me.

I guess I just need someone to tell me wtf is going on here until I see my therapist on Friday. I know I’m under a ton of stress and life change. Please reassure me that I’m going to be ok and that reality is real. I feel like I’m totally going to snap one of these days and it’s scaring the shit out of me.",20Sep2018,6

I’m a 21 year old female living in the UK. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression earlier this year, and have been taking medication (Sertraline) since then.

Overall I’ve felt much better. My suicidal thoughts have lessened considerably, my anxiety attacks are almost non existent, and I’ve been feeling much more positive toward life since being on my medication. However, I have noticed two side effects that are concerning me, and I wondered if this was normal or perhaps something I should discuss with my doctor?

1. Forgetfulness. I sometimes feel very vague and confused, and forget simple things that I was supposed to be doing. While normally only mild, it seems to get worse when I’m very busy and have a lot to do, which can cause problems, e.g missing appointments or forgetting to turn off appliances.

2. Vivid dreams. Again, not a problem in and of itself, but i find they are becoming so realistic and frightening at times that I am waking a lot in the night and sleeping poorly as a result.

38,"Hi reddit, please help as I have no one to turn to 


My bf (22m) and I (22f) have been together for close to a year. He has depression, psychosis (both diagnosed) and he believes that he has other mental illness like personality disorder (?) and bipolar. (undiagnosed yet) 

I try to be there for him as much as possible but I must admit that the past few months I wasn’t the most attentive partner due to work and me going on 2 long holidays. 

Long story short, he cheated on me (no sex) while i was away. He confessed to me when i got back because he felt too guilty and broke down crying, begging for forgiveness. 

He told me his motive for doing it was partly to get some attention and the other part was for me to leave him after I found out so that I can be with someone better than him. (which he says quite often, whereby i can get a much better guy than him but i always shot it down because he makes me happy and I am happy with him.) 

when i found out, I was in shock because I thought our relationship was going very well. We were happy together, always laughing although like every couple, we did have our quarrels occasionally. 

He explained that he was in an all time low depressive state and wanted to end his life while I was away and tried to break up with me through text. But i refused and asked him to not take his life, asked my friend to keep an eye on him and we moved on. (We had major time difference as well) 
He also explained that throughout the entire incident, he felt that he wasn’t himself and that someone else was taking over his body and he has no control over it. 

Now the question is, can this be true? I am not well informed about mental illnesses so I am hoping that some of you can bring light to this situation. I do understand why he felt neglected because thinking back, it was always about me. He was attending to my needs but i wasn’t attending to his. I was too caught up with work and planning for my trips to notice that he was slowly drowning. 

I am still unsure about how depression/personality disorder (?) caused him to act this way but I have read similar stories online where a partner has depression or other forms of mental illness and it caused them to cheat on their partner. 

I have not forgiven him yet, but I am trying to because a big part of me wants to give him another chance if he is telling the truth (which I believe he is and am hoping for my sanity that he is) so that we can start afresh and continue building our life together.

40,"Hey guys. I was diagnosed with MDD two months ago. My condition was pretty bad before I decided to find a psychiatrist. My mood swings worsened and I have suicidal thoughts. I know long before that there was something going on with me. 

I should start with my family first. When I was a kid, I was bullied by my own siblings. They always blame me for everything that I did. I was even caned by my father for something that wasn’t my fault. I don’t really believe my father because of that so usually I will go to my mom. My mom though, she was very busy that she doesn’t have time to be there for me. I always ended up crying on the sofa and hoping that someone in my family would console me, but they didn’t. They just do their own stuff and I felt like I wasn’t part if the family. It was very scary to even think until now that when I was crying on the sofa, I will imagine to cut myself until I bleed in order for to get attention from them. I even thought of killing myself when I was a kid because I feel like no one understand and need me in this world. From there, I become very quiet. I will stay alone in my room most of the time, reading books or listen to songs or crying. I became revengeful and my plan was to get good results in school and become a doctor. Once I become a successful doctor, maybe these people wi understand me more.

I am an introvert. I don’t really engage with people let alone confess my feelings to my family or my closest friends. I kept worst things that happened in the past to myself. When I was 7, I was sexually molested by my cousin. Because I was so little, I didn’t dare to confront her. When I was 8, I saw my brother raped my cousin and he knew that I saw him that he threaten me and he beat me. I was so traumatized by that event, I decided to go to a boarding school so I can get away from my family. When I was 12, I was forced to do oral sex to my friend couple of times and he also tried to raped me at nights. Again, I was so terrified to tell anyone and I moved to another school.

My high school life was great. I was that one quiet boy in class but my classmates were all very friendly so I thought I found a good place to forget about my past. I did forgetting about the past and very rare that I remember about those awful events. I got best results in exam everytime and was the number one student in the major exam the last year of high school.

After high school, I was away from my friends. Everyone found their own paths and again I was alone. I pretended that it was normal and I should be fine at first but it’s not. Slowly I feel the loneliness creeping and I started to remember the things that happened in the past. When I lost my friends, I don’t know where should I go. I can’t go to my family. So I was alone and need to start everything all over again. Now I’m doing medicine which is very stressful but it is my passion. I started having nightmares about the past and sometimes weird dreams about those people. It gets worse for the last two years but again I thought I can overcome it like how I used to in high school.

Last year, I was walking in the shopping mall when I saw the guy who forced me to do oral sex. At that point my life started to change. I kept having nightmares more frequent and I started to keep myself from everyone in my class. Someone noticed my behavior, they say I’m not the happy cheerful kid that I used to be. I keep isolating myself from any social event until now. I started to feel the change in me. I wanted to become that happy guy again but I just can’t. Everytime I want to feel happy, there is a voice in my head saying that I shouldn’t and I don’t deserve to be happy, that everyone do not care about me and I am nobody to them. I have frequent suicidal thoughts.

From there I met a psychiatrist. I went there alone because I don’t want my family or my friends to know about my problem. At first I thought it was great, that finally I found someone that I can share my problem with, that finally I can find help. But it wasn’t. During third appointment with the psychiatrist, I was turned down by her because she argued why do I have to remember all those bad things when I can just move on. It’s like denying situations. Maybe she thought that I’m just weak. I think I’m weak from that moment. I think that I was too caught up in the past and cannot move on. I think that there are a lot of people experiencing more awful situations but I can’t just get hold of myself because I was just raped. 

I decided to stop all the therapies and stupid appointments. I keep myself away from my friends. I skipped most of the classes. I failed my exam. I become this awkward guy. I lost my trust in literally everyone. I just feel like I don’t belong to this world again like how I used to feel when I was a kid. I attempted suicide before. But I just can’t. Because everytime I stand in front of the mirror, I will see the kid that persevered his awful time, the younger me who wanted to be successful in the future. That if I commited suicide, I will disappoint that younger me. Now I’m just so confused with life and honestly I don’t know what to do.",20Sep2018,2
41,"Screw you, anorexia. It's been a long time, my enemy, obsession, my fence. And still you are lurking in the shadows. You grasp onto my insecurities and twist them to try and pull me back into your web. 

It's hard to believe 15 years have passed since you first showed up, offering control where I felt I had none. A perfectly normal life with a skewed perspective that it's bereft of fun will gladly invite in a little self-sabotage. You kept me in grocery stores for 90 minutes, doing mathematical Olympics to search for the perfect snack with the perfect caloric profile. You kept me at work late, sneaking around to pinch off of other people's food. You kept my social calendar empty just in case there was an event that might include a pretzel or a beer. You made sure my legs clocked dozens of miles of walking each week to earn, or forgive, the food. You felt triumphant when the competition was won against an opponent, unaware I was mentally comparing every morsel of food intake so I could deserve to eat. Excuse after excuse, trick after trick. You stayed at bay when I entered therapy and they promised you would ""go away"" if I would just eat. The therapists are excellent at validation but not at metabolism, and you just morphed into binging and sadness. 

But you're gone for the most part. You finally wrecked enough of my life that I had to fight back to put it into order. I no longer am afraid of any food. A simple, yet monumental achievement wrought with guilt over damaged family relationships, anger over missed opportunities for youthful adventures, and bitter irony over the divide between those who fight not to eat, and those to fight to find any food at all. To any part of me that once held onto the safety and comfort of anorexia, that part is superseded by actual happiness and fulfillment in life. There is nothing for me back there. As difficult as it is to pass through and the challenges remain, there is no question that life is better without you. Like an abusive relationship you had me believing I could not survive without you. Now my current self just feels pity for my former self that it took so long to get away.

He told me a couple guys he knows brought GHB with them and spiked a few girls drinks, he said he took care of me. I got a flashback of him putting my underwear on. I asked him if we did anything sexual he said yes. I told him “you knew I was drugged” he told me “you think I raped you? you’re the one that kissed me first”. I havent talked about it since.

# ""Paranoia attacks"":

So it started about half a year ago, about when i turned 19. I started to have these attacks of the feeling that something terrible was about to happen. During those 5-10min episodes i got extremely hectic and could often hear voices screaming at me. They sounded kind of muffled but still pretty loud. Most of the time it was the voice of my mother screaming at me which is weird because i have a pretty good relationship with her. I don't think they were panic attacks either since the symptoms of a panic attack don't quiet match up with mine.

At my worst i had those attacks about 3-4 times a week. I just brushed them off as me being malnourished or maybe me sleeping too little. They have mostly stopped lately however.

# Hallucinations:

About a week ago i was home alone and i thought i heard whispering and really quiet footsteps coming from the living room downstairs. I thought my house was being robbed however when i went to investigate (I know not the smartest thing to do when you're 80% sure you're being robbed lmao) there was nothing there. I later went to bed aka watching youtube in bed. I suddenly heard a pretty clear footstep coming from the foot of my bed. It sounded like when you're walking barefoot and your foot is sticking to the surface a little if that makes sense. I jumped up but nothing was there.

Since then i just experienced some minor disturbances like thinking an inanimate object in my peripheral vision is a person but then looking at it again and realizing it's not or thinking that someone called you when no one did but i think that's something pretty much every person experiences.

While I have never hurt myself before and am unlikely to hurt myself, these thoughts of not wanting to be anymore has been getting stronger and more frequent lately as I have gotten into conflict with someone I view as a friend.

And it’s like, I want to call someone to talk to. Be with someone to understand, but there’s a certain sense of isolation here. I migrated to here a while ago and never found friends whom I can rely upon.  And now that I have hit rock bottom, I feel so alone and so cornered.

50,"A little over a year ago I started working at a cool, new, software development company. I’m young in my career and it seemed like a great opportunity to expand my skills and take on some more responsibility. Almost immediately, I was being given projects and tasks and completing them without hesitation or issue and things were going well. I was being recognized for my efforts as the newbie and I was loving what I was doing. Everything was fine until I was given a new project for a very large client.   
The project details are irrelevant but essentially, I was tasked with completing this massive project all on my own with very little oversight or help from anyone at my company. The client’s involvement dwindled over time and I was left to figure a lot of it out on my own based on small amounts of input from their end. As time went on things got worse and worse, to the point where I was getting blamed for everything that was starting to go wrong. All along I felt I was just trying to complete the customer’s requirements and when they wanted me to focus on something else, I would divert my attention and make sure that was taken care of.   
Jump to today, I’ve been in therapy to work through some of these issues, my girlfriend has been helping me work through some things, my friends and family have been supporting me, but I am just beyond exhausted. My entire life is being affected by this project and I am completely depressed.   
I feel that I’m tied to and responsible for this project to get completed. I feel that I was in over my head from the very beginning and wasn’t capable of seeing that I couldn’t do this alone. I feel that the project was far too much responsibility for me. I feel that as things got worse and worse I was left to just continue letting the crap pile up on me. I’m ashamed and embarrassed of the work I’ve done and the work my coworkers now have to see. I feel like a complete failure and that this project will haunt me for life.   
I’m considering switching jobs so I can rid myself of this stress and move on. I don’t want to be a quitter and even through all of this I feel like I can’t quit because I need to be available for this project. I don’t want to ruin my career by hopping to the next company when things get tough. What do you do when you feel completely stuck in a job that makes you nauseas every single day? How do you overcome that feeling of failure?

In the days after this incident me and my friends rented a beachhouse for 3 days and basically just binge drank the whole weekend. I made terrible choices and got very very drunk all 3 days. Coming home from that vacation, I have never been the same mentally.

Today I suffer from a wide range of symptoms, mainly pain in the head and spine, and an inability to focus at all. My behavior is also much less in my control than it used to be.

56,"[USA /28/ Female]

I have been working at my current job since graduating college in 2012. Until the last year I’ve been a model employee, on time, always staying late when need to, got along well with everyone. My bosses always spoke very highly of me. 

Background: 
&gt;I travel to remote worksites for year long projects. After the year I go back to my home location for about 6 months and travel again. When on travel I am away from my normal worksite and only with employees assigned to that job including the project foreman who acts as the site supervisor. No HR, no regular boss, just this mini group assign to the task at hand. Across the country so I’m far away from friends and family. 

My toxic anti work behavior all started about a year ago when I went through some harassment with new site foremen who decided to make me the scapegoat for their project fuck up. I never really spoke up about anything going on. When I did people didn’t believe me because it’s my word against 2 foremen and 5 other guys/supervisors (their friends). I never told HR as I knew the individuals wouldn’t be fired and it would just make things more difficult for me (especially since I’m one of only 3 females at my job). 

During that time work was not a fun place to be. For that year away from home I was depressed, being isolated from everyone at work and spent most of the day crying in my office in a aching haze.  I already have ADHD. Being depressed made it nearly impossible to focus and suddenly all the rumors they spread about me were true because I wasn’t keeping up with my workload. I wasn’t sleeping or eating. Never getting into work on time and I was most likely just miserable to be around. 

Fast forward to today and I’m now back home in a much healthier work environment. Im still dealing with a bit of isolation but nothing extreme. I bothers me sometimes because I know I don’t deserve it but as there isn’t anything I can I do I just try to let it go. I am however still having trouble sleeping and dealing with anxiety when at work. 

I try to go to bed on time. However, even when I do  get to sleep I wake up repeatedly to check the clock to make sure that I’m not oversleeping. It’s like I can’t relax enough to get a good nights sleep so that I can wake fully alert and ready to. When my alarm goes off at 4:45 am (supposed to be at work by 06:00) I am so tired that I snooze through all of my alarms. I will finally get up an hour later in which I’m already late. Sometimes I get dressed. Sometimes I just lay there panicking about being late to work again. Thinking about how I need to call in to say I’m late and knowing how disappointed I am in myself for being late in the first place. 

Today is one of those days. I woke up and laid there thinking how I didn’t care about work. I needed a mental health day (again 😒) and I would call in. I emailed my boss that I was sick.  3 hours later I now feel extreme anxiety about not being at work and guilt about being a terrible employee and how I’m going to get fired and again all the rumors are true.  

I wish I could just get to work on time. It would fix everything but every morning I sleep and can’t make myself wake up and get there. 

I was on anxiety medication for the first time in my life during all of the harassment. I came back home and stopped taking it because I needed to find a new psychiatrist to refill my prescription. I couldn’t find one in time and had my GP renewed my prescription for Vyvanse and Wellbutrin. 

I haven’t taken the Wellbutrin in a few weeks but even when on both medications I still wasn’t waking up and getting to work on time which further continued the cycle of anxiety. 

I’ve never had this problem before. I’m 28 years old.  I don’t know how to fix it. I do know that I will get fired if I can’t correct the behavior especially since my bosses already think I’m a complete fuck up now. I’m terrified I will lose my job but I still can’t bring myself to get to work. Wtf is wrong with me? I feel like I’m agoraphobic. I don’t want to go anywhere or do anything but I especially don’t want to work if I’m even a millisecond late. Then I panic and it starts all over again. 

Anyone have these issues?  I really need help with this.

65,"I am usually composed and analytical when I'm alone. And at these times, I'm not the kind of person who is usually bothered about being disliked. I am not bothered about reasonably large levels of failure in general (for eg, if I lost my job tomorrow morning, I'm pretty sure I won't feel too bad about it).   


However. The moment I come face to face with another person, my mind gets clouded. I cannot think clearly or analytically. My thought process is simply so much more clearer when I'm alone in a room. When I'm with another person (someone I do not know too well) in any social setting, it's almost as if a sense of desperation sets in. There is suddenly an urgent need to know that they think well of me. It's almost as if my gut is telling me that if they do not think well of me, I will not get the answers I am seeking from the conversation, or might not get the desired outcome from the conversation. This, not in major path-breaking discussions. Even in minor things like meeting a doctor for a flu, or finding out from a junior at work when a certain task would be completed. It's not as if anything will break if I get negative outcomes from these settings, and rationally I know this. Very often, I tell myself this before the conversations. I prime myself and tell myself to stay calm and composed. But the minute I get into the conversation, that's all out of the window. The minute I smile in greeting and engage socially, my mind becomes blank and the analytical part of the brain shuts down. And a sense of desperation sets in to have be thought well of and to get a good outcome to the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

And this usually has negative effects - like I might not end up telling the doctor all my symptoms because my brain is not working. Or I might not be able to take the right tone in conversations. 

This doesn't happen with people I know reasonably well though, whether I like them or not, or they like me or not. It happens more in social settings and with strangers. More so, if I had been in this same situation with the same person, but had been talking on a Chat box instead of face to face, I would be perfectly composed and can pull of the right conversation.  


The funny thing is, I'm known very well in my circle for being a great public speaker in technical settings. Crowds don't scare me. Nor does disapproval.  But somehow some conversations make me lose my cool and I neither know why, nor how to fix it.

66,"I've had some worries about my mental health recently which i voiced to a family member. She has been pushing me to see a psychologist. 

In the past three years at college I have never truly felt happy. I'm not sure if i have depression or not - I don't always feel overwhelmingly sad or unable to get out of bed which makes me think i don't. I have some days when i feel happier. For the most part i would say that i just feel nothing. Generally indifferent to existence. My mood can swing from high to low really quickly. 

I study engineering so there is a lot of pressure. Over my three years at university i have had so many rewrite and supplementary exams and i generally just scrape through with pass marks. I tend to hit low patches, especially when stressed. In these low patches my mind turns to suicidal ideation (mainly jumping). I have actually found myself walking to the top of buildings before to check if i could get access to the roof to jump. I don't feel that i would ever actually commit suicide but i really worry that these are thoughts i have. I think my mental health may not be as it should.

Though I want to get better and receive treatment. I get that I have to ask for help obviously.

Well, I left a message for a therapist 48 hours ago and I was disappointed to not hear back. Maybe they’re busy? I told them I hear some offer a sliding scale, I don’t have a lot of money, and I was looking into counseling.

Anyway, what are qualities of anxious and depressed people? 

If I’m depressed and am actively working my way to get better, then I’m not doing *terrible*, right?

My friend has had clinical depression for his entire life, I’ve witnessed him sleep for like 18 hours straight, and I thought sleep until 2-3 PM was bad. He complained I’m too optimistic that, I’m under the impression that we’ll ultimately be okay, even though we are suffering.

I’m happy to be alive! It’s hard to imagine what life would be like without me... pretty different or sad...

68,"In 2016 my father in law died from suicide, which sent my bipolar to husband into a state of dysmorphic mania that I absolutely did not recognize or see. I should note that I don’t have any mental health issues for which I have been diagnosed. A couple of months later he secretly reached out to his ex fiancé, who has classic bipolar that she does not treat, and began a deep emotional relationship in which they told each other I love you and talked about how sad they were that their stars had not aligned for them to be together (I am not kidding they actually said these words to each other). It turns out the reason that they ended up breaking off their engagement was because she had a bipolar episode and had to be hospitalized. When he learned this he deepened  their relationship and talked about how it was important enough to be in each other’s lives. 

A few months later he was visiting his family in Florida and sent me a text message about his father. I responded to it and his response to me was oh that wasn’t meant for you that was meant for X. His mother told him while he was down there that carrying on this relationship with his ex was inappropriate. We had the same conversation when he got home and he agreed. He did not cut off the relationship and then filed for divorce from me in October. They were talking almost constantly at this point based on our phone bills which I discovered later.

We reconciled but the day after we reconciled he spent the entire day messaging her. Her family was the victim of an atrocious crime in January of this year and he attempted to use that event to bring her fully into his life as a friend who needed his support. At this point I looked at the phone bill, figured out what had  been going on, and begged him to tell me the truth. It took him a month or two to finally come clean. He deleted all the messages but I saw the emails so I know the kind of warm and lovely things they were saying to each other.
After a month or two he began to realize that he had had an emotional affair and he went back to his doctor, who put him on some very serious medication. He cut off all ties with her and when she contacted him a couple of months later he told her that he was serious and didn’t want anything to do with her. I have no idea if they’ve talked since then or not - this was in April.
My question is should I forgive him come? I don’t know enough about bipolar two and black mania or dysmorphic mania to fully understand what he did and what his mindset was at the time. He’s going to the doctor and change medication and then talk therapy to try to deal with what he did but I just cannot get over it. I don’t have any family as his family has now abandoned me and my own family is wrapped up in themselves. Does anyone have any thoughts? Positive negative I don’t really care I just need to know what somebody else thinks

TL;DR. My husband had an emotional affair in a state of dysmorphic mania and I don’t know if I can forgive him or even if I should. I don’t know enough about mental illness to understand exactly what all of this means and I need some advice

My family and I were at the mall last weekend when we passed by a man doing demo of a VR. Out  of nowhere, my daughter (who has mild autism) asked to try it, so we allowed her to even though there is somewhere else we need to be ASAP. As I was watching her fully immersed in VR, I noticed how much she was enjoying it so we just waited 'til it was finished. When it was done, my daughter told me that she wanted one for her birthday, which is going to be on the 2nd week of October. Now, I know about VR but I wasn't sure if it's the right gaming gear for my daughter so I searched online about VR and autism. To my surprise, I was pointed to several websites saying that virtual reality training can help a kid with ASD improve their social skills and brain activity.

70,"I'm nearly 30 and I still struggle with this on a daily basis. It's like pushing against a forcefield. The forcefield lifts when I'm just sleep deprived enough. Then I get as much done before I'm too tired to produce useful work. For some stupid fucking reason I managed to graduate in STEM with honors working like this. I really wish I didn't graduate: ""Look at me, I have a credential that I can't live up to!""

I mean it literally, I can't make myself do what I don't want to no matter how badly I need to do it. I will often end up just sitting and doing nothing. Not ""Ha Ha I did nothing productive"" kind of nothing, I mean ""sit and stare at the wall like an old man for six hours"" kind of nothing. Doesn't matter if there's zero consequences, or if I will get fired consequences. Last year I almost got into legal trouble because of it.

It's not like I'm not thinking about the consequences. Either I'm not thinking about the consequences or what I need to do, and being perpetually distracted... or I am VERY aware of the consequences and what I need to do and am banging on the forcefield in my mind for an entire day until I wish I was fucking dead.

It's like god himself restricts me until it's 1-2 AM, then suddenly I am able to do everything I need to turn my life around and keep it on track.",20Sep2018,2

But I really dont wanna go do anything with him. I dont like going out much anyway, but especially with him cause I feel like we have nothing in common and its just always awkward with him.

78,"So, well, let's start like this: my name is Tomás Pérez Ortiz, I'm 18 years old, male.

My problem is the followowing:

I act like a Stalker or at least I think so, let me explain.

I have having a little chat with an animator from youtube and while we are definitively not friends, we do have nice little talks. My problem is when I ask and she doesn't respond me... And she sees the message. Now, I'm no looking for a gf, because I already have one even though our relationship is really rocky. In fact, I never saw any woman I chat online with as possible tomances, I only sae them as friends, nothing more. And what frustrates me, that I want to slowly built a friendship with some of the people I meet online and I get ignored. I CAN'T stand it. It's so fucking bothersome.

And this isn't only with her, but with another gemale friend I have as well online (which we are officially friends and not just mere small talk). And look, I understand that they are people and they are occupied, in fact, they have admitted that they are going through a lot of stress and hard work and I completely understand it. It's just that... It feels lonely, I have friends in real life, quite a lot actually, but with people online, only one of my online friends is constantly active and able to talk to me, my gf is also from the internet but ,of course, she is most then just a friend. I think my problem lies with these two girls. I mention earlier. 

I understand it sounds extremely selfish, and it is, but the way I act like this is because I have been hurt very deeply in the past by people I used to call friends and I have always been a lonely guy, just now I have started to gain friends, and the thought of a friend leaving is terryfing to me, it makes me cry.

What can I do with this? Am I stalker? Or am I just just deeply affected by the thought of being alone?

I love talking to these people when they can but I'm also afraid to say something that will screw the relationship so far or make them think I'm a creep.

I'm not a creep and I'm not looking for a gf... I'm just looking for a friend.",20Sep2018,2

81,"Hey all,

I have been dealing with anxiety, depression, and obsessive thoughts. A little bit of background, my dad's side of the family has a history of depression and my symptoms only really surfaced within the last year because of a horrible relationship I went through.

One of my obsessive that plagues me is if I am capable of love and concern. In the past I have certainly shown these things. When my grandfather passed away in 2005, I was incredibly sad, yet when my other grandfather died just this last christmas, I was not as affected that much, at least not a severely when I lost my other one. Another instance I remember is when my best friend was rejected from the college he wanted to go to. He was so upset that I immediately went over to comfort him. Another example was that I have shown concern over my parents weight and want them to slim down for their own health.

But lately, I don't know if I am capable of genuinely love, or if I am just possessive and lonely instead of loving. I mainly introverted, and I like to have time to myself, but I sometimes look to be with my family because I feel guilty that I am not spending enough time with them. To clarify, I love my family and we have spent quality time together every now and then, I am simply talking about day to day interaction that I force. I also have these doubts about how I would react if I found out if anyone I care about died, would I be sad, would I be accepting, or would I be apathetic? The introverted aspect of it all is concerning to me because I don't know if I value my close friends and family because they are awesome people and we came together naturally or because I value the fact that we are ""friends"". I also had this inner fight concerning my ex, whether I truly loved her or I was just lustful/lonely/desperate (she was my first serious relationship) and happy with the idea of finally being in a relationship. I also tried to help her when she going through stuff, but again I don't know if that was me genuinely caring for HER or just some stupid valiance/protection/paladin fantasy.

I also find myself worrying if I relate to the incel/neckbeard/niceguy community because they all seem so desperate/bitter and I don't want to become those callous assholes but I can't help but find myself relating to some of the emotions they are going through.

I have also found that when I have talked to others on here, I don't know if I am genuinely trying to help them or I am just trying to show off/give unsolicited advise, because it feels like all of these motivations at the same time. The karma system does not work because I find myself anxiously checking if the people I have talked to have replied to me and given me feedback/validation (like when I try to text people, this was cranked up to 11 concerning my ex so there may be some correlation)",20Sep2018,2
82,"Recently, I found out a mutual friend of mine is bipolar. He was told that I might have a mood disorder, and confronted me about it. 

Awhile back, I talked to a councilor and after listening to some of my stories and how I felt and all, they said I could have a mood disorder. 

I question it and myself because I look at the “signs” of being depressed and having a mood disorder and I fit half of them and I don’t fit the others. I’m afraid that if I talk about it or talk to someone, it either becomes real and I get diagnosed or I find out it’s nothing and I’m just “sad.” 

I’m always told that I’m perfectly fine, that it’s all in my head, that there’s nothing wrong and I’m just sad, or just going through stuff. It tends to be a rollercoaster of emotions and feelings and it varies. 

Maybe I’m just being dramatic, or maybe it really is something real.

83,"Hey guys, 
Im writing this late at night so sorry for possible mistakes. Also, English isn't my first language. 
I've noticed that my mental state got worse and worse over the last 2 months and I don't know what I should do.
I'm 18 years old and going to graduate next year which means there has been a lot of stuff going on at school recently. Exams start in 2 weeks but we've already done loads of presentations, tests etc. Because I'm going to take my final exams in a few months, this is really stressing me out. On top of that, I just started working as a cashier. My employer is pretty harsh I guess, I work 4-6 hours 2 or 3 times a week. After I had 8 hours of school! No need to say that I am absolutely exhausted at the end of each day. Also, I'm still taking guitar lessons which I didn't sign up for but my parents won't let me drop out till February. There's just so much stuff I gotta do and so much pressure to do all of these things perfectly. I recently had my worst and longest panic attack because of that. I rarely ever get panic attacks, and if so only ""small"" ones. I also noticed that I have no motivation and nothing to look forward to in the future. I'm not excited about things I used to be and fatigue is my most felt emotion at the moment. Am I sick or is this just a normal reaction? Does every student feel like that when they're graduating soon? I don't think I should be seeing a psychologist because surely all these symptoms are going to end when I'm done with school...right? 
Sorry for this absolute mess of a text guys I'm just desperate for any advice and appreciate every message! Thank you!",20Sep2018,2
84,"I've had some really bad anxiety attacks for... A couple months I think. 

So in turn, I decided to make my room a more comfortable area. Where I can watch tv or play games. It helps at least. 

But laying in bed last night, trying not to have a panic attack, it just kind of hit me. 

I'm so tired of having to keep doing the same things to keep my anxiety at bay. 

I'm so fucking tired. 

Why do I have to be the one that always wants to die? 

Why did my family procreate? 

I keep playing games to kind of help but I'm just so out of it on my new med (trintellix).

So I've lost about 20 lbs in two months.

The hospital here is awful and I get panic attacks just thinking about it.

88,"I’m currently in school, I have friends like everyone else. However hidden from my friends are my inner thoughts. Every time I say something my brain goes through a process that ends up with me comprehending it in different ways. Sometimes I’m so eager to right something down funny that I said (that’s what I usually try to aim for, being funny, which I’m actually pretty good at not gonna lie) or either I think I said something wrong. However, a constant fear of mine is that my personality is changing. I let things get to me and then I can’t stop thinking about them, and then I’m stressing out about whether or not the next time I talk to my friends I’m gonna say the same kind of things I usually do. Lots of times I always ending up like good ol’ me but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t stress me out. Plus lots of times there’s no way of telling and I finish the day stressed out about this kind of shit again. However throughout my high school experience there’s been two people who stray from this, my brother and my friend John. Today I said something kinda awkward to John during my last period. I allowed myself time to think about it, and then I started to question how I usually act around him, I picture scenarios in my head and when I can’t think of the perfect outcome I freak out, I worry that if I hadn’t been so stupid and just stopped thinking about it everything would’ve been the same. And now I’m kinda freaking out I’ll never act the same around him. ",20Sep2018,2

This has never happened to me before that I can remember and has happened now twice in the last month. It’s terrifying. I literally feel like I’m going to die. I can see/hear around me but not respond. It’s like I’m alive but playing dead...except I have no control over it.

It usually happens when I feel very overwhelmed and like I have no control over my environment, but this is really scary.
