0,"I have a habit of drinking once a week quite heavily, I tend to go out at the weekend and I’ve cut down on the quantity of alcohol but I still feel i need to go out once a week to just let go of any stresses and enjoy myself freely. The problem is alcohol really fucks with my head the day after I get either bad health anxiety, or obsessive planning- the obsessive planning can last a while, I don’t really know how to describe it. It’s usually when the night doesn’t go all perfectly how I planned it, Cos of my expectations, and I start planning my weeks ahead, going out, having fun, I need to feel reassured my life’s good and there’s stuff to do, but my brain won’t feel satisfied unless that’s all I’m thinking about, but it’s just the same thing over again there is no problem to be resolved it just keeps repeating the same things, and then I write them down, I try to ignore and forget but then I feel really agitated and fucked if I’m not paying attention to these obsessive thoughts going “pay attention to me” it feels like a problem I just can’t solve. - yes. That’s what it feels like. I get so anxious I’m wrecking my head and sanity by drinking, but sometimes it doesn’t do this and I feel fine day after. Just fuck expectations I set for myself and life. I guess when I feel like I’ve done something wrong, or regret about something then I have to start planning. This probably stems from my low self esteem and perfectionism, I also have an obsession with my boyfriends ex (she crosses my mind loads of times all day and constant checking of her and her friends social media) which doesn’t help because I constantly compare my life to hers and I want everything to be how I plan it to be, it’s a strong desire. I need everything to feel good. I’m super embarrassed and always say I don’t need regular therapy because I function day to day with anxious thoughts, but nothing too crippling, only occasionally. But I have complex’s and a fucking stupid toxic way of thinking. I want to take responsibility for myself but I’m finding it so hard, these thoughts r making me wanna scream and just explode or sleep forever Cos it’s just horrible being awake and trying to fight reason my brain, and I need some advice or maybe anybody else who’s experienced this. I feel I’ve maybe described it badly or trivialised it but it’s really fucked with my head.  I have adhd, anxiety and had clinical depression a while back so I’m on anti depressants and adhd meds btw. - meant to be coming off anti’s and I’m so worried anxiety will get worse fuck fuck fuck ",05Nov2018,1
1,"I love daydreaming (which, in itself, I know isn’t normal) but I’ve never heard anyone talk about this; perfecting daydreams. I’ll give a simple(ish) example of how the daydream develops and “perfects”:
•Buying a red house
•Buying a red house. I call my mum to tell her how excited I am about the new house
•Buying a red house. I /FaceTime/ my mum to tell her how excited I am. I go inside the house. It has two cream sofas and a fireplace
•Buying a red house. I FaceTime my mum to tell her how excited I am. I go inside. It has two cream /leather/ sofas and a fireplace, /it also has a coffee table/

Over the course of a few days, weeks or even months I add and change things about the same daydream to make it better until it’s exactly right to the smallest detail and then I move on to another daydream. I have OCD and anxiety, is it perhaps a symptom of those? Or is it something else? Does anyone else do this??",05Nov2018,1
2,"I've developed an anxious mental block about dealing with things. It's been like this for the last year. I won't respond to emails from professors, unless it becomes critical. Otherwise I just ignore everything and hope nothing happens. I won't pick up the phone to talk to my friends; it's easier to numb myself with a netflix binge. I just can't bring myself to get grip on my situation and it feels like i'm just in a tailspin. I'm trying to find ways to numb myself further and any moment of clarity I do get is the only time i'm able to be productive. It's frankly exhausting. I'm 27, just finished my studies, and I need to live a meaningful life. But i'm not going to get a job and move out out of my dad's place like this, but any willpower to wrench myself out of this situation is non-existent...",05Nov2018,1

8,"I stopped my girlfriend from doing peyote when her birthday comes. The idea made me so uncomfortable i started crying and like freaking out.

I remember how “good” I used to be and I’m out of practice now. I’m trying not to get discouraged by it. But then my friends show me some fucking brilliant artwork they’ve just “slapped together” and I can’t help but feel discouraged a bit by it. I feel like I’m never gonna be that good. But art is integral to my identity. It’s my “thing” and always has been, and hopefully always will be. I know this but I seem to sabotage myself. The result is I make less art than I want to, then I feel
guilty about it, I see the great things my friends do, I get discouraged, etcetera. Vicious cycle. How do I get out of this?!",05Nov2018,1
10,"When I was five I was sexually taken advantage of by my best friend who I consider my best friend. It was on the night of our first sleep over. He was seven and he called me a chicken, I told him that I didn’t want to because I thought it was gross. He then Bach’d at me like a chicken. I still refused to do what he asked... he then threatened me he wouldn’t be my best friend and then he said that “It’s what real men do”, so I gave in.

Since then I’ve noticed I’m very flirty with girls, and I prefer to wear sweat pants because they are comfortable and I’m lazy. 

That being said I’m still a virgin. I’ve been dreaming of finding a princess to spoil since I was 10. As of right now I’m looking for a girl to have fun with.

My concern with my sexuality stems from every time Im asked whether or not I’m bisexual or even gay I get really really depressed. It makes me anxious and uncomfortable. I’ve spoken to counsellors and clinicians about it and all they seem to do is agree with whatever I say. 

Girls used to scare me. If one knew I liked them, I thought that meant I also meant a lot of other things, including that I thought they were pretty or hot, which made me uncomfortable because sometimes I just really admired them for their intellect and ability to be trust worthy.

Trust is where I begin to falter in my mind. I think it’s because my mom or dad never trusted me to make the right decisions. They really loved me, more extremely than they should have. They never let me go and do things if they thought I might get hurt, or I might be in danger.

I’ve summed it up in my mind as my mom is a lunatic. She hasn’t changed in over 15 years. She’s experienced divorce and a new job and that’s literally it. I mean also another kid but not much. 

Anyways, I have depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I’m in love with this girl who I have wanted to marry since I was thirteen, I believe counsellors and clinicians aren’t honest with me and that they are only there to support me and not say what they really think or believe because they are in some aspect afraid of me, because I’m vague and intelligent.

I got a 77% average in highschool with out even giving one single fuck. I’m 18, and I’m really passionate about helping the human race. I have no friends since I sexually harassed this girl I loved back in August. She has a boyfriend and I was getting desperate because I didn’t want to lose her forever. I love her to this day. I told her to suck my dick and I told her I sucked 2  dicks which I did when I was 5. The next day after I was sexually taken advantage of I showed my other best friend what happened. I pretending to be a girl. I pushed him up against the wall and pulled his pants down. 

Then when I was 7 I remember the first guy who introduced me to sex did the exact same thing as he did when I was five when we were sitting in the back of his car. I think I remember basically giving him head but I can’t picture in my mind, I just remember the seats and looking at him. 

I’ve been so frightened and terrified of my community because my clinician asked me to sign a piece of paper which gave him permission to give information to who ever he wants. He told me he was just gonna talk to my doctor and my mom and let them know I was alright, but instead I’m 210% certain he told that girls mom information about me to make sure she wasn’t in danger.

Ever since I became depressed I’ve been obsessed with feminine poetry. It’s beautiful and makes me feel warm, almost like I would hope a real mother or girlfriend would. 

This girls mom works at the office as some individual. I’m almost certain Hailey told me her mom was a clinician back when we were twelve. I legit saw her mom, like looked at her dead in the eyes. 

I love her to death, I just want to hold her and dream with her and feel her heart beat when I’m in times of need. I’m not a needy person, especially when my confidence is on the foundation of trust and acceptance. I don’t have to receive trust and acceptance from anyone else, except Hailey. I don’t know what to do.

She’s since blocked me on Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook. I went to her house in August to say sorry. I had flowers, birthday gifts and a journal plus letters ready to give her. I was going to read them to her so I could explain that I don’t normally sound so desperate when I’m not depressed.

I haven’t been able to trust her since her last boyfriend. She cut me off from everything. I was toxic. All I did was send her music, hoping she would appreciate it. I love music so much... I was just scared to let her into my family and let them intoxicate her. 

My family is so harmful. They don’t care about others, they’re so harmful and disturbed. They’ve been bullied and have psychological issues they can’t solve because they aren’t even trying because they believe it’s just apart of who they are. They aren’t even trying to seek help and it makes me sad.

My dad used to tell me a joke about the mailman being my real dad. I found out a couple months ago that this joke wasn’t really a joke and that apparently my mom and dad got pregnant when they were 18 and my mom had to get an abortion with my dad. The only supportive person she had was a coworker. For 22 years he tormented her about this coworker even though nothing happened. I was truly disturbed when she told me.

After I turned 18 and I finally told my mom what happened to me as a kid, she told me my dad was raped by his teacher when he was 9. Apparently it was a huge court case and my dad wasn’t the only victim. There was plenty others. My dad was supposed to get 10000 dollars Canadian for a settlement, and he got a very disappointing amount. 

His mom told therapists he was fine and that he didn’t need counselling, so he never received help.

My dad used to shake me, scream in my face, kick me, hit me with his belt, basically once every week. I used to pray to god asking why my parents had to be so hard on me. 

I would be grounded for weeks for the littlest things. And it boiled down to simply not listening, and not telling the truth because I was afraid of being grounded or beaten. I was a child, what did they fucking expect??? They were so cruel. ",05Nov2018,1

14,"I've been dealing with major depression ever since I was in elementary school. I'm 18 now. 

Quick backstory- A huge majority of my depression was being extremely suicidal, self destructive, self hatred, and loneliness. I started using drugs when I was 12. I dealt heavily with prescription pills and alcohol. Alcohol was my drug of choice and I had to go into rehab when I was 16. I am not completely sober now but I am doing A LOT better as in I haven't drank in 2 months and I only pop pills every once in awhile. 

About 7 months ago everything completely changed. Nothing drastic happened in my life (I'd even say my life outside of my brain was getting better) but my depression morphed into something else. 

I am in constant fear. Thoughts of my loved ones dying play over and over and over in my head, I have nightmares about it. I'm always thinking something is wrong with me health wise. Ive convinced myself I was having a heart attack or I was going to die plenty of times. I fear that my doctor is missing something or doesn't realize something is wrong with me. I feel like everyone thinks I'm lying to them. I get extreme paranoia that my parents are watching me through my cracked door at night. Most of my day is based around being nervous and suspicious and scared, despite having nothing to worry about. 

The only ""drastic"" thing that happened before my depression changed is graduating high school ????? This really scares me and a lot of the time my thoughts make me think I'm going actually insane. I don't know what to do? Is this normal ?",05Nov2018,1

I don't really want to repeat it, but it just annoyed and irritated me to no end because ... I don't know. The person was just trying to be helpful but the suggestion he had made was so ignorant and uninformed that it just made me angry. I really shouldn't be angry...even if he DID research the disorder I have, none of the text he would find would properly describe what it is like living with this day to day. There is NOTHING online that even comes close to describing what the hell I go through daily between the impulses that I can not control and the lighting fires and walking to and from my safe spot up to 5 times a day (it is more than a mile round-trip every time I walk to my special place and through all the time I am up there doing what I do best--so I am exhausted by the time night comes)...those stupid articles online only tell the CLINICAL definitions (naturally--that is what they are and are supposed to be) and not the people definitions.

I gave it to him, and we talked a bit. The second time I met up with him, he continuously forced me to kiss him, though I was clearly nervous and uncomfortable. He just told me it was adorable and would grab my face and pull me in. I wanted him to like me, I wanted that a lot. The same night, he started to bite my neck, etc. And even begged to touch me when I told him no plenty of times. That's the furthest it went, but I still believed I liked him a lot. As the relationship went on, I noticed he was incredibly shallow. My hair was growing out from being half shaved, so I often wore extensions there to keep my hair looking in that weird 'emo' style. When I didn't wear them, he acted like he didn't like it as much. He'd often tell me what to wear and how to look and I'd listen. The bugging about touching me even progressed to him saying he'd break up with me if I didn't let him. So, I let him. I felt nothing, I didn't want it, but I wanted to make him happy. I thought I was in love with him. Later I'd found out he joked with his friends about keeping me in a basement and raping me. His friends also called me crazy and a wannabe psycho because I had major self harming issues that he happened to tell them about. He also threatened that if I broke up with him, he'd jump off a building. these weird sexual things happened a few more times and eventually I learned to let him do it and do things for him back in attempt to not lose him. Eventually, him being so mean to me made me break up with him. Now, I suffer from feeling like I was taken so early from my childhood, and even so people tell me this was my fault. He manipulated me and used me.

&amp;#x200B;

“Maybe” is a joke... but it’s also a creepy response to a creepy feeling from the evil laughter in Plato’s cave... or the thalasophobia, or the fear of wild animals, or currently my greatest fear - the snowball phobia that can make my body shake violently...

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is, when there is crime (both stalking or vandalism), there is fear of future impulsive and reckless behavior. This creates trust issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine you listen to someone speak and they say that they want absolute power over you and that they want to treat you like a boy, pet, or even “toy”.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine that this person has also hurt you in the past. Would you submit to someone who could cause you emotional pain? Perhaps you would be on your guard... and if you are easily scared like me (like: clinically frightened), you would “paint it black” as you perceive the other as darker than they really are....

&amp;#x200B;

One day, you try to express that you feel persecuted in some way... because the black star of the stood up date, left a scar... or because you had a dissillusion (?) that stars were awarded for humiliating acts of submission... because “Shoot for the stars, to land on the moon”

&amp;#x200B;

and you take to your strongest shield... and try to redefine what celestial objects mean to you.... the haunting moon keeps you up at night...

&amp;#x200B;

//////

&amp;#x200B;

I’m maybe imagining things, but bullying is not OK - let’s make it go away - I can bring some colorful paints. I think being visible with your closest “friend” could improve the situation for everyone. And maybe it is much sweeter than we think... Maybe we both paint it black - because when we are close to something really beautiful, dare I say eternal, we think of ourselves as unworthy.... perhaps played with.... when this is further from the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

And that is the flip switch that splits her feelings into two... “I hate-love you”... because she cannot love herself in a stable way... Not yet..... I’m working on this to help her...

&amp;#x200B;

You are worthy my dear. You always have been. And I want to protect you.

&amp;#x200B;

And the picture that stayed on my retina for so many years... Was it just a plot to suggest to others that there was something deeper there than we wanted (the “hat trick”?), or a plot to make the true ex jealous...

&amp;#x200B;

Was it... was it really true love, that sustained this image? If so, what kind of monster am I to have let this longing pain continue for years and years.... and not resolve it sooner... heal it... embrace it... seal it off from a world of pain and deliver it to the world as the only truth...

&amp;#x200B;

Is the “love you” - LY - a lie? Is the fox also SHY - and that spells Hannibal Lector - HL? (And did you put a book in her mailbox? A nail in the coffin?)

&amp;#x200B;

Or am I Hannibal, because of the brand of my jacket?

&amp;#x200B;

What darkness is there in a character that cheers for villains? Am I the villain? In the past I was darker, because of my illness... not so anymore. But I am still scared.... and paint it black...

The Riddler freaks me out and makes my head spin... A few years ago I couldn’t control it anymore... but now I almost can... I lose focus at work because the riddles take me hours to solve (\~20 possible combinations per riddle, instead of the intended ONE...).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Displacements at a supermarket

Talking walls

Abbreviations and anagrams

&amp;#x200B;

... and then it started to generalize... as if anything people said or painted was aimed at me...

&amp;#x200B;

but in the end, these were just free flowing impulses - ART, if you will - that needed release from a prison that I had built... A sentence that would represent the endless teasing (which was really just due a malfunctioning switch) that I had to endure for two years straight......

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Recover sleep for your brain. Keep impulses in check

&amp;#x200B;

Practise the art of loving kindness and \*self-compassion\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Stop drinking at work. Or is this just my imagination? Have you tested yourself on a questionnaire? It often looks like this pain-numbing behavior is a risk for addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

Regular sleep is the most important!

I am strong enough to save you from others and from yourself. I just needed time to save myself first.

&amp;#x200B;

The LOVE is real. And the stronger it is, the more we dissociate - because of the dopamine - and perhaps the arousal (sex/fear) that triggers our adrenaline. And so we lose sleep... and we become less able to think straight and make errors in judgement. We both have triggers. We both have strong feelings! 

&amp;#x200B;

And maybe there is only one way to hunt the darkness away, to silence the pain, to focus the brain, and to challenge our fear of being abandoned or used:

30,"So, I used to suffer from social anxiety when I was younger and up until yesterday, I thought I had overcome that but now I'm not so sure. A month ago, I was at a wedding and experienced something strange. As I was sitting at the reception table, I looked around and felt as though I was in a dream. I remember thinking, 'how did I get here?'. Even though I logically knew where I was, a part of me was still confused. I have never experienced that before. 

Then yesterday I was at another wedding with my husband and it happened again but this time it was much more intense and lasted for what felt like an eternity. (Please note that I've pretty much been a hermit for the past year and a half so these two weddings were really the only two events where I was forced to socialize with strangers, otherwise I would just stay in my comfort zone.) During the ceremony, I started to experience some mild anxiety but I felt it was normal at that point. Then as time went by, I started to feel more and more anxious. The interactions I was having with people just seemed awkward and I felt like I couldn't relate to anyone. Then I saw an old friend from high school that I haven't seen in forever. I was genuinely trying to connect with her but she was being fake and ignoring me. We had a big disagreement during high school, but I thought we had squashed that long ago. Anyway, during the reception, I was sitting at a table with people I couldn't relate to and I felt uncomfortable the whole time. Then to make things worse, my contacts started drying out and I was having trouble seeing. It was really bothering me and it only made my anxiety worse because not only was I having trouble hearing what people were saying (because it was so loud in there), but then I couldn't even see them. At one point, I went to the bathroom and started feeling different. I can't explain it. But I remember standing in the bathroom stall and just listening to the sound the fan was making and felt like I was in a dream. The environment felt really dark, like I was in a horror movie or something and the sound was tripping me out. I kinda shrugged it off and walked back to my table but as I was about to enter into the reception area, I realized they were in the middle of doing the toasts so I waited for the appropriate time to go in. Once I sat down, I started listening to the groom's brother who was giving his speech. He was very drunk and was slurring throughout his whole speech. Some people were laughing and others were just silent. It was so awkward because he took forever to finish what he was saying and I wasn't sure if this was normal. I kept looking around to see how other people were reacting to him, but since my vision was blurry I couldn't tell what was going on. It made me even more anxious and confused. After that, I kept feeling like I didn't want to be there and like I couldn't relate to the people there. I had this feeling like everyone around me had bad intentions, almost as if they couldn't be trusted. Even my husband started to feel different to me. Then after that, it just seemed like the music was getting louder, the people were getting louder, my vision was getting worse. I just wanted to get up and leave. So, I just left and went to my car. Once I was in the car, I was a little relieved after taking out my contacts but I still felt like I was crazy. I was trying my best to focus on breathing but I seriously felt like I had taken a drug and was experiencing a bad trip. I felt so concerned because I honestly thought I was losing my mind, like I was insane. I kept thinking, 'am I going to be okay? what if this continues to happen? am I going crazy?' I felt so bad for leaving my friend's wedding but I felt like I was on the verge of experiencing a panic attack or a meltdown. 

Today I feel hungover like I took a bunch of drugs yesterday, even though I was completely sober both times (no drugs or alcohol). My head hurts, my jaw feels so tense, and I just feel really shitty. I still have some anxiety/stress but I don't like I'm crazy. Another thing I want to add is that I've been feeling a little depressed these past couple months. I have been feeling negative about my life and I've had a couple of moments where I just break down and cry. I'm feeling lost in life and feeling very alone. 

Has anyone ever experienced this? Or do you have any idea what this could be?",05Nov2018,1
31,"So I have an issue that doesn't feel like an issue to me, even though it's pretty complicated and not exactly ""normal"". I have much greater empathy for (certain) animals than I do for humans. I even find it uncomfortable to bond emotionally with a human, even my family members. Yet, it's so easy for me to connect deeply with animals. The most common ones in real life are dogs, especially dogs of people I know. In fact, I guess you could say that I have more empathy for the dogs than for their owners.

&amp;#x200B;

I've grown accustomed to not bonding emotionally with people, and now it just comes naturally. The only exception right now is my best friend since childhood (we're both guys). We both have Aspergers, so we understand each other's unique ways of thinking a lot better than practically anyone else we know. This only makes our friendship stronger. Also, he's pretty much the only human I know whom I truly have deep love for. I can bond with him without any struggle, but with anyone else I'd find it uncomfortable, and I naturally avoid it.

&amp;#x200B;

My inability to connect with people also crosses over into fiction. Ever since I was a kid, I was much more attached to animal (and non-human) characters than the humans. Because of this, I've found it very hard to get into most movies and shows, since most media has humans and humanoids as the main characters. My favorite shows are Regular Show and The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show and my favorite movies are Ratatouille, Lilo &amp; Stitch, The Brave Little Toaster, The Lion King, and Balto. As you can see, all of those have non-human main characters. I've become very emotionally attached to certain characters from those stories, especially if I relate to them on a deep personal level. The ones I relate to the most are Remy (Ratatouille), Gonzo (The Muppets), Stitch (Lilo &amp; Stitch), Nick Wilde (Zootopia), Lampy (The Brave Little Toaster), and Mordecai (Regular Show).

&amp;#x200B;

I grew even closer with my best friend after I started comparing the two of us to Mordecai and Rigby (I'm Mordecai and he's Rigby). I actually started watching Regular Show in the first place partially because of how I saw a little of us in them. Also, because of the fact that blue jays and raccoons are highly intelligent and adaptable creatures, I started to have more love for the real life creatures, to the extent of even trying to imagine myself as a blue jay and him as a raccoon. I even have blue eyes and he has brown eyes. I also started to become attached to Gonzo and Rizzo from the Muppets, who are even more like us than Mordecai and Rigby.

&amp;#x200B;

I've imagined many conversations between me and these characters, even trying to imagine what it would be like if they were with me. For instance, I remember when I used to watch My Little Pony as a teenager (I'm in my early 20's now), I had a huge crush on Fluttershy (who has many aspie traits like me), to the extent that I imagined her being with me everywhere. I didn't want anything to do with sex, however, because I never really wanted to have sex with anyone or any fictional character, not even if I was married. I'm actually turned off by sexy things.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I know fictional characters will never be truly real, I'd been thinking of getting a dog, or even just befriending one that I can visit often. But there's one problem - I'm sensitive to loud noises (e.g. dogs barking). So whenever I'm with a dog, I have to wear earmuffs, and even then it doesn't block out all the sound. I'm also afraid that it'll turn out that I'm allergic. I also thought of having someone animate my favorite characters talking about stuff relating to me and my life (someone can make a quick animation of the character in question and an impersonator can do the voice), so it feels like they're actually talking to me.

&amp;#x200B;

With all this in mind, I still don't even want to have the ability to make deep emotional bonds with other people. I like not being distracted by people and not having the desire for sex. I actually don't ever want to have a desire for sex. I don't know if there's something wrong with me or what. So, what do you think of my situation and everything else I just discussed?",05Nov2018,1
32,"My friend she asked me a location and charges of subatomic particles. The answer was simple, but I give her nonsense answers and tell her about the locations of periodic table and relating to charges. I feel like useless to her.

33,"My therapist made me fill out a paper today asking what I want the most and my number one answer was freedom. She was confused and she asked what I meant by freedom. 

Freedom to me isn’t my automatic freedom I have for living in America, but instead it’s freedom from my demons. For years my mental illnesses have kept me a prisoner in my body; restricting me from doing something spontaneous or fun. I feel like an outsider and that I can’t tell anyone what’s really wrong with me because then they’ll look at me like I’m a freak. I want to stay normal in their eyes. But it’s hard when I’m battling my inner demons everyday, and everyday is a new day for my illnesses. I could have a really good day and I could be talkative and active, something that feels like freedom. But the next day it can come crashing down into a sudden depressive episode that can last for months. 

I feel like my real self is pushed back into my mind and I can’t control my life the way I want too. I have to live the way my mental disorders do, like they control me. So when I mean freedom I mean breaking away from my disorders that control me and taking back my own self, and creating a life that can be tailored to me, instead of my disorders. I can just imagine what it would feel like, like a breath of fresh air and a weight off my chest and shoulders. Gaining freedom over mental illness is a battle I think and I’m trying to overcome it, I want to live a spontaneous life not a fixed one. ",05Nov2018,1

35,This community has been very helpful to me in finding myself a little more. I have some shitty feelings but honestly I have no reason to feel bad my life is fine and this community helped me come to terms with that.

36,"I will try to keep it short.

1. Person in question for extremely complicated reasons I can't write on internet, can't go to medic right now.

2. Person had something very traumatic happen during childhood, and has obvious PTSD from it (example: nightmares about it every single night, 1000-yard stare when triggered and so on)

That person been seeing 3 specific hallucinations, and I can't figure out if is psychiatric, psychological, and if related to PTSD or not.

1. Extremely vivid hallucinations of perpetrator of trauma, scares the shit out of person.

2. Hallucinations about a favourite cat that died in the past. Reaction to those aren't negative.

3. Person see child version of person. Quoting here: ""sometimes doing good things, sometimes bad, sometimes really, really awfull.""

And after telling me about it, my friend realized there is a clear connection between seeing hallucination 3, and having suicidal thoughts.

So opinions about that? Ideas where I find more information?

37,"So almost a week ago i found out i got accepted into a university i applied to. I know that my mom will be proud of me but i get so nervous and feel anxiety when i tell myself ill tell her, that i dont.

I dont know if its cause i know she'll be proud of me and i feel uncomfortable with that cause i dont want any attention for it at all. I just hate receiving compliments of any kind in general because it makes me uncomfortable. Maybe i feel like i dont really deserve it?

Is there some type of mental illness this relates to?",05Nov2018,1
38,"So my anxiety has seemingly flat-spun out of control over the past couple weeks. I turned 21 two weeks ago and with that have acquired a very bad way of calming my mind and being able to sleep at a semi-reasonable time (strong alcohol in swigs from a flask).
I even brought it to my Army training this past weekend so I could get a little sleep.
I don’t take enough to get drunk, much less tipsy, but one swig is enough to do the job.
Oh and this week I’m going to talk with my counselor about seeing a psychiatrist because I cannot deal with this anymore. The evidence for that conclusion comes from me almost having ANOTHER anxiety attack come from my phone’s alarm this evening. I had a pretty decent attack last Tuesday and, as far as I know, there was no trigger. I was in the middle of a regular conversation and I suddenly felt it come on with just enough time for me to set down my bagpipes and grab my cover before the attack hit, forcing me to go at a dead sprint out of the building and freezing at a railing (4’ drop from the rear balcony with two ramps)

I don’t know what to do and everything has just gone to hell with my schoolwork, research, and I think it’s even taking a toll on my relationships, especially with the woman I am fully certain that I am going to marry.

39,"For the past two years, I've struggled with the idea of identity. The thing, or person rather, that had become my sole purpose and the mold I filled, left. Since then I go through ""phases"". I'll become super into gaming and *only* game. I'll become super obsessed with *research,*  and *only* think about research. Constantly reading articles and seeking out professionals. (which I regret doing once the phase is over). I'll become obsessed with my GPA and academics. Some other phases are: filming documentary, painting, guitar (which I never learned but bought one), my club, religion at one point, activism, streaming, ...

Very weird for me, has happend to me (what I can remember) at least once before. So for my timezone it was sunday yesterday, currently 5 A.M in the morning(monday) now as im writing this. It was a normal sunday, woke up a little bit earlier(around 09:00) than usual. Day went on to about 14:00 and i get a headache(spelling) and i was pretty tired so i slept for a while. Still had headache when i woke up so i took a normal headache pill to get rid of it(usually works 99% of the time).  Now the headache didnt dissapear as fast as it usually does. But anyway, i went to bed later that night and fell asleep, but i remember waking up a few times, and feeling like i never fell asleep. When it was time for me to go to work at 5 a.m in the morning i feel scared, for nothing? I felt terrified but i dont know why. Anyone here that might be able to pinpoint on what this feeling could be?  I googled it and i found articles saying it was a panic attack so hence why i wrote here. Aside from that, my life is perfect, i have a girlfriend, steady job and a own apartment with my girlfriend ofcourse.

But i went ahead, and for about 4 months it effected me so very negitivly i thought id never recover fully and im glad i had help getting thru it from family, I did recover fully.

This drug, where do i start, Well it got rid of my voices in my head but it did many things so harmful, I couldnt enter deep sleep for months, Id have sporadic crying episodes and had a constant fear of everything, I lost intrest in all my fav hobbies, I could only move slowly, I would have random bouts of shreiking and punching walls or rolling on the ground.

Never had i ever been hospilized for my mental illness but this drug landed me in one for over a month.

I drank so much water, and took 100s of dollars of milk thishle, the whole ordeal was a massive strain on me, and I never felt fully better till around late may this year. (the major side effects were gone by late January.)

Ive read online about horror stories of this drug, alot of people post about thier hardships but never check back saying they recovered, Im here to say, if you are in the same boat i was a year ago, and this med is destroying every fabric of your being, know this. it gets better, it just takes a looooong ass time.

49,"I'm hoping this is the right place for this. In March of this year, I almost killed myself. I was honestly maybe 2 hours away from taking a bunch of pills and hoping for the best (worst?). I'm not sure why, but I went and got help before I actually did anything. Part of what my counselor suggested when I told him about my plan was checking myself in to a psych hospital for a few days. He said it could be a good chance for me to reset and get my meds reevaluated. I decided it was the best course of action for me at the time, so I asked him to start the process.

The process of even getting admitted was arduous. He made a call around 2 to get someone out to campus (I'm in college currently) to assess me and go from there. The guy doesn't get out to see me until 8 that night, and they decide to get me to the hospital in an ambulance so they can keep an eye on me. The ambulance didn't get there until 11, and I didn't get checked into the hospital until midnight.

Everything pretty much went down hill from there. I didn't get to talk to anyone who would tell me what was going on with my situation until the third day I was there, and at that point, it was the weekend so there was no hope of a discharge until the following Monday. So here I am, actually trapped in a psych hospital, and I have basically no idea when I'm getting out. I broke down crying my second day there because no one would tell me anything that was going on. They also withheld all the meds I was taking until a saw the doctor, which was 3 days after I got there. 

They treated all of us like children while we were there. We were herded to and from meals and we weren't allowed to do basically anything by ourselves. We couldn't even go outside unless we wanted to smoke. I went out a few times just to get some fresh air, but it's hard to do that when everyone around you is smoking. They also technically had a schedule that they never followed, so none of us had any idea what was in store for us ever. We spent so much time just watching TV in the common room because we weren't allowed to do anything else. 

On top of all this, they kept doing these group therapy sessions that were basically a bunch of mental health technicians talking at us. It was painfully clear that they had never experienced the issues we were dealing with, and they seemed to have a superiority complex because of it. One guy didn't even have a college degree. Yet here he was, thinking he knows all about mental illness and preaching at us to just get better. Because it's all in our minds, and nothing is really that bad that we can't overcome it with sheer willpower.

So I finally get out and go back to college. My friends had been amazing through this process, and they helped me more than anything in that hospital. That was the really frustrating part. I feel like I didn't need to be basically incarcerated to get better. I suspect part of the reason they kept me over the weekend was so they could get more money out of me. After insurance, I had to pay around $1000.

I still feel traumatized by this experience, even though it was more than 6 months ago. I can't sleep sometimes because I keep reliving it. That's why I'm writing this now. I'm too worked up to sleep. I mostly posted this just to get it off my chest, but I'd really welcome any general advice or similar stories with happier endings.",05Nov2018,1

This is my first time using reddit so I am sorry if I am not doing thing 100% correct yet.

I am a 20 year old female and I having a lot of mental health problems. My mom and step father did a lot of not great things to me when they were raising me like shaming punishments, being manipulated to hurt the other parent, being told it was my fault they weren't getting along, being lied to about very important things like my step father not being my biological father, I was told I was just a drain on my family, told my dead father would hate me, yelled at constantly, got in trouble for not participating in the family, got in trouble for things inconsistently or things my siblings did too, I was hit for being disobedient, hit for things that my siblings did, I was hit for crying even when I was crying privately because it was “manipulative”, my mom an awful black eye when I tried to stop her from hitting my sister and she lied about it to everyone and said that I did it to myself to make her look bad, I was forced to sit in time out for consecutive days, forced to eat food I did not like to the point of vomiting and being punished for that, I was sexually shamed for wanting to have privacy, I was given unnecessary enemas and suppositories as a child, I was made to feel like I was a burden, my parents didn't go to my school events, made me stay home excessively and watch my siblings instead of being around friends or doing sports or other extracurriculars, I was not taken to the doctor when I was sick and made to feel bad for being sick, and that is just what I can list off the top of my head. 

When I was 14 my family doctor did a mental health screening and told my mom that we should seek mental health care for depression. Well my mom is stuck in this mindset that people with mental health problems can never lead healthy fulfilling lives and are a burden to society and just kill people. Naturally she refused to take me told the doctor to ""Shut up, don't give her an excuse to act that way"". So my problems have just been going on untreated since then. I am at a point where I have more freedom to do things like seek professional help. However, I currently reside in a very rural area and I do not have access to secular counseling until January due to wait lists. I do not have a car and cannot go to the city 40 minutes away at this time. In the meantime I am looking for things i can do to help fix my mental situation.

So a lot of the problems I am having right now I have had to some extent since I was 14. Some are new and some have really intensified and I feel like my overall mental state is declining rapidly. I would love helpful advice on what I can do to help myself until I can see a professional. My self esteem and sense of self worth are incredibly low. I hate the way I look hate my mannerisms hate my personality. I hold others to much lower standards than myself and forgive others more easily than myself. I am trying to forgive myself and trying to embrace my own uniqueness and beauty and trying to love my genuine self but I don't. It hurts it feels forced to love myself. At times I am scared that if I do not keep myself in line that I will become a toxic negative controlling and abusive person. If I do not restrain myself I will do and say things I will feel guilty about because I feel like I could have hurt someone even if I didn't. I feel like no one will love my genuine me and I will just get made fun of and scorned.

Next fun and cool problem hinted at above, I have extreme social anxiety and a deep mistrust of others. When people do nice things for me I feel like they are doing it to manipulate me. I feel like they want to trick me or hurt me. Maybe they are doing the nice thing so that they can make fun of me behind my back. Or maybe they want to get information from me so that they can use it to hurt me later. There are maybe four people I have ever met where I feel like I can trust them and not have to put a wall to protect myself when I am around them but I have noticed that I am extremely uncomfortable making myself emotionally vulnerable them. I try and it's like some part of my brain shuts off and I am physically unable to tell them that ""no I do not feel happy right now, I am actually really sad"". 

When I talk to other people I get so concerned about how they are perceiving me even long after the conversation ended. I have a hard time interjecting in conversations that I am genuinely interested in taking place near me because I think that no one likes me or wants to hear what I have to say. All in all being around people is exhausting. I am very empathetic to others. If someone else is feeling happy I feel happy if they are angry I get angry too, if they are sad I get sad. If someone cries even if it is a stranger I cry with them. This is exhausting but sometimes the happiest I can be is when I have put myself in there shoes and experience the thrills of their life. 

I also spend a lot of time daydreaming to escape reality and boredom. It started when I was bored on my 40 minute bus rides as a kid. Later I would daydream when I was upset. I have a lot of characters and stories happening in a different world in a different time. It is one of the only things I get enjoyment out of.

I am extremely lonely. I don't know if it is my social anxiety, general self hatred, my general personality, my general lack of energy/interest, or anything else but I have hard time finding people that I make a genuine connection with. I try to be extremely nice and kind to everyone because that is what I would want from others. Most people don't reciprocate which makes me a little sad. I always feel like I get left out of peoples plans or that they don't think of me when they do things or that if they do I am an afterthought. 

I have two people right now that will reliably not cancel their plans to spend time with me and I am very grateful to have them but my social needs are more than what they can fill. I want to have more people that I can spend meaningful time with. I have a hard time finding people that I can make a connection with that: a) reciprocate how I feel and don't make me feel like I am putting in all the work in the relationship and involve me in things that they do or b) don't turn out to have romantic feelings for me. 

I have always had a more difficult time finding female friends than male ones. I am bisexual and get more nervous talking to other women but not as much talking to men. I haven't fully rationalized why other than I feel more different from women than I do with men. That being said when I am trying to make friends I end up trying to make friends with guys more often than ladies. And I just do things that are friendly like ask them about their day listen to them complain etc. I never flirt or act coy or text them a lot or anything. And most of the guys that I have really enjoyed spending time with have drunkenly told me they love me, or we play a group drinking game and it comes out that they have sexual thoughts about me, or they ghost me completely and later down the line someone else tells me its because they had feeling for me and I just feel bad. I feel like I am playing with people’s emotions even when I am very clear I am happily in a committed relationship and I just want a friend. I feel like people only want to be around me because they want to have sex with me and not because they care about me as a friend. And I don't hate or blame them for it. If anything I gave out a wrong signal somewhere or didn't interpret that they were interested in me.

Other relationship problems I am having is that I am having a hard idea with sexual monogamy. I want it to be known again that I am committed to my boyfriend and I would never cheat on him. I respect him too much to ever do anything selfish like that to hurt him or lie to him. I love my boyfriend a lot but I am not sexually excited by him. We almost never have sex, like once a week if I am lucky. I will never pressure him into doing things he is uncomfortable with. I will not pressure him into having more sex. I have voiced my problems calmly and he says that his sex drive is just lower (which is fine) and he does not get a lot of pleasure from sex(which makes me feel bad). I try to be passionate with him and sometimes we have good sex but most of the time neither of us orgasm and it leaves both of us feeling upset. 

This is really hard for me because I have probably loved him the most of anyone I have ever known. We are very compatible otherwise and I feel very safe and loved when I am with him. I do not know if it is solely because of or poor sex or if there other factors at play but I have a lot of sexual thoughts and dreams about other people. I try to shrug it off and ignore it. But it does make me feel guilty that in my mind I am not being faithful to my boyfriend. I also wonder if it because of this that other people get mixed signals from me when I am just trying to be their friend. Just another layer of guilt on top of everything else.

Outside of relationship stuff, I am having other guilt problems. I feel guilty whenever I take time to myself to do things just for me. Like if I sit down and have a bath watch a show by myself I feel bad that I was not doing something productive like coursework for college or applying for internships or cleaning the house or working. I do this bad thing were I pick out all the miscellaneous hours in the week I spent on leisure and tell myself I should have spent them at work. I am paying for my tuition and making enough money to pay the bills is a huge struggle for me and really stresses me out a lot. I cry about it frequently.

Aside from that I do not have any long term goals. I try to set them but it feels hopeless. One roadblock turns into a major setback and then I wonder why I bother caring in the first place. I set achievable goals for myself and they feel fake and unlikely. I achieve some of these goals and they just do not feel like me. I feel like I forced myself passionlessly towards them and they have no meaning to me, but hey I did it. I feel like every time I care about some goal it gets taken away from me or made impossible. I feel like it is dangerous to like things and the way things are because they will change to something I hate. I am having a really hard time finding anything I care about to work towards.  I am enrolled in college only because I thought it was the next logical step for me. My life is stagnant and I feel like I made a mistake picking my major. I am going to graduate but it isn't going to mean anything to me. Everything feels useless. 

At this point I am slow to respond to opportunities that come my way because not many come to fruition. And I know this is not helping me. But it hurts me a lot when these things don't work out for me.

But if I live in the moment I am just going to fuck everything up for myself. If I stop forcing myself to care about making my life better for myself in the future in case I enjoy living my life I will destroy everything. If I give in I will just drop out start making 22k/yr spend everything I don't spend on rent on cigarettes alcohol and weed. 

On drugs, I only occasionally drink and smoke. I drink on the weekends and smoke maybe once a month. I don’t really have a lot of time or money to spend on it. But it does make me happy and relaxed and feel more open and able to tolerate being around people more. But I want it to be known that I am not doing these things to excess.

My moods are oppressive. One day I might be sad and on the verge of tears for no reason. Twice a week one thing will set me over the edge and I will cry uncontrollably for 20-40 minutes. Other days I may feel numb and unattached to my body. These days are frightening because everything looks different. Its like things look the realest they have ever while simultaneously looking warped skewed and ugly. I have days where I am on edge constantly. Just jittery and impatient, apprehensive and scared. I would say I have two days a week that are emotionally the close to normal. Like I don’t wake up sad and feel ok or maybe even happy most of the day. They usually coincide with my work shifts. I guess being at work and doing something productive there really relieves a lot of the tension I have. But there are bad days were I go to work and can not escape my feelings and feel bad because I feel like I am annoying those around me. And that sucks.

I do not sleep well. Most nights I get five or so hours of sleep. I have a nighttime ritual that starts at the same time on weeknights of brushing my teeth and flossing and washing my face and all of that and I give myself 30 extra minutes to lay in bed and relax before I need to be asleep to get a full 8 hours. Nonetheless I usually don't fall asleep for 2-3 hours every night I lay down because of my anxiety. And I wish I could control these things and not dwell on them but its like every night everything I did wrong that day or weird embarrassing stuff from my past creeps through my mind and keeps me up. I try to calm myself and daydream but the thoughts always end up back in the front of my mind. And then when I do manage to sleep I have nightmares about everyone hating me, people tricking me or framing me for things, nightmares where I am being chased down endless hallways that turn into other weirder hall ways of places I have only been once or twice. At least once a week I have a nightmare where I am raped or where my stepfather is trying to kill me. These dreams usually put me in the worst moods the next day and generally happen around 2-3 am and I can't sleep after them. Because of this I am exhausted most days. And then there are nights were I pass out immediately and sleep for 12 hours. And I don’t even feel rested afterwards.

I do not have much of an appetite. I force myself to drink water and eat but it never feels good. I almost never crave foods. On the bright side of never craving foods I force myself to eat healthy. I avoid fried food and carb only meals. I eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables and chicken. I often think back to how good things tasted when I was younger and get really sad about it.

Hobbies that once made me feel good are only a source of frustration if I can even get myself to do them. There are many times where I do not have anything to do and I can't even get myself to pick up my guitar or put a pen to paper and draw. I just don't have the energy to do it.

I am in a lot of pain daily. My body is always sore. My legs are tense. My back hurts. I get 3 hour migraines at least once a week. I have weird stomach aches and diarrhea 2-4 times a week. Most of this stuff is unexplainable but the stuff that is seems to linger a lot longer than it should.

Not to overly concern or alarm anyone but I do not want to be alive anymore. I have been dealing with this feeling on and off since I was 15 and haven't done it yet so don't worry. There does not seem to be a purpose for me to be here. I do not get enjoyment from even eating or sleeping most days. I rarely feel happy naturally (I force myself to look and act happy frequently) and when I do feel happy it is so fleeting it hurts. I have never attempted suicide and probably won’t. I don’t want to hurt those around me who care about me. I used to tell myself that it was selfish of me to kill myself when I can change the world and make other people’s lives better but slowly it seems to be that I can’t even make my own life better so how am I going to help others. 

I end up thinking about suicide often but I try not to plan it. But I wish I was dead frequently. I just don’t want to be in pain and suffer any more. So if anyone wants to give me any useful advice for what to do moving forward from here I would really appreciate it.",05Nov2018,1
51,"Be it depression , borderline personality disorder or anxiety disorder, I'm not the only one who is struggling , it's my family who is struggling too in silence.Depression is a mood disorder which affects me , hampers my daily life but it's not bothering me alone , my family suffers to..My Behavior, my actions , my moods everything affects my family. I feel bad at times that why my struggle is becoming their struggle!? Why are they suffering!?I don't have answers to these questions, they are affected because they love me , they care about me , they support me endlessly.While struggling with so much , my only constant support is my family, my sister , my younger brother, my brother in law , especially my parents who never say anything but understand everything silently. I don't have to think about calling them up , texting them never bothers me , I know they are standing beside me in all my highs and lows.It's very important to have your family support when you are battling any mental illness , I'm lucky to have such an understanding family who understands me so well. When I was diagnosed with depression and BPD , I didn't open up about these to my family, they knew I'm on medication they knew I'm suffering but they never forced things upon me and when things came out in open , their support is unbelievable. Handling my depression is difficult but they handle me so well that at times i feel what would I have done without them.Be it travelling to so many states from Delhi to Bangalore to Manipal , to the expenses of these trips and my treatment you never said a word , you agreed to everything, every treatment more than I do..I know I'm not full of gratitude or I can't thank you enough, but I have to thank you for being such understanding parents , I never imagined things would ever be like this. When I say BPD , this disorder disturbs everyone around me , my emotional regulation is so weak that it's my family who is affected the most , my self harming hurts them more than it hurts me , my crying , my isolation worries them more than it bothers me.I want to say thank you to all six of you and really want to apologise that you people are suffering along with me .

52,"This has been happening to me for a very long time. I cannot seem to decide what i want to do with my life, i am interested in a lot of things ranging from cooking, music making, graphic design and even psychology. But i cannot seem to pinpoint what it is a want to do, my desires only last for maybe 2-3 months and then i suddenly want to do something else and become disinterested in anything else.

I have been diagnosed with depression and very often suffer long bouts of low moods, but when i come out of a low mood my interests change and i almost become obsessed in my current interest as well as feeling incredibly optimistic about my newfound interest.

I never really noticed this until recently but it has been a huge issue in my life, i started University this year but i have been struggling since i keep losing interest in my studies and i keep wanting to suddenly do something else. This also effects other parts of my life as i am always moving from one thing or the other and never really working at any one thing.

well, thanks for reading and if anyone has any thoughts about any of this, i would appreciate it.

My father died approximately 2 years ago had to be strong for younger siblings cried slightly on the way but outward appearance tough guy not affected by much. I do miss my dad. I'm not particularly good at showing emotions. A couple months later I also lost my job and my wife thought I was suicidal for clearance I was not just figured it was a pretty shitty streak of bad luck. 
My younger brother is an unreasonable human being basically holding my father's ashes ransom and is abusive whenever the subject comes up.

I am married and was watching coco with my wife and at the end I literally had to leave the room and went to the bathroom where I cried for a solid 5 minutes. Wife asked if I was okay and told her I just needed to go to the toilet thinking about it makes me upset.

Not really sure if I got over it as it was sudden and looking for advice on here. Same thing happened when I watched a monster calls.

Is it just these films making me relate or should I look into counselling/therapy?

56,"Long story short, I’ve been on some ups and downs the past couple years. I started having symptoms of depression and stuff like that in 5th grade, going on until middle school. That was awhile ago. I feel like these symptoms change every once in a while though, which really confuses me. One half a year I have suicidal thoughts, the other I get over it but have a lot of self doubt and really low self-esteem. This has been going on until now. I try to blame it on puberty but this doesn’t feel right.

Right now, suicidal thoughts come and go. I also have a habit of dislocating from reality if that even makes sense. One day I’m alright, another in sad as crap. Another thing I noticed is that my  self esteem has just seemed to be really low recently out of nowhere. Every day I try to be positive, but I just never have that one “good” day if you know what I mean. They’re all just mediocre or bad. I have passions and goals that I do pursue, and I do feel accomplished and proud of myself but still crave more...and don’t feel satisfied. 

One of the last main weird things happening is my shyness. It’s weird. At school I act like myself. Chill and whatever. At home I am the quiet one and feel so left out. It’s gotten to a point where I’m too embarrassed to talk to my sister. I still can talk though, but my shyness goes on and off. With me feeling like the odd one out. I just cry a lot when I sleep and just feel lonely and helpless.

I don’t feel loved, but everyone I know supports me.

I feel suicidal, but the next day I’m over it.

I feel proud of my accomplishments, but then compare myself to others and get really jealous or disappointed with myself.

Please help. These last few years have been harsh on me and I don’t know if I should end it or not. Thank you so much:",05Nov2018,1
57,"So I’m diagnosed with prolonged psychosis, I hear voices that aren’t there, so I’m told the voices are thoughts in my head. However when my psychosis hits I feel like the voices are exterior like someone is actually tormenting me in the attempt to make me insane. I get paranoid of everyone, and this causes great trust issues, where I don’t even trust psychiatrists, family, institutions . I have to keep my beverages always capped cause I believe someone is trying to poison me. I get so bashed on by voices sometimes that I get so pissed off I can’t even feel emotion as my wife cries for my current mental state.  I used to cry so easily, I’m scared I’m being desensitized and my heart is shrinking because of these horrible voices. I take anti psych meds I’ve taken zyprexa abilify resperidal however I find I feel like a zombie on the pills and life is grey. I stop taking my pills for this reason and I usually end up doing meth which makes me truly Insane and in my own world. I have many delusions now but am too scared to speak of them because of who might be listening. I write a lot and it’s mostly very sad, crazy, and dark. I used to be such a positive person. I still am when I poke my head out and finally break through and rise up out of the muck of my soul, yet that is rare and always a breath of fresh air. I long for pure silence in my head.

58,"Thought id write something here in a vain attempt to reach out to someone who may have some experience with this.

I'm a 22 year old guy, with ADHD and anxiety disorder and currently suffering from depression. I have spent the past few years after leaving school trying to figure myself out. I've explored medication for ADHD, but overall iv had a severe decline in my own mental health which has been especially bad over the course of 2018. 

I've resolved to get myself back to study, as I feel university is something that would be good for me. But with the next university intake being in 2019 im staring down 3 months without ANYTHING to do.

Each day is a struggle, thinking on the next three months with NOTHING sends me into a panic, feelings of existential dread as it feels my life is being wasted. 

I have close friends who I see weekly, but they are wrapped up in their own lives and its hard to be around them sometimes, as when they speak of exam stress and all the stuff they are doing, I'm grimly reminded of how hollow my own life is. This often comes out as either suppressed resentment or just unbearable sadness.

I'm trying desperately to think up of things to do, trying reach out and get myself involved. But everyday is a struggle, sometimes im so tired that im not sure if im awake, I can't remember the last time I felt Joy, I spend much of my days alone that when I do interact with people I have to remind myself how to interact normally, and I'm looking at many months of this ahead.

59,"TRIGGER WARNING: Contains subject of self-harm and suicide

I am so done with everything. I hate this world. My exams are coming up and I can’t remember ANYTHING. I’ve tried to study for hours on end. But. I. Still. Can’t. Do. Anything. 

I get so frustrated I end up crying and self-harming. I don’t cut but I scratch my arm as hard as I can with the sharp ends of my nails until it bleeds or when there’s raised lines. 

My parents are no help either. They’re always like “just do your best and it’ll be fine, you have way too high expectations for yourself”, but when I do get a bad score they’re always disappointed. My expectations aren’t even high either, I just want to pass. But I can’t. My school is well known for its academically high standards and I just can’t keep up. I’m in an extension class so our exams are going to be way harder. 

I also have anger issues. When I get mad or frustrated I lash out at people and even threaten to kill them. Especially to my family. I just can’t control it, I feel like I want to break or hurt something and sometimes I do. I have so much homework and so little time. I sleep at 12am and wake up at 4am to try and complete it but I can’t. I’m extremely stressed out and now I’ve basically given up. I’m not even bothered to study or do the homework anymore. I’m just so done. 

It’s not just about the exams or homework either. I’m just so sick of everything in general. There’s literally no point in living. We go to school and then work until we die, sounds great, doesn’t it? I’ve been depressed and suicidal since I was 10 or 11 but never really tried to do it.  I’d always wished death upon myself and even once wished I had cancer so I could die (please don’t be offended, I know this isn’t something one should wish for when there’s actual people dying of cancer). 

The trigger that made me strangle myself was the exams, It was the tip of the iceberg. It wasn’t the main reason why I did what I did, it just made me realise that I’ve had enough. Only half an hour ago I did it. I was in the bathroom crying from a mental breakdown and my right arm was covered is scratches. I had pull the plastic tag thing that comes on rubbish bags and circled it around my neck. Then I pulled on it. I don’t exactly remember what happened but I fell unconscious, but only for a few seconds (I’m presuming but I’m not quite sure). Then I woke up and lifted my head from the mirror in which I had collided with when I fainted (but I didn’t feel it) and there was a dazed moment where I was confused what had happened and asked myself mentally in the mirror, “Is that really me? Am I still alive?”. Then I did it again because I didn’t quite believe that I just fell unconscious. I could see my vision blurring and turning almost black when I let go and immediately collapsed the the ground. Shockingly enough I tried it the third time, except I stopped pulling before I could collapse. 

Don’t tell me that I’m selfish for feeling depressed just because of school, I know I am. I know that I have it better off than some people. Yes, I do realise that life is important and that I should enjoy it. And also yes, I have told my parents about how I feel about everything to them but they don’t care. They’re loving and great parents, really, but they just don’t understand my situation.

I really just want to curl up in a ball and die. It’s been 3 years since I realised how depressing life was, and it isn’t getting any better. Sure, “I’m young and have many opportunities ahead of me” but how am I suppose to have opportunities if I fail this (very important) exam that decides my future. I can’t do anything. I really can’t.

I’m an 18yo M and I’ve had some trouble being social all my life but not externally more internal I grew up with a sense that I wasn’t cool, I was boring, people were laughing at me not with me, I was ugly, that I was a complete screw up, etc but on the outside what people saw and told me was that I was smart, funny, good looking, and was a solid guy. I don’t know exactly when this started happening I just remember middle school was when it really crept it and it stayed with me since high school till I started having panic attacks, paranoia, and delusional thoughts. I would never tell anyone cause my family doesn’t believe in these sort of problems and was so focused on how it would make me look bad so I kept my mouth shut till it got so bad that I wasn’t able to be calm anywhere so I started doing coinciding my senior year. Eventually my councilor concluded that I have anxiety and depression and the delusions and paranoia cane from having multiple panic attacks from bottling up everything that was going on in my head, we got to work on it and I got to the point that I don’t have panic attacks, the paranoia and delusions are gone, and my anxiety and depression has been reduced. But I still just don’t feel better I have a fear of intimacy that has made it impossible for me to go beyond being friends with the opposite sex which is alright at the moment cause I’m still working on myself at the moment anyway but there’s also this hollow feeling I have a lack of felling connected with my friends an family which I can only explain as loneliness I also lack any hobbies besides video games and even that is becoming uninteresting to me, I fell like I need more in my life but idk what it is can anyone relate or say something that might help?",05Nov2018,1

Having either of these would definitely explain my recent decline in concentration ability that seems to have gotten gradually worse over the past two years. I'm aged 17 if that's important.

Said boyfriend is my only solace it seems, and well, sex is my only stress relief. I’m lucky if I get to see him once a week. 

Job is sh!t, don’t get paid enough for what I do and the hours and shifts are ridiculous. Management doesn’t exist and administration is blind. Whatever. Old news.

Now, I’m on birth control, just started it at the end of September, so I’m halfway through my second pack. It seems as though I’ve gained some depression as a side effect from it.

I’m now doing a mixture of 2 melatonin with blankets, sound machine, and breathing exercises to sleep. It’s kinda working, I guess.

I’ve had a history of self harm and it’s been months since I’ve done it last, even though it seems like years since I’ve last thought of it. My boyfriend is the reason for that, he’s my silver lining in all of this. Such a patient and understanding guy, I feel like I don’t deserve him most of the time, haha. But these ideation are back. Not fully, but I catch myself thinking about things I wish I wouldn’t. It’s scary, cuz I know the road it leads down, and I want to ask for help, but it also could be temporary and I don’t want to bother anyone.

I said this would be short, whoops.

I just wanted to vent I guess, and I’m kinda hoping someone will tell me if I’m being overdramatic or if I should have genuine concern or reason to feel this way, and what I should do, cuz I’m lost. Lol",05Nov2018,1

I sleep whenever and wake up whenever. I stay up very roughly 24 hours at a time, frequently more, and sleep 14. I don't shower regularly. I don't eat regularly. I miss my meds. Im so frustrated because I was in a better place. The world is out to get me right now. My country is a mess and current politics are affecting my mental health severely. Therapists don't know what to say when you have a valid reason to be freaked the fuck out. I think I'm transgender and I have no idea how to process those feelings. I don't know who I am. I don't know where I belong. I never want to be a person who just takes, I want to help people and I can't right now because I'm in such bad shape myself. Everytime I try to get things together I just stop caring at some point. I can't even make myself do things I *want* to do. How am I supposed to make myself do things I don't want to?

I feel like I dont deserve the help and should just give up. I mean what stops me from making the same stupid mistakes again. Im way too stupid to improve so why should i even. Im meant to be this way a fucking bother to everyone. I take so much from people. I try to repay with money but compared to the love they give me thats worth nothing. I keep dissapointing to them. ""We trust you X, you're a smart person."" *me failing ther expectations*. ""Ah well X everyone makes mistakes"". Well i dont think someone makes the same giant mistake 3 times in a row and still not realise it or learn from it. I just have to let them forget about me so i wont hurt them when im gone. I already got it kinda planned. In 3 years or so im going to take a trip to japan and end it there. I hope i grow apart from them in that time so i can do it without hurting anyone.

67,"So I have reactive attachment disorder, autism, severe depression, ocd, and for some reason I can’t thing of the others rn they’re not relevant to the situation. So the first 3 are pretty relevant to this. A little over a year ago I was expelled forever for having 5 school shooting memes on my phone and the repercussions ever and the social detachments was the worst thing I wouldn’t ever wish it on anyone ever. So I waited a week to see how things would pan out and as I said a bunch of terrible things happened to my life and one thing was the worst thing ever I said before (I’m not gonna say what it is) and I’ve pictured kms like a billion times and the school had like a billion meetings with various people and departments throughout the year and one day I found out that it was only because of my autism (and the memes) that it was but I would’ve been just fine if I wasn’t autistic. So now I can’t get a job or get into a college and I just lay in my bed all day everyday and shower like once a week and I can’t drive and I haven’t had any friends for several years so I can’t just do something.

I've been quite stable(well with minor ups n downs) but I've seemed to be triggered and have been dissociating like crazy as of lately. If you're unfamiliar with these feelings, I feel like I'm trapped in a snow globe or I'm like a puppet and someone is making me do things- like I'm being controlled. I honestly don't know what's real or if I'm real. Anyways! It's been getting pretty annoying to deal with. I guess it doesn't really affect me that badly but I feel kinda suspicious of everyone which I know is not very good. It's like I'm in this weird mixed dissociating, slightly sad but happy state. I wouldn't say it's as far as a mixed episode. I was thinking maybe I should go to the hospital? Get monitored on my behavior? (I live in Canada so price isn't an issue + minor).

70,"\*He is not diagnosed. I'm not trying to do so. I only want to help him and be there for him... A lot of symptoms of depression checks. For the lack of my knowledge and understanding I will refer to his episodes as depressive ones. My apologies, guys.    


My (20F) boyfriend (21M) has these episodes every two months or so. They usually last few days (3-5). Out of the sudden (on a date, hanging out with friends, alone at home) he:

shuts me off, becomes unresponsive and detached, isolates himself, loses interest in doing anything, stops moving or talking, doesn't respond to texts or calls, lies down for hours, browses Twitter endlessly, plays the piano for hours, doesn't eat or drink, avoids eye contact, leaves my place suddenly and goes home... 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried talking to him about it many times (patiently and lovingly, no assuming, no pressuring, actually trying to listen and understand, no blaming), and always after the episode has ended, but he does not want to for reasons uknown to me. However, I've started noticing a pattern and from my point of view it's reocurring without any obvious stressors, and its getting worse every time and I want to act and adress it as soon as possible. I've started educating myself about mental health and how to be supportive for my loved one. Good people of Reddit... here I am lost, though. How can I be there for him if we are not living together and he's avoiding me while he's depressed\*? ",05Nov2018,1
71,"I know the title may seem vague and irresponsible, but it goes a long way back stemming from diseases and depression.

My mother (46), has been in multiple car accidents that resulted in her going through multiple surgeries in her neck and back. Simply put, she never fully recovered from the pain. Fast forward a few years and she was later diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Before her accident, she was the very best mother anyone could ever have. I really did appreciate her a lot. However, things took a large turn the following years after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. 

The pain was constant and she never found a way to fully get rid of it. She coped with severe daily pain for almost 10 years. In addition, my father, who was also caught cheating once before my mother's accident, grew jaded of the situation that my mother was in and completely fell out of any semblance of support. He stopped earning enough money to fully support our home and we were evicted into a much smaller 1 room apartment. To this day, we worry if we would be able to afford even this apartment at all. Regardless, he would constantly ignore my mother and find getting medication to be an annoyance. He would never take her seriously and would yell at her for not doing anything, when in fact, she was trying her best to keep up. No matter all the pain medication, depression medication, or medication for her side effects (constipation, sleep deprivation, migraines, etc) , he would always find a way to blame her for the lack of money, and quite frankly, the lack of sex he was getting. In fact, he once told her to go get a job in her state where now, she has fatigue to the point where even washing the dishes would cause her to collapse on the bed with cold sweats. But I digress. 

No matter how many times I tell my mother to leave him, she says its too difficult to leave, since she is a South Korean born native who cannot speak fluent English nor is she able to get by with a job. So instead, she accustomed herself to find me (21 M) as her only source of emotional support. Ever since I was 10 years old, I've grown up watching everything from afar. I was the only one by her side and I was the only one that could make her feel better. My mother has no where else to go, since her relationship with her own parents in Korea worsened due to our financial situation and she wasn't able to visit my grandmother at her time of need (surgery). The rest of her family also lives in SK, which I wouldn't be able to go to since I'm still in the last year of college. Due to all these events, she slowly grew more and more depressed. Regardless if we had a good day, she would get pessimistic and anxious. The psycholgists that she visited to treat her depression only worsened it, as they basically compared her to a drug addict, considering her long list of medications and said it was all in her head. Now she is afraid to even see a trained professional. She closed herself off to only me. She lost all her friends to distance and time. And now she has no self confidence in herself.

I find my mother to be the most important person in the world. But as of late, I feel as if I lost what made my individuality. I feel obligated to fill in my father's shoe as my mother's only emotional support. Like all young adults, I want to be able to pursue my dream, eventually marry my significant other whom I am in a long distance relationship with. There is just a burden that stays with me whenever Im with my mother. I know im supposed to help her, but her stubbornness to stay with my father only brings me down as well. No matter how much I go out with her, how much I care for her and do all the housework to make her life easier, no matter how much I genuinely try to make her day better, she finds a way to blame me for not caring. I've never in my life regretted spending time with her. But there are times where her words are sharper than nails. She makes me out to be just like my father whenever I mess up. Whenever I dont do what my mother expects me to do. Whenever Im happily enjoying my own time when my mother is sad. Its almost as if Im expected to be sad with her, when she fights with my father almost everyday. My words are always drowned out and my ideas never matter. It makes me doubt myself as a son. I feel trapped, just as trapped as her. Not because of pain, but an obligation to always be at her side. Not on my own will but hers. I wish it never turned out this way. It honestly feels like a never ending maze.

How do we go about situations like these? Am I selfish for wanting to think about myself in this situation? How do I get her to let go while assuring her that i'll still be there for her? What can she do to make her life better? Im afraid I'll lose everything.",05Nov2018,1
72,"I think I might have depression. A lot of the time I don't feel sad I just feel nothing. I'd like to go see a doctor but I have some things I need to sort out first so it'll probably be about a month before I can go. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **no motivation / can't concentrate**. I have trouble concentrating on anything. I have 2 final exams for uni within the next week and I've hardly studied for either. I'll try watching a lecture recording but I just can't concentrate on what is being said and have to keep rewatching things. Same with reading, anytime I see a chunk of text (whether it be for study or even just online) I just glaze over it, it takes multiple attempts to properly understand it. Before this I think I was pretty normal, I'd procrastinate my work but when I need to I can sit down and get it done. Now it's a huge struggle. I've handed in so many late assignments this semester just because I didn't care and couldn't get myself to do it. It's not because I don't like what I'm studying because I truly love my course, the lecturers are great and I'm genuinely interested in what I'm studying but right now I just can't. it's just exhausting to me.

this also applies to things I want to do outside of uni. There are so many things I want to do but even when I have free time I just don't. It feels like I just physically do not have the energy to do things. 

\- **memory problems?** sometimes it feels like I have trouble remembering things. my mind just seems to be all over the place and I have trouble remembering little things throughout the day and holding on to my thoughts. hours and days can go by and I have trouble remembering what I did. I can remember the big stuff but everything else just seems to slip through.

\- **no emotional memory.** following on I have no recollection of how I feel. Like I know last week I went out with a friend and I know I had fun and at the time it felt like the most fun I've had in a long time but I can't remember what that feels like now. It's like someone told me about and I just know it factually. I also have bouts of 'bad mental health' (discussed below) but when I get out of it I can't imagine what it feels like. Like i know at the time it was terrible and everything but I can't remember it anymore

\- **can't feel.** I also have feel like I have trouble feeling emotions if that makes sense?? A bit one for me is feeling excited. I feel like I've never been excited. I see other people being excited and I wonder if they are feeling something that I don't or if they feel the same as me and are just being exaggerated in their 'acting' of the emotion. but that being said I don't feel much else either...

**- periods of 'bad mental health'.**  Every now and then I get into a bout of really really bad mental health. I feel really really terrible, can't do anything, everything feels like a huge struggle. I get a really strong urge to drink a lot (I don't normally drink) and to punch walls although I don't actually do any of this. I don't think I'm suicidal but when I'm like this I wish a 'tragic accident' would occur. Also lots of crying. But at the same time I feel like I also enjoy it to some degree because at least feeling bad breaks up the monotony of feeling nothing. I think it normally lasts around a week although I don't really know. I know it's happened twice last year and at least twice this year but I haven't kept count. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this makes sense at all. It seems just like a big rant, I've never put all of what i'm thinking down like this before. At this point I don't know whats normal and whether this is somethine to be concerned about. I think all this started about 1.5 years ago (?? can't be sure) although it's been particularly bad in the last few months. 

Despite all of this there's a part of me that feels like I'm just making it up for attention or because I want an excuse or something and the logical part of my brain knows that this is ridiculous but that nagging thought is still there.

The adderall helps me get up and out for work without feeling blasé and/or unmotivated/sleepy; but it has always had an issue of not lasting and I don't want to take XR because then I won't sleep. 

My antidepressants help a little but I am having more anxiety attacks--to which I got temporary meds for that. But my PCP knows these won't help (antidepressant+antianxiety) but it will hold me till the Psychiatrist appt in the beginning of December.

81,"So I'm gonna dive right in; been dating my SO for 10 years. He's a regular dude, not super affectionate or very touchy-feely but a very loving bf. He's quite introverted and he shows affection less by physical touch or cuddling but more in an action oriented way, he moved countries to be with me, is very supportive of all my endeavours, and he truly believes in all my insane ideas and obvs loves me even after a decade. (Both early/mid-thirties btw.)

&amp;#x200B;

One thing is weird though, he reacts very poorly to touch, even if it's meant to be affectionate. He immediately pulls away if i'm just casually touching him while say, sitting on the couch watching a movie. Not always, but very often, especially if he's concentrating on something else. The more immersed he is in something else, the more... jerky, or abrupt his pulling away is. He pulls away like he's being burned or something. 

It's very bizarre at night, when if i'm just accidentally touching him he jerks away very violently and seems angry. I'm not even talking about me going in for a hug or something after he's asleep, but more like a minor touch like my leg brushing his while i turn in bed and he's falling asleep or asleep.

He had a rough childhood, but we don't really talk about it. His father was an alcoholic, and, while not physically violent from what my bf said, was at least verbally abusive towards his mother. Never towards bf or his sisters, but enough for his mother to be terrified and sometimes going to bed with the kids instead of in the matrimonial bedroom.

So anyway my bf's behaviour affects me and thus our relationship in a very negative way. I feel intensely rejected by him refusing to even brush against me while we're hanging our or sleeping, and his outbursts at night scare me a little and i feel like they clearly indicate some sort of post traumatic behaviour. I get that people are more or less touchy-feely than others but as i said, he jerks away very violently, curses, turns around and basically leaves me there, wide awake and not understanding what just happened. 

I'm ashamed to say this makes me angry, first the rejection (we also have sex super rarely but i'm not really bothered by that at all) but i miss physical affection and secondly the anger that he displays during those moments i described above.

I've suggested he maybe look into it, see or talk to someone about his (maybe) traumatic past, but i'm also not the most empathetic person and i don't want him to feel attacked or like i'm implying he has some mental issue (which i am, i know there's something going on and my first thought was either that he was abused or suffered some other trauma)...

So.. i don't know... help? Is this behaviour as unusual as i feel it is? Do you guys have experienced something like this at all?

Hi friends. I am a medical student going into psychiatry. I wanted to share some basic information on ECT. From working in the clinics, I’ve seen many people who drastically improved from getting these treatments, but I also know there is a lot of misinformation about it, no thanks to the media.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is ECT?**

* ECT stands for electroconvulsive therapy. It delivers a small, controlled current through your body and induces a generalized seizure under anesthesia. 

**What is ECT used for?**

* It is mainly used to treat severe depression resistant to medications, but it can also be used for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and catatonia.

**Is ECT safe?**

* Absolutely. It is one of the safest procedures performed under anesthesia. Mortality rate is less than 1 per 100,000 treatments. It is proven to be safe to be used even during pregnancy.

**Is ECT effective?**

* When combined with proper medications, it is much more effective than medication alone. Studies show lessened depression score and decreased rate of relapse. 

**Is actual ECT like how they depict it in the movies?**

* Portrayal of ECT in the media is problematic. In these depictions patients are often seen awake, shaking violently, and experiencing pain, akin to a torture. None of these are accurate. ECT is done under general anesthesia so it is completely painless, and with muscle relaxer so there is little to no shaking. 

**What are possible adverse events from ECT?**

* Most common complaint is headache. Transient nausea, dental and tongue injuries may also occur. Some may experience some memory loss after ECT, but for many it is temporary, generally resolving within a week. There, however does exist risk of permanent or persistent memory loss. Regardless, the typical ECT patient is very depressed and accepts some degree of memory loss as a reasonable tradeoff for resolution of the depressive episode. As the procedure is done under anesthesia, small risks exist for its usage. 

**How many treatments are required?**

* Frequency varies, and there are no hard and fast rules. In the United States, the treatment is typically given 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). Most patients require 6 to 12 treatments but some only require 3 while others require 20 or more.

It is my hope more people who could benefit from this treatment utilizes this in the future. Has anyone here have experience with ECT?",05Nov2018,1
88,"Hey, not sure if this is the right place to ask. I am new to Reddit and this is a throwaway account. Also English is not my first language so I apologize for any mistakes I may make.  


So, this one is a little difficult to explain. I have started to get a feeling that people around me are not real 'beings'. I mean, they obviously are and I recognize that they are. But sometimes I tend to forget that they actually exist next to me and I feel like I am alone in the current space until I look at them and actually go through the thought process that they are there and they possess a mind.   


Not sure how to put this clearly, sometimes I feel like they are just like any other objects in the room, like a phone or a hairbrush, like they have no feelings, no life. So far this has not caused any trouble as when I recognize their appearance I behave accordingly.   


If any of this makes sense, could this be an indicator of the beginning something serious? Should I consider going to talk to someone about this? Do any of you have had similar feelings before?  


I should note that I have been more stressed out as before for I have broken one of my legs so I can not use it at all and it has made life a little more difficult by not being able to go to store or school on my own and thus, I have spent a lot more time on my own in the comforts of my home. I live with two roommates so I am never fully alone for an extended period of time.

93,"Hello. I am going to make this short and sweet so I don’t keep anyone here too long. I just had a few questions regarding a psychotic break that I had and was wondering if anybody experienced this as well.

-after your psychotic break, does literally every memory that you have feel foreign to you? Like oh wow, a week ago I was fine and I went to the water park with my friends. But it seems so... foreign to think about. (real memories, not false ones) 

-when you were having your psychotic break, do you remember some parts of it where you were conscious and aware of everything, but you were too sick/delusional to believe that people were NOT out to get you? I remember freaking out about this, I remember hearing my friends outside my window out to get me and I kept trying to go outside to just let them take me away with them and get it over with my but gf was holding me with all of her strength to not let me get up. 

-do you have significantly long false memories where you couldn’t tell if you actually experienced this awake and hallucinated it or dreamt it? I have a false memory that is VERY vivid where I owed this famous rapper money ($500,000) and I couldn’t get it to him. So he wanted to kill me. 

-do you have a false memory of dying/trying to die?

-after a psychotic break is over, do you feel some sort of breakthrough? after this first episode, I do not want to take anything for granted. I flushed everything and threw all my stuff away like my pipe for my weed, my other meds that weren’t necessary (klonopin and left over xanax) and I just want to turn my life around. I want to be a better person for myself and everyone else. 

This all happened last week. I was off my meds and doing drugs like coke, marijuana and benzos (xanax and klonopin) (Zoloft 50mg. Not that high of a dose but I kept that dosage for 2 years) I wasn’t sleeping at all on top of that. And I was already horrible depressed due to my living situation (it wasn’t the best) 

Now I am at my parents, sober, trying to turn my life around and I don’t want to look back at all. I hate the past me because I was so toxic and I feel like this episode really meant something for me to try to turn my life around. ",05Nov2018,1

98,"background: im a 20 year old college student (female)

I've been on prozac on and off for a few years (for depression), recently my dose went from 20mg to 40mg, to 60.

I've been on Evekeo (a new ADHD stimulant) for about three years. No noticeable side effects from either medicine. My prozac was bumped up to 60mg in august, and ive been taking that dosage consistently for about two months. For the past month or so, I have been extremely anxious, jittery, sometimes my hands shake so badly i cant write notes for class. it is to the point where it is interfering with my schoolwork and extracurriculars (i am a TA and i can't even teach the students without constant stammering, sweating, and shaking. it's humiliating to be watched struggling like that.)

My hands are constantly wet with sweat, and i'm always at an uncomfortable temperature. I am either freezing cold all the time, or sweating from heat. I've been nauseous lately too, the thought of most food makes me gag, and ive had awful indigestion. (not sure if this is a side effect from the medication, or a side effect from the anxiety)

I am definitely going to see my psychiatrist over winter break to talk to her about all of this, but if anyone has had any similar experiences with anxiety like this from prozac+stimulant, i would love to hear any advice or what other alternatives have worked for you.

I'm starting to think that my problem isn't so much depression as it is anxiety. I would prefer to not take three medications a day, so any knowledge about switching from antidepressants to anti-anxiety medicine would be greatly appreciated.

And what's so fucked up about this is that I don't even notice my behavior and I don't make a big deal out of it until they point it out. I've always been like this and now it's just getting worse and I don't know what to do but I know I'm going to end up spiraling out of control and that is my biggest fear. Maybe I should admit myself into the looney bin, maybe that could help but that scares the absolute shit out of me. All I know is that if I don't fix myself sooner or later everyone around me isn't going to put up with it anymore and they're just going to end up leaving me and I can't blame them for that. I'm such a toxic person. I need help but don't know how to get it. I don't want to be alone and have everyone alienate me but the way I am right now that's all I could see happening for me. I'm such a selfish person and I'm realizing just now how selfish I actually am. All I do is care for myself all the time and all I want are things for myself and I don't even notice I'm hurting people along the way until they tell me that I am.

108,"Hello. I come to you today for advice/tips/coping strategies. I’m a graduate student, so on top of already being stressed at this time of year, my girlfriend just broke up with me on Friday. The two of us have basically the same friends, so I can’t even see my friends without being asked about her. She thinks we should just be friends because she is closeted and feels guilty about lying to her family. But yet when we have seen each other (twice since The Break Up) she laid on me, or called me cute. Does she not see that when she does that it is so difficult for me? I even told her I don’t know how to be just her friend, and I’m not going to immediately lose feelings for her. She basically told me “it’s not you, it’s me” but how can I not think it’s me?

I have definitely struggled with my mental health before, and I was working on it diligently, but The Break Up was a major setback. I feel like I’m always on the edge of a breakdown.  I feel worthless, annoying, lonely, and basically a giant pile of garbage in human skin. I took the day off of work to try to recover some more, but nothing is working, I just feel lazy. I know I couldn’t have gone to class because I would be on the verge of tears for about 3hr solid. 

I tried to make an appointment with the counseling center at my university, but they can’t get me in until December. I can’t live this way for another month or more. 

So, I ask, does anyone have any tips for just making it through the day? Dealing with this breakup? It feels silly to have a breakup affect me so much, I used to be so comfortable with being single. How do I get back to that? 

Also how do I justify taking time for me?

I dont think its so severe, but its chronic and that has had as much if not more of an impact in my ability to socialise and adapt to the world. I am not being hyperbolic when I say my dog was my only friend in school. I had a lot of trouble working and adapting after I barely graduated high school and it was a relief to finally get disability so I wouldnt be homeless. After that, though, I didnt know what to do as it seemed it was all up to me to get better. I tried herbs and meditation and self help books but it never helped enough.   
   
For a while I thought psych meds would help- they just tend to make me more depressed, and while therapy can be a relief for an hour, it never helped me adapt to the world. I have a lot of books Ive read on everything from diet to meditation, but most of that seems like bandaids. I try to use them, though I dont always do so very well and it seems there are legit 1000 different ways to go.

I do that, I exercise, I make art that is pointless.

Currently on my first week of using a CPAP to treat 'severe' sleep apnea. 
Been on anti depressants for 5+ years

I've dealt with increasingly bad cognitive issues for over a year now, and I'm starting to feel as though there may be a bigger picture that myself and my doctor(s) are missing. 

Anxiety and depression have been an issue for a large majority of my life, but I'm struggling moreso with my day to day due to my lack of cognitive ability and random but severe speech impairments. 

I have issues with both short term and long term memory. I have problems remembering peoples names I've known for 15+ years at times. I frequently am unable to recall or break up my days in any sensible manner so every day feels as one big conglomeration. 

Remembering the day of the week is near impossible, and the month and year escape me quite often as well. 

The biggest hurdle and one that has hindered my ability to obtain and maintain meaningful work is that even the most menial tasks are near impossible for me to hold onto day to day. I can be taught a very simple process, and even if I do it 15 times that day I'll be completely wiped clean the next day. I'd say it takes me 5x as long to retain process and specifics relating to a work environment than it should. 

In regards to the aforementioned speech impairments, I am seemingly randomly hit by incredible confusion during conversations where I either quite literally cannot get the words to reach my tongue or I am just unable to name even the most mundane things. If I am able to think of what I want to say I sometimes cover this lapse in speech by saying the completely wrong thing in hopes that the person I'm talking to corrects me. (Bus instead of truck, cat instead of dog) If this happens and the person corrects me I'm suddenly able to connect the dots from my brain to my tongue and can say the word completely fine. 

I apologize for the literal novel, I could go on and on and on but what I'm really looking for is some guidance. I've been seeing my GP as well as my psychologist for a year now and I haven't seen any notable improvement whatsoever. I've been bounced around on 15 different medications and I'm incredibly frustrated to say the least. 

In short, I need help. I have no idea where to go from here or how to proceed. What tests to ask for or what I should be trying to find out myself.  

If this is not in a suitable sub, I am happy to post it where it should be. I'm quite a new poster in regards to reddit (just a lurker really) so if a mod can PM me a better route than this I'd appreciate it!

I’ve improved. Made some lifestyle changes, gotten better. Actually started studying sometimes, although I am always so agonizingly slow I might as well just give up. I keep trying all the time, but then I just get exhausted and need a break, but there is no break. Even weekends aren’t a break right now, because I either spend them trying to regain a bit of sanity which ends up just never working, or trying to study extra which doesn’t work because I work like a sloth and I basically did nothing.

Trying feels worthless. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I didn’t keep trying, though. But trying is really, really hard right now.  I just want to be genuinely happy for just a few moments. Thankfully I can relax just a bit in my own room doing stuff that I love...but now while doing my things, the thoughts came. Benchmark exams, all the unlearned material in school, the fact that i’m gonna have to go to school at all. It kept me awake while I was cuddling with one of my favorite plushies...that’s just kinda scary to me. Plushies are usually my getaway, and I love all of mine to death, but even they can’t prevent these thoughts anymore. I feel pressed on, i’m on the brink.

This post is not going to be put together, so please just bear with it, It's really difficult for me to post this but I have to at this point or I'm going to have a melt down. 

   
 

One thing I'm 1000% sure about is that I'm not okay, I'm far from it. I have very very low self esteem, it's basically nonexistent and so is my self worth. Rewinding back to when I was 14 or 15, I admit that I was an absolute pain in the ass. But I'm proud to say that I have changed a lot, it took a little bit of work but I got there. I treat people how I want to be treated and I own up to my mistakes which helped improve my life a lot. 

That positive mindset really helped me open up to more people and start working harder, sooner than ever I was at the top of my school and my parents called to tell me that they were proud and I cried, I cried hard.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm Currently 16 and I'm having an existential crisis. I have no personality, I simply pick up on how people behave and I mirror it, I feel like I'm fake. I feel guilty for who I am, I've buried my personality so deep that even I lost touch with who I was, who I am. I'm such a huge people pleaser, I crumble under pressure because I want affirmation I guess. I'm almost entirely convinced all of my friends are going to leave me if I open up about my problems, and one of them is already growing distant but I'm not sure if it's actually them growing distant or if it's just my brain playing tricks on me.

   
Aside from my one bestfriend, I cannot bring myself to trust or open up to anyone else. I'm afraid of affection, I can't handle physical contact and I can't stop pushing people away from me because of that fear. It saved me a lot of over thinking but it's ruining my social life/skills. Recently I cut ties with a guy I liked because there was this one incidence where they moved to get close to me and our legs touched, another incidence is with a female friend I have, she texted me one day and told me that she missed me and it scared me because I don't really know her that much, even so that shouldn't have such a huge impact on me. I'm pushing my friends away because I'm losing trust for absolutely no reason. 

I am also terrified of having people abandon me even if I cared very little about them. I've had nothing but shitty experiences with ""friends"" in the past which might be whats hindering me from moving forward with my life. I don' think I can ever give anyone a chance to get to know me or even start a friendship/relationship with me because I'm so scared of the ""what if's"" and I know that that this is no way to live but it's just how my brain functions and I can't turn it off. I feel so overwhelmed with all of this, I've kept myself together for the past three years but I'm falling apart. I know this is not the time for any of this, I'm graduating highschool this year and I should be working twice as hard to be successful but when does mental illness ever choose a good time to strike? I've lost my motivation and I can't study anymore which is only making matters worst because I'm panicking over how little work I'm getting done, I don't want to let my family and friends down But I'm so fucking lost here, talking to my parents isn't going to do much good because they are religious and I am not, they'll tell me to pray and having a psychiatrist is expensive so this is my last resort. I can't keep this in anymore and I really don't want to burden anyone with my problems. ",05Nov2018,1
116,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. 

So about a year ago I've had a spiritual awakening which the doctor interpreted as psycosis . 

It started with social anxiety. For that reason I decided to go to a psycologist who sent me to the psychiatrist. He prescibed me 0.5mg risperidone and 0.5 fleuxetine. I refused to take them for 2 months. 

Than after those 2 months some events happened that made my parents force me to take the risperidone.

It immediately messed with my mind. Within a week the psychiatrist upped the dose to 1mg risperidone and removed the fleuxetine. 

My brain went south from then. All my running taughts stopped and I ended up losing all my creativity. It also took away my ability to feel emotions . These are issues that I'm still struggling with today.

In that terrible state, I became non verbal so my parents took me to another psychiatrist who prescribed 15mg olanzapine. Those were the worst . Apart from doing nothing good, they made me gain 33 pounds, which obviously screwed with my self esteem and made me feel really week.

After 3 months they made me switch to 15mg aripiprazole along with sertraline 150mg. It did bring my strength back but thats it. My mind is still a mess. Now the psychiatrist has prescribed ritalin too which for once I kinda agree with.  

If I manage to survive the next year taking this horrible antispycotic, will my brain return to how it was before ? Will I be able to feel, think, brainstorm and come up with creative ideas again as well as have a sense of belonging in this world ?

Therefore I don't fully understand how it makes people feel or how bad it can be so if anyone thinks I'm in the wrong or get anything incorrect about mental health then please tell me as I would welcome the insight into your world.

My gf (22) suffers very badly from anxiety and depression, Poor self confidence, 0 body confidence, very bad trust issues, insomnia and self harms when things get bad. What I'm asking is what's the best way to deal with this as a whole. She will sleep for 16 hours a day of she's not working and if I try to wake her she will scream at me aggressively and when she finally wakes she will have an hour long panic  attack saying she's has wasted her day and then will start an argument about how I didn't drag her/ kick her out of bed earlier. When she panics I can bring her out of it If sit down and calm her down for an hour but I don't always have the time if I need to leave for work.
If she has any alcohol at all and she panics it's game over for the night. She won't realise where she is and is impossible to get through to . Last week was my 25th birthday and we went out for a drink and she panicked about something. When people saw her crying and screaming at me they called the police and I was arrested as she scratches herself down the face until she bleeds and I spent my 25th birthday in a cell for the night. This is not the first time it's happened. She refuses to take meds as they ""zombie"" her which I respect. However there needs to be some way of keeping on top of her ilness on part. I know it's not a fixable curable illness is there anything other than meds to keep on top of it. I love her too much to just say fuck it and leave her. She's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with but it's getting harder to manage when people and all my family keep telling me I would be happier without her.

Any advice would be amazing

120,"I recently reached out and it was the worst decision of my life. Maybe future me will appreciate it but right now it's terrible. I was diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder, anorexia, ptsd, and some opiate use disorder (I didn't know that was an official thing till now?).  I spent a week in an inpatient facility and got prescribed cymbalta and naltrexone. I've been faking taking the naltrexone though. I'm planning on blowing through the rest of my opiate stash this week. I don't know where I'll get more. Getting diagnosed with anorexia just fuels it even more, it's validating. The mdd doesn't surprise me, neither does the ptsd. I'm so overwhelmed and I feel like I'm just faking getting better. Inpatient is going to be so costly and the only good thing I got out of it was the antidepressant. I was basically forced to get help and I don't want to get better. I just want to be high and I don't care at what cost",05Nov2018,1

I'm currently 20 years old, I just got back to school in august after I dropped out some years ago due to anxiety attacks and somewhat being bullied, and I felt good at first to be back at it. Now I'm a few months in and I feel very exhausted. When was unemployed I often thought about my interests and how to get a successful life with that etc but I never really dug into it. It's some kind of thing I'm really worried about and makes me very uncomfortable, and now I get confronted with it every day. It's not like that I don't care about my future, but it's already exhausting for me to get up every morning.. I'm glad that I get up every morning and crawl to school every day.. it's so freaking exhausting. How am I supposed to do that for the rest of my life?

I was in therapy in 2017 and back then I thought I'm unhappy simply because I wasn't doing anything during that time, and my therapist helped to get me back to stand on my own feet. I finished it before school started and left me doing it all by myself. Now I'm here and I feel worse than ever and I have no idea why, my class likes me and I made some friends to hang out with in my free time, and I'm doing good grades. But every day and every time my mind is kind of foggy and when get home I feel suicidal. I already felt suicidal before and I didn't tell my therapist about it.. why did I not tell him about it? I don't know about other countries but in germany you gotta wait 2 years until you can do a therapy again unless you want to pay it yourself. And I certainly don't have the money for that

It's not like something horrible or traumatic happened to me, but why do I feel this pain my chest and my belly? I am scared. My body reacts to my psyche and I feel sick all the time. I need some advice, I want to be successful and not throw it all away. I have always been to told to just push myself through but I pretty much cry every morning I wake up and want to run away. I don't want to disappoint anyone, I already did that in 2014 to my parents and now the same thing happens again. What the hell is wrong with me, why can't I just be happy?

Hello reddit, I think I need some help.
I’m facing some mental health issues that are destroying my life. 

I was wondering if someone could help me with diagnosing what conditions I have and ways in which I could treat them.

These are the things I’ve noticed about myself:

Extreme brain fog, I don’t seem to ever be able to think straight and to my full potential. 

Very very bad memory, forget dozens of things I’m told throughout the day, almost instantaneously.

My body and thoughts are constantly switched to overdrive. My legs always tap, my hands shake, I am always biting something whether it be my nails or gums or lips, I take a long time to get to sleep always thinking about stuff and chattering my teeth to the tempo of music and moving around. Everything seems so full on with me and exaggerated, I eat way to fast, I think too much, I feel too much, it’s all or nothing.

Sometimes I question life and what it means and if anything matters, and think that I’m crazy. I don’t feel in control of myself and the decisions that I make. Extremely indecisive, decisions fluster and worry me; my mind races from one choice to the next.

I encounter this strange dizzy feeling sometimes like I’m almost drunk, and always tired.

Difficulty speaking, stuttering, can’t seem to articulate myself and my feelings. Sometimes I stop mid sentence and completely blank out and forget the very thing I’m talking about.

Extreme perfectionist, I will take a very long time focusing on the tiniest details when doing or creating something.  Sometimes this is a good thing, but means I take a long time to do simple tasks like writing an email.

I can learn new things quickly but I can never make myself work hard on them. I procrastinate so so much which makes me feel even worse about myself.

Extreme social anxiety, until recently I’d be extremely nervous making a phone call to anyone. Simple things make me nervous, meeting new people, especially interacting with girls I’m attracted to. I avoid any confrontation and never stand up for myself.

Get extremely stressed in work, way more than my colleagues. Sometimes so much I’m convinced its caused my skin to rash up.

I feel as though I can’t be my true self to people.
I don’t take care of myself and adopt lots self destructive habits.

I have so many ideas of things I’d like to achieve in life, I’d like to make films and create businesses but I can’t seem to compel myself to do any of them. I know I’m not putting in even 20% effort into life. and I realise that I have never really tried hard at anything.

The best way I could try to describe the way I feel is that I’m just floating on the surface of the ocean. Held up only by a life vest, I’m hyperventilating with panic but just not choosing to swim to the shore that’s only a 100m away. I’m just letting the tide take me wherever it wants.

Throwaway account for reasons that may be obvious and a **Spoiler** for season 3 of the show.

Let me start off by giving you guys some backstory. I have been in therapy for a wide array of issues: Compulsive spending, depression, anxiety, manic episodes, suicidal attempts. I attempted many times to get a diagnosis but I wouldn't share any embarrassing details that I will share with you. Every psychiatrist I would see would base these disorders off as the result of childhood trauma and an absent father. I was on all the medications you’ve probably heard of Buspar, Prozac, Xanax, and Zoloft. 

My relationships have never really been stable in both interpersonal and romantic areas. I’ve had 3 romantic relationships my entire life with the longest relationship lasting 6 months. Whenever I developed feelings for someone it would turn into severe infatuation where it went as far as stalking, rearranging my work schedule to be able to interact with him, and try to change my physical appearance in order to get them to fall for me. I am not proud of any of this but I need to stop denying that this was happening. With friendships, whenever a friend would cancel plans like drinks at the bar I would fall into a severe depression where suicidal thoughts would come to mind. I would call these friends and tell them I was considering suicide in order to get them to come see me. 

My manic episodes started getting pretty severe over the past few months to the point where I would take a week off from work and take lavish spontaneous trips to Europe, I started having auditory hallucinations of a ‘sane me’ insulting me and calling me crazy. I would go to Vegas on weekends to go on an alcohol binger and have numerous random sexual encounters. I would also lock myself in my room after work and watch TV for 6 hours straight. I will admit, I was too ashamed to open up about this as I was scared of being institutionalized and being known in my family as the freak.

In August, I wanted to start watching a new show and came across the show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. I had heard of the show before but because of the name I thought it was related to the meme I had grown annoyed of so I never really gave it a chance. As I started watching I was horrified that there were a few similarities between myself and the character Rebecca Bunch, the stalking, lavish spending, fear of abandonment, the hallucinations. The fact that she was the titular “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” left me in a slight depression and I almost stopped watching. However when I reached season 3 where Rebecca finally gets diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I decided to finally go to a new psychiatrist to get another opinion and decided not to hold back any information that I was scared would be regarded as ‘crazy’ people behavior. Thanks to the show’s portrayal of mental illness, I was finally able to open up about the stalking, the auditory hallucinations, and everything in between. After 12 years of therapy my official diagnosis is Self-Destructive Borderline and while the road to recovery will be a long one, I am hopeful that someday I will be able to completely manage my BPD. If you're currently going through something similar know that you aren't alone and the medical professionals are there to help you not judge you.

TLDR; Was an undiagnosed Borderline for 12 years but thanks to the show’s portrayal of mental illness I finally opened up about topics I was ashamed to admit, finally getting an accurate diagnosis.",05Nov2018,2
130,"So, on November 1st 2018, I saw a figure right outside my front door and it looked like a guy with a hat. Completely shadow. Later I realized it was my shadow reflected onto the glass,  but that night I went to sleep and had a dream, where I thought I saw him in my kitchen window, and saw him and he screamed. He was 8 feet tall. That spooked me out that day. On the 2nd I saw him again, but we just looked at each other. On the 3rd, I was a little spooked out at night but not much.

He was staring at me but he was holding his breath, and then his skin started to turn green, I assume from lack of oxygen, and then I woke up at 4:30 and couldn’t sleep.

136,"I'm 24 and have been depressed and suicidal most of my life. I never had friends growing up and I'm still a virgin.

I only have one best friend. He has a longtime girlfriend, his own house and is really muscular and in shape. I feel like shit compared to him.

I just graduated college with a BA in art history. Currently living with my parents.

I go to therapy around every two weeks. I've been with the same therapist for years.

Ever since I was 12, I was put on antidepressants. Various drugs over the years. I'm now hooked on them. My parents regret ever starting me on them in the first place, but they were hopeless and just wanted me to feel better.

Currently on Risperidone, 2mg, and Mirtazapine 15mg. I got off Duioxetine about 6 months ago. I tried getting off Risperidone by weaning by going from 2mg down to 1mg, and I only lasted a little over a week. It was just too painful and I thought I was going insane.

I'm constantly miserable and sad. I just feel really lonely. I feel fucked up all the time because of these medications. My therapist says I need them. And that the risperidone helps me clear my head and helps me focus.

I think about suicide everyday. This morning I woke up thinking about buying rope at Home Depot and hanging myself. I think about hanging myself a lot, that or getting hit by a car.

It's fucked up. I don't want to die but I do. I don't want to hurt my family. I'm so ashamed of myself.

I call the suicide hotline just about every month or every week it seems like now. I just feel so hateful of myself. I used to have some fucked up humiliation fetishes that really fucked up my life. I used to masturbate everyday to humiliation porn. Just some of the lowest stuff imaginable. It made me feel like shit and I got off on that. I was masturbating so much instead of making friends or girlfriends in high school in college. I've then stopped masturbating and it's been two months away from porn, and I still feel like shit.

I'm ashamed of myself. Back in high school I used to touch women inappropriately on buses and crowded hallways. I didn't know what the fuck I was thinking. I just did it because it was fun I guess. I've since stopped. My sister saw me touching one time and she read my diary saying I hate women. I don't even have a relationship with my sister. The fucked up thing is I don't know what age I stopped. Maybe when I was a junior or something. I'm ashamed I did that. I have no desire to touch women anymore like that and it's been years since the last time I did that.

I just feel fucked up. I hate myself. I think about suicide and I'm just in a lot of pain.

And it's not like I can really talk about this stuff. My best friend says I don't need therapy or pills and thinks I'm normal. And yet all of these doctors are saying I'm not ready to come off the pills and that I need this stuff.

I'm just so sad and angry and upset. My sister graduated college the same year as me and moved all the way to Cali with her boyfriend. And yet here I am miserable, hooked on pills and therapy, and still living with my parents. I'm just so ashamed of myself and miserable.

And I have a tough relationship with my parents. I can't even look them in the eye, it's just so uncomfortable. My mom knows I used to touch women. And I even talked to her about that. And she keeps telling me to just move on and stop living in the past. She also knows of my fetishes because she found adult diapers and panties in my room growing up. I quit the fetish two months ago because it was causing me so much pain.

I just feel so disgusted with myself.

I'm ashamed of myself. And I'm in a lot of pain. I just don't know how I'm ever going to get better. I'm 24 and thought this depression would be gone by now. But it only seems to be getting worse.

The fucked up thing is I made my own mother cry at my graduation. The best day of my life and I fucked it up. She came to give me a hug and kiss, and I just grabbed her face and squeezed it and pushed her away. I was horrified by her crying. And no matter how much I apologize, I just feel like shit.

I just hate myself so much. I call the suicide hotline and cry and cry, but I just can't seem to make this pain stop.

I feel horrible all the time. Things just seem so fucking dark and scary. And I don't know how it will get better.

I'm trying to apply to grad school and become certified to become an art teacher. But I don't know if I will even get accepted.

I just want to die, just to make this pain stop. I want to get off the meds, but my therapist says I need them. And I don't even know what life is like without medication.

Fuck, if I'm feeling this fucked up now, imagine what life would be like without the meds. I sometimes wonder if I would be happier without them. But maybe I do need them, I really don't know.

I just feel so horrible. They keep saying this will pass and things will get better, but it just doesn't feel like it. Things feel so fucked up right now and I just want to die.

I mean, what's the point of living if you're always miserable and hooked on expensive medications. My parents and friends want me to get off this stuff, but I don't know if I can.

I mean, I went from 2mg down to 1mg, and it was the worse hell of my life. Did I just need to go slower or something? Yet my therapist says I need to be on this shit because it helps me focus.

I just hate myself. I'm sick of who I am. My cousin tells me to sculpt myself into a great person. And says I can redeem myself and become great.

But I just don't see that ever happening. I feel like I'm getting worse and worse and things are just getting worse and worse.

I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. I just see nothing but pain and more misery.

I can't even look at my parent's faces without feeling uncomfortable.

How is this going to get better? I'm 24 and my life is just fucked up and I want to die.

137,"Without fail, every fall/winter, my mental health declines.

I mean it's always pretty much in full swing, I have my good days too. But this time every year it for some reason gets worse. For the last ten years, basically ever since I started to self harm and when my depression really surfaced to the point where i couldn't ignore it.

Last winter was actually the best I've had since this all started. My wife proposed at the end of the summer, we went on a trip to washington state, our biggest adventure of the year, met my best friend in person for the first time. And then we were married on January 1st of this year. She has helped so much. It also helps that we travel too.

I'm fearful of this winter though. Already I was drunk every night last week. I didnt get depressed though. It was mostly Halloween festivities, going to friends houses, binge watching Netflix. Nothing compared to years ago when I used to drink alone. Even still, I know its not the best way to be. 

This month im gonna be making less money since we are taking some days off for adventures (we work pretty much constantly, each 6 days a week full time) so it is well deserved and not often that we get to go. But since I'll be making less than my regular income, I cannot afford therapy this month. And that's kind of bumming me out.

I'm pretty in tune with my triggers and how to handle them. Sometimes it's the flashbacks that get me. Back to other times I really struggled during this time of year. All of my worst relapses have been winter relapses. Which is really rude of my brain to do because fall/winter are my favorite seasons. Those memories replay in my mind sometimes. Sometimes it makes me think about how far I have come in my recovery, sometimes the sick part of me misses it. 

It's not that I want to be depressed, or that I miss it or my self harm or my eating disorder. I think growing up it just became comfortable and a part of me. I didnt really have time to be a person whenever I was growing, I was too busy being depressed and miserable for absolutely no reason. So in part, my illness became a part of my identity. 

The last almost two years now, since I first met my wife, have changed me so much. I moved in with her, we got engaged, married, i started my tattoo apprenticeship. Basically my life, and my mental health, did a complete 180. I have not relapsed, though I have still gone through near misses with it and been through depressive episodes, it's safe to say this is the best I've ever done.

I feel like I've been waiting. Waiting for it to go away. With each new, exciting, life changing event, I've been waiting for my depression to disappear. I'll be good for a while, really good, and then there is that inevitable downfall back into my old pit of despair. I get discouraged. Disappointed. Often times feel hopeless, because I'm just ready for it to be over.

I came to terms with the fact that I'll have to live with this the rest of my life a long time ago. But even still sometimes I have a hard time coping with the fact that this isnt going anywhere. I'm  forever haunted by this darkness. And angry that even with my diligent efforts at keeping my symptoms at bay that it will eventually return anyway. 

I am either wildly optimistic or extremely pessimistic. Excited or afraid. Abundantly happy, or so low that I cant even feel anything. Sometimes I can feel the warmth of the sun, let it drench my skin in its light. And sometimes even though I know it is shining all I can feel is the cold and dreary darkness.

But I think the worst thing about clinical depression is that there often times is no root. There is no cause. You are the way you are and you don't know why but everyone demands to know what has made you this way. And when you say you dont know, they think you're lying or crazy. How can you feel this much despair without a reason? 

The other side of the coin is falling down into that abyss over seemingly small things. And then you appear even crazier. Then you seem overdramatic. If you could just pull yourself up by your boot straps like everyone else we can all go on with our day. 

But it's not that easy. And nobody knows why it isnt that simple.

Bottom line: Depression is a cold indifference, a numbness, and it isolates you from everyone. I myself have become even more infuriated by there being no cause for this. I want nothing more than to just be like everyone else. Process emotions healthily and not only that but feel an appropriate amount of them. 

I'm so tired of this. Ten years is ten too long. I just want to be a person again, whatever person that was, I dont even remember.",05Nov2018,1

140,"I am 18 years old and was quite recently diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. I initally believed that the diagnosis could only be helpful, as it could help me understand myself better. 

Now, however, I honestly wish I never got the diagnosis. People stop taking me seriously if they know I have the condition, even my family and the doctors who are supposed to help. Anything I do, any opinion I might hold or any feeling I feel is put down to the autism. It is entirely dehumanising to have everything about you disregarded as a sympton of a disorder. 

Despite not being the most socially talented person, I can still see that at best people patronise me or at worst believe my views are unimportant because autism is a development disorder or the brain so I simply do not understand. 

While I was certainly unhappy before the diagnosis (which is why I was seen by mental health professionals) and I still struggle with being rather limited in what I am comfortable doing, I was at least treated as an individual. My treatment is no longer that of a person but of a disorder- a faulty though process with no repair that can not be valued because it can not properly understand like it should, so theres no point in really engaging with it. Being treated like a idiot by everyone is quite hurtful. Knowing my thinking is limited and I am slow to adapt, I accept that sometimes I just do not get it so I just let people have their fun. Even still to be essentially turned away because you will be of no use, as you would not understand so its not worth the intellectual effort.

This is how I feel. Does anyone have advice.

I made the decision at 16 to cut off all toxic influences in my life, whether it be my biological mother, my best friend, or my dad’s girlfriend. I have OCD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Unspecific Depression. I have been in treatment since I was 13, therapy my whole life.

**TODAY:**
This is not the first time this has happened either. I came home from my therapeutic high school with four text messages, two from my boyfriend, and two I hadn’t checked yet. Eventually I did, to come across a group chat with myself and my dad started by my dad’s girlfriend who apparently got into my house and took pictures of her shoes claiming that I stole them and wore them.

The first pair of shoes were designer booties that I would never wear anyways. I tried them on because I was curious to see if they would look good on me, then I gave them to my dad. The other two pairs of shoes were in my closet and both hadn’t been worn outside one 60 second outing. 

My dad’s girlfriend has a shopping addiction. She buys all of these designer clothes and leaves them at our house so she has an excuse to randomly enter as she pleases. Her furniture and items are all over my bedroom to begin with, because she has yet to take them to her house as she was living with us previously before she fucked THAT one up. 

Basically, she exercised her self proclaimed “right” and automatically assumed I was wearing her shoes because I put them in the mud room for my dad to remember to take them to her. She then felt it necessary to look in my closet where she found the sandals. In the texts she is cursing me out, with my dad added, after which she takes out all of the clothes from my drawers and closet, all of the shoes off my shelf, and even rips my prom dress to get her revenge.

This is not the first time she has done this before, she’s notorious for making quick assumptions then even breaking my belongings on the floor for me to clean up. Now I have to clean all of the clothes again, and worry constantly about her doing more damage to my bedroom as my dad is letting her come and go to finally get her stuff out.

I feel so alone. I have my boyfriend, but who says that’s forever? I’m going to college in fall and obviously I want to stay with him but I worry he won’t want to stay with me. The only family member I trust is my 87 year old grandmother who lives at least an hour away. Depression is an understatement at this point.

**[TL;DR]**
My dad’s abusive girlfriend trashed my room over a dumb assumption she made. I now feel insanely lonely and depressed and am looking for advice on how to cope with the situation. Thank you for reading!",05Nov2018,1
