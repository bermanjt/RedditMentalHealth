0,"I wasn’t sure where to post about this, but I’m at a loss for figuring out what is happening. If this post is not appropriate for this community, I will remove it. 

Every once in a while, usually after experiencing intense negative emotions, I get locked into a state where I find it incredibly difficult or impossible to interact with the world around me. I can’t think. I often can’t speak. I can’t follow any external stimuli. It feels like I’ve shut down and can’t be a person anymore. I just stare into space, not truly able to continue any line of thought. If people talk to me while I’m in this state, I either can’t respond, can respond with very limited vocabulary, or cry. It truly feels like I am stuck (“locked”) into it. It sometimes comes with periods of memory loss. People will tell me about something that happened when I was like that, and I don’t remember it. Most times, it wears off on its own, and afterward I feel completely emotionally and physically drained. I have no idea what’s going on when this happens, and I’m hoping someone will know more about this. 

If anyone has any idea of what this could be, I would be very grateful for the opportunity to research it. Thank you for any replies. ",06Feb2018,3
1,"I'm in a committed, long-distance relationship with the man of my dreams. He suffers from anxiety and depression (diagnosed, both of these things), has a suicide attempt on file (it's from before I met him, but I don't know when; I just learned about it today and it's really thrown me off), and has suffered from 4-6 bouts of being suicidal in the past 2 years (no attempts that I know of in that time). He's being treated medically at the moment. Therapy is not an option. He's completely fine at the moment, taking his meds, they're doing what they're supposed to do (though he regrets feeling like a zombie), he's having an angry day today but it isn't his depressive kind of angry; we got in a fight this morning (not a bad one, and it was my fault) and he just hasn't been able to shake it. Normal angry. The past few months have been some of the best we've had; relaxed, for the most part, lots of laughing, lots joking. Our relationship is such that he feels comfortable opening up to me, he tells me when he feels himself slipping into a suicidal mindset, he's got his safety ropes in place and knows how and that he needs to rely on them, etc.

Anyway, the help isn't for him, it's for me.

I don't suffer from an anxiety disorder, but it does come along with PMS, and so I think that's what's happening today, but for the past couple of weeks I've felt this growing cloud. Like, we've been so good for months, but we're coming up to March and March is usually a tough month for him so I know we're gonna slide into that black pit again, and I'm always terrified that *this* is gonna be the time that I lose him. It rips my heart out to even think about that possibility. I keep imagining getting a phone call from his best friend letting me know he's gone. The man *is* my soulmate, he's my biggest cheerleader, he encourages my ambition and he's smart and he's funny and if I lost him I know I would never be able to find anyone else half as good for me as he is. Even when he isn't suicidal, he isn't too chuffed about being alive (he sees life in general as a curse, and this just isn't a mindset with which I'm familiar), and I'm so sure that I'm gonna lose him at some point, I sometimes feel like I'm just waiting for it to happen. But I've never been so in love with someone before and it makes me so vulnerable, it's so scary. But it also makes me feel really selfish, like I'm demanding he stick around for my sake...

I keep reading that depression and anxiety are highly treatable, but we're both in our early 30's, *and* he's a *doctor,* and it sort of sounds like he's been on a bunch of meds before (they have him on diazepam now, which he jokingly said he'd never have put himself on if he were his own patient, because even though it prevents suicidal thoughts, it also lowers inhibition, so if he *were* to have suicidal thoughts... but he also said it's the most effective medication he's been on, so far...).

I want to be his partner in this and help him find a good treatment regiment, for *both* of our sakes, but I also don't wanna seem like I think he's broken and needs fixing or seem like I'm prying or whatever. Plus, this is old news to him; he's struggled with GAD and depression for most of his life. It's just me that this is a new thing for. He's happy to talk to me about his treatment plan for a little bit before telling me it's getting uncomfy, but I'm afraid if I ask too often he's gonna think I'm obsessing about it... 

Sorry, I don't know what the point of this is. I think I just need reassurance. He's fine right now and I ought to just appreciate the good times while we have them, but I cannot shake this feeling that I'm destined to lose him.",06Feb2018,1
2,"Since early 2016 I have barely felt any sort of happiness. There’s has been about a handful of days per year where I’ve felt happy, and even fewer days where I’ve actually felt happy to be alive.

Usually, my mood is either pretty neutral, or else I am feeling sad. For the most part, I feel neither happy nor sad; I just exist. It’s been like this constantly for two years now. 

Oh, and the feeling of hopelessness is pretty consistent as well. ",06Feb2018,9

4,The past few years my anxiety and depression seems to never go away. I can't be in public without feeling like i'm in someones way or i'm an inconvenience to everyone around me. The thought of following through with a plan makes me so overwhelmed that I want to crawl into a rock and never come out. I'm slowly getting to the point where I want nothing to do with anyone or anything. There is so much hatred and negativity in this world that I no longer want to be apart of it. On my days off it's near impossible to get out of bed on my own will. I smoke weed to make me forget about what's going on around me. It makes me zone out and lose touch. Life is overwhelming.

5,"I have been on Wellbutrin (300mg) for depression for about 5 years, was on Fluoxetine due to depression previously but went off of it because I didn't feel it was doing anything and I just felt numb. I struggle a lot with anxiety. I white knuckled it for about 3 years, trying to deal with anxiety in other ways (exercise, meditation, etc.) I also have ADHD so stimulant drugs often can trigger anxious and repetitive thoughts. Anyway, I've been on zoloft 75mg for about 2 1/2 months and it was great at the beginning, I felt confident and happy and was not so on edge all the time. I am finding now that I am really agitated all the time now, I'm always tired, I would rather be sleeping than anything else and could sleep all day if it was socially acceptable. I just don't like being awake. I'm almost on the opposite end of the spectrum, I used to care so much I was almost frozen with anxiety all the time, but now I'm so apathetic I'd rather not even exist. It feels like the things I do I do because I have to, I find no enjoyment in anything and don't even feel connected to my brain anymore. I have been having random periods of dissociation in places that are otherwise non-threatening (the grocery store, while I'm cooking for example). I know I need to speak to my doctor about this but has anyone experienced anything like this? I want to say I am suicidal but I don't even have the energy to kill myself, and when I am anxious I still want to die I just am too scared of the possibility of death to do anything. I feel really trapped. I have tried accessing counseling services at my school but they don't really have great resources to just talk to someone.

Tl;Dr
I feel depressed and want to die after being briefly okay on zoloft but i lack any energy to do anything and when I'm off medication I feel the same way except Im too anxious to commit to anything. I don't even know what I'm asking. I feel like i'm losing my mind.

7,"Hey folks,

I have posted this in the depression forum and thought I'd also post on here to see to increase diverse feedback as yes I am very depressed but I am also not sure if I am dealing with another mental health issue or if this is normal form of questioning sexuality though the past year has been very, very, very rough and I don't think this is all normal. I am determined to battle this issue full on and move on and just need a point of direction via objective feedback.

So I am mid 20 year old woman who has had a long history of here and there anxiety, some of which was physically debilitating, it got that bad at one point. I have not ever been diagnosed with a mental health issue as I was always able to handle it, this last year has been very different in a hard way.

So my current issue started when I naturally questioned my sexuality last year. Some past fantasies made me question if I was attracted to celebrity women simply for actively and intentionally fantasizing about being with them romantically. I knew I was not attracted to these celebrity women that I actively fantasized about in real life but I got confused how I could get attracted to them in fantasy if I was not attracted to them in real life? Believe it or not this one question got me going round in circles trying to find an answer for a whole year. Just when I thought I finally researched enough about sexuality, a thought would enter my head ""you cant live life because you are not 100% sure, are you sure the attraction you felt in fantasy but not in real life doesn't define your sexuality?, How can you be sure? You can't continue living life until you have all the answers"". I tried to ignore those thoughts but it kept coming back up to the point that I sought clarity online, asking forum users""does attraction you feel in fantasy that does not crossover to any real life attraction mean it is attraction?"". When someone asked me if I had internalized homophobia I explained that I honestly have nothing but love for the LGBT community and this had nothing to do with any real life desires for women because there was none. When someone told me why I was still a virgin if I preferred men romantically, I responded that I was asexual. I ended up having to clarify why I was having a hard time and yet I didnt know why, all I knew was that it had nothing to do with a problem with being bisexual or a lesbian. Is it mental illness? Is it a normal process of questioning sexuality? I have no idea. I've tried ignoring the repeated overnalaysing and the question that keeps ringing in my head but to no avail. I go by weeks feeling good but then after a huge crash. The  question creeps back in and takes over weeks and months. Its an endless cycle of misery and small moments of peace and then misery again.

I have spent a year not being able to hold down a job, not engaging in any of the exercises I used to, not living life and I am not even sure if I am suffering from a mental illness either. Its been rough and I am still in it. I am still sitting here noticing that if I dont end this back and forth with that one question regarding attraction and fantasies, it will take another year of my life. I am pretty sure those close to me think something is up with me due to unemployment. I am surving on savings but not sure what I will do when they run out. I dont want to wait for that. I want to get better.

Does anyone have any tips? Any feedback. I am really hoping for something, anything to help me get out of my own head. I cant afford a counsellor so its either I seek help online or I read some books. I dont even know whats wrong with me though?

If you have read my story and respond, thank you. I am not losing hope.",06Feb2018,4

10,"My (21 F) boyfriend (21M) is struggling with mental illness. He says he's depressed, and other times he says he has bipolar. I don't think he has been diagnosed properly, so I can't tell you what he has. He does go to therapy every week and is on/off meds. But here's the story: 

He's sort of my high school sweetheart. We dated early in high school, and then didn't talk until three years later when we got to university. (our universities are close in proximity and we both live in our hometown). After that, we've been dating on and off for about two years. It's nice to be with him, because I thought I had lost him forever after high school but he is the absolute love of my life. We were very young when we first dated, about 14 years old and I have loved him ever since - I only dated one person between us dating in HS and just recently. 

The only problem is, he keeps breaking up with me. At first, when we started dating again, I was shocked and hurt and get really sad for weeks at a time. After being with him now for some time, I realize that he's mentally ill and pushes me away everytime something is wrong with him. I don't want to be with anyone else, I completely love him and am thrilled that we've found each other again. Even people we went to school with root us on, but they don't know what it's really like or how he treats me. 

He's a bit abusive when he breaks up with me. He says that I'm controlling and a demanding bitch, and that I need to grow up - which I really am not. I don't make him buy me things, or drive me places or do things he doesn't want to do. I listen to him, comfort him and support him. I'm not flawless, but I'm also not any of the things he says to me.  It hurts, but then he comes back and says that it isn't him, and he doesn't know how to control himself. The scary thing is, before this break-up, like the day before, we went out on a date and hungout for a few hours, laughed, got some coffee, took a walk by the lake, made-out for a while, and he played with my hair and told me he loved me and I dropped him off back home. The next day, he breaks up with me and tells me all that terrible stuff. It's like there was no warning. 

Is anyone else in the same boat, or know how to deal with this? Nowadays between break-ups, I accept it. I used to get really hurt and beat my self up over it and get extremely depressed. But now I understand. However, it's been a month since our latest breakup and we haven't gone that long between break-ups before. Is there any way I can also help myself feel better too? I know that it's temporary, but I can't eat or sleep or study or function.

11,"So I watched a youtubers video on having chronic dissociation disorder and I really resonated with a lot of tbe symptoms. HOWEVER, relating to symptoms of mental disorders and believing I have them is something I do all the time. It's sort of like astrology. If you look for certain traits or behaviours in yourself, you're probably going to find examples of those being true.
I do think I have a ""foggy"" perception of reality. I never truly feel awake or energized. It's common for me to suddenly realize I was on ""auto pilot"" for the whole day. I'm stunned for a while and finally feel like myself. But it goes away pretty quickly and I'm back to being unaware.
I also have a very bad memory, my friends notice it in conversation all the time.
I don't even know if chronic dissociation is a diagnosis, but it's a symptom I hadn't thought much about until I learned more about it, and now I think I might fit the criteria. What do you think?",06Feb2018,12
12,"The other night I was in severe crisis and I called the crisis line in hopes of alleviating my anxiety but they barely talk to you. All they did was let me vent but they couldn’t offer any sound advice or even some real words of comfort. It was just the same old “oh I’m so sorry you feel that way” nonsense. 
I asked if there was any government-funded counsellors I could speak to as I can’t afford to pay for one out of pocket but no such service exists. The only services available were mental health professionals but I’ve seen them before and they didn’t help at all. If anything they only aggravated the problem (and weren’t the nicest people I’ve ever met either by the way) as they treat a crisis as a medical matter and not in a emotional matter. It seems mental health professionals don’t actually care about your happiness so much as they do to stabilize you, only for you to fall back in to that dark place about what’s bothering you later on. 
It seems like only people with money get a chance to address their issues with therapy and psychiatry is for everyone else.

16,"My sister is currently in the process of divorcing her husband.  Together they have a preschool age son.  They've had issues for awhile now I guess she wants out.  The husband doesn't want the divorce.  He insists their problems began after the son's birth and that the 10 years they were together before that were good.  He says her previous PPD has caused both of them to behave poorly but that that's an issue that can fixed since they were happy previously.  Sister denies she ever had PPD and says she's always been miserable with husband and therefore their problems can't be fixed.

The thing is, my sister did have PPD for I would say 2-2.5 years after the birth.  We all saw it.  She was diagnosed as having it by a therapist.  She admitted it to various friends and family.  Her own texts and emails to me show that she believed she had it.  And though her husband definitely has issues of his own, I wouldn't say I noticed any major red flag problems between them before their son came along.  Just typical relationship stuff.  I'm not a big fan of her husband, but on this point he seems right.  I haven't said anything to her about it because I don't want to get involved in their divorce or have her think I'm siding against her.

My sister's PPD thankfully subsided about 2 1/2 years ago, but before that we were all so worried about her.  Now I'm worried that she seems to legitimately believe it never happened.  Is that something I should be worried about?  Is that common for people who suffered PPD?

22,"I have a problem where my anxiety often keeps me from falling asleep, and the meds I'm on make me almost coma-like when I finally do. I just started a new job, was up all night nervous about it, and then, after I finally managed to fall asleep around 5, completely slept through my alarms. By the time I actually woke up, work had already (albeit barely) started. I was COMPLETELY mortified. I called my new boss and managed to get out to door and to the office in record time, and luckily she was completely cool and nice about it.


Regardless, I do NOT want this to happen again, and I feel like it's inevitable that it will, and that thought terrifies me—I WANT TO KEEP MY NEW JOB. I've talked to my doctor about the meds I'm on and how I have trouble waking up in the morning because of them, but because they're working so well otherwise (better than anything else we've tried), she seems willing to look the other way. I'm going to talk to her again at my next appointment.


In the meantime, does anyone have any tips on forcing yourself to get up in the morning?? And to a lesser extent, falling asleep at night? I think the falling-asleep thing will normalize eventually, but as far as waking up goes, when left to my own devices on the weekends I could literally sleep all day. Literally all day. To put this in perspective, before I was on any meds at all I would naturally wake up between 7 and 8 am, no matter the day of the week and despite my crippling depression and anxiety.

I really, REALLY want to force myself to like this person, I find her on Blue Cross' website under CBT therapists. So, I go to see this lady whose website says she does CBT, which would work well cause I have OCD. I get in there for my first appointment and she makes me watch her do the paperwork for 35 minutes. She has me tell her my life story while doing so but says ""she is listening."" Then she says we only have 10 minutes left-- but oh! not to worry. She can charge me for another session right fucking now. I'm suicidal and desperate so I say okay.

We talk, I feel marginally okay, she tells me she can truly help me and she thinks I can fix this in 4 months. Then she tells me to lie down and I'm like... okay... gonna keep an open mind?? Then she plays this thing online that's a creepy old man's voice saying ""you're on a beach, just relaxxxx"" and I am struggling not to laugh. I practically fall asleep cause it's really dark in the room and I was running on 4 hours sleep, so she assumes I am meditating. She then told me she is an ""energy healer"" and hummed while ""sending her energy to me."" She explains her expertise is ""hypnosis"" and it's backed by UCLA and other research centers. I tell her I *want CBT,* please. She says she's studied that but if I ACTUALLY want to heal I need to be hypnotized (I am opposed), she then says she wants to see me in 2 days. Mind you, she has a PHD and went to Harvard and Pepperdine...had a 5 star review...

I come back in 2 days (today) and she has this weirdness about her. Like she's judging me. She asks how my week is going and I said I was struggling with binge eating disorder. She says okay, well can you eat veggies? I say yes, I last night binged a 2 lb bag of carrots. She literally told me ""that's so weird and wrong, you are in severe condition."" Those were her words. And she didn't offer me any kind of help afterwards, she just let me sit with her harsh words. I felt like crying. 

Then she pulls out her phone and says ""I have a friend who can help you better than I can with eating disorders,"" and she calls THE WEIRD OLD MAN FROM THE TAPE SHE PLAYED. She told me for $250 he can talk to me over the phone 2x a day and that would help me stop binging. I told her that is not something I wanna do, I can hardly afford her and I am unemployed and depressed about it. She says basically I don't wanna be helped then, and keeps forcing the guy on me. She makes me take his number and read it back to her, being a total bitch about it as if I didn't actually take it down. Mind you, I am being super polite to her. Then she goes on her computer to look up stuff about my insurance for another 25 minutes, then our time is up.

When I said this might not be a good fit for me again at the end of our session, right after paying her, she told me, very creepily, that ""I shouldn't let you leave if you have thoughts of suicide, then."" Like she's blackmailing me to stay in therapy with her. I told her I was going to find someone for CBT next week, and she said ""I think I'm going to have to think about that,"" as if it is HER CHOICE for me to see what I need.

28,"For some reason, I've only do this with my immediate family and my boyfriend. Since I was young I've always just started bawling any time I'm in an argument with them and also anytime I talk about my feelings with them. I've always done it and I've never questioned it until lately, but it almost makes me feel more comfortable to open up. I can't control it and I really hate that I do this because I feel perceived as super emotional and as if I'm only thinking with my heart.

30,"Hi all. I've been playing with this for some time now since I have always been overly hesitant to post anything or say anything to people for fear of pity/disgust and what-have-you. I would like to explain and hopefully get some answers or advice on what I've been going through.

It started around 7 years ago (26 now), I was generally a lonely teenager that was drawn to the more melancholic side of life (aren't all teenagers?) and always put my feelings of emptiness down to simply being a teenager, these feelings continued for some time and I believe festered inside me and turned to anger, anger at myself, the world, everything but again I always put this down to a lack of maturity...Now I'll be honest I don't really know when I noticed a problem was showing, In fact the process has been so gradual or so instant that I have forgotten a 'before' time, for this reason I'll focus mainly on the 'now' and break it down into segments for ease of reading and to better grant me clarity as I type (I know that my way of typing can be a muddle of thoughts).

BEHAVIOUR---I notice in myself that I have sporadic and episodic outbursts where I will contort my body and make random noises, this will overcome me at stages and I'll need to play out the whole 'episode' before I feel in a right mind to go about my business, this can range from simple frantic facial expressions, jarring and stiff limb movement to making noises that wouldn't seem out of place in a monster movie. Normally I could keep these desires in check but recently they have invaded my daily life and I have been caught out doing them without being overly aware. This can occasionally manifest as an almost overpowering desire to scream until my throat hurts or I pass out, this thankfully has not happened but the desire is is there and I just keep my mind occupied during those moments. I have also found I want to hurt people, this isn't conscious thinking but a latent desire that has recently invaded daily life. I've found myself having these violent intrusive thoughts that will result in me spacing out for minutes at a time just wanting to potentially eat away at someones flesh, the crucial detail is that I don't WANT to hurt them but the pain caused to them is just a byproduct of the ACTION of hurting them. I've sated these urges for example by ripping things apart, the act of the damage itself is cathartic.

SEX--- I've seen a clear change in my sexual desires and fetishes, a few years ago I was happy with penis-in-vagina straight sex, the normal stuff guys love (Breasts, asses, thighs, blowjobs, anal, cumshots etc etc), then I slowly moved onto other things, namely Hentai, Furry and just general drawn art...this again I considered just some extra 'kinks' and in general never explored them beyond a passing interest, then I drifted towards Futa, Monster Girl and other more plain kinks...I can't remember when but I became obsessed with Vore (The one doing the eating), Lately however I have found myself drawn towards Rape, Torture and Necrophilia...none of which I say with a hint of pride but also with no trace of remorse (and I wish I felt guilty about it anymore). I don't know why but the look of terror, the abject hopelessness in the situation, the finality of it all just arouses me. I know it's sick and I know its wrong but I find myself drawn to it.

SOCIAL--- I have no friends to speak of, by that I mean that people have tried to befriend me but I will always sabotage or create a reason in my mind to hate them unconditionally, as such people leave me alone the majority of the time...I do find that when I decide to that people will call me charming or say that I have a rather magnetic personality but its a charade I keep up to make things easier for myself over any real desire to socialise.

 WOMEN- I feel like this deserves a category all itself, I find myself with a deep seeded, almost pathological hatred of women. I've had Girlfriends in the past but its never lasted, many due to them cheating...which I suppose in part explains it. I find myself unable on a physical level to engage with them on anything other than a superficial level. I believe that my past relationships have somewhat ruined beyond repair my perception of women and while I'm aware of this my instinct refuses to change and in part I believe that this burning hatred has been nurtured for many years and is now an integral part of who I am. I'm not one of those MRA types and I'm not even vocal about this but I see it as an internal burning that I never let out, as such I think its somewhat festered and matured.

MISC--- I tend to believe I've lost some key part of myself and feel like I'm forgetting who I am on any real basic level, I now define my being based on Greed, Disgust and Emptiness. I don't really know who I am anymore and feel like as each week passes I'm moving further away from who I want to be and more towards some vague and undefined version of myself that I seldom recognise. I cannot put it into words expressly but its like looking in a mirror in the dark, the features are mine but the person looking at them is separate and loosely connected, this isn't a constant feeling but a gradually occurring one.

Well, I thank you for reading the wall and I do hope that someone here takes the time to offer some form of advice or recommendations. I feel like I'm at a stage where I am still aware enough to see a problem occurring.

31,"Hey, I’m Sam, 20 year old, transgender guy from the Netherlands. Last week I’ve had a terrible relapse into depression. This resulted in me overdosing, but not being admitted to the mental health ward of the hospital. I’ve had problems with depression, anxiety, ocd and ptsd since I was 13 years old. (All professionally diagnosed) I’ve heard of people in the Netherlands talk about aid dogs for psychological issues. 

I’ve had therapy since I was around 9 years old due to bullying. This continued until I was 12 and changed schools. At 14 I had been put in an emergency list for therapy as I had been struggling with suicidal tendencies and self harm. At 18, this therapy stopped, as I had gone more mentally stable and took medication. 

The last year however, I’ve had major issues with anxiety, a panic disorder and recurring depressive episodes. These until the point that I dropped out of school (VWO, dutch people will know what that is) I’ve changed to go to college (MBO) and currently am learning how to become a game artist. 

I’ve been skipping a lot of school, to the point of getting a letter sent home because I’ve been absent that much. I don’t skip school because I want to, but simply because I’m either too anxious to travel to school, which is a +2h ride with public transport, or I am too sad to get even out of bed. 

I’ve been wondering, if I qualify for a psychological aid dog. After years of therapy, it seems like one of the few things that could actually help me. 


Tl;dr : queer young adult with psychological problems wonders if he can get an aid dog.

32,"I’m not sure where to start but basically I cry thinking about the past, present and future and all the memories I’ve made throughout my life.

 I remember staying up crying when I was 7 years old because I didn’t want my mom to die. She’s a perfectly healthy woman, nothing wrong with her then or now. 

With my current boyfriend I have episodes where I’ll just cry anywhere from 10 minutes to 3 hours just crying because I love him so much. I cry because I look back and see all the memories I’ve made with him in the time we’ve been together, in less than a year. I cry because I know I’ll look back at these moments when I’m like 80 years old. I cry because I imagine future memories with him, like us having a family and growing very old together and then reminiscing on all these memories we have. The feeling is like from the movie ‘The Notebook’ where the old man is telling the story of him and his wife and just looking back on their life. He says he likes it when I cry because he can see how much he means to me but I feel like the amount of emotion I have for this person will become negative. I’m extremely scared to lose him. I think he’s so attractive and has become even more attractive that he’ll soon realize it and go off with someone else. I have nightmares where he and another girl get together and it’s so painful to see. I take a lot of photos throughout our relationship and looking back on them I cry so much. 

I even cry looking back on photos of myself when I was like 5 years old. I’m not sure if there is something wrong with me or I’m just too emotional. 

 I cry when I’m at a party and a song like ‘Come on Eileen’ comes on. I see it as a song of fun times and memories that I’ll look back on when I’m older. It’s not a feeling of ‘oh I don’t want to stop, this party is great’ it’s more of a feeling of I’m going to get old and everything will end. With any slow type songs, I’ll get emotional about it and just start thinking about my life up until now. When I turned 16, I cried my whole entire birthday.  I knew I’d think back on turning 16 and the whole being a teenager thing and all the memories I’ll make with my friends, especially when I’d get my drivers license and a car.  

Sorry if this offended anyone who actually has problems and my problem isn’t actually a problem. I just want this to stop. ",06Feb2018,1

36,"My partner who is now 25 suffered from domestic violence as a child and is now suffering the consequences of it. He was diagnosed with PTSD, depression and chronic anxiety because of the physical and verbal violence his father inflicted on both him and his mother. My partner was suicidal at one point and although he needs therapy, he just graduated and not financially stable to seek it at the moment. 

The last couple of weeks has been rough cause his flashbacks have been getting significantly worse. The only person who went through it with him and understood the magnitude of the situation was his mom. However since he cannot seek therapy, he wants closure from his mom: to understand what happened in the past in order to process it. She on the other hand, doesn't acknowledge his PTSD and tells him to move on from it like she has which has negatively affected him even more. 

Anyone who has been in the same situation: does seeking closure from a person like the mom who was also a victim help? Is it important? 

In a situation where therapy and medication is not accessible, what are ways to alleviate and better his condition?

44,"Hello r/mentalhealth
Sorry if this issue feels trivial compared to anyone else's, but my mother and I are at our wits end and don't know what to do.I live in the UK with my younger sister and mother. My sister is low on the spectrum and has some communication issues, but they have always been subdued. Our childhoods were decent and we both have had no major incidents in our youths, nor trauma. About a year ago, my sister starts cutting herself off from us. She doesn't respond to us anymore and barely looks after her hygiene walking around in all black all the time. She never goes outside and neglects her pet, which the rest of us take care of. Any attempts to reach her are met with hostility: screaming fits, violence, slamming doors, ignoring/avoiding us and so on. She also refuses to see any professionals about her condition and since she is approaching 18, is unemployed and  has flunked out of two colleges already, its starting to get costly due to our low income.
We don't know what to do. We want to help, so kicking her out on her own won't solve anything but she wont let us do anything unless its by force and these issues are affecting the entire family.

45,"My friend is as healthy as can be, but eversince I started really knowing him there's been *something* wrong.
He'd go to the doctor, clear up whatever condition he thought he had and then he'll go home and start googling every single aspect of his bodily functions. (For example: ""Smelling burning wood"" - then he thinks obviously something is wrong with his nose now??) Until eventually he discovers some other condition he may have. Then he stresses it until a doctor clears it up again and then repeat.
He would sit for hours up at night reading symptoms, and unfortunately  that is not exaggeration.

He's never fine, never normal, never healthy in his mind. And as much as it annoys me, its worrisome. Because there's no helping a person that always thinks that he knows better.

48,"Hello everyone,

I have been struggling very much with my image recently. To put it bluntly I believe I am simply not attractive enough for women to be able to be physically/sexually attracted to me. This belief has caused me much distress and dread. Its harming my relationship with my girlfriend, my family and friends. Its also causing me to lose all motivation at work and at the gym.

I also compulsively stare at mirrors or the camera on my phone, probably about an hour a day at least combined. I just need to feel like I look okay, and I have to fix all minor imperfections (which likely amount to nothing anyone can notice). This time can be better spent working, socializing or relaxing. 

The mirror staring, plus lack of motivation is harming my life and my potential. I wish I could gain back some motivation, but the feeling that no woman can every truly find me attractive (and thus never feel romantic affection for me) makes me too depressed. Why have a nice job and nice house if no woman can truly love me? What’s the point of these things if I can’t share them with a life partner?

I know I do have a girlfriend, but I feel like she is just settling for me and will move on once she finds someone new/better. I truly feel she just likes my attention and time that I give her, but does not find me sexually attractive. I’ve talked to her about this, numerous times and she assures me she does, but Its just impossible for me to accept because of my looks. Even if she truly does find me attractive, these feelings will surely drive her off. 
I am not upset that I can’t date models/attractive women. I really don’t care too much about my partners looks and I find I am attracted to many kinds of women. I understand I’m not attractive so why do I think I’d deserve someone who is attractive? I just don’t think any women could find me sexually attractive. My current girlfriend has a gorgeous face but is very overweight, so its not like I wouldn’t be with someone who is also conventionally unattractive (I still very much find her attractive though BTW, I consider myself very lucky to be with her). 

Regarding my looks I have many flaws that cannot be fixed by diet/exercise/haircut/grooming.  I have a large forehead/high hairline, weak chin/jaw, slightly droopy deep-set eyes, little to no cheekbones and chubby cheeks (even while at a healthy weight.) On top of this I have an ectomorph/thin frame and 5’7” short, with old looking skin. I basically look like a much less attractive Jeremy Renner.

I essentially have nothing women find attractive (Height, jaw/chin, eyes, large frame, good skin) other then good teeth/smile. 
I could post pictures if people would like to see what I’m talking about here, but It wouldn’t likely help me too much.

Is there anyone who has felt similarly? Any advice for me?

52,"I’m hoping somebody could give me some ideas of what this could be. I’d like to do some reading and research, and maybe if someone or anyone can relate to some of this, or understand it they could give me a starting point.

I’m 30 years old, and as a kid always felt like I had ADD, and slight OCD. I’d get distracted easy in class, and could only learn if I taught myself. I used to pick up random hobbies, and interests, become fully immersed in them, and then sometimes forget about them months later. A lot of them I still enjoy. Despite this I never felt like there was anything wrong. I grew up with a close circle of friends, and lived a pretty normal life, until last summer I moved in with my girlfriend, and in an unrelated decision, I decided to give up drinking alcohol completely. I never felt that I abused alcohol, but just wanted to make a life change. 

In the next few months things that were once small symptoms grew to huge problems. I began to completely isolate myself from society, and would hide away any chance I got. I didn’t want to interact with people so I would wear headphones around every place but work where I wasn’t allowed to. The OCD had gotten so bad I began to eat the same food (ground turkey and pasta) for every meal and even the slightest alteration to my routine would cause terrible anxiety. I should add that i’m not depressed at all as long as I can be alone playing guitar, producing music, or listening to headphones I feel great, but it’s causing extreme stress on my relationship so I know I need help. If I come home and have plans to go to the gym and my girlfriend says “My parents invited us over for dinner. Can we go?” I know the right thing to do is cancel my plans and go with her but it’s almost like everything in my brain doesn’t let me. I begin to get defensive and insist I CANNOT miss the gym that day and get anxious and almost have a meltdown. To her it looks like i’m just a selfish asshole but I swear there is something else wrong here...

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Does anyone else have symptoms like this? I don’t think quitting drinking brought this on. I think drinking hid this from coming out my whole life. I don’t do any other drugs so it’s gotta be all me. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",06Feb2018,1
53,"I (25M) have a good friend (26F), whom I have known for several years at this point.

The problem is that I have seen several red flags quite a few times now. 
I think she struggles with some fairly deeply rooted psychological issues, such as a very unealthy approach to dealing with her emotions (All or nothing, either expressing them violently, or repressing them to the point where she lets them build up resentment), an ungeneralised eating disorder, I suspect issues with alchohol (She gets very drunk very often, sinks into deep depressions and refuses to talk about anything mentioned while drunk the day after) and some very low self esteem (Which she adamantly represses, but that still manages to show itself from time to time).

She has stated that she doesn't know how to navigate being ""normal"", due to her having a very troubled childhood and sometimes even longs after the problems of her childhood, because she knew how to navigate those.

Basically, I feel like as a friend that cares about her I should absolutely encourage her to seek out help. However when I did so, she didn't refuse that she had the issues, but claimed that therapists couldn't help her. 
She referred back to a suicide attempt she had when younger, and explained how the therapist didn't understand her values and simply encouraged her to think positively and cheer up.
I tried explaining to her that not all therapists are like that, and she cannot judge the entire field by her singular experience. But she still strongly refuses any notions of therapy.

This made me feel horrible about myself and basically dropped my self confidence to zero. It basically made me feel so insecure in the relationship which in turn gave me some jealousy and anxiety issues.

He finally broke down and told me he's on 3 different types of anti-depressants on high doses that have made him lose his sexual drive. I thought I understood but it's still hard to cope with him not seeming to be interested in it at all, sometimes we have sex and by the end of it he cums and is nude and I'm still fully clothed, didn't even wanna undress me to see me naked or something.

I’m still having a very hard time processing all this. I just need to put all my thoughts in one place so I’m doing that here.

One of the maintenance men at our apartment got electrocuted very, very badly yesterday on the fire escape outside our apartment (we are talking full hand on a power line and feet on metal kind of electrocuted). I don’t know why that’s what he was doing but it doesn’t matter. He was attached to the line for over 30 seconds. Someone else pulled him off (and also got electrocuted, but he will be okay). I called 911 while I was still in the apartment and then went out and started CPR because he wasn’t breathing at all. I thought he was gone. After a while, he came to. Screaming bloody hell, but conscious. I hadn't looked at his hand until then, but it was pretty much as good as gone. If you've never seen/smelled burns like that, I don't recommend it. Paramedics showed up and took over, I gave them my phone number in case they needed me for anything and that was it.

Come to find out just a bit ago, somewhere between our building and the ambulance or hospital, he died 3 separate times and they’re going to have to amputate his hand. I don’t know if he’s going to make it. I don’t know what his quality of life will be at this point. It just makes me so upset. These are the very sweet people that take care of our building and often times take care of the gross things we don’t want to. They’re super nice guys. I was put into a position where I had to comfort his brother for a while (the one who pulled him off the wire - suffered minor burns but will be okay) and I did a pretty abysmal job because I was trying to process what just happened myself. Ended up going to work almost immediately after the paramedics lefts and I didn't even make it 30 minutes into my workday before the adrenaline dump. I could not stop crying, shaking, vomited a few times.

But I don't know what to do. I do already see a psychiatrist and therapist, but is there anything I can do in the mean time? I couldn't sleep because all I could hear was his screams and his brother's screams and the sound of electricity going through someone's  body...additionally just the sight of that. Though the area has been cleaned, it's so hard for me to even go near the door of my apartment and definitely not anywhere near that fire escape. It's hard for me to go into my kitchen for the same reason. It just feels like an unbearable weight on my lungs, or almost like there's a wall there. I feel disconnected. I cannot get the smell of the burns out of my mind. Is there anything I can do to help myself with dealing with this?

58,"Hey guys - I'm holding my bachelor party in two weeks, and I've invited a great lifelong friend of mine. He had developed schizophrenia in our late teens/early twenties (almost 10 years ago now), and had a quite a scary episode while treatment was getting figured out. Since then he has stabilized and we have remained friends - though we see each other much less nowadays since we live in different cities. This is the first time we'll be hanging out on an overnight trip, and this is the first time I'll be hanging out with him in a big group where I know drinking and maybe smoking weed will be involved and we'll be away from home. I'm not 100% sure what his triggers are, but I'm pretty sure he has a good sense of what he can/can't do in terms of triggering any symptoms. As far as I know, he has been completely stable and successfully managing since that first episode. I know he's gone on various trips with some of his friends where there was drinking involved - but I also know those groups of friends have their own illnesses that they all help manage together. Also one or two of my buddies on the trip know about the illness, but nobody else has met him before (obviously I don't say anything to them under any circumstances).

I could never imagine not inviting him - he's one of my lifelong friends. And I hate to have to wonder about this for my good friend for my bachelor party. I don't want this shitty illness to prevent him from being a part of this. But a part of me is concerned about safety. Should I talk to him ahead of time? Should I make sure there is (and he knows that there is) an exit plan if he's feeling overwhelmed? Should I not say anything at all but just keep this in the back of my head if I sense he's not feeling well?

My girlfriend is usually a pretty happy, rational, and fun person, but almost every night, the later it gets, the sadder she gets, until she starts crying uncontrollably. Usually, when I'm there, she'll direct it at me, for example if I get up to leave and go brush my teeth, she'll be crying when I get back about how she thinks that I don't love her and I left because I don't want to be with her, and she'll refuse to listen to my reassurance. I guess there is the possibility that I'm just the worst boyfriend ever and that I make her miserable, but it seems like she's perfectly fine the majority of the time. I know that her mom also has some sort of thing that is depression-related that she's taking medication for and it sometimes leads her to act a little bit loopy, so as a result my girlfriend is terrified of the possibility that there's anything wrong with her that would necessitate medication. I was wondering if those symptoms match up with any known conditions and how I should act when she's upset in order to support her. Thanks

I've begun to worry that this is more than me being antisocial, I have this nonstop paranoia that I'm gonna end up alone because no one would want to hang out with me or be in a relationship with me.  
If anyone has any idea to why this may be happening, or anyway to help me out here in changing some things in my life to help change the course of these thoughts i have, I would greatly appreciate it.",06Feb2018,8
65,"Hi. I am 16 years old and this problem has tormented me for some time.
I'm walking all the time. I feel urge to walk, walk and walk. Usually when I go, I sink into such deep thoughts that I lose touch with reality. It is difficult to describe. I do not know what causes it. I do not feel it so strong, for example at school, but at home, when I have to do homework or any other work, it becomes unmerciful. Any thoughts?",06Feb2018,2

67,"Hello redditors, before all, sorry for my english.

I am a student, and for two years, I do not know what's happening to me. My social life is worse than rotten, and I feel like it's getting worse. I feel like I'm in cycles of happiness and sadness, which can vary in just one day. I'm not an antisocial person, I do not really have a hard time making friends and acquaintances, but it never lasts long. I do not get attached to people and I get tired of them very quickly. I have also for two and a half years a huge disintegration in a lot of things, even things that I like. My main activity once at home is to listen to music, and live in my head an imaginary life where I am admired, where I attract attention and I make others laugh. Since my childhood I'm pretty like that. I can spend hours daydreaming while walking inside the house (I have a hard time staying on the spot with no activity). I love doing the same thing in high school. In fact, it's a little sad and hard to admit it for me, but I feel that I want to be noticed in social life. It's a little weird though, because deep inside me I'm not really trying to please others. I have been many times against authority, and social norms. I love getting out of the heap, and doing what is best for me while many others just follow the rules that society imposes on them as idiots. I almost never listened to my parents, because they are like many other people superficial people and unable to think for themselves. Besides, my parents have always had a childish and immature behavior towards me, they often made fun of my asociability when I was young, and also of my excessive weight. They also had very offensive words and jokes against me. So for a long time now, I have no real affection for my parents, or even other people in my family.
However, I can feel feelings and empathy for people that I appreciate more than others.

I used to be very socialist and selfless some years ago, and now I am a pure liberalist and I feel that I develop more and more selfishness.
I do not hide that I want to be rich, independent, and full of power. However, I strongly wish to remain discreet, even anonymous.

The longest friendship I had really lasted barely a year and a half. I consider many people around me as acquaintances and not my friends. However, I can become very communicative and argumentative when I can draw something that benefits me.
I have a great interest in girls, but I do not feel made for a life of a couple, I have the impression that my real love feelings disappear after masturbation. It may be because I fell madly in love with a girl two years ago, and it did not work at all. I often think about her, and I can not get out of my head that it will never work with her again. It makes me very depressed and sad.

I have a negative vision of many people, for me they are all selfish manipulators who have an alter-ego when they are in public.
So I have never looked at anyone positively, at least not for long.

That's all. I am ready to answer your specific questions, because I can not write everything here, otherwise it would be much too long.
Please help me, I'm afraid it'll be too late in the near future.
Thank you very much.",06Feb2018,3

70,"This is a post I made for r/relationships that has the same description i would give for a different problem. I'm just looking for advice. 

I met Anna when I was in 10th grade, after I moved to Missouri from Texas. She was a grade above me. We became friends, had a lot of good times doing typical high school kid shit, smoking weed and drinking and partying. Her senior year and my junior year we both fell pretty heavily into some bad shit, I moved out of my parent's house at 17 and quickly became an alcoholic/drug addict to anything I could get my hands on, and she became a meth addict for a year. I tried to talk to her parents and I though that helped, but they didn't do shit and Anna continued doing meth while understandably keeping me in the dark about it. 

I moved to Texas that spring after almost failing several classes due to excessive absences, then almost flunked again for the same reason after I moved to Texas. I started taking Benadryl and prescription pills  of all kinds to get high when I didn't have the money for weed. On my final Benadryl trip I took around 800mgs. I had a bad trip and witnessed my kitchen floor covered in spiders and ants. This trip was bad enough that it caused me to have HPPD (Hallucinogenic persisting perception disorder), and I continued to see bugs for around a month before it slowly started fading away and I didn't see them anymore. At some point that summer before this, Anna came to visit me for a week. 

I moved back to Missouri for my senior year, first with my grandmother for two months and then with my friend Trevor for a year. Our house was a roach infested trailer, it was disgusting and I fell into deep depression, far worse than my previous bouts of depression. I became friends with Michael, Hannah's boyfriend, and we soon became very close. During the summer after my senior year, despite immense effort on my end to take care of my depression without the help of a doctor, I became more depressed. Hannah and I started talking more often than we had been since she visited me during the summer, and I was working on the constant state of paranoia I was in which led me to believe that she hated me. 

One night during August, I drank .75 gallons of homemade wine, which got me more drunk than I had ever been in my life, and I became delirious, convinced that I was in a television show and that every person involved in my life was an actor, paid to pretend they are my friends. Every coworker, every person I saw in the street. Like the fucking Truman show. This lasted even after I sobered up for around two weeks, until I convinced myself that even if I were in a TV show, there's no way I could prove that, and ultimately my life would not change as a result of me finding that information, so I ignored it and got kind of better. 

Then I started hearing Hannah say rude things under her breath. ""You're stupid"", ""idiot"", ""you're so weird"", etc. It started with her, and soon it was everyone. Michael, Trevor, complete strangers. Some days were worse than others, some days it didn't happen at all. This has continued to this day, but I've found proof that it's not really happening. I moved in with Anna, Michael, and a different guy named Trevor. When on meth a week ago, I was sleep deprived and I started going into psychosis, then I started hearing full conversations between Michael and Anna. I knocked on their door, and then called Michael, and they weren't even there, they were at the casino.
 
But the only person whose mouth I have ever seen move when I heard them insult me is Anna, twice. Yet she says she doesn't do that. 

Now to the main issue: when I talk to Anna, she seems uninterested in the things I say. Sometimes she even seems irritated. It's not like I dump these problems on her and she has reason to be annoyed with my attention seeking, in fact I rarely bring any of this up. For example, just earlier today I was talking to her, and she mentioned that she was thirsty. It reminded me of the disappointment I felt when I took a drink of water after I woke up this morning and realized there was only a sip. It was just a funny thing that happened, but while telling that short story her facial expression was one of annoyance, and she was looking at her phone and ignoring me. When I finished, she said ""mhhm"", and nothing else. She does this very often during conversation. She talks and I listen to her talk but she hardly has a word to say in response to anything I bring up. I talked to her about this today, and she says that she doesn't know what I'm talking about.

If I'm crazy at all, could I just happen to also be crazy about all of it? Does she actually not like me or am I paranoid? I'm not paranoid, if she didn't like me I would just want her to tell me so I can get the fuck over it. I know I'm fucking weird and I don't care what people think of it because it isn't going to change a goddamn thing. What's bothering me is that I don't know what's real and what isn't. Maybe this is more suited for r/mentalhealth, so I'm going to post this there, too. 

TL;DR: I have some sort of undiagnosed mental illness that makes me hallucinate my friends and strangers saying rude things under their breath. It isn't really happening, I have proof. The problem started with my friend, Anna, and then worsened from there. She is the only person whose mouth I've seen move during these hallucinations, which makes me skeptical. She acts as if she doesn't like me half the time, and she ignores me often when I talk to her or she acts annoyed with me. 

Obviously I'm going to see a doctor soon. ",06Feb2018,12

72,"In the last two years I've been dealing with increasing difficulty getting to and staying asleep, as well as various other stresses (deaths in the family, loss of support system, assault). Over the last few months I've had some sort of episodes where I people convinced that I've either done something horrible, usually twisting memories of already-committed acts, or would otherwise be better off dead.

I am working on getting help, but I was wondering if something like this could be related to my insomnia.",06Feb2018,10

75,"This started several years ago, so it's not really anything new. I just wanted to see if anybody else has this or whatever. Anyways, a few years ago I stopped being able to cry from emotions. My eyes still get watery if there's something irritating them or whatever, but no matter how emotional I am it won't cause me to cry. There are times when I wish i could cry, because not being able to feels wrong. Like there's no release, and all the emotions are stuck inside.",06Feb2018,10
76,"So, I'm waiting for my glasses to show up. Then, I'm heading to the VA. I guess it's time to go inpatient. I just feel so tired. Not suicidal. Just not living. Lost interest in everything. I feel like I'm missing out on everything. My son is in his graduation year from high school after beating the odds. He has Autism and was told he'd never speak. I have done nothing for his graduation. My 13 year old ""visits"" me in my room. Its the only way he gets attention from me. Even then, I can handle him for just a few minutes before I ask him to let me sleep. I feel awful. I feel like I'm missing out on being a mom. I'm just so tired.",06Feb2018,6
77,"I have an irrational aversion to working. Not in the general-jokey-""Mondays, am I right?""-way. But in a way that it has meant I've only worked a few months top at around 8 different jobs in the past 6 years. I am fine going to Uni, I actually love going to Uni and never miss a class. I haven't tried yet but am signing up for volunteering, and I have an inkling that I'll be fine with that, too. For some reason though, as soon as I get accepted for a job and then have shifts or know I'm about to have a shift, I am unreasonably uneasy about going. I pace, I fret, I lose a lot of sleep - today was supposed to be my first shift at a casual job, and I had to get out of it, after maybe 4 hours of sleep tops. I can't concentrate, I feel so down about myself, I convince myself that I don't belong there, I don't act like myself when I'm there; instead I'm nervous, anxious, overly-apologetic, sad, embarrassed, all the great things.

I don't deal with this in any other part of my life, I'm not sure what is at the root of it and why it only applies to working. Socially, I certainly get a bit nervous if I'm going to a party or meeting someone, but it's mostly excited nerves like before you go on stage, whereas for work it's like dread-nerves like those dreams where you realise you're naked in a public place.

I chatted with a mental health professional online and agreed that I should talk to a GP about this and get a referral for a psychologist. I don't know why this is ruling my life, or if it's common or maybe a phobia of some kind. I have a legitimate unrelated phobia and while the panic I experience with working is about 100x less intense, it's like a blunted version of it where it's more sadness-concentrated dread than terror-dread. Can anyone relate?",06Feb2018,3
