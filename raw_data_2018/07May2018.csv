I have a psychiatrist appointment in a few days. I think I should tell him my thought and that I'm transgender. I'm just worried he'll tell me I should be committed or sent to the hospital. I don't want that cause I'm so close to graduate but,  don't want these thoughts either. What would happen if I admitted my problems?",07May2018,1,

His friends called me a psycho bitch because of my mental illness. 
It's the last straw for me I think.
I've had depression and anxiety since I was 12. 
I'm scared I'm genuinely unloveable and the pain of losing this guy who's changed my life and given me so many reasons to live is too much. It's deeper than dying over a boy but I can't explain in much more detail. Everything hurts and he was my entire world.

7,Sometimes I think my life is absolutely falling apart and there's something uniquely wrong with me that I'm just gonna fail... and I think I'll fail a test and I get like a B? I'm a straight A student but a part of me feels like I'm not gonna do anything in life and be unhappy. But I literally have mostly As???? Why do I so greatly underestimate myself? I feel like I'm either on top of the world and the most beautiful and successful person on earth or I'm gonna fail and nothing is gonna work out right. I don't understand my opinions or my feelings cause I feel like I'm not me and I'm narrating a person inside of me?? And it doesn't upset me but it bothers me cause I don't know if what I'm thinking is true and I feel like I'm always acting and seeking attention.,07May2018,1,
8,"No one can understand. I was out of the cloud but I floated back in. Why is this numbing part of my brain so soothing? Letting go. I try to authentically type as I let my outer layer down. This is the true me. Socializing bring me out of it. But it's so numbing, so different. That's what froze me and I felt like I wanted to cry when I came out of it. I am no person in this state. I see no point. No one in the world understands this side of me and I am drifting out of it now. Now I am depressed. 

 No words can cross the barrier because they're meaningless. I am no one. I do not have feelings. I feel the world. I feel through a vessel. It's not me.

9,"Tldr: Should weight/bmi still be part of diagnosing  anorexia?

So I have never had anorexia and I've only known a couple of people who have had it and haven't really spoke to them about it a lot.

From what I know about it, its starvation as a method of control and is a mental state causing body dysmorphia as well as having physical attributes. (Correct me if I'm wrong in the comments).

I always found it weird that a person can't be diagnosed as anorexic until they are under a certain weight or bmi.

DSM-5 says for a persom to be anorexic, they must show: Persistent restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight (in context of what is minimally expected for age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health)

And as far as I know most drs use BMI to measure this?

Like, if the person is already showing all the other signs of anorexia and is in the mental spiral of obsessing over their food / looks / weight to the point of not being able to live normally, why would it make sense to not diagnose them until they are under a certain weight?

Isn't better to help people before things get too extreme? I feel like with all other mental illnesses they say to get help before it gets out of control but it seems to be different with eating disorders? 

Idk, I'm not a dr or anything, it just doesnt seem to make sense to me.

11,"I really don’t know how else to explain it other than my mind wants to think but it just can’t. Usually at night and sometimes during the day my emotions just leave me.

I’ve been with my first GF for around 6 months now, and I believe I may have encountered some emotional exhaustion which is causing my mind to race; but not think about anything in particular. It used to be so easy for me to conjure up emotions but for the past week I seriously don’t feel anything and it’s really concerning me. 

My mom has a history of pretty much every mental illness there is; and I can have some depressive episodes (although I’m not outright ‘depressed’). 

I honestly just don’t know what’s going on, how to fix it, and where I should move from here.

12,"Hey everyone! I'm working on a book right now focusing on bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Description:

Oliver Stanton and Ellenor Stevens have more in common than their love for theatre. A need for escape. For Elle, it's compulsions. For Oliver, it's mania. When fate pulls them together, they find something new. A reason to face things. But when Oliver's attempt to get help goes horrifically wrong, he begins to wonder. Does he really need to be ""normal""? Or is it enough just to be alive?

I really hope to raise more than awareness for these mental illnesses. I want to spread a deeper understanding. Mental illness is so real and it can be so scary and frustrating. I've put so much research and time into this, and I can't wait to release this book in December! I'd love to hear about your personal stories regarding these disorders, if you'd like to share below. I want so much more than to be heard. I want to listen and understand myself. I want us all to support each other in our personal journies.

Thanks so much! Have a beautiful day, and remember that you are never alone.

13,"I guess it can be hard for me to say this, because often it doesn't feel that way. I'm in High School and I have ADHD (in retrospect, I think I just never noticed because I naturally am good at school work and I was a master procrastinator so my grades were excellent, although I suspected at times), depression (at times mildly noticeable previously, but a lot worse now), and anxiety (it kind of developed all of a sudden over the summer, and the school year has been brutal). It's spiraled downhill and I'm at a point where I don't do any homework at all anymore. Everything makes everything worse, and I never know how my mood will swing throughout the day and over the course of the week. I take Vyvanse, which gives me an emotional high early in school, but I often get hyperfocused on some thing that interests me and not on my school work (though overall this is one of the better parts of each day). Then, after a few periods, it changes and I never know where I'll go then. Sometimes I'm energetic and peppy even after or before the Vyvanse kicks in, sometimes I'm anxious, and sometimes I'm depressed. Often it's some combination, but it's usually some predominant part. I'll be happy and kicking, or distant and distracted, or depressed and lazy, or anxious and paralyzed. Because the bulk of these symptoms became obvious just this year my doses of vyvanse, lamotrigine and sertraline occasionally change, and so not even my medicine is consistent. Whenever I try to get my life in order it feels like only some of it works. I try to get over my adhd and work and build habits, but I get depressed and don't care. I try to finish a project so I'm not anxious about not having it done, or depressed about how I can't get anything done, but I procrastinate and can't focus. I never know how my mood will change, and I've sort of just given up. Combine all this with usual teenage stuff, like hormones, college applications, girls, and trying to figure out how closely my religious beliefs are to my parents, and sometimes I just feel like all I can do is exist and fail and barely make it through life without completely shutting down. Weekends are the worst, because it shows me just how lazy I am and how with so much extra time I still can't get anything done. I can't ever really make a plan to do something because my mood will change and whatever problem I was going to work on will shift into something else.

14,"I just need to get a second opinion to see if I should REALLY go to see if there is something wrong with me, I seriously feel that there is a problem developing though.


First thing I should mention, I have an Uncle who does have Diagnosed Paranoid Schizophrenia, and I have a Father (now Diseased) who seemed to fit with the same sort of criteria as he said very Delusional sounding things. Such as ""The government is trying to poison me"" which I think speaks for itself. Then I am pretty young (i think), barely outta high school. 


And the third thing, about what I think or I don't think are Hallucinations and Delusions, And I think they are increasing. I have heard one voice, one time, and it wasn't anyone I knew, almost sounded like PsychicPebbles's voice but... Croaky?? I guess? It was very faint, but there was no other noise, what he said was,"" C'mon, just one more taste, lemme touch you"" I have also had visual, olfactory, and tactile hallucinations as well. One time I could of sworn I saw and felt a hand reaching behind me and touching me, even though I was in an open field by myself. Then another time, in a Web Design class, I wasn't smelling anything, but then all of a sudden a smell of some REALLY good popcorn filled my nose. I actually said aloud, "" Who's popcorn is that and can I have some?? "" But everyone looked at me weird saying "" What do you mean nobody has popcorn...? "" I didn't believe them at first, so I walked around the room, looked at everyone around the room, and nobody had popcorn, everyone just had a... really utterly confused face. 


Then there are the ( I think ) are delusions. Just yesterday, I was in my room after a shower, and my foot started twitching. Most people I would assume would immediately think ""Aw man that's annoying"" But I immediatley freaked out and thought there were bugs in my foot, controlling the tendons, and I yelled at my foot "" GET OUT!! ""


I immediately after saying that thought ""What the hell am I thinking? There aren't bugs in my foot. Or wait are there? Y- No, there aren't bugs""


I am not sure if I am overreacting to minor (everyday?) hallucinations and odd thoughts. I am just wary. I don't think I haven't been getting enough sleep. Should I seek help?",07May2018,3,
15,"I have panic attacks sometimes that really aren't triggered by anything. I can just be laying in bed and then suddenly the sky is crashing down and I am shaking and sweating. The best way I can describe it is that feeling of horror and dread that I character in a slasher film feels right before they are murdered, except I'm lying in bed doing NOTHING.
Unrelated however are my real melt down episodes: 
When I am arguing with someone (usually my boyfriend but not just him) I end up in a complete breakdown that I have difficulty describing. I shut down completely. I am unable to speak. I am shaking and crying, trapped in my own head. When I say trapped in my own head, I mean that I can respond to what's going on in my head but I can't make words come out of my mouth. All I end up saying is ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, help me!"" The room is spinning and everything else.
The only things I can think of are not making anyone else mad or upset or whatever. After the meltdown described above^ that's kind of hard. 
I keep thinking that the person is going to hurt me or they want me gone in some way. I don't behave like a rational human, but its not voluntary. I know that I am melting down and there's nothing I can do to stop it.
I don't know what to do. I looked all around the internet and nothing really explains what's going on. Panic disorder fits the first part, but usually there is something that triggers the attacks.
I can't find anything that would explain the frequent and severe breakdowns that I talked about in the second part. It seems like a psychotic episode (minus hearing voices) but I don't have any disorder associated with that.
I know I've been rambling, but can somebody help me find answers?",07May2018,5,
16,"""Oh so edgy lolol!""...it seems that the moment anyone posts anything genuine, it's considered edgy. I really don't care at this point. 
Anyways back to what I was saying...I'm an 18 year old, aspiring for a Law Major, rarely active, and just...bored.

Bored with life, bored with the way things had been turning for me. Actually with the side of frustration and pure anger. I love control. I fantasize about it everyday, me having full control of everything, my life, others, being a powerful and wealthy individual. I love the idea of manipulation too...throughout my life, I always had re-occurring thoughts of inflicting violence on those I dont care about or hate. I care about those close to me, beyond that line, everyone could die for all I care. Actually, I would go as far to say that I would actually enjoy hurting people that I don't really care about. It's only fair since it's not anyone I care about. 

You know something, no matter how much I love to tell people I'm kind, polite, and being told the same thing back, I really am feeling different. I barely have any friends like how I used to...I think the only reason I even try to have friends is so I dont become a loner. I could care less if they died the next day but hell, i still need them so i dont seem like a loser. I love especially thinking about hurting everyone I hate, and not being touched by anyone. This will sound selfish, but I dont care. I love being above people! I love being loved, I love seeing those I care about be happy, and I especially love hurting everyone else and making them my personal bitches. 

My question is...why is it whenever I talk to people, friends, family, I'm so distant and detached? I care about them, but o dont feel like it, feels like its suppressed or just does not come up. I can MAKE friends, but I cant maintain them. It's ridiculous, not once have i ever felt love in all of the relationships I've been in, but rather a need for sex.",07May2018,1,

He never used to physically force me to have sex but he would mentally fuck with me and i had no say in when we did it.

Then about a year later i was assaulted by my friends cousin at her house one night i kept telling him no but he wouldnt stop. Since then ive been fucked. I want to have sex but i panic every time! Its messing up my relationship with my current girlfriend. I keep making excuses because i havent told her (or anyone) this happened to me.

19,"When I was in my late teens, I was dealing with sexuality and how to come out, and my parents got divorced, and my first boyfriend left me all at the same time. And I shut off my feelings and just started suppressing everything. I distinctly remember making the decision to stop feeling because everything hurt so badly and my family was dysfunctional anyway.

Well, I suppose that was a short term solution, but now I’m in my mid 30s and I still can’t feel much of anything. But I have severe anxiety, on again off again erectile dysfunction (depending on how stressed I am) and anger turned inward. I constantly feel butterflies in my stomach, always anxious.

I recently noticed that when I was thinking in my mind about how I feel about my father, I automatically shut it down and pushed it aside. I was refusing to allow myself to feel anything about it. I’m 99% sure that my anxiety and sadness, along with everything else, comes from suppressing everything and being emotionally dead.

So I go in and see this nurse, tell her my problems, she tells me all this textbook shit that everyone already knows. She tells me to stop smoking weed even though I currently do it like once every 2 months, and tells me it will 100% give me a “psychotic episode” even though I’ve never experienced anything like that. She tells me to “try meditation” and that my problems are normal for boys my age, and not to worry, she booked me in for another appointment, but if she’s just gonna tell me shit that just about everyone in my life has told me every time I’ve talked about my problems, I’m not gonna get any help.

36,"I just copy/pasted this from my depression log sub because there's a better chance of getting traction/help here than there.

Seriously. I find myself overthinking everything. What I'm wearing, how my hair looks, how my teeth look, the sound of my voice, the volume of my voice, it's just too much. I feel like an alien trying so desperately to blend in but failing in every aspect.

This site is, no joke, the only remotely social interaction I have anymore. I don't have a job, because my anxiety would tank an interview. I don't have a driver's license because, again, my anxiety causes me to freak out and fail the test every goddamn time. So anything I could do that would get me outside, I can't/don't do for one reason or another. It doesn't help that there's nothing to do in this fucking city that isn't either ungodly expensive or far enough away that I can't walk.

And this shit, in turn, makes me even more depressed than I already am. I want to get in shape so I can feel a bit better about myself. I need to lose, like, 50-60 pounds. I could probably get away with less, given my frame (I'm really broad. I barely fit through the doorways in my house). The problem, aside from a food-phobia that I'll get into in a minute, is that I'm so goddamn depressed that if I start to do anything physical for longer than like 5 minutes I feel like I'm gonna puke and my legs give out.

I'm not even obese or anything like that. It's just your standard stomach fat. I just don't get out much so my legs aren't used to physical activity. If I tried to run for any real distance there's a 70/30 shot I'm going to land wrong and hurt an ankle, it's that bad.

So, the logical next step is to diet until my body could keep up with regular exercise, right? Welp, thanks dad. I was abused with food as a kid and now I don't eat much of anything. My diet has the same variety (actually probably less, surprisingly) that it did when I was 4. So, it's got little to none, is what I'm saying.

And it's not even like I haven't tried eating something new. I like, physically can't. I desperately want to try new things. There are foods I get exposed to that smell fucking fantastic, but I can't for the life of me get my mouth to close around the shit. It locks up. The last time I attempted to try something new, I was 12. I was out with my dad and step-family, and we were at some weird farmers' market kind of thing. We were going to go into some store and we were allowed to get something as long as we ate lunch. There was something really cool in there that I wanted, and I can't remember what it was now, but I hadn't eaten anything. They had pizza, which I've never been able to get myself to eat (and it's one of those foods that I desperately want because of the scents. God damn does it smell great). My mom and her side of the family will accommodate my food issue so I don't starve to death, but my dad absolutely will not. If I want something different, I have to buy or make it myself. Which, when I lived with him, led to me going days without eating sometimes.

But yeah, back to the story, I was in the car with my dad while everyone else was in the store, and he was actually screaming at me about how embarrassing it was to have a kid that wouldn't eat like a normal person. I was in tears trying my hardest, but my mouth wouldn't close. Eventually he got pissed off and took it away from me and made me sit in the car by myself while he went into the store with everyone else.

So, because of that experience, I haven't attempted to try anything new in almost 8 years.

So yeah, I have this food thing hanging over my head, I have about 60 pounds just hanging on when it shouldn't be, and a few other physical problems that I blow way out of proportion.

Like, I don't consider myself a decent looking person, but I know I'm not some hideous monstrosity. I figure I'm pretty average. I'd look better if I lost the weight, I know for a fact. But I have an overbite that's a bit bigger than average and I blow it way out of proportion. I mean, my teeth aren't great either, but the overbite is more of an issue in my head. My overbite bothers me so much I've been desperately trying to grow a beard to hide it since I was like, 15. It's a patchy mess, but my depressed/self-conscious mind considers a patchy beard better looking than an overbite.

So I have these underlying mental/physical issues that I desperately need help with, but I just can't get myself to start. I know I need therapy, but I can't afford it, and when I was getting it, it didn't help me at all. Psychiatry as well, but that's just pills and shit.

You know, looking at everything I've written here, I don't know why I do this. I don't know why I ever think that anyone would give even the remote possibility of a fuck about some dude on the internet.

I make post after post just desperately trying to get some kind of idea of what I need to do to stop hating every bit of who I am, but I just can't find that release. I look at myself and think, ""why would I ever deserve other peoples' care/attention?""

I just don't think I'm worth more than dirt to anyone. Then again, even dirt has its uses, so I guess I'm lower than that.

Maybe one day I'll be able to look back at all this and feel good about where I am, maybe one day I'll get sick of living like this and shoot myself. Who knows, and who the fuck cares?

51,"Hello all. I don't know if this is the correct place to seek help, so if it's not, @mods delete the post.

Let me start by mentioning certain facts. No one, except my grandmother (who is 76 and has been suffering from dementia and Parkinson's for around 8 years) has had any semblance of a mental illness. I have no experience with spending time around a person with a mental illness except my grandmother who is weak and not a threat (to herself or others). I'm already used to living with her and helping her out (as my parents work 12+ hours each day). However, there's a much bigger issue on the horizon.

My brother, who I'm very close to, has always been an intelligent, and nice person. I've had countless conversations with him about basic topics and much deeper ones (aliens, why we're here, the universe, the soul, etc.) and there were never any issues.

He has been taking drugs on the regular for the past 6 months (with the major damaging factor that I think has been the cause of what I am about to write being ecstasy - he probably took around 20-30 tablets in a 3-4 month period). For the previous 2 months (including this one), he's been growing more and more certain about stuff that just isn't right.

He thinks he is the new Jesus and that our hometown will become the center of the world (300k population in a small, second-world country of all places..). He tried his hardest to create a tornado to show his powers to me and my friends and when nothing happened, he said that it takes time to form (as if). 
He also thinks that as long as you believe hardly enough in something, it will surely happen (such as saying that our country will win the soccer World Cup). A couple of days ago, there was a big storm in our town and he said he's the one who caused it because he was angry at something.

Additionally, during a music festival, a guy that overdosed on drugs died. This guy happened to grab my brother and my friend by their heads whilst he was falling backwards to the ground and going into shock. The frightening part of this is that my brother thinks he took the guy's life energy out of him and he's the reason he died.

I know there is something very, very wrong with him and my thoughts are on psychotic episodes and maybe even schizophrenia (these are just my assumptions due to the evidence I've seen).

I have no idea how to help him. My friends and I want to talk to him in a gentle way and try to help him understand what's happening, but I don't know if that will help or make things worse. I know he needs to see a mental health specialist and probably take anti-psychotics (if my hunch is correct) but I have a feeling he won't be inclined towards this. 

I'm becoming rather desperate because I am at a loss of what to do. He also thinks that me and my friends are the 12 apostles. I can't ignore him and shun him out of my life, and his parents aren't the best people around (who could have potentially even caused his drug issues and mental health problems due to being complete asses that never gave him any proper love, motivation, attention, or anything really and have always shot him down whenever he found something he likes, ie. recently he found a job and my uncle immediately told him to give it up because he knows a guy that failed in that line of work).

Can anyone help me understand the path to approach this problem? I have millions of scenarios in my head about this situation but I'm still unsure of what the best course of action is. Do we present him with an ultimatum (which I think is a bad idea since he'll definitely stick with the drugs instead of us - and I'm not judging or feeling ignored because of this fact - it's drugs; they're bad if one isn't as careful as can be, and even then it's shady), do we talk to him in a normal way, do we try to show him evidence that what he thinks he's capable of isn't working (which, again, I think won't work because psychotic people can't see that they're in the wrong and ignore all evidence of the contrary).

I'd really love to save my brother before it's too late..

Sorry for the long post. I appreciate each and every comment and little bit of help that I can get since this is the crucial moment to do something about it.

Thank you.

53,"Probably long.  Apologies.  Just writing it helps me, though.
I've been dealing with a level of anxiety and depression that I haven't had to deal with since I got sober 5 years ago.  A lot of it is tied to financial stress, but that can quickly morph into questioning self worth and brief, intrusive thoughts about this state being permanent and not being able to find a way out.  My depression mostly manifests itself as just overall fatigue and isolation.  I nap a lot more than I probably should, eat unhealthy, and try to stay up late to try to hide from the morning.  My job has a very odd schedule and allows for most of my work during the day to be done at home in front of the computer.  Sometimes this is a blessing.  Right now, not so much.  I'm still in the midst of struggling with this wave of depression and anxiety, and while I have a lot of work to do, I do notice that I have several healthier ways of coping than I had 5 years ago.

-I get outside and walk.  I'm fortunate to have a dog who loves me as much as he loves walks.  He wakes me up at 7:15 AM every day regardless of the night before.  We walk after coffee at 8:15.  He generally gets 4 walks a day totaling about 8 miles.  These walks are sometimes the high point in my day.

-I clean.  Making my bed has been huge.  Keeping my apartment clean makes the apartment look bigger.  This helps in a very real way when the rest of the world seems to be closing in.

-I talk.  This one was hard.  I just made my first phone call to a friend today despite struggling with this for about two weeks.  I go to meetings for my sobriety, but it has even been hard to bring it up there.  Hopefully this post and the phone call I made help open me up to talking more.

-I find something, no matter how trivial, that I'm proud of.  Last night was really tough.  Monday all the checks go through for all my monthly bills.  Regular people with regular jobs begin their routine on Monday, leaving me a bit more isolated than usual.  Most of my work is weekends and evenings.  I was really suffering one of those ""is this really all worth it"" moments while on my last walk of the day with my dog.  I all of a sudden realized that if something happened to me, no on e would care for my dog as well as I do.  Most people would find 4 walks a day excessive.  His quality of life is significantly better with me taking care of him.  It was a little thing, but it was exactly what I needed.

Looking at this list, these are tools I didn't have 5 years ago.  It is a reminder to me that growth does occur.  I may never be free of anxiety and depression, but that doesn't mean my reactions to them will always be the same.  I hear the term ""tools in my toolbox"" a lot in the meetings I go to.  My problems don't necessarily go away, but over time I do get more tools to deal with them.  5 years ago this might have broken me.  Today it has me really stressed, walking a lot, talking to friends, and writing honestly on a forum full of strangers who have probably felt like me before.  That's growth!  That's hope!  If I can grow that much in between now and the last time I felt a wave this strong, who knows what tools I will have when the next wave comes.  I have a lot of work I need to do.  I need to be better about reaching out at the first sign I need help.  I need to eat better.  I need to recognize the signs better early on.  But these are all things I know I can work on.  OK.  This has gone on too long.  I'm a little teary eyed now, but this was helpful.  To anyone who read this whole thing, thank you.  To anyone in a similar situation: it gets better.  Reaching out helps.  Venting helps.  In my experience, isolation does not.",07May2018,4,

66,"Hey guys. So a little bit of background. I’m 20f and my boyfriend is 21m. I’ve had anxiety and depression since I was fourteen and I’m on medication again and have been for about a month. Even though I don’t feel the full effects yet I do have a brighter outlook on life. I think this is because of the medication but also because I changed my situation. My boyfriend and I lived together for almost three years but I moved out and back with my family about a month ago. 

I left because I couldn’t work where we were located as I didn’t have a license. I moved here so I can work on getting a job and my license, and once I do so I’ll be moving back with my boyfriend. Living there and relying on him was causing stress on both of us as individuals and in our relationship. It was making my anxiety and depression a lot worse. 

My boyfriend has had bipolar symptoms since he was twelve but he was just formally diagnosed last week. He has been in a “low” for about 3-4 weeks now and it’s just getting worse. He isn’t on any treatment yet but he will be on Wednesday. We live in a place where there are great, free resources for mental health and myself and my boyfriends family were finally able to convince him to use them. 

Unfortunately since he isn’t receiving treatment yet his symptoms are getting worse and I don’t know how to help him. He knows he can speak to me anytime and he says I am the only person he feels safe and happy around. Unfortunately because of his job he can’t visit me at my sisters other then the weekend. I’m not sure of what I can do to help him until he is able to receive treatment. I know it’s only a short time away but things have become unbearable for him and it’s started to affect his work and social life, which it hasn’t done before. Does anyone have some advice?

68,"Granted, I have mental health issues that set me back and am far from perfect but the older I become, the more I feel that we are undeniably living in a profoundly sick society.

I’m in my 20’s and live with my mother and step father in the UK because living here on my own is super expensive and I wouldn’t be able to cope at current.

They are both affluent and well adjusted on the outside (middle class you could say) but behind closed doors (bless their hearts honestly) they are quite obviously unwell and nasty.

They offer ‘zero’ emotional support to each other or even have any emotions at all for that matter? I don’t need emotional support from them because 1) they are incapable of providing it bless them (they genuinely find it hard to give a shit) 2) I have a loving father who supports me (lives in another country).

They talk little, are very rarely happy or seen smiling and I’ve heard that there are cases where they partake in infidelity. And of course, you’ve guessed it - they take many things out on me as the scape goat. I am extroverted away from home yet at home I am almost mute (afraid to speak).

They have little interest in empathy, the beauty in life, having friendships and I would go as far as to say happiness. They plod along - Mum stays at home all day and just spends her energy trying to show the world and others that our household is amazing and wealthy. 

Step-dad is a workaholic who thrives by working hard, being complimented by co-workers and flirting with women (there are cases where he stumbles home drunk super late). ‘No one’ ever visits my home. I wonder if they want friends at all.

I’m not spoilt by any means I pay (out of my own choice and goodwill) my full wage to them to live there as it is a nice place (big comfy home) for me to recover from my current health problems and I keep the house in good shape. 

But it scares me that they are wholeheartedly willing to carry on living in this way. Being nasty to me and others and just attaining as much wealth as possible to ‘seem’ cool, wealthy and competent to others even though no one really visits? Where’s the logic?

Not really sure where I’m going with this but I’ve noticed that a lot of seemingly well adjusted people seem to be crumbling on a soul level. I feel it’s sick and I would never want kids of my own to evet witness living in this way and conclude that life is about shutting off your emotions, being nasty to others and being super conservative about one’s own assets and that’s that. 

No empathy, happiness, compassion for the world and humanity. Just material wealth and the goal of a good reputation. 

I honestly wish the best for them and often thank them for letting me stay but they do scare me a little. My real dad comes to visit me occasionally and he always leaves feeling the exact same as me. He always says the following “the vibe in there is very artificial”.

She was four days late on her period, but she ended up getting her period the night she tested negative with a pregnancy test. I was okay after that, but then I became focused on little things that could get me in trouble. I would come up with crazy conspiracies in my head that I was going to go to jail for some reason, often looking up laws and punishments online. Two days after I got over that, the girl asked me to buy her plan b because she got with another guy and she had no one else to go to. I refused because it wasn't my problem and I had no obligation to give her money, especially if she was lying to get money out of me for something else. Over the next two weeks, I started to make up a conspiracy that she was actually pregnant with my child, using someone from her vacation as the excuse. Luckily, she said that she got her period. She has gotten two periods since we had sex, but I was still worried. I constantly hit her up for a week asking her if she was lying, which led to her to get upset with me. She swore over and over again she was on her period and not pregnant with either guy's kid. She ended up blocking me on everything. It has been two and a half weeks since she blocked me on everything. The last message exchanged was her searing that she's not pregnant and that she was on her period.

But I want you to know I appreciate it. And I appreciate everyone who takes the time out of their day. You can save a life. That’s all. ",07May2018,2,
76," This looks like it going to be long so if you want skip the first text chunk it's kinda background of what happened before the thing.

I had been doing pretty ok for me for awhile. not great but not bad. I'd felt ok enough, and bugged enough by my therapists, and feeling guilty enough that I hadnt that I started doing some very light trauma work last week. My anxiety had been pretty high before it and I hadn't been sleep enough and looking back I think I may have been slightly manic. But after the therapy session on Thursday I crashed and slept. and slept. Friday again I was okish. low interest in things that usually I'd be excited about, some self hate higher than usual, very tired. I think I slept a bunch more then too. Saturday again I was pretty ok, exhausted but volunteered and was kinda forced to have social interaction. Weirdly I kinda just emotionally shut down during it when the people were irritating me and went into this like zen state. When I got home I tried to do a project and messed it up. It upset me more than it normally would but not bad bad. Felt horridly unloved by my cat ( not logically) and cried some which really isn't normal for me. Self harmed a couple times. 


Ok so Sunday got up late was still tired, wound up sleeping like 16 hours or more. Got up ate cried (really not normal for me), felt unloved by my cat, worthless etc. Decided to do some self care, had a bath bomb , baths with bath bombs are good self care right lol? Took the bath got out to turn on the shower to rinse off. This is where things start getting scary. I decided to self harm because I was still really upset  While doing so I just kept doing it. again again again. get some relief . and crying get in the shower rinse wash my hair cry. get out and towl off. a few minutes pass. then I'm crying harder. decide to self harm again. I'm crying hysterically and laughing hysterically. nothing is funny but I'm tilting my head to the celing laughing and crying. self harming rocking back and forth. self harming places I normally make sure not to. doing more damage than normal. all the time doing this scary laugh cry thing. 
I had no control of it . Just cackling at the celing rocking back and forth even after I stopped self harming. I felt insane. Like freaking Bellatrix lestrange. I finally calmed down when I took a bunch of ativan. I tried a text line and chat line for mental health but there was a huge wait so I slept instead  when I was calm enough. 

What happened to me? how do I stop it? is there a name? how'd I make it less dangerous ( I tore my body up self harming) ? has anyone experienced anything like this? ",07May2018,3,

78,"I have crippling debt, no career, living paycheck to paycheck at 32 and today me and my fiancé separated. I’ve been going through a lot of mental and physical work to make, not only myself better, but a healthier relationship for me and her. My insecurities got the best of me and it ruined us. I have been fighting my demons for a long time and when I met her, I wanted to be a better person. I felt her fall out of love with me day by day. when she told me, she didn’t see us together anymore and no future, and that this relationship was hard, and she wanted an easy one. I feel so lost and feel like I have no one to turn to for support. No family, not many close friends and nowhere to live now. I look at my gun with a sense of relief I can have. I’m scared, I cant stop crying and I don’t know what to do.",07May2018,1,
79,"I'm looking to get some help changing my way of thinking. There are several issues going on. First, I don't take criticism well. I take it very personally, and rather than try to apply the feedback, I usually choose to wallow in the sadness of feeling inadequate instead. Very much tied into this is my tendency to give up on new things if they don't come naturally to me. I don't want to feel like an idiot, and yet I know that the true idiocy is in not allowing myself to learn and grow because I don't want to deal with the discomfort.

I also have a problem with being aware and present in the moment. I often don't notice my immediate surroundings, and it leads to doing things incorrectly or not catching on to something that's fairly obvious. For some reason, it's almost like the present moment is always taken for granted while my mind is elsewhere, whether it be past regrets, future worries, the song in my head (I'm a musician) etc. I believe this is also why I often have a terrible memory.

Finally, I believe at the root of all this is a lack of love for myself. I get down on myself very easily, and I internalize and wallow. I have a very hard time being assertive and standing up for myself. I often find it hard to identify what my true feelings or opinions are, and I think it's because they're shrouded by this complex web of self doubt and fear of confrontation. 

I think I'm simultaneously very self centered but also self deprecating, and I just want to be a normal person who can fully and meaningfully engage with people and the world around me. Any suggestions on what steps I can take to adjust my way of thinking? Has anyone dealt with a similar mental complex? Any advice is much appreciated, thank you.",07May2018,0,
80,"You meet this guy tall, extremely good looking, and charismatic. He seems completely normal, until you get to know him. I’m going to explain some of the craziest FAKE scenarios he actually acts out and pretends are real even harming himself. He’s 21 and when I first met him he was with loads of girls and TONS of booze, I mean an entire trunk full of EXPENSIVE alcohol thousands of dollars worth. Natural you wonder how does this 21 year old have all this money? Well when asked he claimed (this is where the story begins) he was in the Russian mob selling arms. He claimed to have been shot and stabbed because of them even claiming to be “married” to his boss named Sarah. He has a full blown description of her, yet no photos or anything. He claims they have sex all the time are married and have three kids. He even takes pretend photos saying she took them when they were obviously taken by him. Recently he posted a photo where he had been “shot” it was obviously fake yet he fought to the death that it was real. When showing the wound it was OBVIOUSLY not a gun shot wound at all. It looked as if he had stabbed himself or scraped the skin off. In his car there are guns crow handles he claims he needs them just in case someone comes after him. He frequently gets “stabbed” or “shot” and the scary thing is even though it’s obviously fake he ACTS as if it’s real to a full extent. His stories get mixed up between people and he has multiple secret groups of friends which he won’t intertwine. He lies about little things as well like places he’s been or people he obviously couldn’t have known. The lies go to the extent you wouldn’t even believe he pretends to disappear frequently all the time because of his “job”. One day he said his friend called and he pretended to be on the phone for TWO hours and there was no one there. He pretends to be hanging  with people posting it everywhere but NO ONE is there. This is just the beginning. We suspect all the scars he claims are from his “russian Mob” or “gang” are literally wounds he made himself which is TERRIFYING. We know it’s all a lie because of inconsistently and the fact his family said he had a Real job that he is at all the time. What in the fuck is wrong with him? Why does he make this stuff up and ACT it out? Why does he pretend to know people and lie about small little things? What is wrong wit him and should I stay away",07May2018,1,
81,"I've met my current boyfriend in October and we have been dating for a month now. I knew from the beginning that he was a bit depressed and had problems at home but it's much worse than I thought. 
So a little background. We are both currently seniors and finals are coming and therefore everyone is stressed because of it but he actually feels rather disappointed because of his grades and thinks that he won't write finals well.
Also he broke up with his girlfriend a few months ago. He said that it was because he stopped loving her and that relationship was doomed to end at the very beginning. Then she procceded to send him texts saying really rude stuff such as ''you're a bastard, I'm disgusted by you, you will ruin her like you ruined me, etc''. He can't fully ignore her because they go to the same school and class. 
Also my best friend, who was also his friend and introduced us,  turned against him and told him similar stuff.
His parents don't quite understand him and he has a tough family situation. He has also experienced some other traumas.
He has anxiety and hates himself. He has absoultely no self-esteem.
He always talks about how he is a horrible person and that it would be the best for me to go away from him and that he only keeps me by himself because he feels good around me but thinks of it as something selfish.
People generally really love him because he is funny, charismatic and can talk about absolutely anything.
But he rejected all those people and close himself in that pit of despair.
I really want to help him because I genuinely care about him. I finally succeded to make him go to psychologicist. He used to refuse to go but now he has finally decided to actually do something about his mental health.
But still, whenever I say something nice about him, he just can't accept compliment. I always tell him that to me he is an amazing person and stuff like that, but he still thinks of himself badly. 
I don't really know how to deal with his selfhatred. I hope that professionals will be able to help him but I still want to be by him in the process of getting better. I'm not losing my patience but I just feel sad that he thinks of himself in such a negative way. 
I just need some advice on what to tell him and how to help him go through all of this.
Thank you.",07May2018,1,
82,"Approximately 3 (going on 4) years ago, I was diagnosed with a split personality. When told this I reacted in a way that people around me didn't expect. I was relieved because after all this time trying to figure out what was wrong with me, the answer was found in a single sentence. From there I was able to work on building myself back up, with some assistance of course.

Fast forward months after the diagnosis - not only did I discharge myself and not require anymore sessions at the mental health institute, but I was able to do so without medication eventually. Things gradually returned to normality, at least as normal as can be.

Now don't get me wrong, having a personality disorder of any kind can make the typical day not so... Well, typical. It certainly keeps things interesting when you find yourself at wits end with yourself. 

My issue is telling people about it after knowing them for a while and having them treat me differently. 

Granted my over simplification of comparing it to ""Jekyll and Hyde minus the murder"" when trying to help people understand doesn't help my case, but that's besides the point. 

When I tell people about my mental health and my journey with it, I want them to treat me exactly how they have done thus far. This is not the case half the time. Some people tread on eggshells around me, with some even telling me they want to ""care for me"" where they become a little too involved.

Out of the two kinds of treatment I get from half of those people, I have to say the ones that get to me have to be those who become too involved. I don't want to be treated like a sick puppy or like someone who's incontinent. I am very much capable of doing things the average person can and it frustrates me when others can't see that.

However to those that do treat me the same, I am forever thankful for. They're able to see past my minor difference and even lend an ear when necessary, without pushing for it that is. 

I'm not sure if anybody else here can relate to this, but if you can feel free to message me. Especially if you've managed to get people to not treat you differently, that could actually be a big help.",07May2018,2,
