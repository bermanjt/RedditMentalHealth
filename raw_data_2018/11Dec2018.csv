4,"I have had depression issues in the past that added up to two attemted suicides. I have received help and went back to living a relatively normal life with little attention to my scars. That all happened about 4 to 5 years ago.

Recently I have been becoming more depressed and stressed. My life should be near perfect. A well paying job, a house, and the family I always wanted. I don't know why but I think of self harm or just being injured in some way all the time now. From someone shooting me to my legs being broken.

Thinking about these things somehow help me fall asleep. The thought of them happening bring some feeling of relief to me like I would be happy if it happened. A few weeks ago I threw myself down the stairs of our second floor. I wasn't really hurt but that just made me want to try again.

I don't want to die. I'm scared to die. I don't know what's wrong. I'm already on meds and see a therapist. It just feels like my brain is messed up.",11Dec2018,1
5,Tomorrow is the 22 year anniversary of my mother’s death. For some reason it’s hitting me hard today. Hopefully that means I’ll be good tomorrow.

6,"Hello all.

I am kind of in a pickle here and don't know what to do. My wife and I are 52 years old, married for 22 years. Anyways she is having mental issues with depression and anxiety. I never know anymore what to expect when she gets home, Tonight she was so worked up she wanted to go to ER to see if she needed to be locked up at mental health center.

I normally take her moods in stride try to be there and listen to her feelings, etc. but of course I can do nothing to really help her. she does take meds for both anxiety and depression, and Dr's office told her today they could not do anything else meds wise for her and if it was that bad to go to ER to be evaluated.

I have been on disability for last 10 years because of failed back surgery that has left me messed up, I also have had to get a stem cell transplant 4 yrs ago for Lymphoma that would not go into remission with just chemo. I took all this in stride and did not let it get to me too much. So I really don't have any idea of what it is like for her. I have always been considered her rock to balance her life out she says. But I am to the point of being lost while dealing with her. While trying to calm her today she at one point said That I don't support her. I think that everything I do is to support her with all things that I can while dealing with my own health issues.

Don't get me wrong I am not bashing her in anyway, I just don't know how to deal with her anymore, I am getting to my end. Tonight I almost said something when she said ""I don't Support Her"" But knew if I said anything it would be wrong and most likely start a fight. I am just at the point of What do I do from here?

Any good advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",11Dec2018,1

A person with multiple severe mental illnesses, like myself, will never lead a “normal” life. We are not neurotypical, and cannot lead neurotypical lives. We live our own special brand of lives. These lives can be worthwhile, rich, and rewarding, even though they do contain immense suffering.

Of course, trying to get as close to normal as possible is the first big goal of treatment. Medicine, therapy, and coping skills are meant to help minimize symptoms and pain. Medication is more than half the battle, so seeing a psychiatrist and making sure you keep up to date on prescriptions is the biggest single step you can take. If you do not yet have medical treatment, you will need to work out a plan to get to a psychiatry appointment. You can involve loved ones in this. Do not be shy about asking for help. Your quality of life is on the line, and I guarantee you that you have at least one person in your life who does not want you to suffer. Ask that person to take you to the doctor. You deserve to have treatment. You deserve to live in less pain. You deserve to have your needs met.

Finding the right medicine can take time, but sticking with it until your cocktail is correct is worth the time and suffering of the trial and error process. The long-term goal is remission, and the short-term goal is the amelioration of pain. It can feel hopeless, but please don’t give up. Medicine is the cornerstone of your recovery.

Mindfulness is another coping skill available to you. Mindfulness, an immensely helpful tool, is the practice of experiencing the present moment exactly as it is without passing judgment. The present moment is not good or bad, it’s just what *is*. You can learn... *continue reading*",11Dec2018,1
11,"hello everyone. i am an 18 year old girl. i’ve been struggling with my mental health since a very young age. i always felt like i was different from everyone else and that i couldn’t relate to anyone. but i’m also a middle child with an older special needs brother and a younger sister who was born when i was three.  so i always thought my mental health issues stemmed from the fact i (hypothetically) lacked attention and affection growing up.  i am extremely sensitive and my emotions are insanely powerful. when i’m happy i’m extremely happy and when i’m sad i literally want to die. everyone says i’m an extremely sweet girl but i don’t have a lot of friends.  i have one really close friend and i usually bounce between relationships frequently and i tend to make that person my world and get interested in what they are. i’m really bored with life and often i just stay in my room on the internet.  i was diagnosed with adhd in 8th grade and then depression and anxiety my sophomore year in high school. i am very up and down and i feel like i have no self identity. i’m painfully insecure, but i am getting better. i tend to latch onto people (specifically male romantic interests) and obsess over them in very unhealthy ways until it ends with them being creeped out. i will go on their social media and check what they are doing like very very frequently. more than 10 times an hour i am a very deep thinker and i recently had a short period of time where i was almost convinced i had multiple personality disorder while i was smoking thc. like i was very convinced, and then as the days went by the more unrealistic it seemed to me. i am a very compulsive and obsessive person. i check my phone very very frequently and keep looking at the same things over and over again. it’s really hard for me to stay on task for more than maybe 30 minutes. my mom brought up the fact that i may have bpd today. i read the symptoms and they seem to add up. can you guys help me?? feel free to ask any questions. also i am currently taking wellbutrin and zoloft and may start taking adderall.  i start college soon and i just want to live a normal life, i need your help 
side notes : 
it’s also really hard for me to make decisions like on what to eat and what to wear ect.
and i don’t really have opinions on things 
if you put a gun to my head i probably wouldn’t even be able to make a decision then. like i have very hard time formulating my own opinions. 
also when i am in a relationship with someone i put them above myself and my family and friends. and i am only interested in them and their life, when i am not with them i am unhappy. like i would choose them above my family. does this go hand in hand with bpd?
i also am very dissociated a lot of the time.",11Dec2018,1
12,"ive been clinically depressed since elementary school, and i thought my worst was in middle school and i was better now. but now i feel like im getting worse again.

im extremely pissed and distressed at all times, thinking of suicide and violence at all times of the day and easily irritated. im so mad all the time, even at people i love. like my mom will cough and i'll have to stop myself from saying something terrible like ""shut the fuck up bitch"". being in public for too long makes my antsy and makes me want to have a public meltdown. 

i used to have ideas for the future. i wanted to be an artist or a teacher. but my grades are completely bombing and my mom says no good colleges would accept me at this point, which gives me all the more reason to kill myself.

i dont really care what happens to me, i figure if i dont die by age 18 i'll end up either still living with my mom like a fucking loser or living in a shitty apartment alone working some shitty job like a fast food worker or camboy or something.

i completely lack motivation and work ethic, im a chronic liar, im ugly and fat, my stepdads an emotionally abusive jackass. im ruining my own life and i cant seem to stop.

13,"Hey guys, I’m Tyler.

So, I’d like to start off by saying I do NOT have social anxiety. It’s fairly simple for me to communicate with people, whether I’m just meeting them for the first time or if I’ve known them forever. I can do in-class presentations easily, too. I don’t have an issue speaking to people. 

But… being AROUND people is a bit of a problem. Yknow, I can leave the house for like 6-8 hours and be okay (although I’ve noticed the beginning of that anxiety creeps up before that time period) but after an amount of time, I get EXTREMELY anxious/panicky and need to be alone in my room. I get anxious spending time with people. Or, I should say, I get anxious when I don’t have enough alone time *in my room* in a day. 

If I’m alone in my car, I’m still freaking out. I like to be in the comfort of my own bedroom or else the feeling doesn’t go away. 

What does this mean… and do you have some tips I can use to cope with it? I feel like I’m the only one who feels this way because it’s not social anxiety and it’s not a fear of leaving my house. I’m sorry if this is a mess. ",11Dec2018,1

It’s always been like this but I’m really starting to notice it now, and I’m confused if this is normal or not.

Me:”Man, I wish I could be better and not stupid I want to die”
Character: “You’re good enough, I believe in you!”
Character 2: “You can’t let them drag you down!”
Character: “You have to live, don’t be weak”

15,"So I've always had low self esteem. Since I was a kid I was always overweight. When I was 15 I got the majority of my weight off and felt great, but very soon after I started struggling with really awful skin problems. My self esteem plummeted again. Soon my weight climbed back up. And my skin kept at it's shit. Both have been up and down since then.

 I'm now 22 and in the last year since I started my current job I've gone from being 215 pounds to 270, which I'm starting a diet soon to fix this. But in the meantime my skin has been on and off and I've just totally avoided looking. Occasionally I'll glimpse at my body and not be happy at all. But I haven't even looked at my face in the mirror in over a year now. At this point I feel like the image I've created in my head is worse than the real thing, but I used to break down and cry when I'd look before and it would ruin my entire day or week. So I've just avoided it since. 

Any more I feel disconnected from the reality of what I really am if that even make a sense. I see this disgusting fucking monster in my head but still fear looking to see whether its true or not. Is this rational or normal? I feel like I've started to go insane, both over this and other things such as my general anxiety day to day.

Good frickin lord who cares?? I’m 25, not 15. But seeing them interacting while ignoring me just, woof. My stomach dropped and my whole body went offline. I feel so tense and like I want to just cut em loose and never talk to them again.

22,"Hey guys, thanks for stopping by. I’m a 17 year old guy, and I need to vent about something and hopefully get some answers from the community.

It begins with me at the age of fifteen. I don’t know how it happened, but at night, I would suddenly come to the realization that we all die, but also that there’s nothing afterwards, no consciousness, no life, nothing. I’ve lived fairly religiously so I don’t know why my brain came up with this. I’ve tried thinking about going to heaven instead but that didn’t help. What happens when I start thinking this way would be what I can only describe as what I think is a panic attack, I start to cry, pleading, saying “no no please no”, I curl up in a ball and hug anything I can to comfort me. This happened for months, usually 3-4 times a week.

When I was in my mid-sixteens it stopped for a good long time, I would say a good 8 months or more, until about a month or two ago, when it started again. I tried reasoning with myself, that there was an afterlife, an infinite afterlife after I die, but that made it even worse, because I don’t want to live forever, it terrifies me, but I don’t want to die. So now, it’s happening 4,5,6 times a week, and it doesn’t stop until I basically cry myself to sleep.

I was okay with it being only at night, but in the last week, it’s started to creep into my regular day, while I’m at school, driving somewhere, even playing sports, and it scares me that it’s getting worse and worse because i don’t know what to do.

If anyone can please tell me if they know what might be going on, or ways to prevent it or stop it completely, that would be greatly appreciated, as all I want is to live without worry.

Thanks guys ",11Dec2018,1
23,"TLDR: My 33 year old brother lives at home, has nothing, does nothing and refuses any sort of treatment.    

&amp;#x200B;

Six years ago my brother was in his late twenties and had his life on track. Our family was middle class at best, but we had a very good, stable homelife which helped instill good values and a solid work ethic. School wasn't his thing, so he went to alternative school and graduated early. After working entry level jobs for a year or two, he focused in and put himself through EMT school, paramedic school and firefighter school. He got a job as a firefighter in a great city and was essentially set. Things continued on a for a few years and he ended up buying a house, had a fiancé, owned a new truck, boat, and had a solid group of friends.    

Then he started smoking pot.    

Maybe it was to deal with anxiety or depression- maybe it was just because he was bored. Eventually he began abusing prescription adderall, and that's when things really went off the rails. He had an incident at the fire department and was required to be drug tested. He claims he quit, but he may very well have been fired. He went to work for another small business, but was soon arrested for stalking/trespassing a girl he had met on Facebook (his fiancé had left him). His house was foreclosed on, he lost his truck and boat, and he used every last penny he had defending the trespassing charges against him.    

He felt he was a victim through it all and lashed out at me and his close friends for stating the truth. He moved in with my parents with absolutely nothing. And he's been there for four years. No job, No money, No phone, nothing. At this point, you would assume my parents would be enabling him some way- but I really don't feel they are. The only thing they provide is a bed and food. He wakes up everyday, draws and makes little art projects. To me, it's obvious he is severely depressed, but refuses to any sort of treatment or even to acknowledge he might have an issue. He becomes irate at even the suggestion of getting help.    

He's alienated himself,  has nothing and refuses to get a job or help. It's been going on for four years and there's a real possibility my parents may move soon and don't want him coming with them. If they kick him out, it's almost undeniable he'd d choose homelessness.

26,"For as long as I can remember I have been relatively detached, but after a particularly rough patch with depression a couple years ago, I've noticed that I am always completely objective in every situation. I habitually remove myself and analyze everything before moving forward. Personally, I've never found this to be a problem for me, I just recently had an interaction with a friend of mine who has a habit of going a bit overboard in my opinion when he falls for girls, in which he had had too much to drink and had a meltdown about one of his exes. 

I've always had a keen ability to analyze and understand others' feelings. I just listened and let him let it all out, but in a moment of lucidity, he remarked that I probably didn't understand what he was talking about because I was ""basically a robot."" My drunk friend actually had a point. I actually abhor long term relationships because my lack of emotional interest makes them a chore. In 6 years I have developed 2 crushes. I found that hookups were fun, because they were mutually agreed upon encounters where we'd do our thing and never speak again. Due to the fact that I am generally pleasant to be around (polite, thoughtful, dunno just what I've been told), some of these women have breached our one-time agreement to try for something more (I guess they're used to shitty guys) and I've gotten very good at saying no. I realized in my (mostly one-sided) conversation with my drunk friend that I do somewhat behave in a mechanical manner. I have personal passions, and I have emotional connections with very close friends, but in general I proceed with logic and rationality above all else. My own parents compared me to Spock from Star Trek.

My question is, what's out there about this? What I've found so far suggests that it's a learned behavior, but I can't think what could have caused me to learn to repress emotions. As I said before, it's never caused any problems I considered serious (I just avoid long term relationships to preserve my sanity, and I don't consider myself lonely), my friend simply sparked a moment of curiosity.

33,"I'm needing to vent. I'm just  tired of the skeptic. I'm tired of the fakers. People that ""think"" they have something wrong with them. So many people have no idea what it's like to really have something truly wrong.  Its painful, terrifying, and traumatizing.  Atleast, what I have is. 

I just wish people weren't so closed minded.  People think things arent possible because it doesn't happen to them.  They're the lucky ones.  But they will never understand what its like. I pray they never know.  I wouldn't wish what I experience on anybody.  


I used to be normal and wish everyday I can be again. But, I want people to know its going to be okay.  It does need to be studied more and there needs to be better treatment.  I wish there was.  


But I'm not giving up ever,  I want people that truly suffer know they're not alone. I know they're judged  and that they wake up everyday not understanding why this is happening to them.  I know it hurts. But one day there will be a light at the end of the tunnel and it will get better.  It all starts with getting treatment and being patient.

34,"I'm a third-year college student (M), 22 yrs, and feeling like everything is closing in on me. I'm pretty self-aware and recognize that everybody goes through similar issues that I am currently experiencing. I've developed a pretty standoffish shield to protect my ego/feelings. This has gotten worse and worse over the years as I found I couldn't get what I wanted being the nice guy all the time. So I took the advantages that my football player physique granted me and became a standoffish asshole to ward people off or get into positions in life that I deemed advantageous. This affected my ability to open up to people, really express my emotions, etc. (I could speak at nauseam on all the self-perceived harm this has caused me). All of this has weighed heavily on me and has caused a fairly unhealthy sex life. I push the women that I want in my life away before I can get physically romantic because of a past trauma that I struggle with. This leads me to only sleep with people I hate and promptly treat like garbage to get them away from me. I'm essentially unapproachable, even though I secretly yearn to be pleasant to everyone around me and be more positively perceived both in respective social class and in my romantic pursuits. I have someone right now that I truly care about but keep at arm's length because I'm not sure if it's the right time, if I'll just do my typical cycle or any other ridiculous behavior that I'll potentially resort to in order to defend my insanely fragile emotions. 

Besides the social issues I'm having I'm extremely anxious about my future (I realize anxiety is the go to throw away term to excuse toxic/bad behaviors or to lazily explain why something isn't getting done, but I don't know how else to describe the feeling.). I'm living in my father's shadow. The man grew up in extreme poverty and started working when he was 12. He now owns the very company he started working at and has bankrolled all of my endeavors, be them educational or even leisure. Now that I'm an adult trying to figure out how to live independently I'm not sure how. It is nigh crippling. My decision making has been rather poor as I've chosen pretty bad influences to be around, which in turn make me do things I would otherwise not do. I barely go to class. I'm barely passing classes that aren't associated with my major. There are so many issues to unpack with this entire paragraph of thought I can't even focus the point. I just hope I don't end up like those losers that sucked of their parent's tit for too long and become drug addicted sacks of shit; like every Hollywood kid ever. 

I guess the ultimate takeaway from everything I've said is that I have some major regrets. I'm not looking for sympathy (It makes me feel helpless, and that is not the man I am. I've overcome so many other hurdles to be searching for sympathy). I wish I could express my emotions more clearly face to face with others, have a plan for my financial/career's future, be able to feel like I deserve the affection from this girl, etc. Who knows maybe I'm just an asshole, been told that plenty of times.

My little sister (17) was checked in today to a mental health facility for depression and suicidal thoughts.
She lives at home with both of my very loving and supportive parents.

There is no visitation, and the calling hours all overlap with my work schedule, however I will make the issue known to my work and reach out as often as possible. She could be there for a week to a month plus.

I want to know any advice I can give her in her situation, her admitting she needed the help before turning thought into action is huge. But the last thing I want is for her to feel alone right now.

Has anyone here had experience them self or with family, in a similar situation.

I got to talk to her before she was admitted, told her I have struggles myself with depression. I told her theres no shame in asking for help, and I know that when the feeling is there everyday can be a battle, but that the facility and people there are going to give her better weapons to fight the war with. To keep her head up and remember that we all love her.

It breaks my heart and I want so badly just to hug her.

38,"I've been having suicidal thoughts for what I think is a year, and the only thing that I found really made me think I have no right to take my own life is writing suicide notes. I'd write them whenever I have the thoughts (they seem to pop out of nowhere, nothing life-wrenchingly terrible has happened to me personally in the last year so I don't know where any of this is coming from) and I can't get rid of them with funny internet memes. Before, it only took a sentence and I would stop, feeling guilty of making anyone sad. Now I've gotten to the point where writing one sentence to each person is not enough--I've ended up outlining everything bad that could happen to each person I knew if I were to go. And then I look at the list, and ultimately I decide to live, because I don't want any of the stuff I think about happening to anyone. I shut my mouth about it too because I know even if they only heard about what I'm going through it might stress them out, I just feel like I would be such a burden--if I went I really would be, mentally.

But the list is always getting longer and getting really repetitive, and also sounding more like excuses and I'm not convincing myself. The thoughts are only getting more and more frequent. I'm worried that one day I'm going to run out of things to put on the list, and then I'll really do it. When I don't have these spontaneous, obsessive bouts of suicidal thoughts, I want to save me so I don't contribute to a cycle of pain in others. Also, I don't know if writing letters to nobody is a healthy thing to do, and it feels like only a temporary fix, reaching some invisible due date.

There's a huge disconnect between when I'm suicidal and when I'm not. I'm in a good headspace right now, so just writing this makes me feel silly.

46,"I am a 23 year old guy who have had this problem as long as I remember. I have a constant inner feeling of emptiness in my head. Like I am not able to think clearly at all. When I close my eyes, it is completely black. No thoughts, no images, no imaginations, nothing at all! I am in my body, but it feels like my brain is dead. I have no inner monologue or stream of thoughts, which is one of the most common things that human experience. Human beings have an ability to reflect upon different things and to think deeply. But for me it just doesn’t work. There is just blank all the time. If I really try to think on something it is just like I can’t make any words appear. The room of which thoughts normal occur is filled with a heavy, black fog. How does it affect a human being to have a thought function that barely exists? A thought function that runs on 10% of normal?

&amp;#x200B;

When people speak together we take turns to say what comes into our minds. One person says A which makes the other think on B that makes the other think on C etc. A play of associations. A long and stimulating talk make people connect to each other. Some people bound so well that they can talk together for hours. But what if you didn’t have this constant stream of thoughts and don't think anything when the opponent said something to you? Then you have serious problems participating in a normal conversation which is the fundament of building relationships with other people. This condition makes you unable to really connect with any person in the world. And all this makes you feel extremely lonely and isolated even though you have the same social need as a normal person. Even when you are together with other people you still feel this loneliness because you simply can’t connect. And even when you get some sort of idea or thought, it is impossible to formulate it as the room of which these sentences are build does barely exist.

&amp;#x200B;

All this affects me a lot emotionally. It is unbearable not being able to connect to anyone at all. It is so frustrating and makes me feel so lonely. It is so hard to see all your potential which can’t come to life as you brain does not work. It is frustrating to be inside a human body when you feel that the real you are only able to manifests 10% of itself. The rest is hidden in this fog of emptiness. I am only a shadow of myself. This is the worst torture I can imagine. I am so frustrated that it burns inside me. It feels like I drag around a hollow body with no one home.

I have tried different medication. SSRI (Paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram), amphetamine, methylphenidate, pregabalin, nortripyline, quetiapin, benzos. I also tried cannabis, LSD, ketamine.

All this makes me so afraid, so stressed out, so frustrated, so depressed. The worst thing about it is that this condition is not normal at all. No doctors or psychologist have been able to give me a proper explanation. Nobody seems to understand it (or care at all). It really feels like the frontal part of my brain is ""sleeping"".

52,"Hi all 

I have never posted here before so I’m sorry if this is the wrong place - but it sounded like a good start. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 7 years and over the last 6 months things have got very difficult. 

It started with a suicide attempt 6 months ago when he was really struggling. I had no idea how bad things were but I have been here to support him and try to help him feel more like himself again. 

This weekend it all just got much worse. He went to his work Christmas party and had way too much to drink (not a good idea, did warn him against it) and basically went off the deep end. 

He was calling me and being really sweet, I was getting a bit anxious so he said he’d come home. 45 mins later he was still nowhere to be seen, so I called again and said it’s time to come home now. Still didn’t leave. 

I called him a third time and he told me he was going to a friends house which was closer (it was not closer). Basically it ended up that he was organising to cheat on me (whatever he was not himself) and he ended up telling a few people he wanted to die and disappearing for 4 hours. 

Anyway the point of all this is the outcome - he finally admitted that he has been hearing a voice for the last year which correlates with how long he’s been feeling depressed. 

How do I best support him with this? It was so scary and he was just not himself. ",11Dec2018,1
53,"I’ve been severely depressed for years and often the feeling’s coupled with symptoms of other mental illnesses. For example, i once went through about a month long phase of having nightmares almost every night (most of which weren’t actually disturbing in a typical nightmare way for some reason), causing anxiety and affirming my general dislike for life. 

My most recent experience of this was around three months ago at the time of writing this, it lasted for about a month too. I was going through intense and rapid mood swings, I was still mostly depressed but once or multiple times a day I’d feel enough adrenaline pumping through my veins to actually feel hopeful for something. Hopeful for living. I felt like spending all the money I’d saved up and disregarded my responsibilities not because i didn’t feel good enough to do anything but because i wanted to use energy on things that made me happy in the spur of the moment. I crashed pretty hard after all this though. Once I lost those manic-ish states I lost all my happiness. I wish I could have those again. Now my life is pretty joyless, not that those mood swings were actually feelings of happiness. It was just bursts of energy that i chose to interpret as happiness. What else did I have to cling on to. Right now my “phase” is hitting rock bottom again and again and again. I keep thinking “I’ve never been worse, I’m truly hopeless” but the one thing i never fail to do is prove myself wrong on that front. I fail at everything else.

Sorry for getting shoddy with the capitalization and sentence structure, plus the lack of commas. And for maybe getting too personal. I’ve already thought about this too much. 

Am I alone in this? I feel like people will think that I’m making all this up or somehow setting myself up for it. I wish I were. Maybe then I’d be in a better place now.

TL;DR- I’m severely depressed but sometimes i experience symptoms of other mental illnesses but the symptoms aren’t severe enough nor do they last long enough to actually be diagnosed with those illnesses. These periods of added instability still deeply affect me when i have them though and make everything worse. They scare me. Does anyone else experience this?

PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY

This has been going on for years. I was diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD, but the hallucinations aren’t related to what I have PTSD from as far as I can remember (childhood abuse).
When I’m in high stress and anxiety and I try to go to bed, I can see and feel my flesh being sliced open. If I open my eyes, it moves to my face and cuts open my eyes too. I tried to imagine my boyfriend holding my hand as a comfort, and I watched his hand being sliced open. 
The only thing that helps is time and touching where I’m being “cut” if it isn’t too severe.

56,"I had always been an awkward kid. Pretty lonely, too. Anger issues weren't uncommon in my family, and neither was depression. Maybe that was why nobody wondered if something was wrong for so long. 

&amp;#x200B;

Living in a small room with two other siblings, high tempers were normal. Things I complained about were just due to the small space. I often complained of things that probably seemed inconsequential. The AC is too loud, the room is too bright, the carpet is too scratchy. Things like that. Now, I know they were probably just from sensory overload.  Eventually, when I was about 11, me and my siblings were removed from our parents care for just about a week because of some safety issues in the home (Nothing violent or anything, the house just wasn't in 'safe' condition. The place was old. Floors started to cave, things like that. A little house work and we were right back home.) We stayed at the home of a family friend. I...didn't take it well. I didn't really know the person well, she was a friend of my moms. That was bad enough but then on top of that, I had a pretty big breakdown about wanting to go home because I didn't like it and I didn't want to stay there and a ton of other stuff. It got to the point where I was throwing things and hitting and kicking my parents and they had to call the police to come and restrain me before someone got seriously hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

That summer, I went to a stayaway summer camp. Another camper, older then me, was in my way. I told them to move. She said, ""Bite me."" I didn't realize she was being sarcastic. I bit her. She moved (though, she was screaming). I went about my way. Later that day, I was pulled aside by the camp security and told that the girl had to go to the Nurse Station because I had drawn blood when I bit her. I was warned that I would be thrown out of camp if I stepped a toe out of line. I didn't, at that point, understand why. She had *told me* to bite her. Why was I in trouble for that? With the guard yelling and already being stressed and confused about being in a new place with a strange schedule, I broke down, sobbing. Later, in my cabin, the same camper I had bitten accused me of stealing her ring. I had been with the camp security though, and I had never done that. But, when they searched my bunk, her ring was sitting under my pillow. Since I had been with security, they gave me the benefit of the doubt, but I was watched very closely after that. I heard the girl telling her friend that she was mad the planted ring wasn't enough to get me kicked out. After all that, I never went to another camp.

When I was 12, I was hospitalized for 'suicidal idealization' aka I tried to kill myself. 

I was in the psych ward for about a week.  The first day or two, I was okay. The nurses and staff were nice and they helped me out. They also had me on a medication, Risperidone. It made it very difficult for me to stay awake and moving, much less cause any fuss. A lot of the other patients wondered why I was even there, since I was (to their eyes) pretty well behaved and adjusted. On the third day, they tried to change me to a new medicine since I was having trouble keep my eyes open. They switched me to wellbutrin. I had a meeting with a social worker (because, as a minor, they had to make sure the home was safe.) Well, that day, I was awake and aware. I remember that I had some dull little golf pencils that the patients were allowed to have in my hoodie pocket. I was fidgeting, listening to the pencils in my pocket and not really paying attention to the social worker. She didn't like that. She insisted that I give the pencils to her. I ignored her. She yelled at me to put the pencils on the table or she would get a nurse and make me. I lost it. I started screaming and throwing a fit and she had two nurses come and restrain me, take the pencils, and then I was locked in my room in solitary for almost 2 days. Meals were brought to me and I was watched while I ate. A nicer nurse, named Lauren, explained that they were waiting to see if my aggression was the result of the new medication. After two days of mostly bored sitting, I was released from my room back into general population. They watched me for 2 more days before deciding, a week after I was admitted, to release me on stipulation that I started seeing on of their approved therapists. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started to see a therapist once a week and a psychiatrist bi-weekly. We talked about a lot of things. About me being asexual and not fitting in, having trouble knowing when people are being sarcastic or serious. Things like that. And about a month after I started seeing my therapist, she suggested I get tested for Asperger. My mother begged her not to do any kind of testing in that vein because she was afraid that it would make my life even more difficult. My school wasn't great at dealing with special needs kids and I was in advanced classes for science and history that she feared I would be removed from. Eventually, my therapist agreed not to formally do any testing or diagnosis of anything on the autism scale as long as I kept taking my new medication, Zoloft and Abilify. On paper, this was just to treat my anxiety and depression (which, to be fair, I did have), but she told me in private that the abilify was to give me a chance if, in fact, I did have aspergers like she suspected. In my solo sessions, she did her best to give me ways to cope and helped me deal with some of my other issues.  I stayed with that therapist until I turned 16 and she thought I had the skills to, if not be perfectly normal, to at least blend in.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, before anyone thinks differently, I love my mother and I understand why she thought how she did. But all through my childhood, I was different. I never quite fit in. I was always out of the joke. Things I thought were funny, other people didn't. I didn't understand how people worked. I've always wondered whether or not, if I took a test, I would be diagnosed as an aspie or maybe im just stupid. I dont know. As an adult now (Im 19), I have trouble holding a job for long, I don't have friends or go out for longer then I have to. My bedroom is about as sensory friendly as it can be (blackout blinds, soft orange lighting, soft carpets.) I don't watch TV because I usually don't get the punchlines. I only read, and even then I usually read the same things over and over. I don't fit quite right in this world. I wonder, almost constantly, if I should just go get tested but Im also scared. If a test says Im not an aspie, then what am I? Whats wrong with me? Why am I the way I am?

58,"I've never been good at making friends. This is mainly due to social anxiety. In middle school, I thought if it wasn't for my social anxiety stopping me, I could be just like everyone else. Normal and happy. Well I still have SAD, but I began to notice other weird behaviors in early high school. Something I do pushes away everyone who has ever tried to get close to me. Everyone just hates me after a while and leaves. And I think they probably all talk bad about me behind my back and make other people hate me. 

I just get so attached to these people so it hurts when they leave. Everyone I get attached to doesn't care about me as much as I do about them. Maybe it's because I come off as weird (I did stuff like text them all the time, but wouldn't talk to them in person because of anxiety). People leaving me has to be my fault. Why would it keep happening to me if it wasn't? I must be a bad person. And I imagine that people who have left think I am a nutcase because I have literally begged people not to leave. When they do, I feel intense urges to just end it all. Why not? I have nothing anyways.

I hurt people I love and make them upset, but I don't understand how. Or what I even do. Everyone around me seems to be laughing with me one minute and upset with me the next. I don't get it. I've never been close to someone I didn't argue with at least a few times. And, once again, I really do think this is my fault. Even though it's hard to admit. I used to point fingers because if I took the blame, it would mean I was an awful person. I was trying to hide the truth. 

But it doesn't work. My ""shy"" mask slips eventually, and people see the unstable mess I really am. And when I say ""mask,"" I don't try to put on a mask and lie to people. I don't try to act like someone I am not. I try to be myself, but I don't know who I am. 

Sometimes I feel so sensitive, like every little thing either hurts my feelings or gets on my nerves. I feel like people try to walk on eggshells around me because they know I take things the wrong way. Or do I? Maybe every little thing someone says is secretly a rude comment about me.

If this post seems kind of all over the place, it's because I'm all over the place. I don't understand anything. I always question whether or not I am a mean and evil person. I'm not sure if everyone is talking bad about me and hates me or if it's all in my head. 

I just feel so different and isolated. No one understands my emotions or how I feel. I don't even understand it. I was diagnosed with major depression, which probably explains my extreme sadness. But everyone else I know with depression is so much more stable and ""normal"" than I am. Or at least they seem to be. So I don't think it's my depression causing this, but it's a possibility. 

I want to hide this unstable part of me, but it just comes out. Or at least that's what it feels like. Outbursts and breakdowns or just me talking 100mph and telling people personal stuff that I really wish I would've kept to myself. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just a drama queen. Either way, I now try not to get too close to the few people left who still have an okay opinion of me. They'll just see how I ""really am"" if we become close. Right before they leave and I get hurt again. I don't want to hurt anyone, and I don't want to be hurt either. I am meant to be alone I think.

Maybe I should just move to a different city. If I wasn't broke, I would definitely do that. I already ruined my reputation here so. Why not start fresh? I don't know. I don't know about anything anymore. All I ever wanted was to be normal.",11Dec2018,1

&gt; Live every day likes it’s your last!

That’s just an idealistic quote made up by someone. Ideally it’s great, in practice it doesn’t work. If my friends are I are working to get money, and lets say I die tomorrow, worst case. I spend my last day working, or doing whatever I didn’t want to do, so that’s sad.

It’s also disheartening to see unaccountability. This dude with his say 5 year old daughter came into our work bathroom. Not only did the bathroom have toilet paper strewn about on the floor, there was feces in the toilet? I figured a few things may have happened.

* The man simply forgot he was in a bathroom, which seems difficult... yet possible I suppose.
* He didn’t care about flushing the toilet, which seems weird and strange. If that’s the case, he also didn’t care about picking up after himself.

Once, all I wanted to do was use a public restroom. So I tell the associate at the register. There wasn’t a line behind me, to clarify.

&gt; Excuse me... I was hoping to use the restroom and there was no toilet paper...

&gt; Thank you for telling me.

I said “thanks” and waked away. I was disappointed to see that the associate’s response didn’t address the situation, and neither confirmed nor denied help. In fact, I didn’t really know what ‘thanks’ meant in that situation. 

Asking another worker at that place, while she promised to find a manager, unfortunately that yielded no results. Going back to the restroom around 15 minutes later to see no toilet paper was disappointing, so I left.


My family is very is very compassionate and caring. By compassionate and caring, I mean judgmental and critical. 

&gt; Get a fucking job!

Or basically:

&gt; These are my standards. If you can’t meet my standards then you must be ‘whatever’.

‘Whatever’ is an insult they want to throw at me, at the time. Say lazy, or depressed, or both. Ive actually been called depressed as an insult, strangely enough.

Ironically enough, I’ve been criticized for addressing my family’s criticisms, which makes perfect sense! Not only do I deserve to be criticized, it’s my family’s business what I do, as in judging someone is a good use of your time, as in sarcasm.

Here’s a pretty good example of my brother judging me:

We were carrying loads of bricks to into a truck/trailer, and he was arranging them into piles to load. I’d bring 6 per his request, then after so long of brining bricks, I got upset we randomly didn’t have any water, on a hot summer day. Asking the seller for a glass of water, since we were  at their house, apparently made too much sense. 

&gt; Oh, we can’t do that!

Baffled, I kept working. Though I noticed I was getting tired, so I brought 5, then 4 bricks per load.

&gt; Oh, I need 6 bricks per load!

I respond with:

&gt; Wait, what? I’m getting tired, we have no water, it’s like 70-80 degrees out... I mean of course I’m getting tired.

&gt; Not my fucking problem, quit bitching and bring 6 bricks per load!

I respond with:

&gt; What’s going to happen if I come with 4 or 5 bricks per load? Is the world going to explode?

I got a lot of my sarcastic vibes from my chronically depressed friend, who I typically consider one of the most realistic people I know. He’s never physically witnessed my family criticizing me, but if he did I say to him that *he’d* say something like:

&gt; Not only does he deserve to be criticized by us,  we do it because we love him, and it’s also our responsibility to judge people!

That’s all done in sarcasm. I don’t know if this is good, but I find comfort in his sardonic nature, and I’ve seemed to have adopted more sarcasm than before I met him.

I obviously struggle with depression and anxiety. Sometimes I really hate my family, and I feel like I’d have a better time only associating with the ones I’m closest to. I haven’t mentioned my parents yet, not only are they very accountable for their actions, uhh never mind no sarcasm needed. They aren’t accountable at all. There have been times where I told my mom I would more than happy to verify her seemingly impossible or unfounded claims with a mental health professional, and get their statement in writing.

Gosh, writing all this really reminded me of a lot of memories. All very irritating unfortunately. I’ve just been dealt and shitty hand, and it’s not my fault.

62,"Sorry if this is all very unorganized, just typing what comes to mind.

I’m an idiot, I’ve been given so many opportunities to get far in life, but I just threw it away. I’m gonna lose my research assistant job because I’m not gonna meet the minimum GPA requirement. I’m gonna fail 2 courses this semester so I’m gonna lose co-op, be set back a year, and my GPA is gonna be trash. If anyone I knew had my life they could’ve done so much more with it than me. I’m just idly sitting, wasting my life away.

I agonize way too much about small things I did in the past that I hate myself for. Every single time these thoughts control my brain and I repeat to myself  “I’m gonna kill myself” over and over again. I probably say it more than everything else. I’ve already planned how I’m gonna die, but I’m not sure if I can accomplish my goal before I give up.

I have no ambition, and I’m a lazy shit, only reason I have small pushes to aim higher is so I can eventually end my life. For years I’ve had reoccurring thoughts about how much easier it would be if I could just drop out and work in fast food and living a uneventful quiet life till I reach my goal of giving my parents a refund on my life (at least what they’ve spent on me, it’s impossible to pay back the love and time they wasted on me).

The few reasons I haven’t already ended already it is 1. Pay back my parents, 2. What my suicide would do to the people around me, 3. The wasted potential in a life. It’s extremely selfish, but I’m just so done with life that #2 doesn’t matter to me anymore. #1 as more time passes the more and more I believe to minimize their losses it would be better to end it now. #3 I’m such an idiot, anyone could’ve done something better with my life, could’ve helped people, could’ve given more than they’ve taken from this world. I just want to fucking die so bad, I’m such a fucking idiot. I really should just kill myself.

63,"I’m in the process of finding a psych as I type.

Some context, and factors, first. My now ex has formed an increasingly aggressive habit of telling me how horrible I am and all the things that I should be ashamed of.

I have a history of depression and anxiety, and I used to self-harm but I haven’t in almost a decade. 

Now what happened... this is hard for me to talk about. 

This past weekend my ex and I were getting drunk together. Bad idea. It was an okay night until he started laying into me about everything I should hate myself for. My anxiety springs like a jack-in-the-box and I could feel myself getting anxious, I asked him to stop. He didn’t, I ended up having a panic attack, and he still wouldn’t stop yelling at me and asking me how it makes me feel that I’m such a horrible person. I couldn’t leave, i was drunk and it was my house. He wouldn’t stop. I begged and begged and begged. This went on for an hour or more until I was a nervous wreck, drunk, confused and generally hating myself. I stood up and screamed, just yelling, saying nothing but trying to drown him out, he didn’t stop, he got louder trying to talk over my screaming.

The next part is blurry and I can’t seem to recall a GOOD reason I did this, except that maybe at the time I felt I had no other way out, and I can’t remember anything until I had already done it - it’s like I had a brief blackout - but I grabbed a large kitchen knife and I stabbed myself in the thigh with it. It went about 2 inches deep. He called an ambulance and they took me to hospital and I ended up having stitches. 

I don’t know what came over me and I can’t talk to anyone about this because what the hell would they think of me then? I’m known as a very logical, rational person in my groups but this, happened. It’s like I don’t know myself. I’m scared of anything sharp now, I don’t think I picked up that knife with the intention of stabbing myself, it just happened. I keep replaying it in my head and trying to figure out what the fuck. I can’t, think, and I don’t trust myself, hell I don’t even know myself apparently. 

I was doing so well before this and now I feel like I’ve never been worse than now. I don’t know how to digest this, it’s not me but it is. I don’t know how to tell anyone or how to talk to a psych. I don’t even know myself. 

I don’t even know why I’m coming to reddit for this. I might end up deleting this, I’m so embarrassed and ashamed. I don’t know. I’m so confused and I hate myself for doing this to myself and I don’t know how on earth, I just, I’m so confused.

66,"I’ve been struggling with anxiety recently. It’s nothing new, it’s been around for as long as I remember. It’s just circumstances that came up recently that highlighted it for me.

I spent the last year in university. I was accepted into a residence so, naturally, I decided to go for it. It made sense, since the university was far from home, we didn’t know the area or anyone there and there were monetary benefits to staying in one. I was fine for the first week or so, when the only people there were the first years and the house committee. Things rapidly went downhill as soon as the second years and above (hereafter seniors) arrived.

There was a process of initiation we had to undergo shortly after the returning seniors arrived. The residence was divided into corridors, and each of the senior corridors had a theme. We were taken in our first year corridor groups to each senior corridor in turn. There was much screaming and shouting, ridiculous demands made of us and the like. One of these demands was that we had to remember the names of every senior after they ran us through the corridor once (10 to 20 people) and parrot it back after some more screaming, posturing and intimidation.

It was pretty bad for me, since I’m awful with names and I don’t emote much, even when I’m scared out of my mind. I got targeted a lot, since I didn’t talk as much as the others, I remained impassive, and I couldn’t remember their names. I wanted to leave. Everyone else was fine.

After all that we were taken to the residence hall to socialize with one of the female residences. I lost control of my emotions in the hall, started sobbing around everyone there and had to be taken to my room. It must have looked comical, my face going from stony to contorted in a moment, completely out of the blue. Again, nobody else struggled with this; they shrugged it off once it was done, even laughed.

A few weeks later I was making my way to the upper floors when I was called into a senior corridor alone. Most first years travelled in groups for this reason, but I am solitary and slow to make friends or trust people. I was shouted at because I couldn’t remember the names of these people I hadn’t seen in weeks. They also took exception to the way I look. If I’m not smiling then I look angry, all the time. My face is just structured that way, and I explained it, which just made them angrier. I was furious since I can’t change that, but I kept quiet.

That was the start of a steady downhill spiral that occurred over the course of the year. I became reclusive, began to feel distrustful and hate everyone, and when I went home for the mid-year break I broke down and had a shouting match with my parents for the first time.

It got worse when I went back. I would feel physically ill when thinking about going downstairs for anything, since I would have to pass the senior corridors on the way down, and again when I returned. If they greeted me I mumbled something and got away as fast as possible.

Bear in mind, initiation was limited to the first semester, so they were not allowed to do any of the stuff they did then from the mid-year point on, yet I still felt terrified around them. Even when they smiled at me and greeted me, I just saw what they had been like before.

I’m out now and the year’s over. I’m back home, yet I still feel short of breath sometimes. That’s sort of new. The almost permanent empty feeling in my gut and paranoia are not, since I’ve had them for as long as I can remember. When I was eight, I didn’t think I would live to my teens. No reason, I was just sure I would die or kill myself before then. I can still remember the genuine surprise I felt on the morning of my thirteenth birthday. I wasn’t happy, I was scared. I thought that meant that I would die later, after I had more to lose and more people depended on me.

I sometimes have trouble sleeping since I can’t feel my heartbeat and I need to get up and walk around to make sure I’m still alive. I occasionally feel like crying from fear. I don’t know what I’m afraid of, since my family’s great, we live in a safe area and we’re financially secure. Even when I’m laughing I tend to feel like I’m putting it on, instead of genuinely laughing, though there are moments when everything comes into focus and I can feel genuinely happy without the looming sense of dread, but they leave pretty quickly.

My parents and brothers don’t feel the same way as me, so I doubt it’s genetic. My mom only suffered from a thyroid disorder and postpartum depression. Given that I have a very healthy metabolism, have not recently given birth and am a male, I don’t think that this is the problem. My mom is against me seeing anyone for this, since I can talk to her. I have my doubts as to the effectiveness of that for anything other than emotional security when I start worrying that everyone in the world is dead or gone but me (a long-standing fear of mine), but I keep it to myself. Socializing was always difficult for me, so I don’t have many friends I can ask for help.

These were all problems prior to university, it just made them worse. I probably should have taken a gap year, but I wanted to maximize my efficiency since I thought that I may have died before I could attend. That was a mistake. I’m hoping to improve so I can make sense of the mess I’ve left for myself in 2019.",11Dec2018,1
67,"Usually when i'm having a hard time mentally I either get angry or cry it out, but over the past month or so i've been feeling those emotions briefly, but then I go numb and feel like i'm sort of leaving my body from the legs up. Tonight it was particularly bad because I found out that an issue I had with someone is still going and has actually gotten worse. I cried, threw up and then went to bed and felt this ""dissolving"" feeling stronger than it's ever been.

I mentioned this to a friend and she said I should probably do something about it before it turns into something else. Is this normal? As far as I know the only mental health problems I have are depression and anxiety, one time a doctor suggested I might have cptsd but I haven't been officially diagnosed with that. Could the dissolving feeling be part of one of those illnesses? Or is it something else?

70,"I suffer from PTSD and anxiety and my trigger to breaking point is always a breakdown in a relationship. 

This has just recently happened to me, my partner left me and I did not see it coming was completely blindsided. Ended up extremely suicidal and in what I can only describe as a near psychosis and out of touch with reality. I contacted the crisis team (I’m in NZ and crisis team are part of our governments mental health team) and got offered to either be put into a ward with some very mentally ill patients, go to a respite or meds. I chose respite and left after 2 days as it was so lonely and depressing and I was stuck in my head.

Had been taking 25mg Quetiapine to help me sleep (my usual nightly does would be half of this) but it didn’t dull the sudden onset of emotional suicidal waves that would wash over and traumatise me. Had 2mg diazepam also and seems to have no effect.

Today however once I got home I was so desperate so asked my friend for some help (she has a stash of prescription meds for her own issues) and she gave me a tramadol (unsure of dosage but it was just one capsule) and a lorazepam 1mg noting I’d already had my diazepam earlier. And for once I finally feel normal and no suicidal thoughts and just calm and a bit more hopeful about life where I’d previously lost all hope.

I have a psychiatrist appt in a few days and would like to ask the psychiatrist for same or similar acting medications to at least get me through the shock and trauma for the next week or so until the suicidal thoughts pass (noting I haven’t had one since taking the 3 above pills).

I’m doubtful I’ll be given tramadol as I don’t have any pain and tbh I don’t know if it’s a combination of the 3 medications that are making me feel a lot better or one in particular but if this is what will make me literally survive until some of the pain subsides then this is what I feel like I need to ask for and openly to my psychiatrist. 

Has anyone else experienced the same with the same mixture of meds or could point out to me which one you think is having the majority of positive effect (I don’t think it’s the diazepam on it’s own as have taken it previously and not been very helpful). Or what I could say to the psychiatrist to make him know I’m not just after benzos or opioids for fun I’m literally just needing the help to get through this and then I’m done.

71,"Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been lurking around Reddit for multiple years and seen some very specific problems addressed which people can relate to. So I thought let's try.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, since about 5 years I have been getting a knot in my stomach every time I have a vacation. I live my life pretty chill and love every part of it, always happy, even when things seem bad I'm smiling and truly happy (no mask). I've been working for most of the 5 years on which this happened and took 1 or 2 breaks a year since I had no problems with working and never felt the need for a break so I just took some after half a year or more. The unfortunate thing though is that every time I am on a break I get a knot in my stomach, sometimes it's from the moment I'm off, sometimes a couple of days in and this sticks until I start work again. I haven't been able to track down why because while on a break I do only things I like, like going out, going to the gym, party, same as when I work but now without the working part. 

&amp;#x200B;

Beforehand this wasn't a real big problem, it sucked big time that every time I was on a break I was sort of nervous I guess but it's not the end of the world. Now though I'm back to school since the start of this year for a master's degree. Again, been loving the student's life again and school has been great for me, no stress what so ever. Yesterday though it started again, my car broke down last saturday, I left it at work and got a lucky break yesterday morning when it turned out to only need a 15 euro part before it was running again. Went home, layed in bed watching my favourite YouTube things and felt this truly amazing feeling of happiness in my stomach (I guess because everything was going better than expected). That's when I thought like, wow even though I have exams next week everything is going perfectly (I had a paper due that day, was well done with it and I'm full force ahead on all the studying). That was the immediate moment the feeling of happiness turned in to a knot... 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I have been only able to think of why this would happen right now, I have my final exams next week and I should be stressing for them but instead I get a knot (which I always get while on a break?). That's one of the reasons I'm posting this and hoping someone can relate and maybe have learned to cope with it. It's been proven hard to study with it so I'd like to figure something out before my exams start.

&amp;#x200B;

72,"Hello, I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this so if it isn’t, please redirect me to a better place for advice for this.

I’m a 17 year old Trans Male  (been out for a year) from Australia and I’m currently going steady with a boy for a few months now who asks if we can kids, hold hands and stuff usual stuff couples do , I’ve never said yes to anything sexual, which he seems to be fine with but he’s started asking me (very politely) if I was Asexual.

It’s made me question this because from what I know, being asexual is not feeling sexual attraction to anything, which I do. I watch porn and stuff but I don’t see myself with another person and thought of it makes me like, shake the thoughts from my head.

So, onto my sexual assault. It happened in 2013, I’m not sure what months it occurred but I was 11-12 at the time. My brother (I’ll call him Trent), would come into my room and press himself against me, I could feel his erection though his pants I don’t remember a lot of what happened, I remember that he asked me of I could feel it and either later on in that interaction or in a similar one he joked about getting a girlfriend. Trent was around 14-15 at the time, and I’ve since partly forgiven him, however I brought it up to my mother who said she spoke to Trent and he’s said that he has no memory of these events (I think their were at least 6 of them, I can’t remember. I do know one happened st my mothers house and another at my fathers house.)

I’ve actually brought this up with my father as I have a memory of my brother doing this at his house, I screamed ‘Rape’ many times and my father cane into the room, however that’s all I remember. My father says he doesn’t remember it either which leads me to believe I might have dreamt/fabricated it, which messes me up mentally, even now I feel panic in my chest for writing about this as last time I did my mother yelled at me and told me I could be sued because I had no evidence (which I don’t, I don’t even know if any of its real)

So, back to the question at hand, my partner (I’ll call him Kyle) he thought I was asexual but he’s also confused now that I’ve told him all this, if it is asexuality or I’m just suffering from trauma. I haven’t been to a therapist or anything about this, which I will be hopefully going to soon because I also feel like I have a lot of other issues. I am very sensitive to touch and I will freak out if someone touches me without me knowing/seeing they are going to touch me. Like at a hair dresser or dentist I feel fine with them touching me but if a friend just hugs me suddenly I freak out, breathing heavily, I shake a little and it takes a minute or two for me to calm down. I also get anxiety attacks frequently (along with my dysphoria for being trans )

76,"Hi, kind of a lurker. I forgot I had a username/account specifically for posts of this type. My SO knows my username for my main account.

A couple years ago, I had a psych evaluation done. I won’t go into the details of what led me down that path but there was a hospitalization or two involved. From my psych evaluation, I was diagnosed with five things. One of them was “F60.89 Personality Disorder, mixed”. I’m still trying to wrap my head around what it means.

I stopped seeing a psychiatrist over a year ago. I’ve been medication free for over a year (Effexor XR and Rexulti) for my anxiety and depression. It was a doozy trying to wean off of those. Still trying to deal with the massive weight gain of being on it. No MDD episodes since weaning off, but there have been a handful of panic attacks and a large amount of intrusive thoughts. I’m trying to find a therapist in my area now, but it’s a bit too early for regular office hours. So I’m here trying to seek some validation/conversation with Redditors on this sub about this diagnosis.

I guess my question is, does anyone else have a Mixed Personality Disorder? Or a Personality Disorder?

From what I understand through Google-Fu, it’s definitely a mixed diagnosis of the 10 possible personality disorder diagnoses. I initially thought I had Bipolar Disorder then I thought I had Borderline Personality Disorder. But I can also self-guess so much before seeking professional help.",11Dec2018,1

78,"So I'm going to keep this short and simple because I'm not sure anyone going to see it even but. Quick backstory, I'm 21 years old and have recently just begun opening up to a friend of mine about some mental health issues potentially and just talked to a doctor. I've never thought anything of it but he talked about it like I sounded crazy and its got me worried and researching. Well here's the story, basically, I woke up one day when I was around 8 years old but one day I woke up completely not knowing who I was. I remember being woke up by my brother and not recognizing his face at all or what was going on it was almost like it wasn't my body or I had just gotten one, I realize I probably sound crazy but yeah. After waking up and kind of just playing along I remember being just very stressed out and arriving at school, and at my school, everyone lined up in lines with their teachers outside of school and waited for the bell to ring to go in. But when I showed up, I knew no one had no clue where I was and just kind of figured it out, from then on I don't really remember at least not accurate enough to say. Well If you've read this much so far thank you I appreciate the interest and wanting to help me out. In my own research, I've watched some videos like "" What It's Like To Live with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)"" on youtube. It honestly felt like eye-opening and relatable... I'm not sure if that just the annoying millennial in me trying to self diagnose myself with something to feel unique or what but, hopefully, someone finds this interesting enough to get talking.

79,"Background: I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia by my psychiatrist at the age of 13 and OCD at the age 10, I am currently 14 years old. But I recall having delusions and OCD symptoms before that.

This is my attempt to try to help those with this specific problem I'm about to address.

Problem: I always think, commenting on what I'm doing recalling past even when I'm dping something. Songs playing in my head constantly, talking in my mind so much that my physical body moves automatically, foget everything, can't understand conversations, feel disconnected with physical things. 

What I did/am doing: I'm taking antipsychotics and antidepressants as instructed by my psychiatrist and am going to a therapist. The therapy sessions helped me alot and I've taken notes and summarized what I've experienced

Probable Solution:
• To stop general abnormal thinking:
change focus on sensations and
focus there, dont stop thinking by
controlling your mind or by telling 
your mind to stop. Just switch 
focus to physical sensations
• For example:
1. Feel your body, shirt and what you're looking at, ambient sounds, games and such.
• For the procedure:
1. If you dont know, hold something rub it on your skin and focus the sensation there and thats the general feeling of changing sensations
• Important Notes: 
Don't enhance attention, it feels like tightening head Even if it's weak there is still the sensation and it will grow stronger once fed.",11Dec2018,1
80,"I have had generalized anxiety since I was 7. Great home growing up, great parents. They were a little strict, but I appreciate that so much now as an adult. 

My dad was weird about pets, I don’t really know why. He grew up in Brooklyn and they only ever had one dog growing up, so maybe it just wasn’t a common thing then? 

I think the first time I asked for a cat was when I was around 7. My dad didn’t think I would be responsible enough for a pet, and my mom didn’t want a litter box. Fair enough. I think I asked for a cat every year until I moved out. We did get a dog when I was 10, and she’s amazing!!! Cutest lil fluffy bear.

So I’m almost 22 now, and I adopted two kittens on Father’s Day.  I’m a college student and new pet fees can be steep. My local humane society had free adoptions that day, and I was like “fuck it, it’s kitty time.” So I got two girls, sisters. They have honestly changed my life. They make me feel so happy, I feel like I’ve smiled more in the last 7 months than I have in the last 7 years. 

I remember telling my mom that I wished I had a pet that loved me the way pepper (the family dog) loved her. Like, google eyes, snuggly, unconditional love. And now I have it!!! It feels like a really special connection. I try to give them lots of attention and learn their patterns and behaviors so I can understand them, and it feels like they know that. They’re angels. They don’t bite, scratch, or destroy anything. They will let you touch them anywhere, and even let us open up their mouth if we had to. 

It’s so nice to feel grounded. I feel like sometimes I get stuck in a bad place in my head, then a little kitty just jumps in my bed with me and it’s like I snap back to reality. 

If you don’t have a pet, I urge you to try to adopt! Obviously don’t adopt a furry friend if you can’t afford it or don’t have the time, but if you do, this is your sign. You’ll save a pets life, and maybe they can save yours❤️",11Dec2018,1

With support, a spiritual connection to YOUR higher power and a clear understanding of the possible obstacles ahead. Our destination will be met. We might have had to take 3 cars, a bus and a train to get there. Our destination might have changed due to the detours.

83,"I’ve suffered from mental health my whole life. I have a diary from back when I was 8 years old and in this diary I log my “daily depression”... I was quite freaked out when I saw this. What 8 year old even knows what depression is? When I was 15 I had my first ever heartbreak &amp; stopped going to school. I told my family doctor I was depressed and he put me on some medication and told me that should work. It didn’t. It made things worse, so I stopped taking them. I started hanging out with the wrong people. I never went to school, I skipped to drink with awful people. I would hide booze in my room and my mom would raid my room and hide it in hers then I would raid her room and it went on like this for a long time. 

My dad was a mentally abusive narcissist and my mom left him when I was 15. It was my brother &amp; I who told our mother we would not go back. She worked 8am-9pm every day to stay away from him so I never really knew my mom. But when she left him, we became the closest I have ever been to anyone. I’ve never had friends longer than a few months, boyfriends never stay and always cheat on me... 

So I went back to my doctor at 18 and said “I’m still fucking sad, do something” and he put me on some more pills and sent me on my way... I came back at 19 and said no. Do something. He actually took me seriously and sent me for psychiatry where I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which explained so much. I went in for weekly therapy and it was going great. Until my therapist told me that this session was going to be our last. Now, I’m absolutely freaking out because what do I do now?! I’m so sad about it. 

Then back in October, I was working at a small store in a small, local town and my bosses husband was very... touchy... and made... weird comments. One day my coworker couldn’t take it anymore, had a mental breakdown and called the police. This resulted in me losing my job. I was unemployed once before this job and it took me 7 months to be happy working somewhere. But I understand why she called the police, he was sexually harassing all of us. Last month in November my car broke down, $2500. Luckily my mom still had money on credit cards and was able to pay it... but now my car needs $400 more and I have no money, my mom has no money. &amp; I’m just so stressed out. 

I feel like my illness and family took away a normal life for me, I just graduated high school at 21. Which I’m proud of... but just wish I could go back and do it over. Go to school, get an education, go to college, get a decent job with decent money so I’m not literally broke as fuck. I can’t even pay my bills right now... let alone buy groceries. I feel so fucked and I don’t know what the fuck to do. It seems like I never catch a break. &amp; I hate sounding like I’m complaining but fuck man I can’t take it anymore!!

85,"Hey all

Apologies in advance if this is not in the appropriate subreddit, feel free to remove this if that's the case. Apologies also for the wall of text!

Anyhoo, a little background: Male, 28, Finland. I have a history of dealing with anxiety, particularly panic disorder which left me in a pretty non-functional state for quite a few years. Through a few years of therapy, I got it under control to the point where I've been totally fine 95% of the time for about 5 years now. Occasional flare ups happen, and there are still some things that are difficult for me (long trips for example, and I don't mean the drug kind, har har), but considering that I've never been prescribed medication, I think it's been going quite well! I've got a job in my field and am currently in my (hopefully, FINALLY) last year and a half of university.

**The Actual Topic**:

For about four years, I drank very little alcohol. This was due to a number of reasons. First, me and my roommate at the time were both students with no jobs living a decent way away from the city, and going to a bar was pretty stressful on our budgets. If I went to a bar, I went sober. Dealing with anxiety was also a component, because I am pretty much a living corpse when hungover (seriously, I've had the hangovers of a 45 year old since I was like 18).

In any case, my roommate eventually moved in with his girlfriend, and since I didn't know anyone else I wanted to live with who didn't already have a roommate, I moved closer to the city on my own. Round about this time I also got a job. Suddenly, I could walk into the city in about 10 minutes and I had money to go party. This sort of set something off in me, and it's like I've been taking back all those prime party years now. Suffice to say, for the last year and a half or so, I've been drinking quite a lot at least by my standards.

*(Note on self medication: I can actually pretty confidently say that I don't self-medicate anxiety with alcohol. Exactly the opposite in fact. When I'm feeling low, I have zero desire to drink. Drinking is a fun thing for me, and drinking when I feel like crap just makes me feel even more like crap.)*

I haven't been drinking daily or anything, only on Friday **or** Saturday (never both), but definitely more than is healthy. To put it another way: there have been a pretty small number of weekends over the last year where I was sober all the way through. This fall has been particularly party heavy, with my birthday party, my friends 30th, my office party, and other such things, and on all occasions, I ended up pretty much plastered.

A few weeks ago, after a Saturday night out with some friends, the hangover was psychologically even worse than normal. It basically kicked off a sort of ""depressivey, anxiety-ey episode"" that's been going ever since.

I've actually always been kind of scared of developing what I call in my head ""proper depression"", because I always felt like Anxiety I could deal with, but Depression just scares the hell out of me. This is possibly another case of my anxiety doing the thinking for me, you know? As in, maybe the fear of developing a major depressive disorder is another way for my anxiety to show itself.

**If you have anxiety or depression, what has your experience with alcohol been?** I've always known that I feel like literal garbage when hungover, and I've had short-term anxiety/depression episodes started by a hangover before, but this time, **it feels almost as if the cumulative effects of so many drunken weekends in succession have sort of caught up with me (I don't know if that's a thing, but it sure feels like it).** I dunno, I also wonder if this is still somewhat caused by missing my ex, with whom I broke up a year ago. It sorta takes me a while to get over people once I actually start liking them. I kind of doubt that that's a major component here, though.

Anyone else had a similar experience? I'm definitely closing the cork (as we say here) until New Years when I'm going to a cabin with a few friends. Might even go sober there too.

The symptoms my friend described set off a lot of alarm bells with me, so I went in. The ADHD was diagnosed immediately, followed by a \~600 question test designed to evaluate my mental state. The Dr. I'm seeing is very uncommunicative and dismissive of questions and input.

When I went for a follow up a month later (this month), the first thing he said when he looked at my results was: ""You lied to make yourself sound better than you are. You aren't hearing voices or seeing things are you?"". To which I replied, no, I'm not. He proceeded to write me two additional prescriptions in addition to increasing my adderall dosage. No explanation for why these drugs, no discussion of side effects or interactions, no discussion of what to anticipate, and he was shooing me out the door.

I'm now on:

15 mg Adderall 2x a day

2 mg of Theothixine before bed

32.5 mg of Venlafaxine in the morning

&amp;#x200B;

The side effects of the Theothixine and Venlafaxine are particularly worrisome, but most disturbing too me is that he prescribed Theothixine at all. I look up all meds before taking them, and it's an antipsychotic. It has been prescribed in the past for off label use, but everything I can find says this isn't common now. I would hope that he would tell me if I showed positive for schizophrenia, but with his mannerism I can't be sure.

101,"I have a friend who I've known for almost 6 years or 7 years and recently he has stopped speaking to me, blocked me on everything, I am still shocked because I miss mine and his friendship so so much, I sound like a drip but he doesn't understand how much mine and his friendship meant. I go to speak to him but I get nervous and he ignores me and sometimes he looks at me and I get worried and nervous. Sometimes my friends want me to confront him but I get too nervous and I get uncomfortable

102,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone had any experience with setraline (zooloft).

&amp;#x200B;

I've just got back from the doctors, explained I have not been myself. Very down, cant see the light, lost appetite etc. All that sort of thing...... I also explained I have a pain in my abdomen, but all tests have come back fine. I wonder if my brain is manifesting the pain?!

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short... He has given me sertraline. Told me to try it for 28 days and then come back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I admit I am not myself at the moment. Very down in the dumps. I am a teacher so have a really demanding job, work 65 hours a week easily, weekends, parents are a nightmare, the entire system is. So it has certainly got me down.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it is christmas holidays soon. So I am in a predicament, do I try super hard to get myself straight over hols without the medication OR do I take it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very worried that if I take it, as soon as I come off i will be even worse. I can't afford to have withdrawal from it and feel even worse while I am back of school when I come of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone else has had any experience of it and what it did for them?

&amp;#x200B;

Many thanks, 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post

That’s just an idealistic quote made up by someone. Ideally it’s great, in practice it doesn’t work. If my friends are I are working to get money, and lets say I die tomorrow, worst case. I spend my last day working, or doing whatever I didn’t want to do, so that’s sad.

It’s also disheartening to see unaccountability. This dude with his say 5 year old daughter came into our work bathroom. Not only did the bathroom have toilet paper strewn about on the floor, there was feces in the toilet? I figured a few things may have happened.

* The man simply forgot he was in a bathroom, which seems difficult... yet possible I suppose.
* He didn’t care about flushing the toilet, which seems weird and strange. If that’s the case, he also didn’t care about picking up after himself.

Once, all I wanted to do was use a public restroom. So I tell the associate at the register. There wasn’t a line behind me, to clarify.

&gt; Excuse me... I was hoping to use the restroom and there was no toilet paper...

&gt; Thank you for telling me.

I said “thanks” and waked away. I was disappointed to see that the associate’s response didn’t address the situation, and neither confirmed nor denied help. In fact, I didn’t really know what ‘thanks’ meant in that situation. 

Asking another worker at that place, while she promised to find a manager, unfortunately that yielded no results. Going back to the restroom around 15 minutes later to see no toilet paper was disappointing, so I left.


My family is very compassionate and caring. By compassionate and caring, I mean judgmental and critical. 

&gt; Get a fucking job!

Or basically:

&gt; These are my standards. If you can’t meet my standards then you must be ‘whatever’.

‘Whatever’ is an insult they want to throw at me, at the time. Say lazy, or depressed, or both. Ive actually been called depressed as an insult, strangely enough.

Ironically enough, I’ve been criticized for addressing my family’s criticisms, which makes perfect sense! Not only do I deserve to be criticized, it’s my family’s business what I do, as in judging someone is a good use of your time, as in sarcasm.

Here’s a pretty good example of my brother judging me:

We were carrying loads of bricks to into a truck/trailer, and he was arranging them into piles to load. I’d bring 6 per his request, then after so long of brining bricks, I got upset we randomly didn’t have any water, on a hot summer day. Asking the seller for a glass of water, since we were  at their house, apparently made too much sense. 

&gt; Oh, we can’t do that!

Baffled, I kept working. Though I noticed I was getting tired, so I brought 5, then 4 bricks per load.

&gt; Oh, I need 6 bricks per load!

I respond with:

&gt; Wait, what? I’m getting tired, we have no water, it’s like 70-80 degrees out... I mean of course I’m getting tired.

&gt; Not my fucking problem, quit bitching and bring 6 bricks per load!

I respond with:

&gt; What’s going to happen if I come with 4 or 5 bricks per load? Is the world going to explode?

I got a lot of my sarcastic vibes from my chronically depressed friend, who I typically consider one of the most realistic people I know. He’s never physically witnessed my family criticizing me, but if he did I say to him that *he’d* say something like:

&gt; Not only does he deserve to be criticized by us,  we do it because we love him, and it’s also our responsibility to judge people!

That’s all done in sarcasm. I don’t know if this is good, but I find comfort in his sardonic nature, and I’ve seemed to have adopted more sarcasm than before I met him.

I obviously struggle with depression and anxiety. Sometimes I really hate my family, and I feel like I’d have a better time only associating with the ones I’m closest to. I haven’t mentioned my parents yet, not only are they very accountable for their actions, uhh never mind no sarcasm needed. They aren’t accountable at all. There have been times where I told my mom I would more than happy to verify her seemingly impossible or unfounded claims with a mental health professional, and get their statement in writing.

Gosh, writing all this really reminded me of a lot of memories. All very irritating unfortunately. I’ve just been dealt and shitty hand, and it’s not my fault.

105,"I'm not going to, but I'm so angry at myself and my stupid behaviour. A WHOLE FUCKING DAY WASTED! I can't comprehend how I can be such a lazy piece of shit. Like seriously, what a wasted day. Why would I do this? I have so many projects to work on and I'm not making use of my time. This is a bad joke. This feels so unreal that I just want to slap myself back to my senses. I'm at a loss of what to do.",11Dec2018,1
106,"Usually I don’t like to spill my whole sob story, and I‘ve never posted on here before, but I’m at a genuine loss at what to do and I’m struggling :/ 

For some backstory, I’ve had panic attack disorder for a few years,  but it’s gotten much better since I was moved out of a stressful environment (I used to get them 5+ times a week, now I get them about 3 times every two or three months). But I’ve also noticed that I now have mood swings (revealed underneath aaaaall that anxiety :) in an almost foreseeable pattern, and I want to chalk it up to puberty (I’m 17 aaaand female) but the people around me don’t seem to react the same way to what’s deemed as my “normal” and “average” mood swings. I always feel violent (towards myself) and unmotivated to even take a shower when I feel really down, but I always feel super inspired and excited about life when I’m up. I could trip and it’d make me want to cry and punch a wall, but other times I’ll decide to fully clean out my room, do yoga for an hour, drink only green tea and attempt to hang out with every single person I could possibly think of for no reason other than I feel like it. It’s exhausting and I don’t know how to control it. 

I’d like to think I’m a pretty honest person. So when my mother saw (so sorry if anyone’s reading this and unprepared, a little trigger warning if this type of thing affects you) a bandaid and blood yesterday, I said that I had done it to myself. I didn’t know how to get around it, so I just told the truth. I thought she’d be a bit sympathetic, because usually, she’s a very reasonable person. She got angry, which I didn’t expect, and began to yell at me. She asked me sarcastically if I was trying to get social services and that the doctor would have to be mandated to report this, as I have a physical coming up. Over the years, I’ve been telling her that I need a therapist, or maybe just someone to talk to me and diagnose me (or let me know this was all normal). She said (sarcastically yet again :) that maybe I really did need a therapist, huh? Then slammed a door in my face. 

I want to be able to say “it’s my mood swings!” but I can’t tell: are these normal, or something more? I don’t want to self diagnose (we all know the dangers of that) but I also don’t want to let this become worser than it is by letting it continue unchecked. And if this is all fine and dandy and normal, why can’t I cope?

The words hurt, especially since I’m so confused. I didn’t expect this. Now the whole house has a weird energy. Everyone living there is telling me that I need to stop doing this (which I would really like to, but I have no idea how! my mood swings feel so all encompassing and everything feels hard to do) and they’re angry/disappointed at me for doing this. I don’t know what to do, or how to talk to my mother. What’s worse is that I feel a bit indifferent, like a car could crash me and I’d be like, oh well! :) My mood was so bad yesterday, I couldn’t do anything productive. But now I feel fine enough right now that I don’t even understand why I’d want to hurt myself. 

Everyone keeps telling me I need to pray to God or just stop doing this, but all it does in my perspective is draw a boundary. If I can’t properly pray this out, is it because I have no faith? If I can’t just stop, does this mean I have no self control and discipline?

I guess this turned into a bit of a rant aha. Thank you to anyone who’s reading this, and anyone who can offer me advice or tips! I feel a bit like I’m sitting on my hands. ",11Dec2018,1
107,"Started off the day all happy and cheery and feeling confident. The day went on and something happened in my brain, that moment I stopped and so many emotions came over me, mainly sadness, loneliness and sadness and I suddenly felt alone and down.

The rest of the day I put a fake smile on my face and faked a smile, was pretty convincing. I sent a message to my parents and sisters saying that I get nervous and that I'm struggling socially. Their reactions were what I expected like 'We are all here for you' 'Anything you need we can do for you'. At the moment I almost cried because I felt that I let down my family and I don't know why.

That night I came home and My parents had bought me my favorite pizza and it put me in a good mood for a couple of minutes. I felt so alone and mentally ill, I hardly ate any of my favorite meal.

My dad came in and sat with me in my room and he spoke to me about how he can sort out any problems I am facing or if I wanted to move schools, I thought about it but I struggled to give an answer,

An hour later I put my phone and Ipad down and had a real think about everything, I felt lonely, upset, worthless and depressed. I went into the kitchen to find some tablets, I then went into the bathroom and I had a blade with me and I placed the blade on my wrist and I just couldn't come to terms with what I was doing, I put the blade in the bin.

I then take some tablets to soothe my pain, my friend then rings my parents to let them know what was happening.

I will never forget the moment they came downstairs running into my room to see what was happening, my mum immediately took me to the bathroom and told me to try and throw up the tablets. I couldn't, I just couldn't.

My parents were so worried my dad wanted my mum to stay in my room that night. I woke that morning feeling so much regret but also a relief. I came to terms that night that I'm not alone, I'm not alone and people do care

108,"After years of having an “unspecified anxiety disorder” I was told yesterday by a new psychiatrist that I “clearly” have major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. I’ve been prescribed Prozac and Xanax and was referred to a psychologist for therapy sessions. 

I’ve known for so long that I have depression and anxiety and it feels so freeing to finally have someone say “yes, you do have problems and we’re going to solve them” and not just throwing medication at me and hoping it would work. 

I’m 20 but I think I’ve been depressed on and off for about 8 years. I’ve had anxiety as long as I can remember. I feel a sense of relief knowing now that I’m going to have professional help and a professional support system. My friends are amazing and supportive and I love them dearly but they can’t do what a therapist does. I start Prozac today and I’m excited for the next six weeks as my body adjusts to the new meds.

111,"So I've been different basically my whole life. I haven't really accepted this, or realized how much so until recently. I've always had anger issues. When I was a kid, just losing to many games or something would send me into a tantrum. On top of this, I've just felt odd. When people express feelings for each other around me it frustrates me. It's just I barely understand why people have feelings like that toward one another, and it confuses the hell out of me. I kind of know what emotions are, but quantifying them within myself and others is difficult. Identifying them in others is also a struggle for me. However, I may now know why I've been this kind of frustrated asshole. I might have autism.

Looking at the list of signs of autism spectrum disorder, so many things seemed to make sense. With clarity however, came a sort of frustration though. I'm 25, and I'm just now realizing this? How? How could my parents not see this? How could none of my school's teachers not see it? Am I just imagining these connections? Torrents of questions such as this flooded my mind for over two weeks. I've always known about my depression, and have attempted to improve my situation there (though never actually committed to it, whizzed back to my old problems and etc. Etc.), but this was problematic beyond just, ""I feel sad all the time."" This was me suddenly realizing my sense of empathy was shit. And by extension, this makes me a far shittier human being than I ever thought I was. My head has only recently stopped spiraling long enough for me to know what I need. I fucking need help. And I need to actually commit to doing it this time. Otherwise, I'll just die alone in a fucking alleyway or something...

I have a lot of other symptoms I feel could be pointing towards an undiagnosed mental illness, mainly manic symptoms, light delusions, paranoia, self harm, blah blah. I want to mention these and be evaluated because if there is something that isn't being treated, I want it to be treated. I want to live normal again, and I also don't want to sound like I'm just a kid googling stuff and self-diagnosing. 

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? How did you deal with it? My family doctor's office has a social worker that offers free counseling and I agreed to see her for a consultation in a few weeks, so I guess I'll go from there.

They stopped talking to me and i havent seen them since. I had no one for the first month, my first time moving out for college and all i could think about was how worthless and pathetic i was for not having friends and doing what they were doing which was going to clubs and parties for freshers.

I try to help him the best i can but i always feel that he doesnt want me around, i always feel like that when i get close to people. He is down again tonight so i suggested i came to his and brought him cake. He didnt respond but is active. I feel like a pain to everyone. Ive been initiating meetups with him about 5 times straight, i try to remember that its harder for him so maybe thats why he doesnt.

So with that void of ""things to do"" at first I didn't know what to do when I wanted a cigarette or was bored and wanted to go to a bar to get drunk.

What in the world will I do?!"" haha.. I wasn't laughing then, though. I was scared!! About a week in though I looked down at my NEEDY little rescue pup that I found last summer and he was looking at me with such admiration and patience and it was like I had never really SEEN him before.

Same with my cat, if I need some low energy love or silent company he will just sit by me/on me until my mood changes and then we get up and clean or something.

I feed him once a week and bring him out every night for about an hour. It's such a relief to know that I'm not stuck anymore.

123,"I've learned that the daughter I'm expecting next year will have a very complicated congenital heart defect that will require lots of surgeries and an extended hospital stay about three hours from where I live and work.

I'd been struggling with concentration and motivation issues at work prior to this diagnosis. It's absolutely critical I can keep this job so I can keep our family's health insurance. My worry is that my focus will only deteriorate as our reality unfolds.

124,"I really need to vent about my brother who is very clearly dealing with some serious mental issues that have never been addressed but were definitely noticed from a young age. I find it really hard to be empathetic towards him because he is also just a straight up asshole to be completely honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some things my Brother has done....

\- (This October) Raised a hammer at my Dad yelling ""APOLOGIZE TO ME! APOLOGIZE!""  which then turned into my Dad calling the cops to diffuse the situation (My Dad would never get physical with my brother) during an argument over my brother not turning his music down 

\- (Within the past year) During an argument in the car with my Dad my brother pushed the gear shift while they driving (thankfully it only went into neutral and not reverse) 

\- (This month) Made fun of my Mom for having to go home and rest after she stayed up 24 hours to drive him to court in the morning (My mom works overnights -- 10pm-6am and my brother had to go to court for the whole hammer situation at 9am so my mom had to go right after work to drive him) I think he wanted to go back to her place but she said she needed to sleep and he just started mimicking her and acting rude as hell towards her 

\- Since my brother can't live with my Dad anymore due to the whole hammer situation, I got all of my brother's things from my Dad's house. He had a desk or a table thing which could be taken apart easily, so my Dad took it apart I'm assuming because he could and it would be easier to move. When my brother saw that this was done he said ""That motherf\*\*ker"" as if my Dad did that to screw him over in some way.... Also, when I was filling up his backpack with some of his smaller things, my Dad went to the bathroom and grabbed his shampoo and soaps and he just put it in the backpack. When I gave my brother his backpack, he instantly thought that my Dad had put that stuff in it in the hopes it would spill and ruin his things? I was there and did not get that feeling whatsoever. 

\- (Always) Makes my parents pay for everything. My Mom pays his cellphone bill, my Dad bought his Macbook pro, my Dad pays for his subway/bus tickets, my mom is currently paying for his rent and his groceries, my dad pays for his Adobe subscription, and has laughed at my Dad when he asks to pay him back

\- (A few years ago) Stormed off at my cousin's wedding because I moved around our tables seating arrangement (I moved my brothers name tag to go beside me since we were sitting at a table with strangers so I assumed he would rather sit beside me) It was so embarrassing because he was so rude to everyone and after he stormed off and left the wedding they were all wondering what was wrong with him

\- (3 years ago) My Dad lives in our childhood home which neither me or my brother have spent a night in since we were like literally 13 (I'm 25 and he's 27) I was living with my Dad for a short while and decided to take over my brothers room because it was the most liveable room. My brother came to visit (was living 8 hours away at this time in his boyfriends hometown) and was really angry that I had taken over his room (again, he has not stepped foot into his old bedroom since he was 13). I was at a dentist appointment during this and was told to just not come home because he was punching and kicking holes into the walls

\- (5 years ago) We were spending Easter at my stepdads house with his family (sister-in-law, brother, nieces, nephews, my stepbrothers, his mom and dad). My stepdads mom is quite old, but is very very nice. If she offers you something and you decline, she will usually insist that we take some. She kept asking my brother if he wanted coffee and in front of everyone very rudely says ""Mom, can you tell her that I don't want coffee"" and then literally left the house all together. This was the first time I was really surprised about my brother's behaviour and even called him afterwards to apologize since it's always a bit awkward when we go over there because it's more of my stepdads family than ours and I felt maybe he was upset about this, felt uncomfortable, I told him I should have gone into the basement with him so we could feel a bit more comfortable alone but he insisted that my stepdad's old italian mom was in the wrong... because she asked him more than once if he wanted some coffee

\- He holds grudges like no one else I've ever encountered -- when I was a teenager, ok I hold full responsibility of how shitty a kid I was, but I used to steal his loose change which he collected religiously so I could buy cigarettes or something. He knew I did this and a couple years later when I had a job I paid him back and we were actually friends. I would go over to his place, we would hangout, and then after not talking for some time he just hate me all over again. He actually reiterated WHY he hates me in a text message sometime this past year and that was one of the reasons -- because I took some money from him 10 years ago (even though I paid him back)

&amp;#x200B;

There's more but that's all I can think of for now.  It makes me sad that his actions aren't necessarily his fault...there's something happening within him that makes him act this way that he has not control over. He's actually like incredibly smart, he's even gifted and had to go to a different elementary school that would challenge him more. So, he's really book smart but can't process his emotions, nor can he take accountability for his actions. It's ALWAYS someone else's fault and he believes that to his core. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does this seem familiar to anyone? I know he needs to see a psychiatrist and I think my mom is helping him in that process, but was just curious if this has been an experience with anyone else? ",11Dec2018,1
125,"**PART 2 - Me (32F) together with boyfriend (36M) for 1 year - feeling like Plan B**

**Thanks to everyone for your assistance with my prior post. It really means a lot that there are so many kind strangers in this world. Also please forgive my Reddit nubness, I'm a long time Reddit lurker but not much a poster so still new at this.**

**Some things I wanted to add: People are pointing out I should be concerned with his level of forwardness upfront. A couple notes: a) he and his entire family are sugary sweet to everyone b) In my dating bio, I didn’t just have a picture, but a link to a longer about section that resonated a lot with his interests, beliefs, values, etc (we were also having pretty upfront indepth lengthy conversations from day one) and c) the forwardness wasn't and isn't a concern to me. Different strokes for different folks I suppose.**

***My concern isn’t even him messaging someone else before we met (that’s to be expected with online dating, nothing’s real til you meet in person) but rather the message he sent specifying he’s all about me alone and despite that, still sending a very affectionate letter to his ex.***

**For any newcomers, my prior post was as follows (edited to clarify prior misunderstandings). If there's any constructive feedback, I'd love to hear.**  
**\~**  
About a year ago, boyfriend and I matched on Bumble. We talked for a week, met for dinner, and started dating shortly after. From the beginning he was laying it on thick - incredibly flirty and way over the top forward (almost too forward) about us getting together, dating, etc.

We've been together a year now and it's been the most fulfilling (least drama filled) relationship I've had. He drives 2 hours to see me every weekend and gets a hotel with no complaints and regularly tells me he can't wait to start a family and build a life together.

Recently, he applied for a job out closer to me and in anticipation of an interview follow up email we're extra excited about, we've been checking his emails frantically (we have an open phone policy). At one point I googled some keywords to see if maybe it'd gone to junk/spam and while searching stumbled across an email he sent to his ex (girl he dated right before me) the day right after we matched on Bumble:  
""I miss you and think of you every single day. I love you with all my heart. My heart belongs to you. I hope you and the kids are doing great. I truly miss you all. I love you.""

He sent this to her 11/11/17. We matched on 11/10/17. Earlier in the day 11/11/17 he wrote \*\*me\*\*:  
 ""I want you to know if you end up wanting to be together, I am going to delete these accounts in a heartbeat! Because I want you and only you! There is no need to ever talk to anyone else. I am very old school in the sense that I talk to one woman and never would even begin to talk to someone else while I'm talking to someone."" 

So I'm like what the heck? How could you be messaging me you want only me and are willing to delete your online dating profiles - then hours later that day send such an affectionate letter to your ex?  Like, I realize it was a year ago. And I realize I have no right to feel this way considering technically we weren't exclusive at this point and hadn't even met face to face. Again, my concern isn’t even him messaging someone else before we met (that’s to be expected with online dating, nothing’s real til you meet in person) but rather the message he sent specifying he’s all about me alone and despite that, still sending a very affectionate letter to his ex.

(Some facts to consider about their prior relationship - they dated 2 months, she was pursuer, told him she wanted to marry and wanted him to move in with her and her 3 kids right away while she was moving her prior boyfriend out (her neighbor said she was like Baskin Robbins with a new flavor every week LOL). So he gets a job lined up and starts slowly moving his stuff in - she lived an hour away so he had to up and relocate. The week before he's due to move in, she suddenly starts picking fights over the littlest things.   
The days before he's due to move in, she starts saying they should see less of each other, maybe every other weekend, he starts questioning what's changed? She then breaks it off altogether. He kept contacting her asking what happened? How'd this go from 100 to zero suddenly overnight? He then gets a call from the cops telling him she has requested he no longer contact her and if he does, a restraining order will be filed. This came totally out of left field with zero explanation from her.  
MY THEORY: she was on a ""break"" with the previous guy (who never knew her dating someone new - she hid it saying he was just a coworker and never introduced them), re-made up with him, and wanted to avoid the confrontation of having to explain things/be the bad guy. I'll also add boyfriend isn't the most experienced at dating as he married his first serious girlfriend, was cheated on after a decade, divorced, and this was his first serious relationship since that.)  


He says he swears on his mother's life that when he sent this message he had zero intent on winning this girl back. But rather he was so desperate for answers, as  to why she would've just up and left him out of nowhere with zero explanation. I said ""Soooo...why not ask why she ended things instead of telling her you love her?"" 

He said, ""Remember? I did that already and she had the cops call me. If I did that again she'd have me arrested."" He said maybe if he sent an email tugging at her heartstrings, maybe that would prompt her to reply something that would clue him in on why she ended things (met someone else, you weren't abc enough, etc.).

It seems weird to me and every time I get down about it, he sees it and reminds me ""Remember that I told you I swore on my mother's life. Let my mother go to hell when she dies if I'm lying about my intent. You know I would never say that if I was lying.""

(I'll add I'm in therapy for relationship anxiety and past sabotaging tendencies - been going about 5 years now.)

Does anyone have any constructive insight on this? Or been in a similar situation and have advice? Am I the backup here?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR boyfriend messaged his ex the day after matching online with me (before meeting officially) right after telling me he's only interested me. I have self sabotaging tendencies and anxiety. I now feel like I was Plan B in that moment.",11Dec2018,1
126,"Hello,

I have always been a successful child: I was a good student, my marks were good, I was doing well in a specific sport, my parents were so proud of me whatever... 

I clearly remeber that day when I was walking back from school and was just thinking how good my life is: I had good parents, we were financially stable, I had everything what I needed. I had nothing to worry about.

But then something changed and I still don't know what. I was maybe 14-15 years old when my ""career"" took a turn.

I was very rarely teased or mocked?(is this the right word?) about my appearance, I had long hair that time,(I'm male) my parents wanted me to have long hair, I was a kid. But then I remeber my friend asked me why I had long hair, I said because of my parents. He told me that I should get a haircut and I went to the barber cuz i didnt like it. I was 16 years old this time. I stepped in, took a seat and told the hairdresser that i wanted a short haircut...after that I realised I that i was going bald, i had that male pattern baldness on the 2 sides, it wasn't that bad but i still couldnt have short hair. so what other choice did i have than let my hair grow and let it cover those sides...My grades got worse, I started losing competitions and eventually after a year I quit my sport. its all because of the lack of confidence.

now I'm 18 years old and I became a nobody. I dont want to do anything, i have no social life, i rarely go out with friends. i consider myself weak in the mind if you understand me, i have always been training, and working out when i was little, but now i dont have the will power to actually keep going and continue with it.

 it's all genetics, there is nothing i can do about my baldness. maybe hairtransplant but have to be 25 or older. everyone is bald or going bald in my family, ridiculous. The saddest part is that I d look good and some say i look good but if I dont like  myself what can I do? everyone can say anything but if you dont accept it then...sometimes when i go on the street and look in a car's window to see my reflection, usually my will to live goes away.  i really have no life if i can say this, but im not planning to suicide because i know it ll be better someday. it's funny how this is my biggest problem in life when others have more serious problems but still.

My question is what can i do to accept myself, how can i possibly solve this?

130,"this has been bothering me for quite some time. my mental health deteriorated rather quickly this semester and to be honest it’s still getting worse. i used to skip class once in a while but a few weeks ago i stopped showing up to campus all together. i would leave home around the time i should be in class and sit in a parking lot or drive around for a few hours so my mom thinks i went to school. 

my professors have started to notice my absences since most of my classes are pretty small. one professor publicly threatened to fail me &amp; tell the university that i haven’t been present for a third of the semester and therefore can’t earn the credit for the class if i missed a class again.

132,"hey, I didn't know where to post this, I didn't wanna post it on any drug sub. I just thought this would be the right place to post. 
a few months ago I was prescribed .5mg of Ativan to take if needed. I took it once on the weekends to see how it felt, it just gave me a sense of calmness and a kind of weariness I can't really explain. anyways it did make me a tad bit less anxious , in general. I took it maybe once more before work or something.
now yesterday, many months later, I decided to take one before texting someone something big for me. I know that was really bad. I didn't wanna feel that sense of panic if they replied negatively. I know I have a tendency to have an obsessive personality so this makes sense but I regret doing it, because this morning before school I took another one and I like how it made me feel at school. at the same time, it does kind of make me out of it. but in my brain, I'm already planning to take one or even two tomorrow again before school. 
it may be good to mention its finals week for me and I have a lot of stuff to do. I don't know if I wanna take it again because of that, and I don't want to feel that anxious stress? or if I'm just doing it because it calms me down in a weird way. 
I had a small incident like this with klonopin last year, a few times I'd take it before class. 
but I don't want this to become so bad that I subconsciously take Ativan every morning just to feel a way. that's not its intention.
I'm at a pretty good time in my life, too, so maybe it's just a passing thing.
I'd like some input, maybe if you guys have it some advice or similar experiences.
take care everyone :) ",11Dec2018,1

134,"Hello everyone! 

My name is Sammy D and I’m making this campaign asking for help in order to get my own service dog that my therapist and I both believe I desperately need. 

I have been diagnosed with the following: PTSD, Sever depression, Sever anxiety, Social anxiety, Panic attacks, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Bipolar. 

This is the reason as to why I’m in need of a loving, caring, supportive, dog that can aid me in my life. I struggle daily with basic tasks, grocery shopping, running errands, getting out of bed even. 
I also am in need of a service animal for when I’m having a panic attack to help calm me and bring me back into reality. As well as the times when I have a mental breakdown due to immense/sever stress, I need a fully trained service dog who knows what to do to help me be safe. 

I have been through a lot. And am struggling more and more as the months and years pass and more extreme and stressful situations arise. 

My whole life I have struggled with my mental health. Not understanding why I feel the way I do, not understanding why others don’t understand me and all the while having many many friends, boyfriends/guys I’ve dated and family leave my life due to “not being able to deal with me” or telling me “you need to sort yourself out before you expect anyone else in your life to stay”.

It’s hard. 
And I need support. Especially when I’m at my lowest. And if I can only get that from my therapist and a service dog, and a couple cherished people, I can accept that. 
My heath, my life is important. And I need help.

So I’m coming to YOU! 
Please if you can, please donate or share my story. 
I desperately need donations to save up the $5,000 I need to get a Canadian fully qualified service dog. I have looked into cost and breeds that best qualify and I have decided on a Pomeranian! I will of course be training this pup from 8 weeks onward. And all I need is the money to buy the pup and money for a trainer! 

It’s going to take some time to save up my own money, (since I’m only on ontario works social assistance and will be applying for ODSP) BUT with your extremely generous donations hopefully we can get this ball rolling faster! 

Thank you again for reading my story! I truly appreciate it! Thank you, Sammy",11Dec2018,1
135," So I am relatively new to Reddit and this story is something I have never shared with anyone, but these particular blocks in my head have  become extremely relevant at this point in my life so I just need to let  it out.  
As a child I was extremely sensitive kid, lots of memories  and events I vividly remember and sadly I can't get out of their  influence till this day. Now, back to the main topic. I developed  sympathy and love for women from a very early age, 5 as far as I can  remember. I wasn't seeing them as just people I like, there was a real  manly sympathy towards any woman that I saw and loved the look of,  obviously they all were way way older than me. There was a sexual desire  involved, even tho at the time I had no idea what it was. Now, in  regards to my upbringing as a younger child I was mostly left to myself  and my mom mainly concentrated on my older sister and my dad was often  away on long trips as a truck driver, so I was rarely educated in any form of social interaction. This desire, and this extremely powerful sexual drive, which as far as I know should not  appear in a 5 year olds mind. It was consuming me and I couldn't  think of anything else as if I was a 15 year old teenage boy. I was obsessed with attractive women, and did not know what to do with it. That is until one day I was just laying in bed and noticed a very pleasant  sensation while just humping my blanket, I know it sounds kinda gross  but at the time I had no idea what the hell I was doing. I just finally  knew how to relief myself from this emotional/sexual build up. I did  have orgasms, obviously they were dry and I didn't even know that  something was supposed to come out. Anyways, as it happened I was doing  it on a very regular basis desperately trying to imagine a naked woman,  having never seen one in real life. I had no idea what exactly was  involved in sexual process, all I knew is that I love the female body  and it gave me this consuming curiosity to see it and explore it. That went on for some time, a year at least. I was very discreet and it almost  became a routinely done thing. That is, till the day I was caught doing  it. By my sister, she then shouted to my mom and I was busted. Now, I  was never ever was screamed on and put under so much pressure in my  life. In my mind I felt that I was doing something so horrifically bad  that it was worth kicking me out of the house, they kept asking me why I  was doing it and where did I see it, to which I simply couldn't reply,  it was just my thing I came up with. I was being pushed against the wall, as if it was an interrogation. We are not a religious family or have any views regarding sexual development, so why this reaction followed till this day I have no idea, maybe they thought someone taught me this, who knows. I locked myself in the toilet crying and was feeling like the most disgusting human being ever, I was in shock. They eventually had to calm down so that I would at least get out and not run away or something. After this incident, obviously the desire was present as ever, and I was holding myself as long as I could until eventually my mind was fogged up again and I did it, but now every  time I did it, an extreme sense of guilt and self misery followed  straight afterwards, and they were haunting me for quite some time. Was busted again and the same screaming punishment followed. I was coming up with shocking conclusion, telling myself that because I'm doing this I won't  do well at school, that my health would go bad, all sort of things. Even tho, it's just masturbation. This topic was never again brought up by  mom, but I was frequently bullied by my sister because of that, of course it didn't help much. With time anything sexual, UNLESS it was  just in my own mind was becoming a source of anxiety and a feeling of being pathetic and worthless. As teenage years were approaching and guys were becoming interested in girls I felt that I am not allowed, not worth it.  Every time I desperately tried to show that I am not interested in them sexually or emotionally for that matter, that I am above it. But of course, deep down I was. I  thought that I was doing the right thing, the less I expressed my  interested in girls and sex the more confident I felt, the more protected, as if I had some sort of alibi. It was becoming  so ridiculous that everyone thought I was either gay or asexual, and my friends made fun of me for not discussing sex and porn with them. Funny  enough I was the complete opposite in my mind. I was following this principle for quite some time, and overall it did add a lot to my shyness which was already present to an unnecessary degree. When my friends were checking out or speaking to girls, out of principle I was not looking at them, just because I felt  safer that way, less vulnerable. I felt I would be a laughable joke to everyone. When I turned 17 I was already living on my own, and even tho I was not the most good looking guy at school, a few girls were regularly coming over to my place. I thought it  was happening mainly because they felt so safe around me and knew that I  wouldn't try to hit on them or anything like that, well, at least that  was my theory. Of course I wanted it all, but at this point in my life  even tho I knew it was OK to show it, that it was OK to express this  kind of interest, I somehow always felt less of a man if I even tried to do it. My first and last long term girlfriend was my first experience too, she had her own moments. The first time it nearly happened she cut  me out right before, afterwards through out our relationship I always  felt shame while doing it, because I could see that deep down she was not enjoying it. She told me that it was the same with all her previous  partners, many times she would just stop me right in the middle of a process saying that she doesn't want any more and offering me a finishing jerk off, and I always refused. I did not want a pity wank  just because I am a man and a man has to cum every time. Obviously I did it myself afterwards.  I tried and studied all the books and went to all the massage courses, nothing worked with her. She was my only partner at the time and it was really destroying my overall confidence even more. I could never say I want her because if  she wasn't in the mood she'd always turn me down quite aggressively. She too, wasn't  comfortable with her body, she never masturbated and never had an orgasm, even tho she had a lot of partners before me. Eventually we just  stopped doing it and once every two months was a norm. We were together  since I was 18 until 23. Nowadays, still having all this social anxiety and emotional residue I get these extreme periods where all I can think about is sex, and it really fucks up my productivity, I really wish I could just not even allow it in my mind. It comes in waves and I just cannot stop it. Like a state of mental fog. I don't have time or options to look for a ONS or anything like that. Deep down I really don't want to either. There came a period when jerking off wasn't enough for me anymore, I wanted to feel and touch the female body, not just having plain sex, I wanted  the sensation of a close physical contact, something sensual. So I'm not that poor and I decided to call  up an escort thinking this is exactly what I need, no commitment no boundaries \*to a degree of course\*. Until she actually showed up at my door. All the desire just went away and I went back to completely hiding it and just offer her some tea or something. Until she literally convinced me and proceeded to do what she was payed to do, but I was completely  disconnected in my mind from it all and I wanted it but at the same time felt completely out of place and was feeling awful afterwards. But every time I'm alone as if some sort of a devil it popes up in my mind again, to such a degree that I cannot concentrate on anything that I'm doing.  So at this point I became stuck in this limbo where I have an extremely high sexual temperament but I cannot suppress these thoughts mentally and feel a complete block in expressing it. It drags me down day by day and it comes in waves. Usually a week can go by and  I'd be happy and content without it or even thinking about it. But every  month for a week or two my mind gets completely absorbed. Just to clarify, I never had or even though about doing it against anyone's will. As sexually and mentally frustrated as I am if I hear ""NO"", or even if I hear  ""YES"" but I can clearly see she's not engaged I simply cannot do it. So  this is not harmful to anyone but me. Looking back at it all I wish my  parents could just explain to me what was I doing and why was I doing it  so I wouldn't live my teenage years shaming myself and suppressing this  side of myself. I feel a lot less of a man these days because of that, I simply cannot express this side of my personality to anyone, and it's  even more frustrating because it bares such an importance in my mind, physical and aesthetic too. Every time I am in position to have a chance to do so, I just get a panic attack and want to get out of there. These days I try to work with  myself and try and develop this as much as I can, but still it's like a switch, every time I get a flirty look, I do everything to show that I  am not interested. Against my own will, and hating myself afterwards for that. So there is my story, I hope every parent will always let their  kids know that it's OK to have a sexual side, and if not explaining or  supporting it, at least do not punish them for having one. Till this day  I have no idea why my mother screamed so aggressively at me for doing it. I  never discussed it with her afterwards. She probably doesn't even remember. Dad has no idea about it all.  I'm 23 and I hope I'll get my mind out of this mess eventually.",11Dec2018,1
136,"I slept all afternoon but I'm still tired and now it's 10:30 pm and I can't sleep. I'm too exhausted to do anything and I can't get comfortable doing nothing. I just want to let the time pass for a bit but none of my usual escapes work. YouTube bores me, music just slows the time, I can't concentrate enough to read and I can't do anything that involves getting out of bed because it's too exhausting. 

Doing nothing hurts, doing something hurts more. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this and it scares me. It's always going to be like this. There is nothing I can do about it besides damage control. I just wish I knew what's wrong with me, then maybe I could at least try to fix it.",11Dec2018,1
137,"i hang out with my friend group often and a lot of times i'll make jokes that nobody laughs at and i feel like they secretly don't like me because of it. i know obviously nobody should be forced to laugh at my jokes and i don't blame them because i don't regard myself as an overly funny person.

i know this is a stupid way of thinking and that people aren't gonna hate you because you sometimes say things that they don't find funny but i can't get over the feeling that they're annoyed by me even though i know they aren't. 

how do i overcome that feeling?",11Dec2018,1

140,"Is it ever ok for a therapist to rest his hand on your knee without asking or anything like that? is that normal?

he has accidentally touched my leg in other ways but this felt definitely deliberate. he was showing me something and when he did that he rested his hand (with the object in it) on my knee instead of handing it to me or holding it higher and he did it twice. so that is why I am asking about it, because he could have placed his hand anywhere else, like it was a touch on purpose meant to seem casual and accidental, which is why I didn't say anything, but when I left I realized that it may not have been accident

I asked this elsewhere but would like to hear more opinions before I decide to choose someone else.

yes I have a sexual abuse history starting in childhood that he knows about.

I get that I can leave and might do that but I don't want to blow things out of proportion. so I am curious if this ever happened to anyone else and if it was fine or if it turned out bad.

143,"Little background; (26F) diagnosed borderline stage 4 Non Hodgkins Lymphoma in Nov. 2016. In December I spent my birthday getting a bunch of traumatic procedures done. The 21st, 22nd, 23rd first three days of CHOEP Chemotherapy. Spent Christmas weekend alone and feeling the first horrible side effects of chemo. Did this for another 5 rounds. Then in 2017 in Sept. Had to have a bone marrow transplant. Now 2018 in remission. Have a huge Polish family that all live within 40 min. Boyfriend of 4 years. 

So going through cancer has literally felt like experiencing the Matrix. Please bear with me for a minute it's been the best way to explain my trauma and feelings. So my whole life hasn't been easy and have been through trauma before but I got through it and was trying really hard to be positive, do the right thing, and try to get college finished. Everyday stuff. But once the tumors started growing and affecting my mood, personality, appetite, etc.. My anxiety and depression came back and all year something in the back of my mind was telling me I was going to die. It's like death was always over my shoulder but I just ignored it. So when I got my diagnosis it didn't really shock me. Some family members came with to chemo and acted so fake and tried to manipulate the way I felt through process even though they were nurses and new how bad the process was. Tried to make me feel bad and guilty for the years of abuse they caused me. Friends completely left and I would get the fake comment on fb from people I've never talked to saying good luck. So my body was giving up on me, friends and family too. When my hair fell out and I needed a walker, strangers would stare, make ugly comments, and made me feel bad for being disabled. I felt completely destroyed by the world. My doctors weren't listening to my feelings or mental health issues I was experiencing. The only thing that was holding me on was my boyfriend who tried with everything he has to try to make it as easy as possible. But for 1 person it's too much. Cancer felt like taking that pill in the Matrix and seeing that everything and mostly everybody who isn't kind hearted is fake. It's all just a show, at the end of the day people just care about themselves and their reputations. And I'm not naive I know the world is cruel, but never this cruel. But the thing now is, I'm living in this ""matrix"" knowing it's just made up, so how do you live with yourself. I have now medically induced ptsd, prolonged qt, feel like I'm 70 years old, can't leave my apartment. Bipolar episodes on the weekly. And every time I try to do something for the better, I think: why bother? People didn't care that you were dying from cancer and treating you like trash for something that's already hard to go through. So what's the point? Sometimes I wish I would've just let cancer kill me so I could disconnect myself from the matrix. But now suicide is stupid because I didn't go through so much pain and hard work to just give in like that. I feel dumb. I just want to put this past me and help others but I can't even help myself. Ugh anybody else feel like This?  ",11Dec2018,1
144,"  I always feel like my friends hate me and that I'm not at all important to them. I can't talk to them about my problems as they don't listen to me, and I feel as if the only one that will is only willing because they want to get in on any drama they can.
 
 I can't talk to my parents because they either forget or give up on my problems (they stopped at herbal tea, which didn't work, for my insomnia; they just forgot about my self-harm; and after telling my mum I am bisexual she said ""okay"" and a few months later told me what a bisexual person is and persistently asked me if I'm gay).

  I'm 14, female and just looking for someone to  be a reliable friend, not a therapist, just someone who's willing to listen to me and occasionally console me. Thank you.",11Dec2018,1

146,"Hey Reddit, I'm just looking for some advice or something, I'm not doing too good.
So about 7 weeks ago I told my parents about my anxiety and panic attacks (I'm 15m btw) and now I've got a therapist. Few weeks after that I told them about my depression. So pretty unexpectedly I started not being able to sleep until 2AM, after going to bed at 10:30PM, which I coped with ok until about 3 weeks ago when I started cutting myself (not suicidal) and it relieved a lot of the stress and sadness, but still I'm not having better sleeping patterns.
I know it definitely has something to do with my mental health since I was VERY anxious at that point but I just don't see why I can't get to sleep... Here are some of the things I tried:
Headspace app - meditation
Cutting myself
Totally exhausting myself with exercise
Reading
Etc

So yeah, I'm seeing a doctor about getting medication next week so maybe the medication will help, but I've just been so tired for so long, thanks for reading.",11Dec2018,1

150,"I’m pretty sure that I’m schizoaffective.

When I was younger, I would have random delusions of people being able to watch me from afar and monitor my thoughts, or of everything I do being completely controlled and having to break out of that control through random acts. Even now I often am convinced people are following me when driving (subsequently causing me to pull over and rejoin the road, but if I’m with someone, I ignore it) or watching me when I’m not looking. So I know I have delusions .

I also have random changes in personality from periods where I’m extremely dissociative, lazy, and messy to overtly organized, productive, and optimistic, and these changes happen quickly enough and to such a degree that it’s clearly beyond normal. 

Thirdly, and to a lesser extent, I have periods where I feel as if I’m incredibly dizzy and reality appears distorted, however this is still at a level where I can effectively ignore it.

I’ve managed to lead my life in such a way that a) no-one suspects me of having a mental disorder, and b) I can get on with my life and have found consistent success in it. 

I’m not exactly asking for a diagnosis (it doesn’t really matter for the sake of this post), but if, given the fact that my condition hasn’t worsened in the decade or so since I’ve had it, there’s a sizable chance of it becoming worse to the extent that I would have to seek help. ",11Dec2018,1

So go on with your life and I'll deal with my shit. God, I'm so mad at myself! 

Do you ever feel like taking a knife and stabbing youself in the leg or something? I fucking deserve that! Should just hit myself repeatedly out of my laziness. Well fuck me, fuck this. I need someone to kick my ass and yell at me to do something, like a drill instructor.

i ask because i'm not sure if i'm mainly just psyching myself out, since i started university a few months back and i would assume that a lot of this is just stress from that? i really don't want to try to make myself think that i'm ill and try and self-diagnose but i'm still not sure",11Dec2018,1
