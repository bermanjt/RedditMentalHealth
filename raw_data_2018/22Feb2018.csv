1,"I'll try to keep this short.
 
I can't ever talk about how I feel without getting choked up and crying. I feel embarrassed and ashamed about this which is why I have not been able to seek professional help. I suppress a lot of my negative feelings to the point where they are so built up, the slightest thing can set me off into a crying/hyperventilating fit where I feel completely useless and would almost rather be dead.

What is wrong with me?",22Feb2018,1,

First off, I want to apologize to the older folks on here. I myself am only a young adult (20) so I dont feel as if I have enough life experience to make any statements regarding the struggles some of you guys face, but maybe this experience will move you as it has moved me.

So, a little bit of history. Ive attempted on my life twice. My first time I took over 200 aspirin that were 500 mg each, on top of about 20-25 sleeping pills. This was premeditated. It didnt work out, I was hospitalized.

My second was not premeditated, it was a mostly thoughtless act made during a severe panic attack. I took an entire bottle of aspirin, but my siblings found the bottle was missing and feared the worst. I was hospitalized as well, obviously.

I was hospitalized two more times because I decided to be open about the severity of my suicidal thoughts and sought out help when I was at my wits end. I couldnt bear to put my family through another attempt, and personally I would have felt like a fucking joke if I had failed in my attempt yet again.

The last time i was hospitalized was at age 17, the first being 13. I was severely bullied at school. It was the kind of bullying youd assume only existed in movies.

People constantly smacking my belongings out of my hands, literally a bubble around me in the halls where people wouldnt stand within 4 feet of me because a girl had started a rumor that I had herpes, consistently having people make fun of me in every class. When I got home, my mom would blame everything on me. She would yell at me everytime she saw me, etc. I dont want to go into detail because it was really bad and I could probably write an essay on it. But one solid example of our relationship was the time I hadnt done her laundry in time when she got home. She threw a gallon of milk at me, it missed and broke all over the carpet. I ran to get towels, she told me towels wouldnt work and made me scrub the carpet with a fuzzy blanket. All the while telling me everyone hates me, im fat, disgusting, and ended it on ""whats the matter piggy, wont talk? Speak piggy speak! Speak piggy speak!"" And kept chanting it until I was done cleaning. Again, this is just an example of our relationship.

I eventually began skipping my classes. I could skip two before I was officially marked absent, and they called home. So I would spend my gym (where the bullying was worse) in the bathroom sitting in the stall doing nothing, same with another class where the period lasted an hour. I honestly dont remember a whole lot of my middle school and highschool. When I got home I would take 4 sleeping pills so I could sleep all day until I went to school again.

Things got a lot better when my mom eloped with some guy and ran away, signed guardianship to my ex-step father. God bless his soul, he had raised me since i was a baby I love him with all my heart. But even though things were better, I have severe bipolar disorder. Mental illness is very rampant in both sides of my family including bipolar, schizo, bpd, and psychosis.

The experience I want to relate to you all is here. I was feeling worthless, even though I was in a better situation. I had (and still do) very invasive thoughts of being killed. Having a pick axe slammed through my torso, smashing ny own head into walls until it was a nub, being pushed into a meatgrinder. Very, very invasive and vivid imaginations of all these acts.

Well my dad didnt know about any of this, and he has to work out of state during the summer. He left the gun unlocked in case of emergencies while i was home alone. We've had people try to break in before so this was reasonable since he had no idea i was still suffering.

Well, I was planning to kill myself again, only this time I wouldnt mess up. The problem was that I was still scared. So I tried to ""practice"" with an unloaded gun until i was ready to load it and do it for real. I put the unloaded gun in my mouth and tried to pull the trigger. I couldnt. I was still too nervous. I tried and tried for a solid 5 minutes, I just couldnt bring myself to do it. It just seemed so hard to pull the trigger. If i could do it for fakes then i could do it for real and that thought overwhelmed me. So I figured, hey, maybe Ill just acquaint myself with pulling the trigger first, not at myself, so I can proceed to practice. I just kind of pointed it at the wall and floor and a shot rang out. There was a bullet in the chamber the whole fucking time. I just stiid there, kind of stunned. My immediate thought was almost casual. ""Jeez, I just wanted to practice. I wasnt going to do it.""

And it just hit me. I was THIS close to dying. I was THIS close to my dad coming home, finding a bloody rotten mess of his dead daughter in his closet. In the space smaller than the word THIS on your phone, computer screen, I was THIS close to destroying his world, to destroying mine, to destroying the 3 most LOYAL, KIND friends I was lucky enough to meet, even though I hadnt always maintained contact with them.

I was THIS close to destroying all of that. That hurt me, that scared me, and for the first time in who knows how long, I told myself I loved myself. I comforted myself. I held myself up in my blankets, cried, watched a funny movie. After that was the last time I admitted myself into a hospital.

Obviously, you cant scare mental illness away. Im still bipolar, I still have those horrible, invasive thoughts. I havent doubted my resolution to refuse doing such a thing. But life has reinforced my resolution to avoid doing such a thing.

My best friend opened up about another one of his friends committing suicide awhile after that. We went to her old house. He sat there in the car, just crying and talking to her. Telling her how much he missed her. And he could hear her talking back. One of the few blessings his schizophrenia gave him. I knew then that death and life were truly sacred. Both of them can have an amazing and horrible impact.

So what Ive done to cope with depression and thoughts of life being hopeless. Well, growing up a little since then, life has shown me it can get worse. It can hurt you in ways you dont foresee. It can turn upside down. You can be homeless. But life has also shown me how valuable it is. Its shown me a look into the deepest feelings another person has. It has shown me the ugly side to everything sweet and the beautiful side to everything ugly. There are more than two sides to everything, and life is so beautifully and disgustingly complex that I do not want to miss out on it.

I still cry almost every day. Thats basically just a trait of mine. I can live like this. The psychotic effects of my disorder are gradually getting worse. I hear people talking now. I hear music that doesnt exist coming from the walls. I heard someone banging on my windows and doors for an entire car ride. I hear people whispering my name. Scratching my bed sheets when im not in them. Its scary. Im not even sure its just bipolar at this point, but I know its possible for people with bipolar to experience symptoms of psychosis. But I know that no disorder, depression, thoughts of worthlessness can unteach me what life has. I can seek out psychiatric care. There are programs that help people like me and people who are suffering worse.

And so even though Im still just making it day-by-day, the plus side is that I experience each day so intensely, life seems a little longer. Im grateful for that.

I just wanted to share. I hope you all are doing okay. And my heart aches for you all when I read what you guys are going through. You are all your own people, your own lives, and I love you guys from the bottom of my soul. It might not get better, but you can.",22Feb2018,7,
4,"A dear, dear friend of mine from College has been battling with years of mental health issues stemming from deep abandonment, abuse and neglect in her life. She's struggled with depression and self medicated for years trying to overcome the trauma of her loss, abandonment and mental abuse. She's suffering severe depression and PTSD symptoms. She's an incredible person pursuing her PhD (almost there!) in holistic medicine and I'm so proud of her for creating a GoFundMe to finally publicly admit her pain and need for help.

I REALLY want to help her reach her goal, seek treatment and move forward with her life. She's committed. But I know spamming message boards isn't going to help. What would Reddit and this thread recommend in particular for getting her message out there in the right way to rally people around her? And specifically, donate to help a stranger?",22Feb2018,1,
5,"For the last couple of weeks, I've been really depressed, which could be expected with my bipolar disorder.

Recently I've felt very stigmatized and disillusioned with the world.  I feel like the fabric of society as I knew it is being lost to right-wing extremism.  It might sound extreme, but I think our society is very close to the early 30's rise of the Nazi party.  We're building border fences while our roads, schools, and hospitals crumble.  We're deporting and rejecting people based on race and religion.  We do nothing about the militarization and surveillance of everyday life.  Every day is a new scandal for the president, who seems untouchable.

They discuss cutting programs that directly impact my life.  Medicaid should be cut and have work requirements (although I think my disability will exempt me).  Disability should be cut. X and Y and Z public benefits should be cut or controlled in a draconian way.

Add to it the recent gun control debates which are getting very little traction politically, despite public outcries for change.  I attempted suicide with a firearm, and it drastically changed my views on guns.  It's horrible to look at such massacres on a nearly-daily basis.  We've had 18 school shootings, many more mass shootings, and we're not even done with February yet.  Between churches, offices, and schools, it's starting to feel like nowhere is safe, and the government's response thus far has been to ""buy more guns.""

I also feel like the economy is collapsing for everyone that isn't rich.  People work and make no money after paying simple living expenses, and they're told to get second jobs like Uber.  Medical care is cause for bankruptcy, and they're told to get better jobs to get better healthcare.  Living expenses are sky high, especially in Nashville, where I used to live, and older people wonder why millennials live with their parents.   

I've been learning German because I feel like the only way out of this madness is to move to Germany.  There, social programs are expanding, healthcare is universal, they have UBI, and life seems much easier and simpler for the common person.  (Please correct me if that is not true.)

All of this has been weighing heavily on me, and I just needed to get it out of my head.",22Feb2018,1,

7,"Hi guys. I don't know if this the right place to vent. I think I have some issues or if something is/isn't wrong with me. I was up until just recently trying to better myself by journaling, exercising consistently, and improving my social skills. I'm 18 but I've moved around a lot so I don't have a solid group of friends, only a few I've made at college. I am not ugly but I have horrible allergies so my eye skin makes me look older and at 5' 8"" I'm at 145 lbs so I have weight to lose. I'm also Ethiopian  with curly hair so it's a real struggle trying to maintain my huge, and I mean HUGE amount of curly hair, compared to silky straight hair, which in the end is not even considered as good as straight soft  hair.

I recently made a fake tinder account only to see how tinder works features wise, but then I made a fake account using pics of an Instagrammer who isn't super famous. I've started and been messaging many guys for 4 days who are eager to meet up for a few days. I forget they think I'm a different person and I imagine they are complimenting me. I started to feel like a major creep so I deleted it and now I'm thinking what the hell is wrong with me. I feel like I work so hard to improve myself but i feel like I'm hardly making progress. I study so hard just to get good grades, I'm constantly trying to be approachable and improve my communication skills and make friends, etc. I'm scared to post on my Facebook because  I'm afraid no one will give me likes. I tell myself for weeks that I am strong and shouldn't seek validation in others and to keep on improving, and then one day I'll look at how few friends I have and how ugly I am and I just start crying again, which makes me feel like I've never been strong at all.

9,"This post is basically a combination of a reach out for shared experiences and solidarity and some notes on things that have worked for me, many of which will seem like basic bitch stuff to some but nevertheless worth sharing in case those who can relate more specifically to my experience are looking for suggestions.


I was diagnosed by some random GPs in my teens with this stuff (GAD, MDD, OCD), and have had varying feelings about how helpful diagnosis is, although I am seeing a psychologist again. Anyway, I'm 29 now, and still feel like it's a daily battle. Describing the experience more specifically seems like a good thing though, to connect with others, share practices, and so on. 

Problem

I have extremely intense waves of anxiety/depression that interfere with my life, because the distress effects:

- How I react and behave in social situations

- The decisions that I make regarding participation in future events and taking opportunities


Observations


- They are short lived (they could last a few minutes to a few hours), usually subsiding into a calmer mood.

- They are worsened by stress (for example, in the last few months - relationship breakdown, last year of PhD, housing insecurity). Yet these waves will often not be connected to these factors at all; instead they latch onto anything (see below). 


Anxiety

- The feelings I would consider to be anxiety are those that are attached to periods/states of worry, obsessive thinking, racing thoughts, paranoia. They are not generally accompanied by the intense physiological aspects of panic attacks (I've had these before), but rather feel very much in the head. I may have an accelerated pulse, hot flushes etc, but not necessarily. I will be very unobservant of my surroundings in these states, unable to have a conversation, and basically be lost in this state until something draws me out.


Nature of thoughts

- I did something that will make X person reject me or cause me trouble and harm. What I did was not justified. Almost always, I will learn that what I did was totally fine and there was no need for concern at all. However, by this time I have obsessed and ruminated for days.

- Mistakes from the past, including childhood, that I see as morally wrong or, again, could cause disastrous consequences for me. These are difficult because there is nothing to be done or resolved. I oscillate between punishing myself for these events internally, and imagining horrible scenarios where everyone finds out and I pay severe, disproportionate consequences. 


Things that help

- Exercise (told you, basic)

- Mantras - 'everyone makes mistakes, you can only control what you do now'

- Delaying worrying. I will tell myself that this horrible outcome that I'm worrying about is unlikely to cause me hard today, therefore it makes more sense to just get on with what I have to do and can worry tonight (which doesn't always happen). 

- Really anything that gets me out of my head or on another line of thinking, including physical activities, games, conversation, watching a movie/TV show. Unfortunately, it is hard to get myself to do these things though, or see them as options, when I'm in this state. 


Depression

- The feelings more characteristic of depression may come out of nowhere, and are like I have been sucked dry of all hope and meaning. It's all just heavy and black. 

Things that help

- Exercise. 100% of the time after going for the run, I feel some improvement. 

- Eating properly and regularly. I've noticed sometimes that I will be in one of these states, and then I will eat something and feel 40% better (not always but sometimes). This is sometimes quite alarming as it feels so temperamental. Similarly, if it is a hot day and I am walking home from the shops, getting back into a cool environment might also improve the mood by this much almost instantly. 

- Waiting it out. 


Starting Therapy

I sought out a psychologist that draws on DBT principles, as I have been thinking lately that the instability here seems somewhat like an emotional regulation problem. It's very early days but so far she seems to think that I was emotionally invalidated during childhood and there's some ongoing effects there. I have been encouraged not to make decisions or react when I'm in that 'emotional brain', which makes sense, although hopefully we will work towards managing things so that I don't get too deep into that space so regularly in the first place. 

Medication

I have been taking Zoloft on and off since my teens. I have tried to go off it before and had the terrible withdrawal symptoms, so went on a low dose (50mg). I'm also on Depakote/Epilim for epilepsy which is supposed to help with moods, although lately I suspect that it may have actually made things worse. I have always had issues with depression and anxiety, but the frequent mood swings and intense distress have seemingly increased during the years I have been on the epilepsy medication, which is interesting as it is often prescribed as a mood stabiliser!
 

If anyone can relate in their own experiences, or has methods for managing and improving health that they can share, I'd love to hear it. 

I will also say that I am vegan, and I have been vegetarian most of my life. Lately, I have been so keen on resolving these problems that I have considered moving onto a different diet. Open to such suggestions, although please be respectful of people's choices (no vego bashing!).",22Feb2018,3,
10,"Hi everyone,

I'm trying to figure out what is going on with me mentally.

Ever since I can remember I have been overly anxious and shy. I don't have a lot of self confidence.

I have a tendency to overthink things, for instance, I could literally spend a week obsessing and researching something as simple as what $30 immersion blender to buy (yes this actually happened)

I have severe issues with every life decision I've made. When I got married I had a breakdown thinking ""this is a huge mistake, it's going to be a disaster, I can't back out now"", cried my whole wedding night and totally ruined it. 3 years in it's been great. Then when I bought a house, ""huge mistake, we are going to go bankrupt, that payment is too big, now we are stuck in this town, stuck in this job paying for it, no more flexibility"" again 2 years in and it's been great. None of those fears came true, the opposite actually.

Now for the most troubling thing of all, we are expecting our first child and I have zero excitement, just dread, thinking yet again ""this is going to be a total disaster, I'll hate being a parent, the perfect relationship I had with my husband is going to fall apart and so will my life, this is going to be terrible, now I'm stuck with this decision"". So much so that it's launched me into a near mental breakdown and I spent 2 weeks coming home after work and crying till I fell asleep. I'm so anxious I don't even want to tell people I'm pregnant because i am ashamed of it and how I feel. I literally spend HOURS a day going through my social media groups clicking on random profiles to see ""ok they have kids"" in a mentally ill way to justify my situation and get myself to feel better. I meet neighbors and acquaintances around town and my first quest is to find out if they have kids to almost check to see if I'm ""ok"" in my choice to have a baby. I'm always online researching what happens to happiness levels after kids and what happens to kids that have moms who are anxious. If I see that over 80% of people end up having kids it makes me temporarily feel better. I am embarrassed to admit this and it is so incredibly mentally ill, but it's become almost a relief to do.

I'm so tired of sapping the joy out of every day of my life and not living fully in the moments that should be exciting. Instead I ruin it with research and obsessing and anxiety.

What is going on with me? I don't want to live this way anymore.",22Feb2018,2,
11,"Greetings, all!

I am going to seek help in several days (for what I believe is a form of OCD).  For the past year, I have struggled everyday with thoughts over my fiancé’s past.  I cannot get thoughts of his past relationships out of my mind, no matter what I do.  I wanted to be his first relationship.  It kills me to think there was someone before I.  My mind obsesses over these very thoughts 24/7.   I cannot escape.  I ask my fiancé for reassurance quite often. There has to be a better life than this.

I am also very paranoid.  I have been this way for as long as I can possibly remember.  I am paranoid my fiancé will be talking to other females behind my back.  I am paranoid in public places.  When people look at me, I fear there is a motive as to why they are doing so.  I am paranoid people are out to get me.  These thoughts are causing me extreme amounts of distress.  I simply cannot escape from all of this.

I am in a constant battle with my own mind.  I cannot escape from these thoughts, which is why I am seeking help.

Obviously I will need a professional diagnosis, but does this sound like a form of OCD I am experiencing?  I don’t know if paranoid thoughts are also associated with OCD?",22Feb2018,1,

13,"Alright so this personality disorder seems to be incredibly relatable to me for some reason, but I don't want to go to therapy due to my parents suspecting I have issues. I'm a 17 year old guy...and I guess my emotions are described as being extremely up and down. Please don't judge me or think I'm being a troll...this is how I feel sincerely and I hope someone takes the time to tell me what they think honestly about it. I am just so tired of never finding help. Right now as I'm typing this my mood went from a fairly light mood to extreme frustration.

Anyways ever since I was a kid...I always felt odd, left out...but I had incredible obsessions with things, from people to things. I remember a time where I was In elementary, and I obsessed over this guy who I wanted to be MY friend only, and he would usually feel incredibly smothered, so he ended up moving away from me. I was bullied in my whole elementary school due to a lack of expressing anger and my personal interests. It's left me incredibly scarred, and I KNEW that I didn't want to be alone...but I was. Teachers would always single me out, at one point I had a crush who I wrote threats to (didn't mean it in a bad way, more like comical) and the police was called after the principal and the teacher read what I said about guns. I didn't get in trouble, since they knew I didn't have any bad intentions, but from what I can tell you, it dug a deeper hole. I used to obsess over characters like the joker in elementary and aspired to be like him, confident, funny, and just plain cruel.

Going to middle school, nothing much has happened, but I found another girl I was obsessive with and used to fantasize about having her ONLY to myself...again she never saw this because I was always cool-headed on the outside...it was almost like lust really. I developed a huge obsession with BDSM, rape, and dead girls as a whole...I still don't know why.

Highschool was incredibly turbulous for me. My emotions went from extreme anger, inward and outward, happiness, sadness, depression. My freshman year I got bullied again and my depression kicked in. I hated not only everyone but I hated myself for being so weak. That year I strived to purge everything about me that was considered weak. During my freshman year, I met this girl who was extremely cute, and it led to me having a 2 year relatio ship with her.

My relationship with her was...toxic. I wanted her to not talk to a single guy, I kept her very close to me during the relationship. I was incredibly sexual, more than she ever was...and she liked that about me. What she didn't like was how I treated her most of the time. She cried at one point explaining that she felt worthless and that I am too controlling. I would try to change...but I can't, CONTROL is what makes me happy and secure...this ended up into a break up where she backstabbed me. She cheated on me with her ex boyfriend, I afterwards cheated on her with my ex girlfriend before her...I wanted her to suffer for fucking hurting me.My ex crying and finding out what I did to her was so satisfying. I always screamed and shouted at her, called her worthless, stupid...because I wanted her to be driven to suicide. I even wished upon her death many times...this lasted for a full year and a half after my break up. She said before it that I was purely insane and that I should seek help, but it wasn't my fault she fucking hurt me...cheated on me...BACKSTABBED me.

So in a nutshell...we go to what's with me now, where all I can feel is extreme moodiness, from extreme depression in one day after over thinking what someone said to me, to extreme happiness, to extreme anger where I hold in tension and anger, to the point where I whether lash out at someone, or I fucking scream alone and punch shit. Laughing was another mechanism to controlling my anger...but it felt too intense for me. Theres people who would say hi to me that i can tell is sarcastic and I end up telling them to fuck off.

Basically I HATE weaknesses in myself, that's why I try to present myself as strong. Not only that, but once someone betrays me or disrespects me, I just consider them less than a human. I wish them for their death, I wish for their families lives to fucking die just to see him/her suffer. This happens with everyone I encounter...I just end up thinking everyone is against me. I can go from overconfident to feeling like I should die, like As if I didn't deserve love. I think about why the hell should I wake up if we will all eventually die. I only wish I didn't have intense feelings all the time. It feels so uncomfortable...whenever I try to vent to my friends, they always tell me I have anger problems, or that I'm just some psycho. I just want to be normal. Or better yet, I want to be successful one day and be accomplished and ambitious",22Feb2018,1,

18,"Hello- this is my first time posting on reddit, ever. I just stumbled along this subreddit and was hoping I could just get some advice, or perhaps just vent. 

I'm 18 years old, I've had cycles of depression since I was 13. At the start, it was bullying but we moved and it's become so so much better- my school life is good now. However, when I was 14 I found texts between my dad and a prostitute. As I would later discover, he's been a sex addict for 20 years. My world was literally ripped apart, I was exposed to this disgusting side of a person and a world at an age where I don't think I completely understood what sex was. I told my mom- who had already known for years- and we begged him to stop, get sober and seek help. I found new texts 2 weeks later. 

The past 4 years have been hell. It's been cycles of forgiving him, getting close to him, trusting him only for him to break my heart again. He refuses to get long-term help, lies constantly to our faces and breaks my trust over and over again. It feels like a never ending emotionally abusive cycle that I can never break. 

 A month ago, my sister found texts for the first time. **She's 14.** My mom has been diagnosed with a form of PTSD coupled with depression. She has no self worth anymore. Last month when my sister found those texts, there was a lot of crying and yelling and he promised, swore he'd get help, begged for a final, last chance. He started attending Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings and following the 12 step program. 

I found texts from another prostitute from last night. The amount of times I have to read explicit details about what my father wants from a woman- I have no clue how messed up I am or how my future relationships will be because of this. It hurts so much to think of that. There was another period of yelling and crying last night. He's staying at a hotel for now. This is starting to effect my studies, my life. I have no will to do anything anymore.

28,"I mean, I'm at a fairly good spot in life. I'm only 16 years old but my education is going well. I'm fairly ""busy"" for being a teenager in terms of how much free time I have at home. On a normal school week, I'll get home at around 7:30-8 PM on monday and tuesday. On wednesday I usually get home for a few hours after lunch, but then I go away again and come back at around 7:30-8 PM. On thursday, I get home at around 9 PM. I go away for about 1-2 hours on fridays and sundays, otherwise the weekends are completely off. I only have a 3 hour lesson in school on fridays which doesn't even begin until after lunch.




I also get up at around 4:30 every day including weekends however this isn't anything negative. I always sleep 6-8 hours a night anyways as I usually go to bed pretty soon after coming home. The reason I'm home so late most days is because of school, boxing training and weightlifting. I enjoy all these three things, but very time consuming. 1,5 hours of boxing three times a week, school is usually 7-8~ hours mon-thu, including breaks. Lifting usually only takes 1~ hour, three times a week. However, couple all this with the fact that I live on an island in Sweden. It's not far from the mainland and there is a bridge but it's still about 1 hours of sitting on a bus every day when I want to do, well, *anything*. All this adds up.


I don't necessarily feel pressured and I'm fine with not being home that much during the day. 



Honestly I'm just fine... except sometimes I feel really off mentally. I mean, the workouts I do (lifting and cardio from boxing) is taxing on my body but it's great fun and I feel very good after doing them. I know what I'm doing, I do lots of research and I've logged a food diary for almost half a year now without a single day off. I see results I like. I do brain workouts sometimes. I keep my nutrition in check, mostly. I set up goals for myself with rewards that I treat myself to when I reach those goals (goals could be get X amount of A grades on tests, reach 100 kg on deadlift and squat, etc).



So yeah that's my life right now, sounds great right and yeah I feel good. 



The problem is when I'm *not* doing something. Like right now. I'm on a 1 week break from school. I had like, what, 3 things to study on. Two of which are already done. The third will take me no less than 1-2 hours until I'm done and I still have this entire week left. And so now I feel so fucking unproductive it makes me sick and anxious mentally. It's like I just got this itch, my brain says I need to work on something but I really, really don't want to and I don't even need to. At all. I mean, I'll walk down the stairs from my room and into the hall. My eyes will dart to the fireplace, to the kitchen, to the It's nice having a week off doing fuck all just sitting here being lazy and playing games, I've been productive. I woke up early. I took a morning bike ride. I've washed clothes. I've washed the dishes. I've cleaned the fireplace. I've studied. So now I'm sitting here. And I just don't know what to do. Makes me sick. I'll watch some fun videos on YouTube, play a fun game. I get into it, I have fun but 20 minutes into that video or that game I just get bored and quit. And I'm back to square one, I just sit here, nothing to do, and as soon as I start doing something new I end up feeling like shit. 




TL:DR; I've studied. I've done stuff. I've been productive. Yet I sit here and feel unproductive, feel like shit. I don't know why. I'm happy otherwise, I'm full of energy most of the time. Life is good??",22Feb2018,6,

We both use several psychiatric medications and are currently going through a change of meds/lack of meds thing, so we're pretty unstable and feeling shitty all day. We are heavy smokers, and decided to stop. I know right now isn't the best time to do it, but we have no money to buy a pack of cigarettes a day anymore. So we're withdrawing.

So about last year I took a bunch of antidepressants cause I was bored and had nothing else to do and had to go to the hospital because of an overdose. Then later next month I took 3 tabs of lsd and I think it did something to my brain like my brain had enough. I feel like I’m still not the same for that trip also from when I od on antidepressants I didn’t feel the same either. My impulsive side is more powerful now like it is hard for me to hold them back like when I used to life with my family we had a dog and i would abuse it and do it just cause and feel nothing when I would do it. I have feelings but I can dull them when I do bad things. I used to go to a private school in my childhood but I had to leave when I threw a rock at a kid. My friends see me as normal but I’m acting when I’m around them normally my friends think I have a lazy attitude and that everything is boring for me.

34,"I'm a highly sensitive, emotionally intense man, who only wants to do good in the world, and just can't seem to integrate and be at peace with the way I've been mistreated.

I've done some reading about authoritarian personalities and how human beings deal with interpersonal power and hierarchy in general. The basic gist I get is that when a person is chronically forced to say ""yes sir"" when they really want to say ""fuck you"", they bury their resentment and it turns into a craving to dominate others in turn, to ""pass along the pain"" they've been unfairly dealt, by unfairly making others weaker or lower on the hierarchy hurt unfairly.

I am strongly, on principle, against either being dominated, or dominating others, and I don't see this changing. I've managed this by keeping as complete control as I can muster over whom I interact with. I'm very self-reliant, and would rather do something all by myself than ask for help from someone who's going to make the interaction into a power play.

That all changed when I went to graduate school, where I was treated very nastily by some of my teachers and trainers, whom I can only imagine were treated the same way when they were trained, and have become very practiced at saying ""yes sir"" when they mean ""fuck you"". The more I resisted being mistreated, the worse it became. I find myself now having obsessive, intrusive thoughts about the way I was treated, which can leave me seething with anger and resentment for hours to days. I just have no way to integrate such an experience. I refuse to find me some underlings or scapegoats to kick around, and the rational part of my brain tells me that going back to where I trained and confronting those people angrily will not turn out well for me. What other options do I have? How to mentally healthy, well adjusted people integrate experiences of being mistreated, without becoming mistreaters themselves?",22Feb2018,8,

38,"I'm a guy, first off. I've always been seen as stoic, and fairly calm, but, it's mostly because I feel like I'm losing my mind internally. I worry about self-diagnosis, because I so desperately desire a label, if for no other reason than to show myself that I'm not completely pathetic.

Some of the things I'm going through:
Severe depression, which comes and goes in cycles. It's been like this for years. Since I was a teen. I thought it was normal for a long time, and that I was just ""feeling down"". But, I don't think most people go outside, lie on the floor, or curl up in bed crying uncontrollably. They've become more common in the last year or two, going from a year apart, or so, to days apart, or even hours.

When I don't feel depressed, I feel. . . odd. Empty, almost. Devoid of emotion. Sometimes it feels like I'm watching my life in the third person, like none of it is real. I've gone places, and felt like it was all a dream, and that I wasn't really there, but I was asleep, and could wake up at any moment. Even my own voice seemed foreign and strange. These have been occurring with more frequency.

I tend to be either cold or hot, with people. I've had very good friends, who I've suddenly become furious with, over the smallest things. Especially when they won't hang out with me, or do something that I'm involved in. As a kid, I always tried to grab people's attention.

I've been cutting myself. Usually it's a few months apart, each time. The longer I go, the more I seem to fixate on it, as it provides a sudden, and overwhelming sense of relief. The last time, I was sobbing, and took a razor blade, and, as soon as it cut deeply, I began to laugh, loudly, and felt free, for whatever reason.

I've looked into, and even planned suicide in the past year. It doesn't seem as easy as I had always considered it to be. I can never seem to find just the right way to do it. I'm very conscious of how my family would react when they found me, and I want it to be. . . as easy on them as possible. 

I'm in my early twenties. Very concerned. Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I don't normally talk about these things. In fact, I can't seem to summon the willpower to talk to anyone about anything, unless forced. I start shaking when I think about it, or fidgeting. Sometimes I think that hurting someone else might ease the pain more effectively than hurting myself. I haven't acted on it, and don't think I ever will, but the thought has crossed my mind more than once. 

I've never believed psychology was very effective. But I don't know what else to do. 

EDIT:
I guess I should talk about a few other things. These I also always saw as normal actions, but now I'm beginning to wonder.

I get. . . very anxious sometimes. This post has already made me hyperventilate, and need to take very deep breaths to calm myself. I usually try not to think about depression. It seems like a gaping abyss of emptiness, and if I think about it, I worry that I might summon that specter again. I've tried alcohol, which only seems to delay it. 

What seems most effective is spending large amounts of money on things that I never use. I have the newest, most powerful desktops, and laptops. Multiple ones. I have very expensive headphones, from companies like Audeze, and Hifiman. I've had two dozen smartphones in the past twelve months. It's getting to the point where financially, I'm also starting to worry. I don't get much enjoyment from these things, but, they seem to at least distract me for a little while. Lately though, as with most other things, the distraction doesn't last. I'm beginning to consider controlled substances, which I'd always scoffed at the idea of but, if nothing else, if should be clear that at this point, I'm desperate. 

Any suggestions at all are appreciated.",22Feb2018,4,

It's not like I wanna die, I just wanna sort of stop existing. Disappear forever. The constant pressure of academics and maintaining a social facade has gotten way too bad to go on. I even went to therapy for three sessions but I hated it there and when she told my parents that I might be a threat to myself and hence opened up and told them everything I confided in her, I just decided that I'm done with that whole thing. It's not like my parents even wanted me to go there considering I had to ask for it myself and through the whole thing, my father was basically calling me a coward.

I thought some of you might find this interesting. Here's kind of a quick summary of how the different medications rate:

&gt; In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs 1·19–1·96), whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were the least efficacious drugs (0·51–0·84). For acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more tolerable than other antidepressants (range of ORs 0·43–0·77), whereas amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine had the highest dropout rates (1·30–2·32). 46 (9%) of 522 trials were rated as high risk of bias, 380 (73%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18%) as low; and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low.

And yes, I do have things to distract. I have school, work, and passions/hobbies, and other friends as well.

58,"*Note:* I have an appointment scheduled with my pcp to find a psychiatrist and get a diagnosis. I'm not looking for what to do, but rather what the issue *might* be.


Ever since I was a very small child(3 yrs) I've had imaginary friends as well as experiences with super scary *things*. I've always been afraid of things in the dark, and created friends to fight the scary monsters that lurked there. It was the only way I could sleep feeling safe. I would talk and interact with these creatures every night. When I was 3-4, I snuck out of my room the night before Easter and saw the Easter bunny filling our baskets- I was wide awake. To this day my family denies anyone dressing up to fill baskets, so I'm not sure what exactly happened- a hallucination?

**Positive Hallucinations**
I was verbally abused and bullied both at home and at school, and I was a very lonely, depressed kid. I was 13 when the X-files came out and was elated- it was the only positive thing I could share with my father. Sometime in the year after it came out, I was so enveloped in the show that I began seeing Fox and Scully, and 'found out' that I was his sister Samantha. I would have to whisper under my breath to communicate with them until Fox suddenly told me I was telepathic and could communicate without alerting anyone. I knew in the back of my mind it wasn't real, but they made me feel safe and part of a family. My fantasy grew to involve the Lone Gunmen, Skinner, and a bunch of others. They stuck around until I was 23-24, and I finally decided I wanted to tackle my extreme issues of depression and social anxiety. Fox told me what I had to do to make them go away, which is not interact with them or acknowledge them at all. It would effectively kill them, so I had to be sure. They faded over about three weeks and I haven't seen them since.

I have, however, had others show up over the years that weren't X-Files related. I have one core 'tulpa'(for lack of a better word) that shows up when I'm suicidal and he protects me from myself. If it weren't for him I wouldn't be alive. 

**Negative Hallucinations**
I've always considered myself to be sensitive and have a bit of esp; I'm definitely empathic as I can correctly feel and read people most of the time. Part of that sensitivity is seeing wraiths and ghosts, and once when I was about to kill myself I even saw Death. The most recent scary vision/experience was with a wraith. It was a half-rotted corpse(not sure if male or female) that would 'attack' me here at home. It would rush at me and I'd have to mentally will it away. After praying for God to cleanse our home it finally vanished and I haven't seen it since. I still get the feeling behind my neck and shoulder blades that something is about to rush me, and half the time I end up running instead of walking away because it's so intense. 

**Other Symptoms**
Severe depression tends to always roll in no matter how hard I try to help myself heal from my past. I've worked through my anxiety with the help of a cognitive behavioral therapist, but am left with depression and these weird experiences. The depression leaves me feeling drained of all energy, super sore, on the verge of panic and tears, and sometimes angry or impatient. Also have bouts of insomnia and have an eating disorder of some sort that comes on strongest when I'm the most depressed/mentally fucked.

So to preface this I have intimacy issues since I woke up next to a girlfriend and she died(natural). I also have to take beta-blockers for a heart condition.

So met this chick on pof and went on a date. Drinking was the choice, now I usually start off pretty awkward the first round or so then come into myself. But with beta blockers I seemed to have stayed awkward due to it making me more sleepy with the booze. So basically the whole time out I was awkward.

Get to her place still 'awkward', watch netflix 'awkward', get the balls to go to the bedroom 'awkward' and then when it comes to getting intimate eventually.......act like a blindman fumbling through nettles or acting like a dead fish due to the blockers. She sucks me off, I get hard but go nowhere, we spoon and then I leave in the morn.

My brain wont let go of what a shit night I gave her. She was super nice and patient.

To try and get rid of guilt I have: messaged her explaining(cept the death thing), said a lame bye via message and laid out all I had done wrong that night and what I should have done instead. No replys.

So now I'm like, can't message her again (verging in to creepy by a fourth message).

It's been five years away from the dating scene becuase of the death. So want to get opinions here.

I feel guilty because she was super interesting and I feel like I never had a chance(due to my hang ups) to show the real me. And because that must have been one shitty night from her perspective.
