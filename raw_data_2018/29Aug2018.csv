1,"I have DPD traits, but not the full blown thing.

I’m realizing how clingy and dependent I am with my mom, and it’s pretty embarrassing. I’m trying to work on it. I want to get better. 

Any insight or advice from people who have it?",29Aug2018,2
2,"My wife and I have been together for a little over 9 years now, we have 2 kids together, 3 and 6. Since having kids my anxiety has sky rocketed, particularly when the get a stomach bug that involves vommiting. I get so anxious about it and I'm not quite sure why. I end up going days without eating, then have diarrhea (sorry for TMI), and then it feels like im constantly going crazy, questioning EVERYTHING that i think about, such as are my car keys in my pocket, etc. I literally feel like I'm losing my mind. I am on Anxiety medication, however, it doesn't seem to be worth it in these times.


I currently write about this now because it is currently going on. The only place I dont feel overwhelmed with anxiety, is when I'm at work. As soon as I get cut from work, the anxiety immediately starts coming back.


Ive tried CBD oil in my vape, but that didn't do anything for me. I'm on the verge of causing a problem in my marriage by telling my wife I want to go stay at my mother's house for a week until this has calmed down, but that comes down to her feeling like a single mom and abandoned, and then the kids start questioning whats going on.


I write this asking anyone for advice. Anything to help keep the anxiety at bay, during times like these, since I can never seem to figure anything out. 


Apologies about format, for I am on my phone.",29Aug2018,3
3,"I just started my senior year of college yesterday (I live in the US). I have depression, anxiety, and got diagnosed with PTSD this summer. I’ve had a hard time with my mental health ever since coming to school - I’m okay during the beginning of the semester and then I crash and burn. I thought I could do that until I graduate but last semester I became really suicidal. Luckily I got help at a program in time. 

I went home for the summer where I did another program and I started feeling pretty good. I was unsure whether I would be able to come back here this semester, but everyone told me they thought I could, so I decided to come back.

I moved into my apartment that I share with two friends on Friday. On Sunday night, I had two panic attacks (one being the worst I’ve had in an extremely long time) about being here and told my boyfriend and my parents that I wasn’t ready. They’re still telling me that I can do it. They’re saying that I’m being pessimistic and that I’m sabotaging myself by saying that it isn’t going to end up well, but it’s never ended up well and I don’t want to feel like that again. 

I’ve been crying multiple times yesterday and today and I didn’t want to leave the house today. I feel like I’m starting out the semester in the mental state that I’m usually at mid-semester and I’m scared as to how bad I’m going to get. I don’t know what to do, I’m overwhelmed and I’m hating my life and myself. I don’t want to be here and I feel like I have no support from anyone. I haven’t felt this alone in so long. 

If anyone has been in a similar kind of situation, I would love to know how you dealt with it. Any advice or comments would be greatly appreciated. Please help me.

TLDR; I’m at school and have a track record of going downhill every semester. I was suicidal last semester and only recovered this summer. I feel like I’m not ready to do this again and I’m already doing horribly but everyone keeps saying I can do it.

4,"Hi Everyone,

This is my first post on reddit. 

I never thought I'd share this for anyone to see. The story of my journey is a long one. Perhaps for another post if anyone is interested...

At the time I am writing this I am 27. So, 11 years of experience. I am moderately and humbly successful in most areas of life - social, financial, etc... I think if you can ""manipulate"" mania it can really work in your favour. 

Diagnosis @ age 16:

Bi-Polar 
Depression
Anxiety

Additional Diagnoses @ 21:

A.D.D
Insomnia

I am not proud of the amount
and quantity of meds I am prescribed. This is where it gets fun.

All daily...

200mg x Seroquel IR 
400mg x Lamotragine 
15mg    x Zopliclone 
45mg    x Temazepam
3mg     x Alprazolam (Xanax)
110mg x Vyvanse (Lis-amphetamine sp?)

20 mg  xDexedrine IR

At the moment I am just wondering if anyone may be at this level and lead a relatively good life (with hard work and determination ). It can be a fucking struggle like anyone who has poor mental health though. I still have occasional symptoms to this day. 

Thanks everyone,

Brendon

6,"I’ve been on the path to recovering from bipolar disorder. I started my meds in June and it completely turned around my life. I felt so stable that I didn’t feel there was a point in therapy and now believe I can stay without as long as I get a higher dose of meds. However, once you push away those symptoms of depression, anger, anxiety, and hypomania, I’m still left with the need for attention. It’s not super extreme like once I walk into a room I need it or I’ll die. But I just notice it’s the only persistent symptom lingering as I’ve had this symptom for quite a while. Recently I’ve found myself thinking a lot about how I can surprise people with my age. (Sounds weird but one way I like to get attention is to surprise/shock people and most don’t believe I’m 19 because I look so young). I also like to get kisses/hugs and talk to my parents or friends constantly. When I’m on social media, making a post and not having I’d get response makes me depressed which is why I avoid posting on Facebook or Instagram. And it gets darker: When I’m out and see a man passing by I have vivid daydreams of them sexually assaulting me. This is partially due to a trauma I lived through as a kid but also do to me subconsciously seeking that type of negative but familiar attention. Point is, I just needed to get this out. I don’t want a diagnosis (lord knows I’ve been down that path too many times) I just wanna vent. A tiny voice in my head says I could be Histrionic but I don’t believe I am. Yet the attention-seeking side of me feels like having such a disorder will make me “special” and “different” so it sounds so alluring. I don’t expect much as you all are not doctors but has anyone had experience with anything similar? I appreciate the help",29Aug2018,1

    Hi Reddit. 


    Well, uh. To start, I made my first account on Reddit just so I could post something about my situation here and hopefully get some kind of insight. 


    Uh, god. I'm really sorry. I'm not totally sure how to start this. Am I going crazy? Because it feels like it. This is true, this is my story, and I'm not sure what to do.


    Some background first, I guess. I won't be giving my full name or any direct and pinpoint information, but I'm D. It’s nice to meet you. I'm a young adult, and I just moved in with my mom in Northern Colorado in the USA after a really ugly custody battle. Previously, I stayed with my mom from feb-july, but I've only now officially moved in. It's been a fairly smooth transition, I guess. I dropped out of high school in mid-2017 while living with my dad, and missed basically my entire junior year. I'm planning on going back this year and (hopefully) graduating. But, that's serving to be a huge problem. 


    From Feb-July, when I stayed with my mom before this, I was completely isolated. I didn't go outside, ever. I became terrified of leaving, of driving, of the world and the people it contained. I think this is because I had some extreme trauma recently, as well as coming to terms with old trauma, severe major depressive disorder, and some various anxiety and panic disorders. (I know, boohoo me.) The depression has since depleted somewhat and become manageable, but.. Being isolated? I was lonely. Insanely lonely. As much as people scared me now, I still wanted friends. People. The only person I ever saw was my mom, and of course, the occasional delivery person. (A chinese place near my house is amazing!!). It stayed that way for months. Finally, I had enough, and decided to make the several hour drive to my dad's house to visit and see other fucking human beings. Faces. Somewhere familiar. 


    It was a stupid choice and I immediately regretted it. Halfway through the trip, on a toll road, I was driven off the road and into the medium by a green semi-truck. I used to car haul with my mother a few years ago, so I have a basic idea on where their blind spots are. I was almost positive I wasn't in one. But, I guess I was, because driver tried to change lanes, directly into me, on the two lane toll road. I freaked out. I froze. I didn't think, I didn't honk. I slammed on my breaks as soon as the semi tapped me and I drove into the grassy median. The semi still changed lanes, and continued driving. I parked, put on the e-breaks, got out, and threw up everything my stomach contained in a big, blubbering, crying and hyperventilating mess. It didn't take long for someone to drive past and pull over to help me out. It was a nice man and his son in a huge white pickup truck. Of course, he tried to get me to talk, but I could barely say anything, between my hyperventilating and my coughing. 


    I remember nothing after that point. I guess I fainted. My mom said the man called her (My phone doesn't have a password lock), and his son called 911. An ambulance arrived, I was taken to the hospital, and my mom met me there. I woke up pretty soon after. I was fine, if you were wondering. Not even so much as a bad bruise. My car didn't make it out as well as I did, though. It wasn't completely totalled but it sure as fuck wasn't driveable anymore... After I told my mom what happened, she said she wanted to press charges with the driver of whatever semi had pushed me off the road. And, you know what? So did I.


    If you don't know, toll roads periodically have places where cameras take pictures of your licence plate along the road, as to tell how long you were on the toll, and who to send the bill for driving on it. I don't know what they're called, but I call them checkpoints.


    I went home after I was discharged, interviewed, and given some pain medications and anti-anxiety medications. It didn't take long to hear back from the officers who talked to me at the hospital. That semi? 


    There wasn't one. 


    They told me and my mom there was no green semi seen driving on the toll road or through the checkpoints before and after the place I ended up. They fucking told me there wasn't any semi around that time at all! Which is impossible. There wasn't a place to get on and off that toll around the spot I was at that didn't have cameras. They told me maybe I had mistaken, and if I'd maybe just seen it in my head? A hallucination. They were suggesting I hallucinated a whole fucking semi. I told them no. Fuck fucking no. It was a green semi truck. What about the scrapes and dent on the side of my car?? Did I make those up, too? 

    Nothing came out of the investigation. 


    Everything started getting worse after that. 


    Its escalated to extraordinary places. I'm starting to question my sanity. When I still occasionally drive, maybe just around the block? At night, I see people walking into the road, but they vanish after they pass behind a parked car on the side of the road. My clothing will change, sometimes entire outfits, even if I don't remember changing clothes. I've left the gas stove on, on multiple occasions. The handle on our dishwasher broke off and went missing, me or my mother having no idea where it went. I see cats outside that the motion lights don't pick up. Sometimes, whole days in the week will skip past. I'll think it's Monday but in reality, it's Tuesday or Wednesday. 


    Then there's the really physical stuff. Walking outside at night, with falling snow, no one around, a tree branch in front of me broke and fell at my feet. It whipped me in the face and I had a welt, but nothing more. That branch was still there in the morning. Physical proof, right? Fuck, you could even see it directly out the back door. Evidently, I don't really go walking anymore. 


    And then there's the cat. The fucking cat, who started showing up at my door. It cries at our door, for hours. So, I let him in once. Because of my window placement being directly above the door on the second floor, I heard the cries directly, and they broke my heart. I opened the door slightly and he just… Darted in, past my legs, no hesitation. And this cat, just started exploring, in a house he's never been in before, not scared at all. How fucking crazy is that? He even went upstairs, and explored all around there. Hung out in my room. Fell asleep in my bed! Eventually, he had to go. We aren't allowed pets since we are renting. Plus, my mom is allergic. I didn't wanna be in trouble. I had to pick this cat up and force him out. He did not want to go, at all. He even clung to my arm, and sunk his teeth in. I now have 4 puncture wound scars on my right arm. He left on his own after that. But now he keeps leaving dead animals on our back porch and rattling our door screens and window screens at night. 


    He got onto my windowsill, 4 nights ago. Rattling the window screen. I, of course, was immediately sent into a panic at the sound of my fucking screen being rattled. Once I got the light was on, it was just the cat. Which relieved me at first. At my dad's house, my cat would always jump onto my windowsill when she wanted in. But, it dawned on me kinda quickly. 


    I'm on the second floor.


    I turned around, just for a moment, to grab my craft scissors from my crochet box to cut the screen to let him in. Lile that, he was gone. And nowhere in sight. I realised, I don't even have a windowsill. It was physical, I swear it was!! God, I swear to god. I know what a real cat looks like, and that was it. I've never had hallucinations. And none of these are like, scary out of this world shit like eyes coming out of the wall or my room being on fire. It's normal stuff, somewhat. I'm not crazy. I've never had hallucinations. I can't be having these intense visual and auditory hallucinations. I want to go back to school. I want to graduate. And most of all, I don't want to be crazy. This has never happened before. 


    I mean sure, I was that asshole little kid who used to say they were schizo, but I wasn't actually schizophrenic! It was a joke, a lie, I was stupid. I've never actually had hallucinations.  


    And I'm starting to get scared. Really scared. The events keep escalating. 


    I'm currently hiding in my room, with a gun. I'm not thinking of suicide or anything. But I'm scared for my life. I've never believed in some vengeful god. But my front door has been slamming shut. I usually assume it's my mom. Our door is heavy, it'll slam if you just let it go. It slammed today. I don't hear it open. I got up out of bed, thinking it was my mom coming home or something. Truth be told, I brought a ton of food into my room. I didn't want my mom approaching me first and seeing my stash. So i went to meet her first. I got halfway down the stairs, and saw she wasn't on the couch, nor were her keys hanging. So I stopped, and sat down on the stairs. Texted my mom. Something like “Oh, did you come home and leave?” She replied back, saying that she's at work. I told her “but the door closed”. She knows about my current dilemma somewhat, and asked if I was sure. I'm positive. I can see the path of my front door from my window, as my window sits directly above the door on the second floor. My bed is right above the front door. I can hear it slamming, feel it slamming, even the air in the house moves, somehow. Trust me, I can tell. I can attach the screenshot of that text conversation if you'd like.


My mom called me in a slight panic and told me of the gun hidden under the chair cushion in the living room, which I had no idea about. I took it, and swept the house. As much as a rattled, small girl with a gun that was a lot heavier than expected, could “sweep the house”. I've never even shot a gun before. No one is here as far as I can tell, and nothing has been moved, but holy fucking shit, did it scare me. I keep hearing noises. And honestly, I'm done. This is too much.


    There's been a lot more strange occurrences I didn't mention here. It's a really long and freaky fucking list that would be too long for one post. Some of them I'll even have to ask my mom about, since sometimes, I don't even notice the weird shit until she mentions it. (Like the changing clothes or the skipping days, for instance.) 


    But, god. This has to stop. What do I do? Who do I call? Is there some kind of disorder for this?? I'm still a somewhat functional human, I don't have anything else wrong as far as I can tell. 


    My senior year of highschool started in the first week of this month (August). I haven't been able to attend due to all of this. I just want to go back to school.


    What's happening to me?? Am I actually going crazy?


    Ask questions if you'd like. I'm not sure how Reddit works to please, bare with me. I might also post this on nosleep or other forums to try to reach a good number of people in hopes of help, but I'm still debating that choice. Nosleep seems to be more fake scary ghost stories than real scary stories. Ugh...

There's other things happening, but again, compiling everything in one post would.. suck. I can make another post about it if anyone ever wants.


Overall, I just want this to stop. Get help, something. Anything. 


Thank you.

13,"Hello everyone on reddit, I have have anxiety for most of my life with extreme bouts of depression and hypochondria. When I was in grade 10, 2013 i all of a sudden lost sensation on the right side of my body, and then eventually (a few weeks later) spread to the other side.  This really freaked me out and I thought I was having a stroke or cancer. Almost everyone who has illness anxiety disorder has a few of death. I then made constant visits to my extremely patient doctor who believed me and gave me so many different types of tests: blood tests, thyroid checks, lower back ultra sound, and brain MRI, and a nerve conduction study. I did almost every test in the book, I also get a burning pain in my left scapula and sometimes weakness in my left of right side of my body but will then go away. Recently I have felt it's gotten worse and I'm feeling in a constant state of worry as to whether I have a tumor on my spine or some auto immune disease. I'm constantly thinking about it no matter what is going on. I have times when I dont think about and I  feel pretty good although I still feel the physical symptoms. I dont know if I will ever feel the same, but I am totally fine living with this, becuase I am happy when I'm not in one of these moods, and I will be moving to japan next june for a teaching job.

18,"I would like honest opinions on this. Its been bothering me, and I don't think Im clingy myself but Im not sure why I have bad luck with dating. But no one has ever out right told me that I was clingy.

Ill give you some examples.

The last guy I was seeing over the summer, he wouldn't text a lot during the day. I don't like texting someone 24/7 all the time either I find it really suffocating so I was fine with it. He would usually text me after he got home from work which was night time every night. We would chat for a while and then either he or I would stop answering for the night. On very few occasions he would stop answering I would text him again about something if I felt like the conversation was a little dead. That was rarely. But I felt like that was an even thing we both did. After we hanging out once he texted me right away and then when he got home, but I didn't answer because I went to bed. The next day I texted him first. Its a long story but he was being distant so then I got scared and got distant and then he ended up pushing me away completely. I think we were both scared in our own ways.

He would get very distant because he has a hard time opening up I think thats when I would get a little nervous. I was in a bad mood one night and he didn't answer my text asking him how he was, then I asked him what his deal was. Well for one, I think its rude when someone texts you that and you don't answer. He didn't get back to me about that until the next day. I don't know if that scared him but he was so hot and cold I was getting annoyed and had to speak my mind.

I guess what Im trying to say here is I can't tell if I was being clingy and pushed him away or he is just some fearful avoidant mess with relationships.

I guess Im just so overly concerned about being clingy that Im really anxious about it and I don't want that to happen because I know how ugly that looks. 

I talked to my therapist about it and she told me in no way that I was being clingy and I'm not a clingy person.

I won't text someone repeatedly if they don't answer, if they don't answer my first text maybe Ill send them one more text asking them what happened. If they were to not answer that, then I leave it.

I’m ready to give up. I’m feeling crushed under my depression and anxiety and I don’t know what to do. I have suicidal thoughts throughout my day, though I wouldn’t do anything because of my family.......

I’m drowning in debt, I’m unable to pay 95% of my bills, I can’t find the drive to go to work or even get up in the mornings to take my kids to school. The school system has already sent a social worker to my home because of my kids’ tardies and absences......

I’m tired of hurting....the emotional struggle is bad enough, but tack on all of my physical ailments and migraines and I’m just a shell of pain. 

I was on medication, but they weren’t doing anything for me - I can’t get to sleep at night, and once I pass out from exhaustion I can’t get restful sleep so I sleep through 8-10 alarms.......

I’m just, tired. Of all of it. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to be happy. I don’t know how to function. I’m just at a loss and keep thinking about how nice it would be to go to sleep and just not wake up. I have zero reason to feel this way.

She's been suffering from depression, and anxiety all her life, as far as she could remember, seen therapists for it and now just kind of gave up and lost trust over the whole medical mental health field.

Right now, I'm just trying to find ways to support and help her but sometimes she'll get mad at me over things that I didn't realize were hurting her more so than helping her. I would give her words of encouragement, but I feel like it's not going through to her, and she only ends up frustrated or mad about it. For example, she's been feeling like she's not good enough, or that she'll never be good enough. Then I will talk to her about all the positive things I see of her. But I feel like I'm sounding more like a lecture. 

I guess I just want to know what the people around you as a sufferer would do that helps, or if you're like me who have someone who suffers, what are the things that you do to support your loved ones that you know are really helping them.

26,"Hey. Lately I've been feeling really weird. A month ago I had a very bad depression episode (I'm fine now) and I think ever since then my brain has just been hibernating or something. I forget things I did a few hours earlier and say things without thinking. A friend asked me a question earlier and I replied but it never actually processed in my head.

I feel like my brain is only using 15% of its capacity, no more. I get good amounts of sleep and eat/drink enough. It's just like there's a fog in my head that's keeping me from functioning properly. I wade through my days not really doing anything because I don't have the motivation for it. There's no sadness, I'm actually quite happy because I'm very much in love, but even when I talk to her my mind just blacks out sometimes.

Should I go see a doctor/therapist for this, or are there other solutions?",29Aug2018,1

29,"So in my state, this is all legal. The legal age of consent is 16. I am completely unattracted to women my own age, sometimes straight up disgusted really. It is not like women my age are not interested in me either, I am a successful business owner and modeled in the fitness industry for several years as well and got pretty big in my industry so I am confident that I am attractive to some degree. 

The only issue is women this young are really immature and are REALLY not looking for the same things that people my age are generally looking for, something long term.

I think it mostly boils down to a physical attraction that makes me kinda disgusted with women my own age. I know I am going to get dislikes for this but it seems like women my age have all let themselves go and gained like 40 lbs and being an ex-fitness model, still in the same shape, I want someone who is on the same level as myself but being out of the industry and running my own business not in that industry, the only women who can look like that effortlessly are women who have not gotten into the let yourself go and get super fat and gross stage of life.

I guess this is kind of a vent session mixed with a silent plea for help from a throwaway account. I am getting really sad to be honest. I hate that the women I am attracted to pretty much just want sex and then to head off to college. I want to settle down with a woman with health and fitness standards that are similar to my own. Someone who is going to have that amazing personality AND actually be attractive to me.

I don’t ever remember feeling bad for another person. I don’t ever remember feeling overly happy about anything. I don’t think I’d ever give to charity. It never really affects me outside of my head, I’m a pretty charismatic person and don’t have problems talking to people. I just have trouble keeping friends.

32,"This is just a general question for anyone to comment or give their two cents about. Something in my (m22) life has become more and more noticeable that I deal with. I’m completely black and white when I deal with people. If you do something dumb and get hurt I won’t feel bad. If I don’t like you I will cut you out of my life no problem. I move on and live perfectly normal. My relationship to everyone Including family most of the time, except my fiancée, I could cut out of my life and not feel bad for it. It’s not that I have bad relationships with my family but I just can be without them. More so with friends. They do something that is harmful I can just stop talking to them regardless of the time we spent together and it doesn’t cross my mind. I don’t know how else to explain it. It’s just something I kind of battle with. I don’t know why my fiancée, maybe the emotional investment, but it’s how I have always been. Shit happens, people do stupid stuff, people leave. And I say that not because it really has affected me but I just have a understanding of the reality of the world and the way things go. If people want to stay around they can stay if they go then they will go. I just worry though that I have something wrong with my psyche because I absolutely know no one else that thinks like I do. Not at least the people I have known. Just looking to see if anyone else is out there or I’m just an oddball",29Aug2018,1
33,The other day when I was walking to a college class the second I stepped on the grass a large swarm of gnats swarmed my shoes and legs. I felt weird about it because they looked not real like when you look at a blank blue sky and see dots moving around. I figured that could be explained by the fact that I wasn't wearing my glasses that day. But they still seemed fake to me. Today I had a really good example that happened to me that weirded me the fuck out. I was home alone and went to the restroom. When I was done I turned the lights off and walked into the kitchen. When I was in the kitchen I heard the light switch in the bathroom click the very distinctive click it makes when flipped. I thought somebody must be home that I didn't see so i walked to the bathroom and the lights were off as i left them and nobody was there to be found. I've had other things happen such as random paranoia but these are things that have happened in the past 2 days.,29Aug2018,0
34,"I've always been the quiet guy for the entirety of my life. In highschool I was void of any feelings and emotions. When lunch rolls around, I would usually stress out where I would sit. When I was a senior I had study hall first period (in the cafeteria) and everyday when I get off from the bus I would dart straight to the restrooms and just sit in there until first period would start (there's usually 20ish minutes for breakfast). I hated myself for doing that and I wanted to change.


 After highschool, I moved 80ish miles out to attend a community college. I decided to take therapy for my anxiety and my shyness. I don't do well around big crowds especially if I don't know anyone or if a friend has other friend groups that are attending. I would either get left out and just feel sad that I was just being an extra wheel. I would feel like a loser if I just stood there all alone so mostly any big event's downtime I would just go sit in a stall in the restroom. I hate what I'm about to say but I think that I can only socialize with anyone who seems to be inferior. I hate this. I hate realizing this. It makes me sick and I don't want this to be me. I'm a scumbag and a waste of space. I stopped going to therapy because I forgot to call them one time and charged my $60 and I was scared to go back there. I wasn't financially stable when I first moved to college so I decided not to go anymore. I accepted who I was at the time and tried to moved on with my life. 

Fast-forward to today. I've realized I've contributed nothing to society. I've given up on dating because I don't want anyone to feel bad about dating me because of my lack of personality. I've been stood up 3 times in a row and it just hurts. I'm self-aware of everything I said or done awkwardly and damnit it just sucks. I don't know how to correct it, I scold myself (I don't self-harm) for it and try to fix it but it usually is never fixed. I've lost my motivation for my hobbies and get distracted whenever I try to get back to my hobbies. I'm still the same person who doesn't initiates conversation or tries to socialize with other people and yet I envied seeing these interactions, seeing people having so much fun without me. I want to join in but I just can't seem to pull myself out of my shell or have anything to say. I think I'll start searching for a therapist tomorrow because I'm desperate and I don't want to feel this loneliness, this anxiety, this shyness, this depression. All my life, I haven't taken the next step to change my life. 

 In short: I hate myself.",29Aug2018,1
35,"So recently I’ve been waking up at the same time every night to go to the loo (3am-ish) but every time I’ve got back into bed I’ve felt anxious that I’m not going to be able to go to sleep. Most of the time I fall asleep with no problem but sometimes the anxiety (which is for no apparent reason) stops me from falling asleep. 
Tonight I woke up again at half three and tried to go back to sleep, I couldn’t, so I’ve tried meditating, reading and just trying to go to sleep and accepting that it might take longer than usual but 3 hours later, the sun is up and I’m still awake and exhausted. 
I don’t have a job and I don’t go to uni for another 2/3 weeks so I don’t have to be up at a certain time. 
My problem is if I get up now I know I will feel awful and lousy all day but if I try and sleep, well, I’m not very confident I will sleep and it feel pointless to be honest.
Is there any point in me trying to go back to sleep now? And what could I potentially do to reduce my nighttime anxiety?

37,"Hello Reddit, I am new here and I made this account just to cope with my ""demons"". I just want to vent my life now, because I feel like I'm losing it again. This is the part where  I probably should say ""I'm sorry about my English, it is my 3rd. language"", but I'm not sorry, at least I'm trying to write and communicate with people.  
Ok, but lets start that vent of my life and I guess this will be a long post:  


I was born in a family of fucked up weirdos. My dad is a violent drunk and my mom is violent and really erratic and we always played this ""game"" that we are a perfect family for everyone else to see, but the truth inside 4 walls was different. My dad used to drink all our money and mom used to buy stuff for her, so we never really had money and I would wear my brothers old clothes and yes, I'm a girl. It was humiliating.  
I grew a bit bigger and went to school, but as a redhead full of freckles it was like going to comedy club and I was the joke. First I used to laugh with them, but it gets really fast old and it turned to be bullying. ""What is wrong with your face?"", ""Why don't you wash your face, it is so ugly."", ""Don't come here, we don't want to have those dots."", ""Look at her clothes!"". As a child I was always that one who would sit in the corner quiet and watch others play and I only talked when it was a must. I didn't trust anyone and I was bullied from 1st. class to 9th. I never told anyone, I didn't even know who to tell and mom and dad never seemed to care. I remember one day at school very well, when the day was over and everyone left for home and there I was looking for my shoes. I found them in the garbage on the other side of the school. Someone had broken them and the other was full of some shit. I was crying and panicking, because I knew if I come home like that, I will get beaten. So I left the school to go home and walked bare foot and there they were again, my bullies ready to pick on me. They ripped off my bag, pulled my hair and spit on me and I cried all the way to home. I got home and it went just like I thought, mom yelling how I'm useless and I got beaten, at least I was happy that dad was so drunk that he didn't even notice. Next day I go to school with my broken bag and shoes..it was a fucking hell and I never had any friends.   
Time goes by and I turn 10, dad finally leaves. It was a happy day for me. Dad had beaten me so many times and I really feared him. Now he was gone and I felt happy for the first time in years. It really was bitter sweet. Mom got crazier after that and started to care less and less about me. My brother has always been her favorite kid, she would have climbed to get the stars for him. I wast just the mistake of her life and she made sure I always heard and knew that.  
When I turned 16, I moved out of my home and went to a new school. I started to have panic attacks, I was getting even more depressed and I was looking for something to forget my past or just to have a moment of peace. I turned into drugs. I used to took anything I could get, at first it was working but in time it made me just even sadder.  
When I was 18, I met this one guy who really seemed to like me, even when I was down he would try to make me laugh. I felt happy, but I was terrified about it too, like ""Out of all people, he wants to be with someone like me, really? I'm just a drug addict with a lot of problems."" and I can't trust people. Well he stayed and I went to get help for the first time. I was terrified and almost canceled my time. I got a diagnose of severe depression, panic attacks and anxiety. I really knew that already. For the next 2 years I was eating ssri-pills to help me through the day and I didn't do other drugs. It took me 5 years to finish school that should only take 3 years. After that school I was so ashamed that it took me so long and I turned again to drugs for help. I tried to go to work and be ""normal"" (what i think is normal) and I had this great guy who really likes me and is there for me, but he doesn't know I sniff shit up to my nose when he is at work and that I cry every day. I finally had the courage to tell him it all..so I did. He listened me and we cried together and the next day he took me to hospital to get help. I stayed there for 2 months, got clean again and had therapy. When I got out I had to go see some psychiatrist once a week. I finally felt like everything is turning for the better. After a year of seeing that psychiatrist my time was to move forward, so the therapy ended. 6 months later I started to have panic attacks again and I was sniffing that shit up my nose again. I was getting worse again. I left that amazing guy and moved out of our home and spent next year being wasted. I was a mess, I really don't remember most of that year. After that year I started to get clean again but this time by myself. I left all my drug friends, stayed at home and cried my eyes out. When I was finally clean again I met this amazing guy again and he said ""I know you are sad, hurt and broken, but I can see what you really are. You are kind, sweet, helpful and you always try even when you fall down, you just get up and punch life to the face. I admire how strong you are."" and there I was speechless. We started to go out again and moved together again. I'm now 28 and I have been clean for 4-5 years and we are still together. But sadly lately I have been feeling bad again, I'm crying, having anxiety and panic attacks and I can feel my old ways calling me. I'm trying to be strong and not to do all that shit again..so I guess I am writing this just to say this all out loud. I don't have any real friends who I can talk to, so it would be nice to find even a internet friend to talk to.  
There, it is all out.",29Aug2018,3
38,"As title.

I tried to tell her, slowly at first, that I booked an appointment at the local psychological counseling center (we have those in Italy and to some degree they're free). She knows it's for this anxiety that I feel, but she doesn't really... understand what that means.

I tried to explain what I feel every day to her: the feeling of dread, the overthinking, the physical symptoms (knot in my stomach, back muscles becoming tense, loss of sleep) etc. She know I feel anxiety during exams, but i've often mentioned to her that I feel like shit on a daily, too.

But today she just kinda said ""well, do what you have to"" and chuckled as if I was being silly. I don't think she understands that this neverending anxiety has been *actually* affecting me. She thinks it's just a feeling that will maybe go away if I vent to somebody about it. ",29Aug2018,4
39,"Maybe this question is better for another Reddit, but I feel the need to ask here because the reason I am asking is due to a desire to get back in shape.

 I recently 'recovered' from a depressive state in my life but have kept the poor eating and sleep habits from it, and can't seem to fix it myself. I wake up at seemingly random times even when I have alarms set, turning the alarm off again and sleeping for about 4 more hours or so afterwards. The amount I sleep every night ranges from about 2 hours all the way up to 18 in one case, for the most part all in one go, and then I don't go back to bed until 1 am the next day as per usual (at least that's consistent).

Then, whenever I do wake up, I normally eat one thing 4 hours after I wake up, sometimes earlier, and eat nothing for the rest of the day. I would like to note right now I am not trying to fast at all. I purely don't have any desire to eat and it normally passes over my head that I need to. I also have been working on drinking more water because I know I currently drink less than a quarter of what I probably should be.

Tl;dr
- I have garbage sleep patterns, 2-18 hour sleep sessions
-I eat only one thing a day and have troubles eating much else
-I drink little water as to what is normally reccomended

Note: I currently weigh in at 150 lbs and am (from when I last checked, been a long time) 5'6. I would also like to note that I am not depressed anymore, and whenever I have depressive or suicidal thoughts they usually pass sooner rather than later.

I work out at least once every day for an hour as well, with one full body workout every monday whenever I wake up.

Thanks for any help in advance, if you think my question would be better solved in a different reddit, please tell me! I'm trying to fix this soon so I can get on to getting stronger!

41,"My Wife has suffered from separation anxiety since she was a young girl, (around 3yo I believe) and gets very emotional at big moments in her life such as when we got our first home together and moved out of her parents' place.

In three weeks our Son will start nursery full-time and she is absolutely dreading it. She has already told me to stop reminding her about it because it means changing working hours etc to fit around him and when we had a 1hr taster session back in July she was inconsolable on the way home.

43,"For a little bit of context, I'm 18 and doing community college rn. Sort of feel like I got the short end of the stick as all my other friends are attending four years and I totally could have gotten the chance to go if I really pushed for it, but my parents blocked that option amongst a whole ton of other persisting issues. When I'm not at school I don't have much to do anymore since my friends are gone, I've tried to get back into personal hobbies and while it has been fun here and there it never seems to fulfill me from the emptiness I'm feeling.
Additionally, my mom got diagnosed with cancer and has just started chemo. It sort of feels like the shittiest of conclusions as to how my life has been for the past year and a half, where I originally started to become numb when two of my friends had the most toxic of break ups. Again, it's hard to feel truly depressed because I've broken out of the habit of hating myself, but happiness is sort of rare and my goals feel just as far as they did two years ago.
I can give more context if anyone wants to hear, thanks for listening too.

So yeah, this Friday I'm going to see him again and make a decision about going on anxiety medication or not, and I'm pretty freaked out about it underneath the surface to be honest and I was wondering about other people's experience so or advice or whatever just someone to talk to about it that has actual experience.

I'm mostly unsettled by the idea of willingly taking a drug that alters the way that my brain works, and the possibility of missing out on experiencing life fully because of it.

Is this the way I found to keep myself alive even when I don't wanna be?

My sister would have a bad time at that time too, but she never tried to understand me. Instead, she decided to be really mad at me all the time, feel hatred towards me and yell at me every time I talk to her (something she still does currently). I can understand she didn't like that situation during those years, but what I can't understand is she being so mad at me if the one who had his life fuked up for more than 2 years was me, not her. I can't understand it. I always try to make her happy, by helping her out with everything, trying to be all the possible time with her... but she always denies everything I tell her. She blames me for being mentally ill. I tried to tell her what my issues are, but she just starts blaming me more and more, without any option of saying anything, because she would start to yell at me and be angry. I don't know why she hates me for something I wasn't guilty of, but she just keeps doing it. She's 14 now and, yes, I can understand she was too young at that time, but now she's older, and instead of leaving past aside as I did, she remains hateful and resentful. My mom also tried to explain her, but got no result. As I mentioned before, I do my best to keep her happy and instead of trying to be cool with me she blames me for every thing I do and she dislikes, calling me a videogame addicted (I am, I recognize it) and starting to get heatened up.

58,"Sorry if this gets a little long but I’ve had a lot on my mind lately and I wanted to bring it up to people that I thought might would understand.

So when I was a kid I suffered from violent intrusive thoughts that kept me up at night as well as having an obsession about having clean hands that made me wash my hands, go away for a little while, and then wash them again. Rinse and repeat until my hands would bleed.

Went to a doctor when I was a kid but my parents didn’t really like his approach because instead of saying outright what the issue was he said “hey you’re just like that guy from that show, Monk!” and then I went to another doctor who diagnosed me with adhd and I’m not convinced that’s actually what it was. I think the issue was more in line with what the first doctor said but I’ve never been actually diagnosed with OCD, just been doing a lot of reading.

That kind of blew over for a while or I just learned to cope with it, although I still wash my hands too much and in high school had a brush I would use when I washed my hands.

So this leads us to today, about 12 years later. So I don’t know what triggered this, I think maybe some askreddit thread that mentioned pedophilia or something but ever since then I’ve been worried for, what I’ve convinced myself is no reason. I’ve never been sexually attracted to a child in my life. I like kids and think they’re great but not in any kind of romantic or sexual way.

I was into some rule 34 type hentai before that would sometimes involve Teen Titans, Kim Possible, and one comic involved the mom and daughter from the Incredibles but I was really only looking at it for the mom tbh. I think remembering that and thinking about that has only worsened my obsessing. But I’ve still never fantasized about children or wanted anything romantic or sexual with a child.

So, having read everything here, do you guys think I actually have anything to worry about or am I just obsessing over nothing? Also, for anyone that struggles with things like this, what do you recommend I do to keep from feeling so bad?",29Aug2018,32
59,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this (although this is my first Reddit post ever so I doubt many will see it) but I’ve just had a few questions about me for a while now that maybe people more educated in the mental health field could talk about with me. I’m a 16 year old male living in North Carolina, a place where parents aren’t really educated about mental health. Just a fair warning this post is gonna be a bit long. I’ve never had the chance to talk about this and I’m not sure what all I should mention and where I should start. The questions I have are referring to my emotional disconnect. When I was a child I remember being very emotional, where now my emotional state is very odd. I do laugh often but at the same time I don’t really fell attached to those closest to me. I have never cried at a funeral and, honestly, I can’t remember the last time I cried. Probably in 7th grade four years ago (I’m in 11th now). I have the feeling that if my best friends were to pass, I wouldn’t shed a tear. I wouldn’t say this frightens me, but it does make me consider if this is normal for people my age or for people in general. Before anyone asks, no I have never shown any violent tendencies to others or myself; I’m not a sociopath. So the question I want to ask, and have been asking myself for a while now, is is this something that I “have” such as a mental illness or deficiency in certain chemicals of the brain, or is this just a personality trait that makes me who I am? I would be more than happy to reply to people about experiences in my life that I have shown little emotion to and would appreciate comments or any sort of advice or help. Thank you for reading this far if you have. Have a good day/night. ",29Aug2018,8

I just want to get away from him because I am so angry but he kept following me to the car park I asked him not to follow me and go home. But he followed me all the way to my car and my anger exploded and then I say mean things to him I pushed him away I kicked him I was screaming. And then while driving halfway I stopped my car and ask him to get out because if he wouldn’t have followed me I wouldn’t explode and say mean things to him.

61,"For most of my adult life, I’ve had a lot of therapy from a bunch of different counselors.  Some were helpful and some were not.  But the more I grow and learn, the more I discover how disturbed I am.  Over the years, I have sometimes had the vague thought that it’s unusual for someone to be in therapy for so long.  But I never thought it was bad; My mental illness is like a large onion, and sometimes it seems like I’ll never get to the middle.  Or maybe it’s like a pile of tangled yarn, and we’re trying to pick it apart piece by piece.  It takes a good long time.  

But for the first time a couple months ago, someone (a counselor at a community clinic) told me that this is not good.  She said she works with clients for only twelve sessions!! 

Maybe things have been atypical for me because I was diagnosed late in life.  I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder at the age of 40, about two years ago.  What are your thoughts about this?  Is it bad that I've been in therapy for so many years?

I'm 34. I don't have a bad life or anything. But I feel like since I got my job almost 10 years ago absolutely nothing has changed, and nothing looks like it's going to change, and it's wearing on me.  


I got out of college and got this job around 25. and that's my story nothing else has happened since. I always thought if I did well, did a good job, I'd move up, get paid more. Buy a house. get married. But this past year I've kinda realized that, nothing has changed since II first started. my yearly raises barely cover inflation. I'm still in this same crappy apartment with thin walls and noisy neighbors. and while I could probably afford a house on paper, no significant savings for a down payment or for emergencies scares me, plus I think I'd lose almost all of my extra income for my hobbies that are the only thing helping to keep me going right now. If I was paid just a bit more I know I could afford it, and so I finally snapped at work and told my bosses in the spring I wanted a significant raise or I'd start looking for something else. I got vague answers along the lines of, we understand, we'll try to get you something at the end of the year. But I'm positive nothing is going to happen. I have looked around a bit at some other jobs, but the thing is I absolutely hate my career. I hate this field. I was kind of pushed into it by my parents, and in college it wasn't bad. But getting into it in the real corporate world, I've just learned I hate it a lot. And it's not something you can just mindlessly do, it's in IT, so it's constantly changing, needing to learn new things, which hating it so much I can't bring myself to want to learn it. and I think, if I could just have a better personal life in a nice home, or with someone I could spend time with I could deal with this frustrating job. but like I said, living alone in a crappy apartment. No prospects at all for a girlfriend. I've tried online dating sites, I've even asked some people out from work, but nothing.  


I've been pushed to my mental limits on all of this. I've had days going into work where I've been on the edge of giving my two weeks. I've thought about it a lot. read through company policies and tax laws. Even though it's a horrible financial move, I've seriously been considering quitting, cashing  out my 401k, and using that to just take a break from everything for awhile. Figure out what I want to actually do with my life and career, and possibly use it to invest in getting myself in a new direction. I know after penalty, taxes, and paying off what little debt I have I'd have enough to take up to two years off if I needed. But that's a lot of lost money for my retirement. But at this point I feel like it's probably for the best if it helps me get back into better mental health, and on track into a career I actually enjoy.",29Aug2018,2

After playing Beyond Two Souls, it really struck home for me. I have BPD, (amongst other things), as a result of genetics/environmental factors, and I'm finally at a point, where I can see my ""split""; The adult, the child. The only downside, is I can only observe from the outside, when I have my triggers. I try like hell to control myself, but I just still don't have the capacity to do it. I don't usually get to those places with friends, but constantly in romantic relationships, or somewhat infrequently against authority figures.

I can talk myself now out of some overthinking I used to do, but I still try to inject problems where they don't exist, and constantly over-analyze things. I also realized that when I am in a traumatic life circumstance, (loss of employment, something major), I begin to lean towards previous relationships, or thinking of current people of interest.

84,"Hello, everyone. I'll admit I do repost this every six months or so, but simply because it was a very well received comment that I believe covers a lot of ground and many people deserve to hear. 

I hope it is okay, but I've added a bunch of links to research and tools that I've created over the years, I run a mental and lifestyle health learning platform for young adults. You can join me over at r/conquertoday and introduce yourself and I'd love to give you any personal advice or support I can. 

**YES to therapy.** All of it. And not just the stuff that gives you tools on how to manage your depression, but the deep, deep childhood Jungian stuff. If I didn’t learn why I was how I was, and then go through this year of anger and sadness, and then take the necessary steps to change what I needed to change, I would never get out of the pit. Good therapy is swimming through the river of sh\*t so you can get to the dry bank on the other side.

**YES to medication.** It’s a booster, it won’t change everything. You might have more luck with mood stabilizers instead of anti-depressants. And, we are currently in an anti-depressant epidemic, so that always felt a little more comfortable for me. But that is just ego, don’t let it get to you.

**YES to regimented sleep.** I mean this. You know the word lunacy or lunatic? It comes from luna, the moon. And it’s because during full moons when we didn’t have fully dark homes would keep people up, and it would trigger mania in bipolar. If I sleep 5 hours, I’m a wreck. If I sleep 9 hours, I’m a wreck. I need 7-8 like clockwork, and it seriously takes me from a 2/10 to a 7/10. Do whatever you can to manage this: yellow light glasses, sleeping medication (stay away from benzo/opioids), job changes, anything. The studies on this keep on coming. [Here's a full guide](https://conquer.today/how-to-wake-up-early-by-biohacking/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=biohacking+sleep&amp;utm_content=biohacking+sleep&amp;utm_term=mental+health) of what I do, I write about this stuff a lot.

**YES to exercise.** It works, it works, it works. Don’t do sh\*t you hate: if you hate running, lift. If you hate lifting, do yoga. Do it, celebrate every workout, breathe in the endorphin freedom. [You can start with literally one exercise](https://conquer.today/best-full-body-exercise/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=burpee&amp;utm_content=burpee&amp;utm_term=mental+health) and grow from there.

**YES to finding self responsibility**. You will never heal without it. I recently talked to a woman with a 35-year-old bipolar son living back at home. I told her, “Sorry mom. I know you want to love him, and I know he is in pain, but he will never heal if he is still under mom’s roof.” It’s just how male psychology works. I know you are female, but there are equivalents to this; such as you saying losing your partner would be the end of it. I am absolutely in LOVE with my current partner. I feel the same way. But technically, I do not NEED her. She doesn’t feed me, or pay my bills, or organize my hiking trips (now if I didn’t have those, that’s another story…). So you must find self-reliance. You can, and you will.

**YES to long term goals and short term habits.** This is called Kaizen. Your small victories are not working because they aren’t going anywhere. I know we are told to celebrate the showers and the little stuff, and sometimes that helps, but you need to celebrate the showers because that means you are one step closer to X. Being self-reliant. Volunteering for a cause. Travelling. Getting in great shape. Start with your values, create a self-mission statement, set five year goals, and break those all the way down to literally what you have to do TODAY to reach it. Write one sentence of a book. Do one pushup. Now these things have meaning. [This is the 5-1-30 method](https://conquer.today/to-do-list-exercise?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=to+do+list+exercise&amp;utm_content=to+do+list+exercise&amp;utm_term=mental+health) I designed to help you build this game plan.

**YES to sobriety.** I don’t drink or smoke and I’m very bored and it sucks. But I am stable. And I don’t have breakdowns. And I don’t have binges. And it is so, so much better. You’ll find a whole new world of health and friendships to explore.

Do not flail your fists violently at depression. It is a fog, it cannot be beat that way. You must be calm, collected, slow and steady. You must wake up to good music, cook a good breakfast, get out the door. Get out the door, every single day. Go to a coffee shop and read, whatever.

You must confront your ineffective thoughts with questions. Not “I’m NOT a terrible person!” but, “OK, sure brain, I’m a terrible person. Here, I’m going to get up right now and knock this person’s coffee out of their hand because I’m terrible. Wait, of course I’m not going to do that. Can I really be terrible? Hm…” [Try the rubber band challenge,](https://conquer.today/change-your-outlook-on-life-forever-with-7-days-and-a-rubber-band/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=rubber+band+challenge&amp;utm_content=rubber+band+challenge&amp;utm_term=mental+health) simple but effective.

**YES to trusting others.** Everything I just said above, depression has given you reasons and excuses why it will not work. I’ve been there. “That’s all great, but…” You are in the fog so you can’t SEE. We can see you, though. I can see you be happy, healthy, stable, strong. I can see you get down like we all do, but knowing how to manage it correctly and knowing it will end.

91,"I started taking 10mg of Lexapro in 2013 and it literally saved my life. I was in such a dark, scary place and was struggling with the way that I was feeling (anxious, panicky, spacey, disconnected). I came home from college to see a doctor who put me on 10mg of Lexapro. I swear to you, I IMMEDIATELY started to feel better. I was finally myself again and I was thrilled. I was on 10mg up until earlier this year when I started getting anxious again. For clarification, I did occasionally get anxious on Lexapro, but I felt normal and my anxious periods were quick and painless. My doctor prescribed Prozac in addition to Lexapro, but I was apprehensive. She said that Prozac would help with my OCD, something that my Lexapro didn't. I was apprehensive mainly because I believe that you should only take medicine if it's truly necessary and also because of the potential interactions between the two. I started working with a hormone specialist because I have PCOS/hypothyroidism aka my hormones could be making me anxious. It's still new and I've started to feel better, but I'm not 100%. I'm wondering if my hormones being out of whack could be the cause of my recent anxiety, but I get anxious when I feel so anxious and spacey like this. Could I have built up a tolerance to my medication, or could my hormones really be affecting me this much? I don't want to stop taking it because it's helped me so much for the past few years and the potential side effects scare me. My recent anxiety has come after graduating college and just being in the real world.",29Aug2018,1
92,"Hi all. I'm looking for some suggestions. My girlfriend struggles with self-esteem and it leads to immense anxiety. In particular, she worries about her career and her job prospects. Just thinking about job applications can make her cry. Sadly, this poor self-worth has led her to not want to celebrate her upcoming birthday, as she doesn't think she deserves to.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to give her a meaningful birthday that reminds her of how great and valuable she is. I was wondering if anyone has insight into what kind of things I could do for her that might help reinforce how valued she is by her friends/family? It's a fine line between triggering her and helping her, and I want to be able to do something that reinforces how valuable she is without making her feel like she is unworthy and punishing herself.",29Aug2018,3

Life just doesn't feel real for me anymore.
I know it is real, it just feels like I cant really interact with it as if I'm disconnected from it all like a pair of Bluetooth headphones trying to connect to your phone but never pairing for longer then a handful of minutes whatever that is. Idk I wish I was living rather than existing.
 
I suspect I have anxiety and depression and have seen a doctor about it which was hard for me to do as a young kid(male). I feared to be seen as weak which just seems dumb now, but after working up the courage to go  I was just given a letter with a list of places to contact for help which was disappointing in the moment because all that courage i built up telling my family was a waste of time I could of just done what I've always done Look it up on Google.

I reckon my long journeys to and from work,school and college plus my internet use over the years have screwed me up. For the last 7 years I have been on some sort of public transport for a minimum of 2 hours a day every day (minus weekends daa) and when I do get home I just end up on YouTube or playing a game. 

I have a decent apprenticeships. A very small group of friends (not to close). No girlfriend or hobbies. I do smoke weed in and out but it's very little amounts and max once a week but I still think it's a factor.  Tbh I'm just living day by day I don't get the point of it all, why do people try? I remember being so happy and excited as a kid. I can conjure that energy now and then but it feels fake. 

I think I just lack real meaning in my life I've been on autopilot mode for too long. I'm just curious what gives others  meaning in there lifes and any advice would be nice.

96,"Hi. Struggling with the idea of being on an SSRI. My doctor prescribed me Citalopram before I could even finish listing my symptoms - originally went in due to panic attacks. I thought it’d be an Ativan RX or him telling me I needed a lifestyle change. 

In reading online all the Citalopram reviews sound superficial, and the list of side affects is terrible...I really like bonin’ and it sounds like it’s a consistent downside (decreases sex drive.)

98,"I love my girlfriend to pieces and she’s not herself lately. She has been through some very bad situations in the past years, including a violent ex boyfriend who was the reason she lost her baby at 3month pregnancy. Also criminal men chasing her, beating her up mentally, she was stabbed and raped twice, drugged with heroin (she become an addict because of it but she is clean for half a year now) alongside with many bad stuff. She already been to court and those men are paying for it. But recently she is not leaving her bed, she hardly eats or goes out, only when she needs to work (only 3 days a week, in the mornings). She drinks a lot everyday, blacks out from it and the next day it’s the same all over again. I feel helpless. She has depression and anxiety since she is 14 (we’re both 22). I can’t tell if she is having an alcohol problem, or if she is hitting a downfall from all the stuff that happened to her, she has always been a fighter and she prefers to cave in and not face the pain, that’s her coping mechanism. But now that things are getting better is a bit weird. So I’m clueless. She doesn’t want to do anything but be in bed with drinks. She doesn’t want  help. I don’t know what to do. Thank you to the people who read all of this, I’m really worried and scared, she is the love of my life and I don’t want to lose her now, after everything we been through together.

99,"I’ve been terrified of death and dying my whole life. When I was little, I used to cry for hours over the fact that one day all my friends and family were going to die. When I was a teenager, I was both chronically suicidal and cripplingly terrified of death, so much so I could keep myself awake for days because of the anxiety of it.

I’m 22 now. For years, I’ve gone through phases where death and dying are all I can think about all the time, I always hope that if I think about it enough then I’ll be able to come to terms with it but that hasn’t happened. I’m so stressed and anxious that I’m starting to lose my hair, my skin is horrible no matter what I do to it, and my weight is fluctuating like crazy. I have vivid dreams nearly every time that usually involve me losing my mind and either acting completely insane or hurting people.

I’m currently on medication and I’ve been in and out of DBT therapy over the past two years, but none of that seems to help with this. The thing is, is I’m not depressed and for quite a lot of the time I feel fine; but when I realise that I’m going to die and there’s nothing I can do about it, that it’s completely out of my control, I get so anxious and spiral so hard that I can’t come out of it for sometimes days at a time. I get so scared it makes me feel sick and I have been sick as a result of being of afraid. 

I don’t know what to do. What can I even do in a situation like this? It’s not like it’s a problem that can be solved, I just want to be less afraid.",29Aug2018,18
100,"Hello all.

I have a question. I'm an adult who manages a business set up by my parents. We have a skilled accountant who handles the business taxes. I normally do my own taxes, but my mom has told me to have the accountant do my taxes because he'd do a better job (and he would).

This would be fine, but I am a little worried about my privacy. I am receiving therapy (and let me make absolutely clear that I pay for therapy out of my OWN pocket—I'm not secretly using business funds for it or anything). As a very private person, I don't feel comfortable telling the rest of my family about this. I have spent a fair amount, though I think it has been worthwhile.

Would the accountant tell my family? Again, I'm paying for it with my own bank account, so there's nothing illicit going on here. I suspect accountants are typically expected to keep their client's information private, but I'm worried that he might think that me getting therapy is a sign of instability, and that he needs to inform my family. He seems like a nice enough guy, but he does come across as a bit ""old school"".

It's probably not a huge deal (one of my problems is that I get super-anxious about weird things). My mom is leery about therapy, but I don't think she'd be mad about me getting it. I've done a good job with the business. Still, I'd rather keep this to myself. Does anyone have advice on how this works? Honestly, I'd prefer not to tell the accountant. This means I won't be able to put the therapy as a tax deductible expense (I've heard you can do this), but I can afford the hit. But if I show him my bank statement, he might wonder what the checks are for (the statement only lists the amount of the check).

Thanks.",29Aug2018,1

I’m not very familiar with this reddit, but I need advice. I have a counselor, just started medication yesterday, but I’m afraid I won’t be good enough for schooling, as it were.

&amp;#x200B;

I unofficially have psychotic depression, my psychiatrist and counselor's estimation – psych eval pending. I have delusions. Hallucinations.

&amp;#x200B;

Just earlier today, I was heading into my science lecture with my coffee for the first day. As soon as I walk in, I thought I saw a familiar face, Adam (fake name; they’re all fake names). I stared hard at him but could not place this faceless old man. I asked if it was him, immediately apologized, and sat at a different seat near a faceless girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

She looked my way and said, “You got your coffee now, huh?” 

&amp;#x200B;

I smiled, nodded, and asked the faceless girl’s name. She told me her name was Kate, and I immediately saw her face. She told me she remembered me from the science lab class we have together (the two are taken in conjunction, so same classmates). She remembered I was sad I couldn’t have my coffee during the lab, but asked why I wasn’t sitting next to Adam like before.

&amp;#x200B;

I scanned the class carefully. The faceless old man vaguely resembled Adam until he shot me a “What the fuck?” look. It was definitely Adam. We’ve been friends for two years. I couldn’t recognize Adam’s face – anybody’s face. Students were staring at me. I was entirely embarrassed and left class a half hour after it started.

This isn’t the first time I’ve had this in public, but usually it’s ignored, or unnoticed. It's happened around friends who I can talk to, or I’m around strangers and have learned not to care if they think I'm crazy. But this is college.

As the title may suggests, I have a partner that suffers mental illness. 

I’ve been with her for almost more than a year &amp; I am deeply in love with her, &amp; (blessedly) she admits to feeling the same.

104,"First off, I'd like to apologize in advance if any of my thoughts seem incoherent, I'm not really good at expressing my thoughts/feelings, but I've seen a lot people get some really good help/advice on Reddit, so I thought I'd give it a go.

So I'm a 19 year old male and I haven't seen a doctor or therapist about this, but since I'd say around December 2017 I started getting really bad stomach cramps. And I'm already a really introverted person, but I started isolating myself from a lot of my friends (we still talk, I just don't really have the energy to strike a conversation or my mind will wander off and I'll forget to text them back). Some days I'll wake up feeling really positive but while I'm getting ready my mind just gets hazy and and I just start feeling completely demotivated. And just recently, which leads me to think I'm severely depressed, when I get ready to go to sleep, I start feeling super nervous and it's like an orchestra is just is just going crazy with their instruments inside my head. 

But I'd say the biggest issue above all of that is I want to talk about this with my friends and family but every time i think about what to say, the words just get all skewed in my head, and the same applies with just normal conversations. I talked to my best friend about it as much as I could but I understand he's no expert on the subject but I appreciate the fact he's there to lend an ear.As I'm writing this I feel I kind of got off subject but I hope that this all makes sense to y'all",29Aug2018,0
