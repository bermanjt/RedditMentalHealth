0,"I worry. A lot. Over things that sometimes are serious, and sometimes things that just aren't. Most of time it's not an issue in my day to day routine, but there are times where I can't stop thinking about how something I've done is going to cause everything ive done in my personal life to come crashing down.

I keep reliving things that I should have let go of:

I still have flashbacks to when I split up with my girlfriend a year and a half ago and all the events that led up to it. It was a rough breakup, but I have since gotten back together with her, and we are now engaged, and I'm thrilled about it, but that night still haunts me.

I also have flashbacks to when I found out I lost my previous job, and all the events of me finding out I was fired. But I have a much better job now, which I'm happy about, but I still relive that event so often.

There are times that I have thoughts that I can't let go of. There are times like right now where I'm rehashing what I guess you could call a fight between me and my fiance, and it's so tiring mentally, because I can't manage to reassure myself that everything will be okay. I really dont think she is as upset with me as I think she is (I know it doesn't make sense to say), but I'm worried that I messed up a lot more than I likely have.

Its mentally draining to have to deal with this. And I feel like I need someone to talk to. Maybe it's just me, or maybe there is an underlying reason, but I just want to understand why I'm like this...

2,"So this is my first post, but I'm diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and anxiety. I was prescribed Risperdal when I was 15 (22 now) but never took it. (thankfully I didn't bc turns out that medication was causing guys to get man boobs)
I haven't been to a doctor since I was 17 besides my ER visit last November. I believe I may have adhd but not entirely sure, but I wanna see if Adderall or some other medication might help me.
I say I think I may have adhd bc I can never focus on anything. When ever someone talks to me, they'll say something and it'll remind me of a show or something and I'm so eager to tell them about it I don't even pay attention to what they're saying.
 I love to draw but almost never go back to a unfinished drawing or I'll just rush through it to get it over with.
It basically feels like a bunch of little ""Me's"" are running around my head trying to do everything at once. Sometimes it feels like the opposite bc I wanna get as many things done at once so I can do nothing for the rest of the day. Idk my brain is bonkers atm

Would I just go to a normal doctor? Also I have crappy insurance that does nothing, how much would a normal visit run? And will getting prescribed medication affect getting any jobs/careers in the future. But I was PDQd from the marines with my disorders, which is understandable

3,"i've been on antidepressants for 4 yrs and have gone on/off to therapy as a conditional thing @ certain clinics. the clinics that prescribed me my meds required clients to attend therapy if they wanted to continue meds. ive also had my primary care physician prescribe me my meds when i couldnt afford going back to the behavioral health clinic for meds and therapy. 

i know, i know meds are supplementary and therapy + meds = magic but sometimes i am just not able to do therapy. i go through bouts of being able to be open in therapy and sometimes wanting to just sit there and guard myself from my own feelings and deny that i am not okay. i just want to know if anyone had similar experiences or any other general comments. 

sometimes i even just attend therapy w/o wanting to say anything but then again, it was the mandatory therapy that i had to attend just b/c i needed my meds. last year my former clinic dropped me b/c i physically/emotionally could not leave the house for therapy and went through zoloft withdrawal and let me tell you... it was so fucking bad.",01Aug2018,1

I feel like there is a massive rift in my reality. I looked up my boyfriends 2 usernames that I know of and found coincidences over coincidences. Those accounts are connected to a platform called Questionable Quest and another one (forgot the name). Sometimes my pattern recognition goes crazy. I am worried that there is something like a game, Harem King(?), to have many girls or something which he participates in. 
We recently have increased trust issues, and all this instability is turning me into a person I don't like. I genuinely love(d?) my boyfriend, but now I'm scared that this is just another loop of the same behaviour and I'm being played. I can't tell if my alarm bells are correct or if I'm panicking.

He did not react as I had hoped to my questions (I clumsily and very certainly scary incoherently asked him), but if I'm wrong this must be terribly difficult for him.

6,"My  nephew was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder. My elderly parents are raising him and I am constantly worried about them - he is  extremely manipulative and although he doesn't hit them, he enjoys  upsetting them and torturing them emotionally. He once told them that  keeping them upset was more fun than going to an amusement park. We  recently started going through his internet search history and found  that he had been looking up videos online about animal abuse, animal  torture, people drowning dogs, medieval torture methods, etc. He's only  11. My parents are not very good with computers, so I had to put all of  the computers on lockdown and set up parental controls.

We've  never actually seem him torture or hurt an animal - but I'm wondering  if his behavior sounds more like Conduct Disorder than ODD? Or is common  for kids with ODD to have a fascination with the idea of torture?",01Aug2018,1
7,"I had a bad mental health day at work today.  I am tapering one of my psych meds right now, and I was unable to control my emotions. I started crying during a meeting with my director.  It wasn’t really the topic of the conversation that had me crying, I just have been on edge and on the verge of tears for the last few weeks.  This weekend I had to take benzos to be calm enough to leave my apartment.

I told my boss I had to leave after I cried for awhile in the bathroom, and she was not happy.  She said it wasn’t okay for me to leave at first and then changed her mind after she realized it was only 15 minutes before the end of my day.  All my coworkers were staring at me and I wasn’t thinking straight.  :(  

I luckily work at a social services agency so they are somewhat understanding, but having this happen at work makes me feel worse than I do already.  This isn’t the first time it’s happened, but it’s been about 8 months since the last time.

I’ve had friends give me advice that I should either give a doctor’s note asking for a leave of absence, or asking for at least more flexible hours while I’m feeling the effects of my withdrawal from meds.  My husband doesn’t understand what the point of me getting a doctor’s note would be, and he thinks something bad could come of me addressing the situation in this way.  

Anyone have any advice or experience with this kind of thing?  This is my first serious job, and I’m unsure of how to navigate my sickness and trying to not get fired for my emotions wrecking me.

Thanks in advance for any advice!

9,"I’m so sad all of the time and i don’t know why, i feel like i’m grieving a loss but no one around me has died and i just feel like a use to no one.
I’ve never been unpopular, but my whole life is avoiding people that i know and avoiding placing myself in situations where i have to speak to people. I’m so sick of feeling like this and the last time i can remember feeling happy is a year and a half ago and i miss the feeling so much. I’m constantly dissatisfied with my life and i feel like whatever i do won’t fill this gaping hole and i don’t know what to do.
I just feel like i’m a use to no one and people dislike having me around, i get paranoid that people talk about my flaws and i feel like i have no one to talk to who understands what i’m going through in my mind. I can’t put it to words the sort of shit that goes through my mind. I’m so sick of anyone i admit how i feel to just telling me to cheer or up or something as if it’s that simple.

10,"So after being down for idek how long I started to feel better in myself. After friends, family and even my doctor said I should find someone that I can trust and open up to, with this I found someone I felt at home with and began ‘dating’ someone. we would talk every day and see each other a few times a week over the course of a month and a bit, all of a sudden they say they need to step away “to grow as an individual” and  now rarely talk to me or just blank me. 
From being super happy and everyone questioning my sudden increase in happiness, I’ve sunk straight back into the void I was in 7 months ago, feeling like I can no longer invest or open up to someone again due to it being too gut wrenching when it suddenly crumbles. I was sceptical at first as I’ve experienced this before but I wanted to make the effort in hopes it wouldn’t, I now realise I got way too invested...

11,"Tl;dr. 33m struggled with depression in the past, trying desperately to falling deeper into a low.  With work, family issues, marital troubles, my head is gigantic mess. I'm on meds, decently healthy, and work out at least 5 hours a week.

I have a history with depression.  I finally bounced back about 2 years ago. Lost my previous job year  and a half ago from my performance decline I couldn't recover from.  

Past:
I am married, my wife for some reason clings on and doesn't want to admit defeat even though it would be better for her.  When we got married, my depression was controllable.  After we moved in (her christian parents said it's a sin to do so before marriage), it started getting worse.  I'm a big picture person,if the whole is not presentable, I cannot concentrate on details.  She is detail oriented, the entire kitchen can be covered with opened mail but the 1/2in coffee stain is WW3.  This coupled with my job getting worse lead to drinking then to me swallowing a bottle of antidepressants. 

Present: I'm pretty sure I don't want kids,she has to have them. I tell her I can't guarantee I want to have them as I'm too selfish and I'm scared that I may slip again and traumatize them.

This plus I'm am idiot that can't focus worth a shit and always misses major details on everything I do.  I tried 3 different ADHD medications, none of then helped.  I'm just stupid and cannot focus.

I had a headhunter call me for an interview a month ago and have been looking at the position.  Its closer to home and may pay better.  I don't want to leave my current spot because they have never treated me poorly.

14,"This is a comment I posted on a thread, but thought I gotta say out loud on here. Maybe it can help someone, or maybe it can help myself.

First, to everyone on here.

I hope you know that you are brave, to take the first steps in trying to become stronger and seek help. You are on the right path, it just takes time. The struggles and sadness you might feel right now are just stepping stones for you to get closer to your goal.

For me, I have been looking down on myself for a long time. I was once bullied and also was taught a way of thinking that never really made me feel like I am an useful human being.  
Once, I was about to take a shower when I suddenly noticed something. I stared at my reflection, all my pores, scars, all the details on my face - the details that make up myself. I look real, funny as it might sounds. I am the same as the people out there who I love, adore, sympathize with, acknowledge, and try to be as compassionate as possible with.

I treat myself like a jerk.

From then on, I tried not to do so anymore. Another ridiculous thing is, when I do not love myself enough, I criticize myself. Basically: I hate myself for hating myself.

That is such a vicious circle.

Nowadays I accept the times when I cannot love myself enough as a momentary weakness that serves as a stepping stone to my future mental healthiness. I think that's much better. I even organized a workshop in my local area with this message, named ""What about me?"" - the question I want everyone to ask in their lives so as not to leave themselves starved of self-love and self-compassion.

I wish you all in this thread health and well-being, my fellow ""thinkers"" - as I would like to call those who just think a bit more than others. ",01Aug2018,3

Them being depressive disorder, an attachment disorder, anxiety, and some other shit. But recently I've been thinking about something and it just doesn't seem normal I guess. So I lost my virginity (with someone he same age and it was consensual) at the age of 6/7 but I knew what to do. Like I knew what sex was and how it worked and I find it odd that I knew that in such detail at that age. I don't remember learning it and I never had formal sex education and it's not like an adult would've just told me about it. I can't find anyway in which it's plausible that I knew that much about it unless something had already happened, which I've now blocked out of my memory or something.

16,"#Hallucinations?  
*As a child (7-8 years old) I heard a disembodied deep and loud laugh, but I couldn't identify where it was coming from. It came from nowhere. Was definitely not any family members. I thought it might be coming from a CD that was playing, but I never found anything. It scared me a bit.

*I saw two solid black figures, on separate occasions. They did the same thing, peer around the room from the doorway. *(I consider that more paranormal than psychotic)*

*Last month, I had an experience. I was with my parents at Lowes, and, it seemed like the employees were fixated at me.  
I walked past the entrance, and two guys in the distance stopped and turned watching me go in. One guy in particular locked my gaze stared intently as he walked past. It seemed like all of them looked at me as I passed.

It happened after a stressful college interview. I didn't feel strange that day. I didn't feel delusions like I was being persecuted, just perplexed at how bizarre it was. Was I imagining it, or were people really looking at me?

#Delusions?  
*As a 14 year old, I had thoughts that this book I wanted to write was cosmically important, because it would be a message that would trigger the ascension of humanity, and I had to get it out before 2012 (because of that world-is-ending thing), because that's when it would happen. If I didn't, I'd miss my chance forever. I honestly didn't take it too seriously. I had the thoughts, and then forgot about them quickly.

*As a 15 year old, something innocuous happened, I made a minor mistake, and then I thought, ""this must be the government controlling my actions. They're wirelessly implanting chips in me to control me, they didn't want me to type this."" Again, I didn't take it very seriously after thinking it, it didn't become something I acted out in my life.

*There was a day I was really freaked out that Asians could read minds. Some part of me was convinced they all knew, but were hiding it. I was gauging their facial expressions, and if they'd react, it would confirm my beliefs. I was just freaked out in general. And again, I quickly dismissed these thoughts, and it's not a belief of my.

*Thought broadcasting, though, is something I struggled with. It's a more subtle influences of emotions and ideas, which you think are your own, not hearing thoughts. My sister confirmed to me that my ""thoughts were loud"". She asked a question, and knew I was lying.  
When I was 16/18, it started to interfere with my day to day life, as it made me super uncomfortable. I knew on some level it was ridiculous, but on the other, my emotional reaction to it...was convinced. I would hold my breath, and avoid doing certain things, because I thought people were picking up on those signals and would know.  
It's much better these days. I challenge the belief. I'm still kind of affected by the belief though.

A disclaimer on the last one, my family members have a lot of odd beliefs (my sister thought she could fly once, a couple others obviously believe in broadcasting), so maybe I only have that belief because of environment.

#Functioning problems  
*I've never really felt much happiness/passion from anything, and I've always been asocial, and isolated from people because of where I live, so no changes there.

* I do struggle with no motivation. I consciously want to do it, but can't make myself.

*I have major insomnia, since I was 15. Long periods of not being able to sleep until the sun comes up. I sleep maybe 3-4 hours a night.

*There was a 2-week period where I forgot what I was saying mid-sentence.

*It suddenly became harder to talk at 19, like my brain won't participate. I ramble at first, and then I have to stop and really try to think about what I'm saying, giving order to the words, otherwise I'll just blabber.


I'm 21, female. I'm told my grandmother was institutionalized in a psych ward, don't know what for (I don't know if it's true). My father had bipolar apparently, and so does my sister. I've dealt with depression/suicide in the past.

I'm going to college in a couple of weeks, and I know it freaks me out. Every time I'm on a college campus I lose my appetite, so I'm worried that the stress is going to cause me an eating disorder, or trigger a psychotic break.

Suddenly, the world is ending. The mechanic doesn't open until 7 and I have nobody to help me, so I'll have to drive it there and then uber to work, but if it's going to take more than a day, I'll need to rent a car because I have to drive around for work on Thursday, so instead I'll have to uber to a car rental place, which opens at 7:30, and then somehow get to work by 8. I can't use the excuse that I was late because of car trouble because I used that excuse last week when my battery died and they're going to think I am lying. Also, what if I don't have enough money for my repairs/rental since I don't have a credit card and I don't have much savings due to several recent emergencies and I don't have anyone to fall back on. 

Now I'm panicking and I have to wake up early tomorrow if I want to get my car into the shop and I won't be able to fall asleep and what if I lose my job over this. 

Now I'm angry because everyone else I know has a support system for this kinda shit. A partner or a family to fall back on for help. I have nobody.

19,"I feel like I can't move on until I identify what is going on with my brother. Have you heard of anything that describes this? Have you met anybody like this? I've never met anyone like him and it sucks that I feel so alone about it.

My brother, two years younger than me, has made my and my parents' lives very difficult. Since we were little, he would beat me up on a daily basis. He would go from calm to hell demon in 0.5 seconds. Anything would provoke him and he would seriously hurt me. He was also very spoiled as a child because whenever he wanted something he would raise hell until my parents would give him what he wanted. If they didn't, he would keep on screaming, hitting, and hurting them until they did. He never did well in school and was a summer school regular. His teachers asked my mom to send him to be evaluated but my mother preferred to be in denial than to ruin her perfect image of her little boy. So many times we had to lock him or ourselves out in order to be out of his wrath's reach. I had three locks on my bedroom door so that he couldn't reach me. He would chase me with hammers and try to knock the locks off my door to get to me. I was so scared of him. As a kid he kicked my friend between her legs in her private parts and that devastated me. He violently threw something at his pediatrician, called her the worst doctor ever and we were charged because of that incident. He said that if we got a dog he would train it to attack me. He would use violent threats to try and control me. The last time he hurt me was when I called the police on him finally. He was very picky about his food and that caused him to be very underweight. He was obsessed with his violent video games and became engrossed by them, taking time away from  his sleep, studies, food, and family. He never joined us for family activities. It always hurt my feelings because I would see how much pain it caused my parents. No matter what I did, I couldn't cheer my parents up either. I could never be perfect enough for them. It didn't matter. His damage was always greater than any good I could create. Anyways, when he started college he entered a deep depression, hardly ate, only played video games, and hardly slept. He then had a suicide attempt.

Fast forward four years later, he is now a lot physically healthier. Hasn't shown violent behavior since he was sixteen. However this is the behavior I am now noticing; It may have always been there but because I've had some distance maybe I'm only noticing it now. He is very forgetful about significant events. He always forgets birthdays, mother's day, father's day. He seems very slow, not sharp at all. We call him to remind him about special days and and he goes ""oh yea I forgot"". All he thinks about is video games, and his world revolves around him. He lacks SO much empathy. I can't help but to feel rage when I am around him. He doesn't really understand social norms and what are okay topics to talk about. Sometimes it feels like he lacks a consciousness. As if he is not capable of higher level thinking: consequences to actions, how do my actions make people feel, is there something I can do to brighten someone's day, thoughts about thoughts. He has trouble forming sentences that gets his point across. He often mumbles, and you can't understand him. I just feel like if there is a reason, a name, a diagnosis to his behavior maybe I can accept him and all that shit that happened and I can move on. It is so hard for me to accept that that was normal. My parents told me that it was. But how could is be normal when so clearly it was the worst time of my life. I know that for my own sanity I need to move on, but I am so stuck on trying to understand what is/was wrong with him.

I am still trying to recover from feeling in danger all the time. That torture happened since he was four until I started college. And even then, the feeling of something bad happening to me always followed. I had persistent nightmares of him hurting me and my friends. I always thought my brother was going to kill me one day, and to a certain extent I feel that still. When he comes to visit I always lock my door now. If I have a family in the future, I hesitate ever visiting him. I always catch myself in situations where people take advantage of my kindness and start to bully me. My childhood was SO hard for me. My dad was an alcoholic. My mom was paranoid, depressed, and anxious all the time. As a CHILD, she would confide in me about her marital problems and about all the times she felt like killing herself. No one took care of my emotional health. I had to take care of everybody to make sure I had SOME sense of stability. And now when there are difficult situations, I often find myself carrying the burden because I feel it is my duty to carry the pain.

I guess this turned out to be a vent more than anything. I was reminded of the hurt he has caused us and it brought up a lot of emotions and memories.",01Aug2018,2
20,"Since I was 16 I've had bouts of tinnitus caused by stress. I keep seeing audiologists who say my ears are literally perfect and my hearing is much above average and I can hear frequencies most people can't (eg. mosquito ringtone, wi-fi routers and infrasound).

However I always notice that when evening approaches so does my tinnitus. As soon as I wake up I go into a quiet room and it's gone. I get weirdly stressed out at night and I've always been this way, and it's self-propagating. I often get to a point where I go without sleep for a while and kinda pass out in bed.

Sedatives basically get rid of it when they kick in and make me truly relax but I can't keep taking benzos and need tolerance breaks and they also destroy my memory. 

Lately my stress has been bad and I find myself clenching my jaw a lot. My mother's been in an abusive relationship with this man who keeps lying to her, insulting her out of no where on purpose and causing her stress.

When I was 1 my mom said that she was laying in bed and had her door open in case I started crying bc my room was down the hall. At some point in the night my mom hears the cat scream really loud then a tall dark figure rushes down the hall to my room and my mom just hears me scream really loud. That night we went to my grandmas house and when we came back to get our stuff and the windows and doors were wide open and the cat was gone. 

When I was 2 we lived in a different house and my mom was in the living room and I was in my room and over the baby monitor my mom just heard me laughing and talking to someone, she probably just assumed I was playing with my toys so she wasn't concerned. Then all of a sudden she starts hearing a deep gravely voice responding to me and laughing as well. When she came to check on me, she saw that I was alone. 

When I was 3-4 we were in yet again, another house, and I was outside while my mom was doing yard work or something and I started talking to myself, my mom was sorta used to this by now so she just walked over and asked who I was talking to. To which I responded, ""the man in the tall hat"" and pointed to the stairs. After this we moved in with my grandma. 

When I was 4 we were staying with my grandma. Her husband had recently passed from a heart attack, I had known him since I was born but I didn't understand that he was dead. I would occasionally see him walking down the hallway, or around in the kitchen. He had a workshop in the basement where I also had a play area. Every now and then one of the drawers on his tool dresser would fly open and sometimes a random tool would just fall off his work table. Every now and then a book or a CD would fall off the bookcase in the dining room and they were always ones that he liked to read and the CD that most often fell was the one that contained the song played at my grandma and grandpas wedding. My grandma was still mourning in his loss and we eventually moved out. 

When I was 5 we lived in a different house, at this house. At this house we had a bunch of trees everywhere and I was climbing one of them one day when all of a sudden I saw this teenage boy. He was covered in blood and looked very frail but I didn't think much of it. Being a typical 5 year old I said ""hey, why do you look so funny?"" Which was kinda rude but when he responded he sounded kinda surprised and kept asking if I could hear him. I guess he wasn't able to talk to anyone. 

When I was 5 and a half we moved across the country to live closer to my moms dad. In the new house I felt extremely uncomfortable. The first day there I got really sick for no reason, my mom said it was jet lag or something to do with being in an airplane, but I just didn't feel right. Stuff would occasionally fall off my dresser or my shelf. I would hear my name being called from a different room only to discover that no one was in there. I would see tall dark figures peak out from behind walls and stare at me only to shy away when I met their gaze. This went on for a very long time and we moved again when I was 12. 

When I was 12 we moved again. In this house I felt safer but still uneasy. I didn't have any experiences for the first few months but after a while I found myself blindly walking around holding conversations with only myself, I would hear people talking in the other room only to find no one there. I heard laughter coming from no where, I heard a deep voice talking to me and I began seeing figures follow me in my day to day life. I would see faceless people in the grocery store and I began blacking out at random times and tuning back in unable to remember what happened. One time I woke up in a cold shower with all my clothes on another time I woke up with pills in my hand. At this point I began going to see a therapist and from there I saw a psychiatrist. I've had varying diagnoses from schizophrenia to stress/depression induced psychosis. 

I was put on anti psychotics and no matter how high the dose was nothing changed. I still heard voices and saw things. I even began to think my food was being poisoned and that the fluoride in the water was being used to brainwash me. I became bulimic in eighth grade and lost a lot of weight. I began meditation for other things like depression, anxiety, mood, insomnia, adhd but I never saw improvements. In freshman year it got to the point that I was unable to hold conversations and my words became so clustered and mumbled that I found myself having to repeat myself multiple times to the same person. In sophomore year I was hospitalized for a day for suicidal ideation. A few months later I began to get worse and worse. I began online school at the end of freshman year and for the first semester sophomore year. Second semester I went back to public school. I started off okay, but during the end of April and early May something just snapped. I became very lethargic and was no longer able to eat meals. I ate barely enough to get through the day. In a three week period I lost 20 pounds. I started hanging out with not so great people and started burning myself. The grand finale was when I was at school. I started tremoring really bad out of no where and I couldn't respond when people were trying to talk to me, sometimes not even hearing them. At one point I blacked out a snapped back to my teacher sitting next to me trying to get my attention because class had ended. I went to the next class and all I remember is putting my head down, when I came to I was in a completely different class and the only people there were my two friends and the teacher. The bell had rang for the end of the day so I went outside to find my mom. I got in the car and we went to a conference with the school district office to talk about GED classes but I don't remember what they were saying all I remember is hearing this deep growl and static. 

We got back in the car to go home and I started tremoring again. My mom noticed and I ended up blacking out again and waking up in the emergency room surrounded by nurses. I was in the ER for a week and a half being held in a crisis room with no windows, forced to wear paper clothes and had nothing to do but wait for food. I began refusing my medication completely while admitted because I was convinced they were making me worse. At one point in the night I felt something tugging on my ear so I turned around and saw a tall dark figure staring directly at me with the creepiest grin I've ever seen. During this stay I blacked out multiple times and started having intense visions of people dying and committing suicide. 

At the end of the week and a half I was sent to a youth mental hospital that was three hours away for two and a half weeks, at this point I was no longer experiencing withdrawals and I was actually improving mentally. I started gaining weight back. When I got to the youth hospital the psychiatrist there wanted to put me on a different anti psychotic. After telling him my previous experience with anti psychotics he said we would closely monitor my mood and behavior and stop the medication if I got worse. I started getting worse and we stopped. He instead had me take supplements and had me take a medication for my ADHD to help me focus. So after a month in the hospital I finally went home. Yeah I still see and hear things but no where near as intense. 

Let me know your thoughts because this is just really weird to me. I'm wondering if the build up to being hospitalized was caused by the amount of medications I was on or maybe it was something different I don't know. What are your thoughts?",01Aug2018,2

31,I was with him a total of 4 years. Emotional abuse started right away. Physical abuse after 2 and a half years. I am 26 and live in a major city. It's been almost 3 months since the divorce. I recently went on my first date. I was so nervous and scared. It went horrible. I cried about it and I'm scared I dont have the backbone anymore to be with men. Even in friendly situations I am afraid of men that I have known for some time. There are hardly any men at my work. The only guy I can stand right now is my ex-boyfriend from high school.

32,"To start off, I've just graduated highschool this summer. I've been feeling lonely, confused, and like I just don't now what to do anymore. I'd rather sit inside and be alone than go out. Two of my friends had their graduation parties not long ago and I didn't even attend. I've been friends with one of them since middle school and the other since I was a sophomore. Life feels bland. In the past couple of months I've definitely had suicidal thoughts but I haven't thought about acting on them.

In 10th grade my bestfriend since preschool died and he was always there for me. I always felt connected to him as we were so alike. I was bullied in elementary school for a couple years and I felt like he was always such a good friend. He was extremely meaningful to me.  2016 was stressful because I lost my bestfriend and around that same time other things were going  on. At 16 I was getting into drugs and I got caught up because my parents figured everything out and I was secluded from friends because they thought some of them were toxic and they also wanted to be good parents. Around this time I was dating a girl who ended up breaking up with me. 

So. I feel like after all of these things happend I've been going through spouts of depression and I wish I had someone to guide me or some type of help.. I don't know why I feel like I do or what to even do. I feel like I've changed and obviously life changes and gets confusing but I'm not even sure if I like who I've changed into. I hope I don't spiral into a deep depression because it scares me. ",01Aug2018,4

I suffer from a form of paranoid psychosis, this has been especially bad in the last year due to certain events that somewhat caused a mental breakdown.

45,"Hi everyone! I don't really use Reddit, mainly just browse sometimes, but recently I've been getting more and more worried about my mom, and I wanted some outside opinions. 

She's always been a fairly anxious person, and as she's gotten older, has progressively gotten more paranoid about things too. It started off as pretty normal stuff, like always keeping the doors and windows locked and putting her laptop away in a locked drawer when she wasn't using it and was going to leave the house, stuff like that. Overly cautious at times maybe, but hey, not so cautious if someone actually tried to rob the place. 

But over time it's started to get worse. I haven't been living at home so I didn't realise how bad it was getting until I came home to visit. Normally, my mom lives alone. 

Lately she's been convinced that the neighbours are plotting against her; as in, she thinks they want to steal the house, that they've broken in while she's not home (even though there's no evidence of this or of anything being taken), and most of all, that they're always talking about her and she can somehow hear them from inside the house. In particular she talks about ""Steph"" and ""Steve"", names I've never heard before, and I'm pretty sure they're not the names of any of our neighbours. In fact, I've never met or seen the people she's described before. 

But she's convinced that they've done things like hack into her Wi-Fi and computer, tried to steal her passport, the list goes on. Every new claim sounds more unbelievable than the last. And several times a day, she'll say that they're outside talking about her and she can hear them, and it's stuff like ""oh they're talking about how they know my Wi-Fi password"" (I even logged into the router to check no other devices were connected; there weren't any) and ""they're talking about how they have copies of my keys and can just come into my house"" (I got the locks changed to try and give her some peace of mind, but she still says this is what they're saying, even if there's no way they'd have keys). 

I've never heard any of the neighbours talking, and I think they're mostly at work during the times she says they're outside talking anyway. I'm not really sure how much to believe or where these claims would be coming from or even really what to do. 

I'm not sure how to approach talking to her about it, either, because I don't want to make her angry or upset. If anyone has some advice on how to approach this, I would really appreciate it! I'm really at a loss. ",01Aug2018,2

57,"TL;dr : Would it be a mistake to quit my very good job (and potential career) because of mental health struggles?

Hi all, I've been struggling lately. For some background, I've had severe depression and anxiety for all my life, and the last couple months have thrown me some intense curveballs.
I have a really good job - it's secure, pays great, has great benefits, wonderful colleagues, meaningful work, etc - but it's also very stressful when my mental health isn't doing so hot because there are high expectations. Would it be a huge mistake to quit this job, which could lead to a career? 
Part of me feels like I'm being a wuss and using my mental health as an excuse to be lazy - I don't have a horrible boss or a toxic work environment, and I do have tons of oppourtunity here, so I should just work on getting my mental health under control and see this as a challenge that I can work hard to meet.
Another part of me wonders if I am pushing myself too hard though - the only reason I even made it here with such severe depression and anxiety is because I'm very high functioning, which isn't always to my advantage, and maybe I need to lower my own expectations of myself in order to be able to manage my mental health. 
I know its hard to judge/advise from the outside of a situation, but if anyone has had any similar experiences or anything like that I'd love to hear how it went for you.

58,"Hello, I am posting this because I have some concerns that I would like some advice with. Last November a series of events happened that I fell into a really deep depression stage. I was unmotivated to do almost anything and really just lost any type of motivation to really progress in life. I just felt stuck. 

To be honest, I kept making the same mistakes and well my depression just did not go away. It lasted from November of 2017 to about May 2018. To cope with this feeling well I started to drink a lot, and we all know, it just made things worse.

Near the end of May the depression started to go away, I found happiness in simple things like running, being outside and just being happy for having a good song to listen too or because I had a good convo with someone. Things I hadn't done for months. 

Suddenly I enter this rage state of mind. I have always been impulsive and business focused but right now, these last couple days I have barely even been able to sleep, I am so hype about business ideas and how to have other sources of income. Just picked up another job as a translator and I also joined a sales team for another company. All this really sudden. Suddenly I start to take wins, I feel confident, happy about myself, I want to be social and interact with others and hear peoples opinions. 

This change was so sudden and fast that I am a little concerned. Of course, these things are good. But am I just getting out of what it seemed to be a terrible depression stage?

61,"Hello! I’m a 21 F and my bf is a 23 M. We’re waiting for insurance to kick in to attend therapy, but we want a basis of possible disorders. His whole life, he’s been negative, antisocial, disassociated, and unnecessarily anger and without empathy. He constantly feels as if he’s unable to feel most emotions besides anger, loneliness, sadness and emptiness. He pathologically lies, but not fantastically and without any gain. The lies don’t paint him as a super good guy either, it’s just a compulsion that he can’t resist. Like recently he told me a lie but then ten minutes later came to me and apologized with the truth because he felt bad about the lying and said he didn’t even understand why he told it. It wasn’t like he would’ve gotten punished either. It wasn’t monumental, though he’s lied about important things as well. He’s always had a fascination with suicide, like not romanticizing it, but more, he’s always wanted to do it. Constant empty threats of suicide or self harm, though he’s been known to attempt in the past and has been voluntarily hospitalized before. He’ll get inappropriately anger and overwhelmed over insignificant things, especially when it’s about others emotions or sometimes even his own. He doesn’t know how to cope with them. At times when I’m upset, he’ll just sit there and stare at me until I turn away. Like he doesn’t care. But he does it to everybody in his life. He’s always been on the outskirts of everything, more of a loner for sure. He has been informally diagnosed as bipolar but I feel and he feels that’s incorrect. He doesn’t have ANY moments of grandiose, at all. In fact, even in his joyful moments, they’re dulled down from what most people would feel, because he doesn’t understand what joy feels like. He doesn’t cycle. He’s been prescribed many antidepressants in the past and they’ve all had a poor affect on him, zombie like, blackout episodes, extreme violence and anger. He seems to be a little on the narcissistic side as well, he always has to be right and always has to win. He searches for ways to correct everyone and feel intelligent, even though no one doubted his intelligence. Please, someone reach out, I’m so at my wits end and I love this man. I’ve stuck through so much of this, and been way too understanding, but I can’t do much longer. He IS open to therapy and medication if necessary, we just don’t know where to begin. ",01Aug2018,2

63,"I'm a teenager, I don't really have any major worries or causes of stress, and as far as I can recall, I have never had a traumatic experience in my life.

I can't really 'feel' emotions anymore. Although I still notice that I'm 'in a state of' some emotions, such as anger, fear, happiness etc. I no longer feel the 'sensations' inside me when I'm supposed to.

#Symptoms:

For example, one night I had to walk home late at night, alone. I had never done this before and I noticed that I was a bit scared because my blood rushed to my legs, but I didn't get the internal sensation I recall associating with fear. Or when I get angry at someone, I no longer feel a 'fire' inside me followed by an impulse to say what I think, but instead, I only notice that I'm a bit uncomfortable.

I collect pictures from /r/CozyPlaces, /r/Moescape, /r/museum, /r/sehnsuchtpics and others. These pictures used to give me a warm, internal sensation, but they no longer do. Same with music, however, I still feel a 'chill' on my skin from time to time when listening to some tracks, but nothing more.

Some weeks ago my teacher praised my short story analysis and read it in front of the class. It was one of the few things I did the whole year that I think I might be proud of, but I still felt nothing. Not even when I showed it to my parents and they were visibly proud of me.

As I'm writing this I notice that my eyes are a bit teary, but I still don't feel any 'sadness' inside me. 

#Possible causes:

**Loneliness**:
I changed schools a year ago. I have never been an extroverted person, and I have always had few friends, however, the school year before the last was the one in which I had the most daily social contact I have ever had in my life. At my new school, I still haven't made any real friendships. The people in my class don't really interest me, as they have polar opposite interests and worldviews to mine. Is it possible that my lack of physical social contact has led me to be less empathetic to people, and thus made me somewhat emotionally numb?

**Epicurean worldview**:
I started to read more about philosophy around the same time I first noticed these symptoms, and the ethical philosophy that I currently agree the most with is Epicureanism. My view is that the world is just the result of physical forces and that there is no such a thing as a 'purpose' to life. Therefore, the only thing left for me is to avoid suffering and pain, both physical and mental, as much as possible. Ever since I have been rationalising away unattainable desires and a specific emotion: Anger. Now I no longer wish to be respected or to make a change in the world, I just want to lead a safe, comfortable life.

**Media overload**: Around the time I started feeling these symptoms, I started reading more and watching more tv series. Before, I had been spending most of my time playing multiplayer video games. Maybe this switch from performing repetitive tasks to spending more time consuming narratives disisetitized me in some way?

**A TV show**: This one may sound silly, but the time when I watched the ending of a particularly sad TV show that meant a lot to me was when I last felt an emotion 'inside me'. However I had already felt some of the symptoms before that TV show.

It's gotten to the point where I'm incredibly irritable at any given moment of the day and I lashed out at my closest friends. I've started to suffer from insomnia. 
Very recently I lashed out very hard at my closest friend, to the point our friendship was at stake. I've managed to salvage the remains and I got through it fine, but that was the point I decided I needed professional help. I can't let this go on any longer. I need to be less on edge every day. I also live under constant paranoia that my dearest friends are pushing me away against rational thought.  This is what is majorly causing me to lash out aty friends.

I do have anxiety disorders (GAD, SAD, and Agoraphobia), but have been able to keep them under control pretty well. However, I started dating my current boyfriend last year, and I love him to death. In fact, he's pretty much most of the reason I've been able to go out in public this past year. 

Anyway, because I love him so much, I've been having a lot of panic attacks/borderline panic attacks. If I don't hear from him like I usually do, I slip pretty fast into ""tragedy mode"". I assume based on circumstances that something terrible must've happened to him and then start crying hysterically/hyperventilating/shaking violently/etc. I know deep down that he's just busy/distracted, but repeating that to myself (along with deep breaths) never helps.

Truth was, I was deeply self-destructive and depressed; social interaction was agony.

However...sometimes people need to be helped, when someone thinks they’re jesus or something of the like. The reason for this I think is because we consider these people to be ruining their lives, that their grip on reality is tenuous enough that they won’t be able to function in society, that they won’t be able to be happy. 

I don’t know if this is grounded in evidence or if we just “feel” these people to need help. 

But where is the cut off point? When internal reality mismatches external reality what does that mean? Men who identify as women or women who identify as pan I see no problem but why do we consider people who think they’re actually dolphins to need help? What exactly is the difference?",01Aug2018,0
75,"I have an issue getting angry. I tend to be nervous and on occasion slip into depressive thought loops. Most of the time I will feel hurt about something and not address it, and then go cry and feel sad, but less volatile. If I confront someone, I burst into tears before I raise my voice, which is incredibly embarrassing and ruins the entire process of working up the courage to be angry.  I tend to run away from things to avoid dealing with them.
I had a real breakthrough a few days ago—my mother was insulting my partner and shouting at me, and I managed to, without being insulting, express how angry I was that she was out of line. I didn’t cry, I didn’t break under pressure, or evade the situation. I felt fantastic.
But I noticed this other tendency that I also have after the fact. Maybe a day after a horrible argument, I just worry about what I did wrong. I seem to forget and forgive before I am ever offered an apology for what I’m angry about. I know that my entire emotional state was trying to force itself back to a baseline  by crying—I would force myself to work until I was too exhausted to care and it’s just contributed to depressive tendencies I’m trying to fix. I want to get a better sense of the protective capabilities of anger.
So I want to learn how to hold a very short term grudge. Just long enough to hold my ground when I’m right to be angry.

77,"# About Me:

My name is Brian. I'm currently in the process of enrolling into college to become a Logistical Engineer. I am 19 years old. At this point I weigh nearly 270 pounds, at 5 foot 10 inches. I have a BMI of 39. I am living with my family currently who have raised me well. I will make it clear that I have not been abused, and my parents have done very well with helping me.

# What I have to deal with:

I currently have had depression since I was around the age of 8 or 11 which stemmed from the feeling that everything was pointless as nothing we do is going to truly matter. Combined with my high-functioning autism and Asperger's Syndrome I have trouble with social interaction. Although I'm not shy, I tend to not know what to say in front of people so I often say something inappropriate without realizing it. The worst of it is the Schizophrenia, which essentially turns my normal life into a living hell. I never am alone, even if no people are present. I constantly am being observed and yelled at by black figures in the shape of people I know which use their voices. I call them Shadow people. It makes it especially hard to have social interaction with something screaming at me while I'm talking to someone else. 

However, I have a special problem with my schizophrenia. *It gets much worse in the dark.* Instead of having them scream at me, they are able to come up to and touch me. Sometimes they smack and hit me although I don't feel any pain. I just feel like I just went skinny dipping in Alaskan Glacier water with how badly I start shaking. Their yelling turns into a single huge uproar as they take on an inhuman screeching voice([Sort of like the Horde in LFD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl_UeyvT72Q)). They don't even leave when I'm asleep. I sleep alright due to the medications I receive, but it never feels like I've actually rested. 

At this point I just want to give up. I'd never kill myself or put myself in danger, as I find it stupid though. **I just want it to stop.**",01Aug2018,1

Seems like right direction, doesn't it?
Fuck no.
Every fucking day or week (better time) I'm seeing bloody photos/news/posts of mine friends or acquaintances like couples photo, ""jerk-from-university-got-married"" FB notifications, Instagram photos like ""hey loser, watch me stroking my gf's butt"" etc.

Oooh thanks, you are so smart, yeah. Let's meet 2 years after and I will predict all your shitflow from your mouth.

Why? Because it's sounds hypocritically as fuck when someone who used to fuck several girls before and now got married say that ""it will be fine""-like bullshit.

Sorry for too much hate. I'm done.
All my mental powers is being spent on avoiding killing people.

Nothing helps when it comes in a few seconds in the middle of the street/underground/cafee etc.
No bulldhit from therapist that keeps telling me her hopeful rubbish like ""you can spend your energy in a many different ways, not to regret about the past, but other options"".  
When I asked her what other options do I have, she didn't answer lol. 
But I don't need answer, because I know what it can be: ""hobby, running, gym, painting"" and 1000 more things you can fulfil your virgin outcast life. Because the real fact is you have missed your the best years of your life (hormones, romance, mental state, sharpest mind state) because of being totally controlled by your stupid mother.


I feel like I just woke up after running had been finished and I can't reach others out no matter how fast can I be and the only way I can take them down and make closer to me is demolishing and bringing suffering.

81,"I don’t want to post this to my main account so I’m using a throwaway.

So it started about six/8 months ago when I decided I needed to go onto a healthy diet as I was very close to becoming overweight and it was causing some big issues with my self esteem. Within another few months I’ve become obsessed with calories, exercise, fat content, food and just losing weight in general. 

I’m only allowing myself 600 - 670 calories a day and if I have more I become intensely anxious and depressed. I weigh myself at least twice a day and nine times out of ten I hate what I see. Is like no matter how much weight I’m losing it’s not enough and I want to lose more and more. I’ve started taking to lying about what I’m eating, spitting food in napkins and then flushing it down the toilet or just saying I’m not hungry. Even though I am. I’ve nearly fainted twice and I always feel breathless, lightheaded and also anxious. My hands shake and I feel restless and agitated. 

I’m constantly checking my appearance in the mirror. Major problem areas are my thighs, hips, under chin and belly. They all look huge, grotesque and fat and it’s like no matter how much I’m losing I can’t see any difference in the mirror. I must check my appearance at least 20+ times a day if not more. I lock myself in the bathroom at work to check my stomach, hips etc and whether there is any bloating, flabbiness.

It’s only happened one or twice but when I’ve felt really low, I’ve eaten large amount of calories (as was my usual comfort method before all this) but then I made myself sick afterwards. The shame and revulsion I felt afterwards was horrible but then I did it two more times after that. I know I need help but I don’t know where to start.

85,"So I normally wouldn't post something like this but I'm not really too sure what to do, I'm kind of embarrassed typing this.

Recently I've been really on edge, like paranoid about harmless things, mostly it's when I sleep at night. Normally little house settling noises don't bother me, but in the past few months I swear to have been hearing voices/movements in the house at night, and when I go to see what it is it's absolutely nothing. I know there's no one in my house, like they don't sound ""real"" if that makes sense. Like I can distinguish real house creaking noises for those, like they sound like something you'd hear if there was like a TV on in the background or something, it's really hard to explain. Anyways, without fail every night it seems like I go into panic mode and I feel as though something is going to ""get"" me, even though I know there isn't, and this makes me not look forward to go to sleep every night. I can only kinda fall asleep if I have both the TV and my phone playing some sort of noise, so I can associate noises to some solid source. I've been absolutely exhausted the past few months because of it, and I want to figure out ways I can stop it from happening. I also feel somewhat mentally foggy, but it's important to note that I've just recovered from mono (which I got in December) and a concussion from about a month ago.

One instance from today (which I've never had happen before) is I could've sworn I heard a voice, like a repetitive voice, almost like a TV show being glitched out and repeating itself, but there was no source and it just kinda disappeared. I know there's a good chance there wasn't anything there, since my dog didn't react and he's very skiddish.

My family also has a history of bipolar disorder/anxiety/depression, I've never had symptoms like this but I'm thinking it has something to do with anxiety. In rare moments I'm scared to leave the house (even though I do) in fear of something happening. And the paranoia may be associated with some sort of anxiety. I've also had some issues with my family that I won't go into, I haven't been abused or anything but there's been a lot of tension/strain through out my life.

The only other thing I can think of is that there might be some sort of sleeping issue, since I don't usually feel ""awake"" when I get up, and I'm always tired, no matter how much I sleep. I know I have a weird sleeping schedule but it's kind of getting out of hand. It's weird to me however since it only happens at one house, I live at two since my parents are divorced. 

After I calm down from being anxious and paranoid I feel incredibly embarrassed and silly, but the next time it happens no matter how much I try to assure myself I still get incredibly anxious and paranoid.

Another thing to note is that I'm a huge skeptic, I don't believe in ghosts or anything, so I'm trying to find a reasonable solution. Honestly I feel like I'm 5 years old again and it's embarrassing.

She has been diagnosed with OCD and borderline personality disorder which can make situations very difficult at times. She told me before we got together that it causes her to lash out at me over the smallest things and also can cause her to think negatively about the relationship (comparing herself to other girls I've been with/spoken to before her). For example, I said I had work to be getting on with today and couldn't see her, and she completely flipped telling me that I always make excuses not to see her and that things are always on my watch (bearing in mind I saw her yesterday and ultimately spend around 4/5 days a week with her). She routinely tells me that she doesn't want to be with me anymore and pushes me away if I try to help but a few hours later will clarify that she does want to remain together and that happened because she felt no emotion.

While I understand professionals are trained to empathize with a person like myself and talking with a therapist could help, I hate that it's their job and their motivation to talk to me could only be to earn a paycheck and there's a possibility (maybe likelihood) that in talking to a therapist I would hate myself even more for annoying them or wasting their time.

Like talking to GPs, explaining your feelings to the GP,  getting told what illness you have, getting referrals, possibly having work/school being contacted e.t.c? Can all GPs diagnose you with a mental issue? or just ones that specialise in it?

I know there's something wrong with me, I've been feeling like this for at least 3 years now, but I don't know what it is exactly or if the mental issue is what I think it is... and I'm slightly scared of going to the GP, since my local ones aren't very secretive about information and not only that- they know the whole of my family, so there's a chance they may disclose the mental issue to them........",01Aug2018,4
97,"Hi, I’m from the UK and have awful self esteem.

I feel like all people hate me secretly, and this makes me alone and needy because I need attention and validation from others, which I never seem to get. Because of this, I’m convinced I’m a horrible and dislikable person because I act in a way which is possessive and crying for attention. 

How can I feel like I’m actually a great person, and hold my head high. I can never love myself; I need others to do it for me ",01Aug2018,5
