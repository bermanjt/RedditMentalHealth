1,"I have suffered from anxiety and depression for most of my life. Right now I don’t particularly feel depressed, but I am tired all the time. On weekends where I don’t have my children I have slept to 4:00(went to bed around 1). Even then I was still exhausted. 

In general I feel tired all the time, during the day a lot.  I take anafranil and depakote, although I am transitioning to lamatrogine instead of depakote. 

I guess what I’m asking is: could depression be the root of my tiredness? Or the medication? I would give anything to have energy. 

Thanks in advance. ",12Mar2018,2
2,"As in, how do you know you’re not faking it? What are clear signs you have a problem..? Could one be in denial or just refuse to accept the fact that they’re struggling (stubbornness etc) and if so what can they do about it?!? ",12Mar2018,2
3,"My dad is obese. He weighs over 300 pounds. He always has bags of junk food (mnm's, chex mix, chocolate bars, or chips) around both his couch and desk where he works. He is a very messy unorderly person who has been self employed almost his whole life, and has never held a real job. 

He has had some really intense fights with my mom about food before. Sometimes, when it is brought up, he threatens to kill himself or others.

One time, when I was about 12 years old, my mom, dad, and siblings were coming home from a shopping trip and it must have been 10pm at night. My dad realized that we forgot to buy the ice cream, so he started cussing and said we needed to stop. Everybody was tired, we had frozen foods, and nobody wanted to make an extra stop just for ice cream. He yelled at my mom when she insisted that we don't stop, and when I suggested that we don't stop, he told me something along the lines of, ""You better f*cking watch your back kid because if you act like that somebody is going to f*cking kill you.""

He still strongly insists on buying ice-cream, mayonnaise, and ranch dressing because, according to him, if he doesn't have it he could choke on his food and die because of a medical condition that he no longer has (about 5 years ago he had a muscle degenerative disorder, but he has since recovered). He also says that if he doesn't eat enough meat, that it will cause him to have a heart attack because he needs proteins. Whenever we go shopping, he insists that we buy a bunch of junk food. Whenever he is around, he always drops off junk food on my desk ""for me"" and becomes angry if I don't eat it. Whenever I eat food, he always says something along the lines of, ""You know what, I am feeling a bit of hunger too. What is [my name] eating?""

Another time, our family was having a barbeque. He was concerned that my mom didn't cook the corn enough. When my mom insisted that she did cook the corn enough, my dad become very upset and called her a b*tch. And then, after I told her not to call her that, he approached me while I was sitting down, he stood right in front of me with his fists clenched, and he started cussing and threatening to hurt me. He continually yelled, ""Do you want to fight huh?"" I was paralyzed in fear, and after him asking that question many many times, I answered no and he walked away.

Just yesterday, my mom served him chicken wings because it was the only appropriate lunch food that she had around the house. She gave him ranch dressing with the wings, and by doing so used up all the ranch dressing. My mom knows my dad has a food addiction, but she gives him the food anyway because, like me, she fears backlash. Last night, he made himself more chicken wings. After cooking his chicken wings, I saw and heard him by the refrigerator cussing and searching for like 10 minutes, refrigerator door open and all. Just this morning, he told my mom to go with him into town (a 30 minute drive) to get ranch dressing with him. When my mom laughed, my dad became very upset and my mom and dad entered into another fight.

He is an extremely sensitive person. He takes offense to any mention of his weight. He uses pseudo-medical explanations for why he literally needs the foods that he likes in order to survive. My mom can't divorce him for financial reasons, he threatens violence, and he refuses to acknowledge his problem.

What do I do?

4,"I am about to post a link of a photo with all the treatment orientation types: https://imgur.com/a/k5ksq

To help you better determine, this link is for what as my issues: https://imgur.com/a/rlKJC

So basically, I am a recent college grad/young adult from a state I spent my formal years in (as in the last half of my life). Moved out to a state with much quicker pace of life and different culture cuz parents noped out of the other state after I finished high school. So I have to deal with being in a state I dislike many things about, living with parents who happen to be (educated) immigrants (so a cultural add on to the natural generational divide). I'm working and doing some uber on the side to save money for a move out. I'm 24 and really would dread being in my current state (geography state) past my late 20s. Some days I feel older than I am, but not exactly in a physical or mental way.

I have Aspergers-diagnosed in around 5th grade, have a history of getting anxious and sometimes letting my mind slip into depression. Been seeing therapists in college from 2014-2017. Right now, I feel like I'm more in a life transition/existential crisis, but I know those things can build up the anxiety and could potentially be a recipe for another bout of depression if I'm not too careful in handling it. I'm more or less looking for someone I could dump my brain's garbage out on a periodic basis, and could help me slowly but timely dig into my subconscious brain, figure out what may be causing the 'cells' to act the way they do, and make adjustments as needed in a training wheels type way if that makes sense. Baby steps into a more peaceful-on-average day to day mental state, but not seeking some elusive perfection as that's impossible. I'd be the one driving the 'car' but the therapist would be like my backseat driving instructor, sometimes going into the front if needed.  

On this sub's end, if I could get more insight into the definitions of the treatment orientation types, I'd very much appreciate it.",12Mar2018,2

6,"Historically, the delineation of psychotic disorders has been determined by positive symptoms of psychosis - delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech. These are *relatively* unique to disorders of psychosis, and by far the most obvious, so it is no surprise that they’ve been viewed as primary to the definition of schizophrenia. And, it would logically follow that the treatment of these symptoms would hold the focus of clinical practice, with the suppression of delusions and hallucinations often accomplished successfully via antipsychotic medications. 

However, new perspectives on the nature of schizophrenia and related disorders of psychosis are beginning to emerge. Modern academic views of the disorder are increasingly recognizing positive symptoms of psychosis to be just that - *symptoms*. As such, they may be viewed as secondary, arising from a less obvious source of disorder.

In this post, I hope to integrate modern research into schizophrenia, reframing the fundamental nature of the disorder. Further, I’ll discuss the implications of this work for the development of more effective treatments, as well as understanding mental illness more generally. Finally, it’s worth noting that disorders of psychosis are among the most highly stigmatized ailments out there, surrounded by fear and ignorance. I hope that in establishing a truer and deeper understanding of these illnesses, the [counterproductive forces of stigmatization](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brick-brick/201405/the-stigma-mental-illness-is-making-us-sicker) might be weakened.

**Schizophrenia: Current Definitions**
-
While I won’t present an exhaustive list of how symptoms might manifest, some discussion of basic symptomatology will provide a foundation for newer concepts. It will also lay out some running examples of how schizophrenic symptoms might evolve.

-

Schizophrenia is diagnosed according to 5 major symptoms, as listed in the DSM-V:

1. Delusions
2. Hallucinations
3. Disorganized speech
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
5. Negative symptoms (diminished emotional expression or [avolition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avolition))

-

Delusions can take a variety of forms. 

*Persecutory delusions* are most common, and familiar – individuals believe they’re being *persecuted,* that others are conspiring or plotting against them; that they’re being watched, judged, psychologically monitored, possibly by the people directly around them, by the government, aliens, or some phantom organization.

*Referential delusions* are also common, and are experienced as the belief (often paranoid) that unrelated external events are occurring *in reference to them*. This is an experience of attributing personal significance to things that most wouldn’t pay attention to. Walking down a public hall, someone psychotic will hear the scattered conversations of strangers and be quick to think that those hushed voices are talking about them (this may play into persecutory delusions, if the individual then believes those voices are malicious). Referential delusions are not only social – one may interpret significance in chance happenings, such as a large branch falling near oneself while walking down the street.

*Grandiose delusions* describe beliefs of having special powers, being powerful, or being an incarnation of a powerful figure, such as Jesus, Mohammad, or God. Other classifications of delusions include *nihilistic delusions,* the belief that a great catastrophe is going to occur, or less commonly, *erotomanic delusions,* wherein one believes others to be in love with them. 

-

Hallucinations can take a variety of forms as well, appearing as visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or taste hallucinations. Most commonly reported are auditory hallucinations. People can hear a raucous cacophony of voices, many overlaying whispers or shouts, voices with emotional affect, delivering opinion or judgment. Their words may be audible or fuzzy, but the vibe they give is often malevolent and derogatory. Visually, schizophrenic individuals may see fleeting shadows in the periphery, or vivid characters right before them, and anything in between. Again, there is a tendency for these hallucinations to appear as threatening and ominous, although they don’t always appear as such.

-

Disorganized speech, as we’ll see, partially emerges out of the (understandable) inability to think. Given the nature of overwhelming delusions and disorienting hallucinations alone, it should be no surprise that such an individual struggles to communicate. Personally, I begin to stutter with only the mildest distraction. With a discordant symphony of phantoms in my ear, I cannot imagine uttering a single word of sense.

---

***Auto-ism***
-

Historically, schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders have been framed with positive symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech) at the center. Understandably so, as these symptoms are most obvious both to the individual experiencing them and the clinicians attempting to treat them.

However, historical precedent is not always the best guide for future progress.

As our understanding of psychosis reaches new depths, the framework in which “schizophrenia” was conceptualized should give way to new ideas, richer ideas. Now, I hope to present some of these newer ideas, straight from the frontiers of modern research.

-

But first, some history. [The term *autism* was first used](https://www.google.com/search?q=autism+etymology&amp;oq=autism+etymol&amp;aqs=chrome.0.35i39j69i57j0l2.11301j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) not to describe the modern autism spectrum disorder – rather, it attempted to capture schizophrenia and psychosis in one general process, the process of “auto-ism,” or the progressive dominance of the self (Greek *auto* = *self*). It encompassed the withdrawal from shared reality alongside an immersion into personal reality, the mind. And in schizophrenia, this is what we may be observing – a progressive dissociation from reality, complimentary to a progressive immersion into one’s own internal landscape, the mental abstractions and interpretations that occur when one is so disconnected from their external world.

Let us keep the concept of *auto-ism* in mind as we move forward. 

---

**Schizophrenia: A Cognitive Framework**
-

Recent work has begun to frame schizophrenia and psychosis as a disorder of cognition. Cognitive dysfunction is considered the primary contributor to one’s inability to live a normal life, but the nature of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is poorly understood. It is suspected that cognitive dysfunction may be primary, at the very heart of the disorder; still, the subtle nature of the symptoms makes this more difficult to investigate than those of hallucinations and delusions.

The duration and severity of cognitive symptoms are rather curious. They appear first, potentially a decade or more before any other symptoms, and linger longest. While positive psychotic symptoms and negative emotional symptoms can fluctuate wildly, and tend to decline with age (possibly reflecting age-related reductions in dopamine), cognitive deficits remain stable throughout an individual’s lifetime. 

All of this implies some sort of cognitive deficit(s) to be at the root of schizophrenia and psychosis, that our current frame of reference is painting a highly misconstrued and distorted image of what it is to be psychotic. Indeed, current antipsychotic medication can prove successful in suppressing secondary symptoms, but fail to treat cognitive deficits. 

Many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) also reveal a general trend for genetic variation in genes underlying aspects of cognition, such as neurodevelopment and neurotransmission.

-

If schizophrenia, the whole complex of symptoms, is the result of some form of cognitive impairment, then we should wonder what cognitive functions have gone awry. One new perspective posits an answer to this question.

---

**Schizophrenia: A Disorder of *Attunement***
-

In psychology, *attunement* describes the quality of how receptive one is to the emotional needs and moods of others. It overlaps with the concept of empathy, and includes the empathetic response, but with an added cognitive aspect. At the level of cognitive processing, attunement describes how synchronized one is with *social-emotional information*. 

This social-emotional information forms an unconscious understanding that is necessary for shared human experience. We all depend on a bulk of unconscious information processing, which includes social norms and axioms, empathy, and predictive reasoning, in order for any higher communication to be possible. Unconscious conceptualizations of emotional expression and motivation are at the root of all conscious understanding of the emotional experiences of others (as well as ourselves). 

If this cognitive process were to go haywire, a person would lack the proper foundation for more advanced social-emotional communication. Then, when social demands become more complex in adolescence and beyond, the individual’s architecture of understanding will no longer be able to hold the weight of new information, and will collapse. Leaving the brain to interpret stimuli by its own accord, and without a stable tether to reality.

---

**Examples**
-

Okay, so how might complex symptoms of psychosis emerge? Here I provide some hypothetical examples to help understand this. 

First, let’s consider a schizophrenic individual experiencing *hyper-attunement*. This person feels as if they are excessively connected to the people surrounding them, a state of “acute empathy,” wherein they may be receiving an overwhelming amount of social-emotional information.

In this state, the individual may interpret this perceptual experience as mind-reading. Now, how the interpretation evolves from there depends on the context. If the person is in a positive emotional state (for whatever reasons), the experience of hyper-attunement and mind-reading may be interpreted as a sign of their abilities or powers. Indeed, they may feel like they are the one reading the minds of others, becoming grandiose upon self-reflection, and believing themselves to have special abilities or a spiritual role.

This may be a mechanism by which grandiose delusions emerge.

If the individual is hyper-attuned and in a *negative* emotional state, the subsequent delusions may evolve differently. They may still have the perception of mind-reading, however the context has changed.

In a negative emotional state, their emotions may rev up (dysregulated) to extremes, and they may fear that others are reading *their* minds. The emotional affect changes the nature of the delusion, making the person believe they are being watched, observed, and talked about. They may believe phantom organizations are monitoring them. This is the nature of *persecutory delusions*.

Here we see how two forms of delusions, classified separately in the DSM-V, may have the very same source. They simply evolve differently, dependent on the context and the individual’s reactions. Hallucinations may operate in a similar way, with hallucinatory visions being visual interpretations of emotional dysregulation.

Fear pathways rev up, hyperconnected to regions of the cerebral cortex within the primary visual region, among others. The electrochemical signals of fear, upon arriving at the visual cortex (or auditory cortex), are interpreted as fear-provoking visual stimuli. Thus, ghostly shadows, maleficent demons, and harm-intending voices.

The more cerebral layers of the experience - those addressing the individual, such as how voices condescend and abuse the individual – may result from connections between the aforementioned fear pathways and regions that represent concepts of the self, such as the insula and cingulate cortex.

-

Now, this cognitive processing disorder is present at birth, and continues throughout childhood. However, complex symptoms won’t develop until social-emotional information reaches a level of complexity that exceeds the capability of the persons mental capabilities. Throughout childhood, people with these processing disorders may feel vaguely out of sync, unable to truly connect with others.

This may result in emotional dysregulation, as they can’t truly connect with others, and can’t consciously understand why that is. They experience a chronic stress of disconnect, always having an unconscious feeling that they are different, dissociated from their peers. This suppression and confusion results in limbic imbalances, wherein emotions are not dealt with properly, contributing to emotional power of future symptoms.

They will find ways to cope, creating an alternative neural architecture upon which basic social communication can operate. However, as they age, social communication becomes more complex, and their alternative systems for processing social-emotional information collapse under the weight of increasingly involved stimuli. As this system of understanding the world collapses, they detach from their outward reality, and begin to process stimuli from a purely subjective point of view.

---

**Conclusion**
-

The disorder of schizophrenia is highly complex, and I do not claim to represent that full complexity here. Rather, I hope to suggest a possible mechanism by which complex symptoms of psychosis emerge – from disorders of attunement, combined with emotional dysregulation and subjective interpretation of emotions.

It is also one of the most highly stigmatized disorders, being surrounded by fear and ignorance throughout history. Yet, these are not necessarily bad people. They are in a tough position, without much help from greater society. Understanding the mechanisms by which the experience of schizophrenia evolves is important to bridging the relational gap between schizophrenics and the general population.

7,"TL;DR - probably feeling anxious/depressed or something, and not sure who to talk to.  Various aggravating factors.  Apologies for the wall of text, but honestly writing it out has been at least a little helpful.

I am from the mid-atlantic USA.

So, I’m hoping to get a bit of advice about what the best course of action is for me.  I have gone to see a therapist for a few weeks about nine months ago, but honestly I don’t feel like I got too far with it - maybe it just wasn’t a good fit.  Honestly, I’m not sure how to even start with something like this.  So, let me start with my “symptoms.”  I’ll just try to get to the point as I suspect this will get long as it is.

I’m in my 40s.  My wife passed away about two years ago.  I have no friends, really, but I get along really well with my immediate family (parents, siblings, etc).  I live alone, and have stepchildren in their 20s who I get along with, but don’t see often.  I have what any normal person would consider a great job, and no issues at all paying the bills.

However, I feel like I’ve been struggling with what is probably anxiety and depression.  I tend to get pretty lonely - I try to get out of the house and walk around malls and such, but that is about the only regular social contact I have (I mostly work from home).  I have a few hobbies, and I do get some pleasure out of them, but I tend to get tired of them and have plenty of empty hours left to fill.  I do try to eat out with family but even if I manage to set up a couple of meals in a week I’m still alone almost all the time.  At work I feel like I’m procrastinating things more and more which I know I need to do but which are tedious, and that concerns me, because I’m not at a point where I can afford to just give up working.  I do tend to neglect things that I don’t view as essential (paint peeling on my house in various places, but if something more serious is wrong I tend to get on it quickly).

Personality wise I’m probably an INTP (just my sense of it plus random tests which probably are only somewhat reliable).  I suspect I might be a bit autistic but never was diagnosed (occasional balance issues, strong reactions to loud noises, difficulty relating to people, lack of empathy at times, etc).  IQ-wise I’m around the 99.9th percentile, which probably doesn’t help with relating to people (and I can certainly vouch that IQ alone isn’t all there is to success in life).  I actually don’t mind having relatively normal conversation with people, and I enjoy spending time with people I’m close to, but I also tend to get tired of it somewhat quickly.  I guess socialization wise I’d be happiest in hit-and-run encounters - have a meal, be on my own for a few hours, have another meal/etc, then be alone again.  I wouldn’t be surprised if I have some ADHD or OCD or something going on.

I’ll just be honest and say that I’m not sure how much I really miss my wife specifically, vs the void it has left socially.  It isn’t like life was completely happy when she was around, and in some ways it is better now, but in other ways worse.  Maybe I miss what I would have hoped that our relationship would have been, but wasn’t.

Obviously I’ve coped with a lot of this stuff for a long time.  I guess what is driving me towards looking for some kind of help is the fact that I feel like I’m suffering.  I’ve had heart palpitations (which are benign - I now see a cardiologist), sometimes I get shivers when I’m stressed, and I don’t have a lot of confidence that these things will improve on their own - these are all new issues in the last year for the most part.  I feel like there is a potential risk of losing my job at some point, and a lack of motivation in general.  While it doesn’t happen often there have been days when I’ve struggled to get up at a normal time, even after going to bed 10 hours before my planned wakeup time.  Often I am up for hours at night.  I was stressed about something at work and had an episode of sleep paralysis (which is very rare for me) combined with hallucinations (which I recognized as such while experiencing them, and I haven’t had that issue since I was a kid).  I do try to relax, though I struggle with being disciplined about doing things like meditation.  Earlier today I was hugging a pillow and shaking.  I’m just tired of feeling so miserable at times (though, to be fair I feel fine or even happy at other times - probably when I’m more distracted by other people or activities I find interesting).

I have tried doing things like meetups to try to get more social contact, but honestly I feel like I don’t maintain much interest in the activities themselves, and I find the social contact really shallow.  I don’t really care for a lot of small talk - I’d rather spend time with people I know really well.  I realize that getting from A to B does require some small talk, but it is hard running into people I might want a close friendship with, or who might be looking for something similar.

So, I feel like I probably should talk to some kind of therapist.  However, what kind should I talk to?  Should I try to use my insurance from my employer for this, or just pay for it myself?  (Honestly, the costs seem awfully high; I guess I can afford it but I’ve been trying to save like crazy in case I do lose my job at some point.)  If there are 20 people in my area that have the necessary qualifications (whatever those might be), how do I pick which one is the best for me?  I’ve already established that I don’t know anybody who can recommend somebody in particular.  If I do go through my employer it almost seems like I have to call up Blue Cross and tell them what I think is wrong so that they can tell me who I can see or something, which seems really odd.

If this were some kind of physical symptom I’d just ask my primary doctor what to do and take their advice.  I feel like there is just nowhere reliable to start with something like this.  I feel silly even guessing at what might be wrong with me but do it mostly to give people some kind of sense of my symptoms.

Another reason is the thought of dying without leaving anything behind gives me literal anxiety. That's why I badly want to have kids now (I didn't before my depression).

Another reason is I feel like if I die without accomplishing anything or procreating it'll be a literal loss to humanity. No this isn't a troll, I'm extremely arrogant in the weirdest way. It doesn't translate into any real confidence though.

13,"So, some backstory: I  was bullied all throughout middle school and high school. People would call me things like ""ugly."" My cousin would bully me too, calling me ugly and fat. It continued and continued until tenth grade came around, and I guess you can say my mind...broke.

I did some things I am NOT proud of, but eventually I got somewhat ""better."" My issues shifted to a mindset that made me think that I was insulting others, but nothing was actually being said. I fight to keep these horrible thoughts away, to prevent myself from actually saying these mean things. Yet...sometimes, I hear the person's voice respond to whatever mean thing is on my mind at the moment. 

However, my mouth remains closed... So how could I be saying things to people? It still feels real.




I've been to countless professionals. One psychologist stood out to me. He said he thinks this is essentially ""baiting."" In all honesty, I think my mind has tricked me into thinking I'm baiting people (hearing their response, despite my mouth being closed). I've noticed that the things that pop into my mind are things /I/ was called. 

I'm currently on medication. I'll be perfectly honest: This is still happening, despite the medication. :( I see a therapist, though. It's helpful to talk about things  with him! He recently suggested that maybe I'm still recovering.

16,"TLDR: Trying to figure out what sort of therapist I should try to find for my wife and me. She has ongoing pain from a surgery, exercise addiction, major challenges coping, severe anxiety, and blames herself for all of it. It's affecting all areas of her life, including her relationship with me and our 2-year old. She did not feel like her past 2 therapists were helpful. How do we go about finding the right person? Does it make sense to also see the same person for some couple’s visits, or should that be separate?

——

My wife comes from a very exercise-focused family which contributed to her having eating disorders in childhood and an exercise addiction in adulthood. A couple years ago, pregnancy complications required an early C-section. Everything ended up okay physically but she found the whole experience - having our daughter and losing her freedom earlier than expected, and not having a choice as to method of delivery - very traumatic.

After her C-section she still could not stop exercising - it’s her coping mechanism for everything - and did crazy abdominal workouts that very luckily did not harm her surgery. However, she had 2 freak medical issues in the following 2 years, one of which required a knee surgery, and both of which she blames on herself. The knee is healing slower than expected, but her doctor is still positive she will make a full recovery, and the 2nd opinion agreed that she's still within an acceptable range of time. But she cannot let herself believe them because she has not seen any progress. Doctor also says she did NOT do this to herself, but she thinks it’s too coincidental that it happened a year after the C-section and her exercises.

She obsessively blames those post-Cessarian workouts for these medical issues, which causes tremendous guilt, shame, and anger directed at herself over the workouts she did. She often replays those workouts in her head. She is extremely anxious that she will never recover from this surgery and will never be able to run again. Running is basically her whole self-identity. She's miserable, and it's a major and recurrent topic of conversation every day. I try to convince her that this isn't her fault and remind her that the doctors are confident she will recover fully, but she has not internalized either of those points.

This bleeds into all aspects of our life together and affects her relationship with both me and our 2-year old daughter. I try my best to be supportive, but the woman I married has been gone for over a year at this point. We have an otherwise incredible and fortunate life together - wealth, community, family, etc. - but she cannot be happy with it because A) she is in physical pain, B) because she doesn’t think she’ll ever be able to run again, and C) thinks it's all her fault. It's a lonely feeling for me, not having someone to share the joys of life with.

I don’t know what type of therapist to even be looking for or what specialties to target. Does she need to see an addiction specialist to help with the exercise addiction? Someone to talk about self-esteem, since she seems to have a hard time finding value in herself outside of exercise? Or a pain management specialist? Or multiple specialists at once? Or do we need to see a marriage counselor? She WANTS to feel better and to be able to enjoy our next child's infancy, but to make that happen, she needs more help than I can offer.",12Mar2018,1
17,"I am a 36yo father with 2 sons, quite happily married. Life has been going quite well for my whole life aside from some family issues I've gone through right after I graduated from college. Recently, I have been hitting a streak at work where my performance is being questioned, the quality of my deliverables were at an all time low, etc. Colleagues and team leader are not happy with me, though they know that I am able to put out quality work and can contribute to the team. I just got pulled aside by my team leader a few days ago and got royally grilled about it, and now I've been put on performance review and need to provide daily AM/PM updates to him and all the PM's I work for with the list of tasks I have on hand. To me, that's downright shameful and I shed a few tears about it (no joke). I used to be a team leader who asks those who are under performing to do the same thing, not the other way around. So, my head has been wrapped up in his mess for a while and I started to ask myself a lot of questions about what led up to this. Now is the time when my family needs me the most to be good at who I am and what I do to support them. I really can't spend more time and energy to figure out what's wrong and I hope I can come to this community for help.

18,"I [21/F] just signed a lease for an apartment new my university. The apartment has 2 bedrooms and while I can afford to live there on my own, likely using the extra room as an office space, I thought it wouldn’t be so bad to save a bit of money by searching for a roommate. My friend [20/F] reached out to me and asked if I would be willing to be roommates next year. She’s a nice girl but she is very fragile and not mentally stable. As someone who deals with various severe mental health issues of my own, I’m worried that somehow by me and her becoming roommates I would be putting my own mental health at risk. She even says that she will have a trained therapy dog with her by the time we would move in together and when I initially signed the lease on my own I made it clear to my landlords that I would be bringing a cat which is my prescribed emotional support animal. I’m not necessarily worried about a dog and a cat living together, especially since the dog would be well trained. However, I don’t want to get into potential issues with the landlords over the dog. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know how to let her know in the most polite manner should I decide that it’s not a good pairing for the two of us. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

If someone talks about how they built their cool new PC I'll feel bad because I don't even understand half of the terms they used in the process and it all seems so natural to them.  If someone talks about a really exciting happy experience they had, I'll feel envious since I don't get to feel excited or happy about anything.

Now part of that is anhedonia/possible alexithymia.  I don't get a strong pleasure/motivation signal from anything.  I don't have to like baking, PCs or whatever, but I do have to like *something*. But even though I don't express these thoughts to people online or in the flesh - I don't want to make anyone feel bad - I don't like that my first inclination is to feel envious or bad about myself when someone's done something worthwhile.

I’m confessing to the fact that I haven’t been taking it for over a week, because I haven’t had the money to go buy a new script. I’m afraid of seeing the pharmacist and asking for a sub and he finding out that I probably haven’t been taking it for over week, and I’m scared. I’ve always had this thing of disappointing people so when it comes to stuff like this, I just avoidavoidavoid. In the past, I’ve even gone as far as switching doctors, pharmacies and the like to avoid the confrontation and difficult conversation of feeling like a total idiot. 

Because of this, intrusive thoughts are back with a vengeance. Every time I look at my ceiling fan, I see a flashing image of hanging myself. It sometimes gets so intense that I have the sensations one might feel when undergoing that act. My throat tightens up and my extremities go numb. I’ve had images of stabbing myself in the throat and just slashing at my skin with a kitchen knife. I’m conscious of the fact that they are intrusive thoughts and *nothing more* but it doesn’t change how disturbing and debilitating they are. 

I don’t want to kill myself, I want to live a happy and fulfilling life with my children and my boyfriend. I need to swallow what issues I have and just go ask my pharmacist to shout me a few pills until payday. I’ve done it before so I’m sure he’ll do it for me.

32,"Hi guys, I am a 21 year old female. 
Health wise, I don’t really suffer from any illnesses and lived a relatively normal childhood. However, I developed depression and anxiety at a young age. 

As an adolescent, my anxiety was severe and often caused sleep disruptions. When my sleep cycle was extremely irregular, I sometimes had hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations (hallucinations which occur while falling asleep or waking up. They’re relatively common and as far as I know, typically benign and often due to irregular sleep. ) 
When I had these, I would hear taunting voices or see giant spiders (fun, right?) 

It’s been a while since I’ve experienced that, and my anxiety has improved drastically. While I do have issues to an extent with depression and ADD to this day, I’m doing much better than I was when I was younger. 

Last night though, each time I drifted into sleep I would hear a voice. It was very clear at the time but I can’t remember what it was saying. I just know it was urging me to do something and taunting me (as it did before. ) usually I am immediately aware I’m hallucinating, but last night I was convinced it was coming from my phone or my laptop or that someone was in my room and become extremely afraid. It took me a while to go back to bed. 

Since then I can’t stop googling schizophrenia symptoms and wondering if I’m developing it. I don’t have any actual symptoms of it though, so I know that I’m probably being ridiculous. But..I do have the common risk factors (anxiety, depression, substance abuse problems in the past, advanced paternal age (my dad was 40, my mom was 32, not sure if that’s really considered advanced or not), a family history of bipolar disorder, depression, alcoholism, etc.

35,"This is my second post in less than 30mins but there's something else I need to just get off of my chest, so here goes:

Ever since early high school, I've had medical issues. At the time, the ones my parents paid more attention to were physical issues, namely a tumor I've had on one of my legs since I was very little. Around this time, I started developing some mental stuff too, but was always too afraid to say anything in case I got thrown into a looney bin.

Some friends and I determined early on that I had issues recollecting some things (usually referring to it as memory issues, since amnesia wasn't EXACTLY correct, I've always remembered things like family etc, just other things that seem to vanish from my mind COMPLETELY). I developed anxiety. I also used to hear voices and have blackouts, and this one was really scary for a number of reasons: 

1) I would normally come-to in a different location. Now, I don't know if the memory-issues come into play here but it was terrifying nonetheless.

2) A number of people would call it something that is now known as dissociative identity disorder. They'd say I would act differently at times, sometimes completely differently.

I thought that everything was going to be ok. My grandparents (who were the only family I told at the time) would brush it off as the imagination of a young man. So anyhow a couple years ago the blackouts just stop (they weren't extremely frequent to begin with). All the weird shit that was happening just stops (this lines up with a breakup I had, maybe the emotions were a factor? I don't know). So I get myself back into the swing of things, find a job, get into uni, all that good stuff. Last December I suddenly have a panic attack out of absolutely nowhere. I have flashbacks to my high school years (I consider myself a horrible person back then), I have thoughts about my last (ex) gf. My anxiety shoots through the roof, I feel like I am fighting for my life. I immediately seek counsel from a counsellor at uni, and things over the next couple months go a little smoother, but still a bumpy road. I wake up anxious, weak legs, intrusive thoughts, illogical thoughts/fears, all that great stuff.

So now, about a week ago, I hear the voices again. It's only for a minute, they aren't saying anything I can make out, but it's them. I realise that I need to seek more professional help once again, I'm just wondering what the hell I'm going to tell my family. These are issues I've had for a decade, how do I tell them? Or, do I even tell them? I'm 22M and prepping to maybe live on my own, so now I wonder if it is even their problem. I just feel so lost. My intrusive thoughts terrify me on a daily basis. I know it is illogical to be thinking of them (they are scenarios that happened 6+ years ago, and some thoughts are of scenarios that I know never happened), but the fear feels so real.",12Mar2018,2

I know how to be healthy I just cannot for the life of me change my behavior. I know it sounds stupid for healthy people but I just can’t stop I feel like Im hurting myself against my will.

-virgin, never touched a girl

-living at home with my parents (I have a very... “quiet” relationship with them. They love me and I love them but we never really interact)

-been working a part time retail job since high school ended

-Chemistry major senior (I hate that I chose this major. It’s not going to lead to anything useful I just wasted my time. And I’m not going to grad school for sure)

-No hobbies, no friends, I spend all day doing homework and working retail. 

-Only time I enjoyed life was when I was a teenager smoking weed and being a degenerate with my 2 close friends but one of them died soon after high school ended and the other had a mental breakdown and long story short doesn’t interact with anyone anymore (I could further elaborate if you want trying to keep this succinct)

-I cant smoke weed anymore cause of random drug tests (although I guess a loser like me should be avoiding such vices)

-I just feel lost. I’m not suicidal cause that’s scary I’m just feeling really detached from everything like I don’t get how to play the game of life correctly",12Mar2018,3

I'm a Japanese male in my mid 20's. I know my English is not brilliant, but if you can listen to me I'd appreciate it very much. I'm being emotional right now and I want to let it go. I write in English just in case someone I know will read this.

I don't know where to start, but I'm stuck and lost in my life. Simply put, I have so much regret in what I have done and how I have been, and I think I have to and want to change but don't know what to do. 

I have wasted so many years, though I had so many chances by which I would lead much better life. Around me were always nice people, but all because of me I lost them and now I have no one to turn to. I should have thanked my parents for all their love, but I told them it's all because of them how sad and miserable I am, which is simply not true.I had a girlfriend, nice and beautiful and everything, but I was wrong enough for her to left me, even though she was very patient for so long when she told me she couldn't put up with me anymore.

Make things worse, I was more than 1 million yen in debt. Luckily I could get a job, though not a brilliant one also, and I will be finish repayning it at the end of the month. 

It took me 2 years and it was long, and I think repayning it by myself was one of the few things that I wasn't wrong with. That said, because I was haunted by this debt too long, it feels like all the other things that I've tried not to see suddenly show up in front of myself. What if I didn't do those thing, or what if I wasn't at least in debt. Those who once were around me all look very happy, have a decent job, etc. 

If I can say say like I'm happy with what I have, but I can't, because I'm not. I think I need to change and start trying to be better. But I don't know what to do and where to start.

Since December last year, I've been having this..delusion? of being talking (verbally, audibly) to people I've never met. It could be the people I see on the news, or celebrities, or an author.. I just start talking to them about stuff I guess. Not necessarily related to who they are. It usually progresses to me believing they can ""read"" my mind, and that's when it becomes a **real**, terrifying problem.

Now, I usually talk to myself when I'm alone in a room, or walking down an *empty* street. My mother has ""caught"" me a couple times, but I managed to just laugh it off or something.

My parents are the most caring, compassionate people I've known, and I honestly believe my mum loves me more than herself. I love them too, of course. But the thing is, they're very traditional in their views on mental health. My mother believes there is nothing between ""crazy"" and healthy. Each time the topic of mental illnesses comes up (talking about other people, of course, I've never told them about any of this), my parents go ""Oh, those poor parents, their kid is insane, how unfortunate for them"" They would **never** in a million years think that their own kinda-smart pretty-funny socially awkward daughter would be..*insane*.

But I am. Let's be real here, I absolutely am. I've cried about this so many times, googled more things about it than you could imagine, but no dice. I don't know what it might (""it"" being the illness) or how I could tell my parents about it.

It isn't schizophrenia, by the way. I've never had a hallucination in my life, only delusions. So that's that.

Please, please, please, someone help me. Tell me what to do. We do not have a ""school counselor"" or anything like that *at all*

He was trying to tell me something about his work but I was convinced that he was speaking spells at me to hypnotize/control me. I wasn't sure if I was really awake or not by this point. 

I also did not realize that I spent about 1/2 of Saturday researching the best methods to suicide and trying to delete social media profiles. It wasn't until my husband came confronting me about isolating from them that something else snapped. I don't clearly remember what happened but I must have scared him badly because I remember seeing him look terrified :( I think I had a crazed look and kept repeating something like ""I know.."" at him. I tried to take a shower and apparently spent about 45 minutes in there banging my head on the shower and muttering to myself before I took a bunch of old expired hydrocodone pills ( I didn't even know I had them..) drank 1/2 a bottle of wine and 1/2 a bottle of nyquil, got back in the shower to sit there and die, and blacked out and I must have thrown it all up because I can't imagine I'd be alive otherwise. I don't remember what else happened that night. 

Sunday I woke up and flew a kite with my daughter and otherwise tried to not .. IDK not get liver damage? I still felt dazed. At some point last night suddenly fear of dying came back full force and I had anxiety all night..

 I have not felt like myself at all in the past few weeks, especially the past few days but this is the least stable and the most frightened I have ever been.

I am just wondering if anyone out there has any idea what could be the cause of me to get these feelings and how I can overcome these bad feelings.",12Mar2018,1
58,"Help, I feel like I’m losing myself and everything. Last semester I was focusing on school and nothing but school. Now I have a full time job and I’m in a relationship. I can’t focus on anything. I can’t even grasp anything or learn. I feel like when someone tells me something it goes in one ear and out the other. I feel like I’m broken. I’m taking vyvanse and it helps only for like 2 hours a day and that’s it... I honestly feel broken and lost. When I took antidepressants it got rid of my anxiety and made me not give a damn about anything which made things worse.  Am I broken or is this normal?",12Mar2018,1

60,"I’m like hyperventilating right now. Ok, I’m not in a good place right now so I apologize if this is frantic. 

I’m going to be upfront: this revolves around a kink I have called omorashi. I’m attracted to woman wetting themselves. 

Now I exclusively browse videos, but there is  a lot of omorashi art online and in the past I’ve browsed it. I was always interested in depictions and drawings of adults, and I’ve never purposefully sought out anything but that. 

But I’ve stumbled across bad stuff. 

Years ago I went on the 4chan archives and searched omorashi. I didn’t really understand what ecchi and yaoi and whatever that stuff was, and I found fucked up shit intermingled with ok shit and browsed a thread before closing it. I’m paranoid that because I did that I’m absolutely fucked up. 

If you, see something fucked up, but continue to browse the site doesn that mean you’re ok with the possibility of seeing more bad things?  Because I continued to go to adult 4chan boards for porn. 

There was a subreddit posting really awful images that I reported. But I still visited it on an occasion. 

My mind has been freaking out the few days because omorashi is linked to anime and anime has this weird/fucked up tendency to depict immature characters. Some of the art I viewed reflected that side of the kink, but I always thought it was fucked up and I wasn’t looking for it. I’ve stopped that altogether. 

I did go on websites where it was, so that’s bad enough for me to convince myself that I’m a piece of shit. Am I overreacting?  I just put the pieces together about this and I’m spiraling hard. 

If I’m a piece of shit, please just tell me. 

I’ve been falling apart, I feel like my worldview is crumbling and I just found out a terrible terrible secret about myself. ",12Mar2018,1

65,"First off, I want to say that over the years, I have been diagnosed with Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, ADD, Depression, Anxiety, and Asperger's Syndrome (However I think the diagnosis with Asperger's was misdiagnosed). My therapist has also said to me that she is suspicious that I have PTSD. Ever since I was child growing up, I have always felt that there has been something wrong with me. I would observe other people my age (and still do to this day) and see how their behavior, freedom, and appearance would be different than mine. I always felt like the person that would finish last. For example, a good chunk of people my age have moved out, got married, have jobs, and so on while I still live with my parents, haven't got my degree yet, can't hold a job (I am 23), still rely on my parents driving me places and can’t be left alone from my parents in public. Growing up, I would feel very hypersensitive with all my 5 senses. For example, some people can't feel an ant crawling on their skin while with me, I can feel every tiny little leg perform movement on my skin. I also remember growing up that I would have extreme anger, anxiety, and depression. I remember how if a Lego piece didn't fit on the model that I was building, that toy would turn into missile flying across the room and explode into a million Lego pieces. I also remember that I would start crying from things that most children wouldn't find upsetting such as sad sounding music. I also remember that I would have severe panic attacks at just the thought of any sort of life threatening health condition that might occur (and still do to this day). I have also had a few head injuries growing up from running out of the bath tub at age 2 and slipping, having a shelf one time fall on top of my head, and running under playground equipment while not ducking down enough resulting in splitting my head. Surprisingly none of the doctors think none of the injuries have caused any set backs but of course I have never received an MRI brain scan to confirm their conclusions. My parents believe the reason I feel so shitty is because of the vaccines I received when I was younger. I'm not sure if that is the case but I feel that there is a possibility. I have also had a lot of traumatic experiences growing up from medical emergencies with me to bullying. Before my life really turned into a hell hole, It was the beginning of 2011 and I actually felt my life was going in the right direction. I had a super cute girlfriend, I was learning to drive, and had lots of great friends. I practically felt almost invincible. However, I did have the occasional panic attack which I attribute to both consuming a lot of caffeine back then and past trauma. I would sometimes have a coffee and a large water glass full of Dr. Pepper sometimes in the same day. I remember occasionally I would feel super tense but I thought it was normal. After all I was told when you are a teenager, you body changes and sometimes you might feel funny. I remember around February or March in 2011, that was when my life took a big hit. I remember had 3 really severe panic attacks on 3 different days. Once at home, at a Wal-Mart, and at my high school's basketball game. I remember after those 3 days I can say that was when I really began to have severe agoraphobia. I felt like I became afraid of everything. Being taxis, trains, elevators, big stores, being surrounded by crowds, etc. It also got so bad that the summer of 2011, I spent it inside of my home because I was so terrified to leave because every time I went out, I would get a really bad panic attack. Since then, I have received adjustments in medication, cognitive behavioral therapy and so on. I also got on and off episodes of really severe depersonalization. I had depersonalization sometimes growing up but back in 2011, I had it almost everyday. Due to how bad my agoraphobia was in 2011, I had to give up driving and wouldn't get my license until the end of 2014 (at age 20). Even though I now have my license, I terrified to even drive outside of my neighborhood and feel that my mind is too impulsive to drive safely. In 2012, I actually developed heart palpitations from the constant anxiety that I would have everyday. Thankfully my doctors said nothing was wrong, told me to take magnesium supplements, and the palpitations went away. I graduated high school in 2013 and started college but never finished. I dropped out of college in March 2015 (but went back in August 2016). I only took classes online because I was so terrified being on campus. Back then and now in college I would barely make C’s. I would try every thing from tutoring to Youtube videos to help me understand my classes and nothing worked. The only reason I haven’t ended up on academic probation is that I cheated every single class I took so I could pass. Some classes I can’t even take (such as pre algebra) because there aren’t any good websites online to help me cheat. Unfortunately I wouldn't get my first job until the end of 2015. Surprisingly after I got my first job, my anxiety started show some improvement. I was able to drive from home to my job (my job was a 3 minute drive) and I was able to be left alone places without my parents being close by. However in the beginning of 2016, I had a really severe panic attack on night driving home and almost got into a car crash at night (the person’s bumper was only 2 inches away from my passenger door!). Shortly after, someone got really sick at my job and the paramedics came while my verbally abusive store manager and a customer were both yelling at me for not working well during an excessively long line. Combined with the anxiety from the store manager, line, customer, and the paramedics (since I’m terrified of paramedics) I had a really severe panic attack. After that, I would have a panic attack everyday at my job and was scared every time I was behind the wheel. It got so bad, my mom would have to sit outside of my job the whole time until my shifts were over and she would have to drive me everywhere again. My psychiatrist gave propranolol and unfortunately did not make even the slightest difference with my anxiety. My heart palpitations came back and I developed really bad indegestion. It got so bad, I skipped meals because every time I ate, my symptoms got worse. I also couldn’t speak because my stomach would hurt so much. I also got constipation everyday. My parents told me I had to go to the doctor. because it was so bad. My doctor pretty much said it was due to work related stress and gave me famotidine. After a few days of taking the medication and not working, my symptoms went away. Once I went back to my job, all my symptoms came back in an instant. It was like I never took the medication! I remember one day, I had such a bad panic attack at my job, I felt some sort of rush shoot up my spine and then my heart felt funny, got tunnel vision and felt like I turned into the Incredible Hulk and Sonic The Hedgehog at the same time! It was scary! The final blow that made me quit my job was one day, I had such bad anxiety, my throat felt like it closed up for 5- 10 seconds. I couldn’t speak, or breath and my mouth would only let me make awkward movements. After I quit, my mom said to me how she was worried if I would be able to ever hold a job again. Once I quit in April 2017, my life since then and now felt like it has been during 2013 (after finishing high school) and 2014. Everyday I sit home by myself all day while my parents work. Every day feels the same. I only go for walks in the neighborhood when my parents are away when I leave the house since I too scared too leave the neighborhood without my parents. Thankfully I can go to stores and different places but my parents coming with me is a requirement. Now in 2018, I can say that my agoraphobia isn't as bad as it was 7 years ago. However, I feel that there is very little hope for me being able to live a normal life. I feel like someone with low functioning autism (not literally). They grow up having all these problems but when they're older (after receiving the right help of course) they have improved but will never be able take care for themselves, have a family, hold a job and so on. I had cognitive behavioral therapy from September 2011 to December 2013. I have stopped because it was making little to no change with my anxiety. I started take Somatic Experiencing therapy in January 2014 and still take it today and have also started Feldin Krais in October of 2014. All the different therapies treatments I have helped me to some degree but haven’t made any life impacting differences. All lot of people say that my biggest problem is that I have too many negative thoughts. Even though I do agree my thoughts are mostly negative. My issue goes much further than just thoughts. Everyone has negative thoughts at once everyday (at least that’s what I assume) and don’t go into really severe panic attacks out in public. My biggest issue in my opinion, is my body and mind’s sensitivity. I honestly don’t know how long I can continue living like this. I am getting older everyday while I’m watching everyone else my age pass me by in life while I just suffer with the same problems everyday. I feel like I have tried everything and nothing has worked. I really wish I could commit suicide but I’m also too scared to do that too. Every time I hear when a friend of mine moves out, gets engaged, etc. I just start to cry so much because I feel so far behind in life and feel like a gigantic loser. I’ve probably cried at least 2 times writing this. When friends want to do stuff with me, I always either invite them to my house or when they invite me some place, I make up an excuse not to go since I don’t want them to see my parents following me. I also haven't had a girlfriend for 7 years either. I also feel so intimidated around other girls now because I don't know how to get a girlfriend, what to say to them and I've been rejected a lot more times in life than have been accepted. I honestly believe that if someone were in my shoes, they would have committed suicide a long time ago. I don't know what needs to be done, but I can't continue to live life like this. My life it isn't a gift. It's a curse.",12Mar2018,2
66,"I am 19 years old, and for as long as I can remember I have felt like there was a grey cloud hanging over my head. I am very easily hurt and feel quite depressed a lot. I no longer really do things I used to love (music, art, etc.) because I have no motivation to do them, and I feel like whatever I create isn't good enough.
I have really terrible anxiety when it comes to pretty much everything in life. I ruminate. A lot. I am constantly analysing myself and situations in my head and I can't really seem to get out of it. My ruminating even gets in the way of everyday life. I would say I spend nearly half the day in my head just thinking over everything.
I was anorexic for a year. The next year I ended up with a yo-yo type anorexia/binge eating disorder thing. My self-esteem went completely down the drain and I am only starting to get out of it. I still hate what I see in the mirror, though. I feel disgusting in my own skin and completely guilty that I lost the control I used to have in not eating much.
It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm starting to have a long-term derealisation episode. I've experienced it in the past, but this has been going on now for maybe two months or so. I've researched it and by the looks of it, the one I'm experiencing seems mild enough. I feel like I'm looking at the world through a window pane, and that's as far as it goes. I'm afraid that it'll only get worse though if I don't sort out my head.
Last year, I was smoking weed pretty much every day. In the last 4/5 months, I tripped on LSD about 4 times. The first two were amazing; last two showed me the reality of just how cripplingly afraid of everything and sad I am. I often wonder if the feelings of derealization may be to do with that, and whether or not I should even be doing such kinds of drugs in the first place. I'm afraid that if I do them I'll end up permanently fucking my head up one day.

For a bit of background on my life, I was diagnosed with autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis when I was 2 years old. I have been in and out of hospital all my life for operations, treatments, checkups, etc. I was put on various medication to treat it including steroid treatments, and I have been taking methotrexate as a treatment for the last 3/4 years.
I have a narcissistic father who, to this day, has made me feel afraid of him, like I could never please him and that nothing I ever did was good enough. He would yell a lot, get frustrated when my siblings or I asked him simple favours like dropping us off somewhere/help us out with something etc., never really showed affection/hung out with/told us he loved us, criticized a lot and self-bragged a lot. My mother has always been the ""hovering"" kind of parent. Always overly-worrying about the health and safety of her kids, pulling us away and ""protecting"" us from the fears she had (a lot of which were irrational phobias) and things like that.
My parents never really understood my sensitivity growing up. They would tell me that if ever I was feeling down, I could always come to them about it. However, when my anxiety and depression began taking a toll on me near the end of high school, they either tried to ignore what was going on or threatened to send me to the hospital. They weren't supportive at all, and when I tried to tell them that they flipped out at me, saying that they do plenty to help me and were really not pleased that I thought that of them. I really feel like my parents have a huge part to play, but I don't know whether to think they are the sole reason I am the way I always have been.
On another note, I got very badly bullied all throughout elementary and high school. Both verbally and physically. I never really had many close friends in school and the one I did have in high school left to go to a different school 2 years before our final year. For the last 2 years I never really hung out with anyone in school and was on my own for most of it.

I was never officially diagnosed with any mental disorder, but I know that the anxiety/depression and whatever else I may feel is real. I know there's something wrong, I just can never come to a clear, concrete conclusion on why this is happening to me. If I really am insane or am on my way to becoming so. If the reasons I have come up with for things being the way they are are right or wrong. If there's something else going on that I'm completely missing. My head feels all jumbled up on it and I don't know what to think or do anymore. Can anyone give me any clarity on what exactly is going on and what I should do? Thanks.",12Mar2018,2
67,"Many people on antidepressants complain that their medication made them feel numb. This happened to me after trying Prozac, Effexor, and Wellbutrin for two years.

I recently been a lot better with both conditions, so I lowered my medicine gradually from 325mg to 250mg, then 150mg, and to now where I have completely stopped taking it. I am not longer having any withdraws (I tapered by skipping days and then increasing the time between doses until I stopped completely), but what I am noticing is that I don't feel as sharp as I used to be. I feel like my memory and thinking has been much worse, especially with speaking. Anytime I get a little bit anxious, I can't recall basic words. I end up getting embarrassed and even more anxious because of this, and in the end I feel like I seem like an idiot. Also I feel like I get mad a lot faster than before as well.

Like yesterday night I kept feeling like I had somebody in my mind trying to talk to me, and I heard them, but again, it was coming to me through overwhelming thoughts and not a voice I heard outside of my head? If what happened matters, I felt like I had something talking to me then a few minutes later those thoughts were drowned out by something saying ""I'm tired.""

70,"Hi, I'm using a throwaway because my friends know my real account (I am from the US).

So...this has been building up for awhile. I'm a senior in high school right now and I suffer from a constant headache. I feel like it never goes away, and I've recently noticed it gets to an almost unbearable level of pain when I am doing social things (for examples, I was recently visiting a museum I've been dying to see, and despite how excited I was, I had to leave early because my headache was getting so terrible). I also feel really exhausted after being out, even if it's just seeing a movie with friends. Furthermore, I've been told I overanalyze WAY too much. Like, a single facial expression from my friend will set me off on a horrible string of thoughts, like, did I do something wrong? Are they mad at me? I know it's annoying for my friends, but I honestly feel like I'm not overexaggerating when I interpret small gestures or expressions to be of annoyance to me. I also seem to think every time something is whispered it's about me. Ugh. This is a lot.

This is going to sound very cliche, but I have no hope for the future. I just...can't see it happening. I can't see myself going to college, even though I've applied and been accepted. I can't see myself doing *anything*. The future is just not there. I always feel like my life won't carry on past high school. Not in a 'I-peaked-in-high-school' kind of way, but I'll just cease to exist. Most days I would really love to just not exist. 

I'm sorry for rambling. I included some of that information because I thought it may help bring clarity, but I'm not sure. My true question is: am I just hormonal, or suffering from extreme senioritis? Or should I see a therapist?

Thanks for any guidance.

78,"For some reason, especially when I'm talking with people I like, I notice some flaw of theirs. Something they said that could be offensive, something they laughed at that could be mean, some personality trait of theirs thats not ideal. The thing is, none of these things are ever a big deal, nothing that would ever make them a bad person. But for some reason, when I notice these things about people, I can't get it off my mind. Its not like I want to find flaws in people, no, I'm actively trying to convince myself that its not something that I need to pay attention to. But for some reason, my mind won't let it go, and I'm left half angry at the person for ""being a mean person"" or whatever and half wondering why I'm making this such a big deal. This of course only occurs in my mind, so I don't actually tell anyone that I'm thinking this. 

An example: I have a crush on this girl and I think she's a really nice person. When we talk, she sometimes complains about something, which is a completely normal part of human conversation. I do it a lot, my friends do it, we all do. But for some reason my mind immediately sounds the alarm, saying ""alert alert, this person is a complainer"". I suddenly feel disappointed in her but at the same time the logical part of my brain is saying why are you getting disappointed? I don't want to be disappointed in her, I don't want to be mad at her. But there's just a part of my brain that demands perfection from everyone else.

I don't think it has affected my relationships to a great degree, because I'm able to suppress that need for perfection from others and carry on with a friendship normally. But I can tell you that I sometimes am tempted to throw relationships away over stuff like that, and I really don't want to. Its like my brain is at war with itself. ",12Mar2018,1

80,"I was in a very very bad place around this time last year. I was suicidal with severe depression and social anxiety. I managed to bet into a better state of mind over the past year but I have a persisting problem, certain symptoms have not gone away.

The most prominent one is my lack of appetite. Despite being very happy now compared to how I felt before, I still am eating very little, and go to sleep hungry many nights a month. I simply can’t bring myself to eat a lot in one sitting, and it’s affecting my life in tons of ways. It’s preventing me from sleeping, it has halted my muscle development and even caused me to lose some gains, and I’m also nervous of buying food when I’m out with friends cuz I never finish it and I don’t want to get the judgmental comments on that.

I also still have terrible self motivation when it comes to school and even exercise. I never feel worried enough about impending deadlines to actually do them at all, nor do I do homework and it’s really been affecting my grades but I simply can’t muster enough to care. I used to really enjoy to workout, and when I actually get to the gym to workout I do enjoy it, but it’s a struggle to get myself to go there in the first place. I just can’t get myself to stop watching videos or doing nothing to get up and go to the gym.

81,"I’ve had some thoughts in the past couple months of just disappearing from this world, but it wasn’t through death, just to fade away; those thoughts would just come and go within seconds and I’d continue doing what ever I was doing. This year gave me a new thought that for some reason I’m not going to grow old because I will be dead sometime within the next ten years. 

The past two days have been better, but I’m still new to depression. Within the past two days I’ve had three troubling thoughts invade my mind. The first one was last night when I was boiling water; I put in my pasta and for some reason the thought of pouring that water all over my legs on purpose would not leave me. I was really close to doing it by gripping the pot, ready to lift it to pour. Then I was suddenly lifted out of this crazy and scary desire and let go. 

That night when I was laying down trying to sleep I couldn’t help but imagine having my legs go numb while my life leaves me. I could almost physically feel it. I’d call for my roommate to call 911 in my brain but I imagined that the ambulance couldn’t get to me because I always lock my door in my room, so I just die as though I wanted it to happen. It was such an intense intrusive thought it has made me consider keeping my door unlocked. 

Lastly, just about 20 minutes ago I was going to the bathroom and immediately I looked at the bathtub and the thought of slitting my wrists for my roommate to find me entered my brain. I then thought about how the sharp knifes are right there in the kitchen and I could go get one, for them to cut my skin as I lay in the bathtub. I even thought about whether to have the water running or to just do it to make it clean, I thought how it would stain the bathtub red. It was quite surprising to suddenly think that because it was forced into my brain. 

These thoughts almost make me go into this state of defense as though I’m being threatened, but my heart doesn’t quicken, its more as though I feel like it’s gonna happen. I haven’t had these kind of thoughts before, and I have not been around violent/depressing things (such as video games, movies, true crime) on purpose. In fact, for the past week I have been on a Full House binge, which is quite wholesome. I’ve only been depressed since about November, and have not had these thoughts.

What do you think? Should I tell my dad and sister about this? I seriously don’t want them to worry about me, I already take too much space in their thoughts and borrow too much money cause I have none since I have to pay rent with 18 credit hours and two jobs. They are about three and a half hours away because I am in college, but I call them frequently. They tell me to get a counselor, but my school ran out of room and told me to find another through them. That’s too much effort. I can deal with the laying down doing nothing, feeling nothing for days on end (and they know about that) and I’ve gotten my ptsd in control this past month or two (they know about that too). I just don’t want them to make a big deal out of it. Should I tell them anyway?

I tried to get it out of my head but every time I replay it in my head it just sounds so weird and I can’t find a reason to believe nothing’s wrong,12Mar2018,1

84,"Hey, I'm going through a bit of a rough time in my life right now. There's loads of things going on and it's slowly eating away at my mental health. Now, to make matters worse, I'm going to have to get my dog 'put to sleep'. He's been my best friend for the past 13 years and seeing him so ill is so difficult, I know it's for the best. 

I've luckily never really had to deal with grief until now and I guess it couldn't have come at a worse time for me. I know he's a dog - but he's so much more to me.
I'm not really sure what I'm asking here, what's the best way to deal with grief I guess? I have a lot of exams and things going on at University right now and all this is making it even more difficult for me. I don't really know who to talk to and I just feel completely lost and alone.",12Mar2018,1
