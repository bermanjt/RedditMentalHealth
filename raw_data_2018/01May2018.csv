2,"For the last year or so I've been having these random flashes of myself dying. These scenes are more frequent on days I’m at my low, but even when I’m feeling my best I still have them. It's not something that I think for myself, but it's just something that happens out of my control. It all really varies, but usually it's something happening in that moment. 

I'm in a classroom? I'll slip on water and crack my skull. I'm at an assembly? A shooter will come running in and I get shot. I'm at a bridge? Someone will push me over and I'll land on my head.

I've become so normalized by these visions that I forgot that not everyone has this. I jokingly mentioned this to a friend the other day and they looked at me horrified. They told me to go seek a professional, but something inside me is stopping me. I’m sure I can handle that myself, but I was wondering if others have this.

Some more general information, I’m generally a very happy person and wouldn’t say I’m depressed. I also never been diagnosed to be depressed so I guess there’s no 100% answer if I am or not. There’s no specific voice telling to go and do anything. I could best describe it as watching a movie scene but I’m in the place of the person dying. I’m sorry if that doesn’t make any sense.

TL;DR - I randomly see myself die and I’m wondering if this is normal/others have this.

3,"im 20, canadian, and in my third year at a new university. ive had mental health and self harm issues since i was 12/13, was hospitalized at 14, and have been up and down since then but have been fairly consistently mostly ok, and until this january, hadnt been hospitalized since. in september i transferred to a different university and the transition was rough bc i went from having a big friend group i got along well with to only having a couple friends i see once or twice a week.

i was ok first semester but since then my self harm habits have gotten way worse. I needed stitches in january and was hospitalized for suicidality a couple weeks later. i went to therapy from 13-16 but never found it very helpful and started it again last summer but quit in january after my therapist got mad at me and accused me of lying about my self harm following my stitches incident.

i started seeing a new one in february through my university but it didnt seem very helpful either-- i cant think of what to say, just that sometimes things really hurt and self harm is the only practical way i can see to feel better. all 4 of my exams were last weekend, so i was super stressed even after they were done. the other night, i was fairly drunk and a guy id been seeing came over. long story short, i got kind of upset and he ended up yelling at me; i have trauma w men and asked him to please stop because he was scaring me, which just made him angrier and angrier. i asked him to leave but he refused and kept raising his voice at me. i was upset and terrified and all i could think of doing was self-harm, so i smashed my arm with a bottle and he finally left. i called 911 because i was bleeding everywhere and got a ton of stitches and will have to return for surgery later this week.

i'm not sure how to proceed. ive had to go to the hospital 3 times now in the last 4 months, which is clearly bad for me but also alienating my few friends here and stressing my family out. i know i should stop self harming, or at least stop it from being bad enough that i need stitches. how can i most benefit from therapy? what other approaches should i take? 

its worth noting that i also really have problems trusting people i dont know, including therapists, so its mostly just been me and occasionally i talk to one of my friends here. hes very good and supportive about it, but obviously hes not professionally trained and i dont want to be a burden.

thanks.",01May2018,3
4,"The main thing being I’m constantly paranoid of getting “let go” from another job, because it happened in my first two jobs (never worked before last year) and almost the third but wasn’t because they actually gave warnings before terminating employees. However, (it was seasonal) I wasn’t kept past the season, although barely anyone (if anyone at all) who was seasonal was kept permanently.

I am on my fourth (seasonal again) job now, and often more confident and trust reality (not doubting that I’m doing what I’m supposed to) and taking on duties more instead of hiding and letting someone else get it. However, sometimes I slip, and appear as a social retard, I’m doing better but it hasn’t gone completely away.....

6,"TW: mention of sexual assault

I missed 5 days of pills when the bottle ran out before getting a refill.  It wasn't intentional, but it also could have been avoided (and will be in the future!).

I lost my shit. I became suicidal. I decided I should probably leave my husband. I decided to quit not only my job, but my whole career. I was ready to walk away and default on my mortgage in order to start over. My chest was in constant pain and I kept sobbing. Just kept sobbing. I became so angry I couldn't think clearly in any way. I could not keep it together. I took days off work and tried to avoid making contact with people. I did not trust myself.

This was the worst experience of my life. I have been drugged and raped and went through hell after that, but *this was more intense, emotionally*.

What. the. hell. Has anyone else experienced this? I want to get off Sertraline now for good, and will be talking to my doctor about easing off of it. This is too risky. I don't want to skip days, but I also don't want to be at risk of a complete breakdown if I do for some reason. What if I lost my pills while travelling, or something else?

Anyone else experience something similar?",01May2018,3
7,"I see a psychiatrist for 15 min every 8-12 weeks for meds (Effexor 225 mg and Xanax .25/30 days). I’ve needed medication most of my adult life and have managed- successful career, husband, two kids, House, dog, whole shabang. I’ve “lost it” ,if you will, three times in my life. Very brief summaries as follows:  (1) 17 y/o failed suicide attempt followed by 30 day inpatient stay. (2) Walking out of a job I loved and because of minor frustration. (3) after our home was foreclosed I was a weepy disgusting”non-dealing” type of mess for a year. Now, I’m on the brink and have everything to lose. I make $250k annually for a company that has done more for me to succeed than any other institution (started 15 years ago entry level, now executive) but I’m hating my day to day. Kids are 9 and 7 and involved in everything that interests them, husband has comfortably left his career to pursue other interests (ROI, 24 months from now). My LCSW of 7 years is no longer an option and I know I need to see someone with frequency- starting over seems like the end of the world but not doing anything will be the end of me and my family.

10,"Hi my name is Wes I cheated on my girlfriend with whom I have a child with!!! When we broke up I went to a therapist just trying to figure out myself , to fix my problems and try to figure out why I was that way! My problems started way back in my childhood I didn't meet my real mother till I was 12. Subconsciously I guess I developed the problem of commitment and trusting a kind of like they're not serious they're not going to stick around kind of attitude. In my past relationships when we broke up it was done but when I cheated on this woman of course I felt horrible and sorry and for a long time it drove me crazy because I was addicted to seeing her and being with her every day but then one day I just realized I really don't need her to be happy and to love but for the first time I actually felt what it was like to be in love and I can't see myself without her the rest of my life! Words are words and actions are actions people want to see actions because words don't mean anything I was a singer in a band for one so I got all kinds of attention ..number two I had a Facebook fan page where a girls would send me pictures in my messenger so that made it easy for me to get the attention that I desired inside!!! My girlfriend moved to a different town into her parents home with our son I got myself an apartment in that same town just to be close to our son because he is our world ,I quit the band cancelled all of my gigs after 20 years of singing on the stage,,,, deleted my fan page off Facebook I have no social media this is the longest span I have ever went without singing I thought it was going to bother me at first but I've actually enjoyed it because it's giving me a fresh mind to be able to figure out what I need to do to be a better man and I have become a better man, I quit smoking,, I've learned a whole lot about relationships that I never paid attention to before I read a lot of articles about life and what women expect out of their man and I lacked a lot of things but I also had a whole lot of good things to bring to the relationship in the past but then I guess I wasn't being serious with those past relationships … People can change it's going to take awhile to prove, but if that person loves you and you love that person actions says it all !!!!! And when it comes to my actions everyone that knows me knows it after a couple of weeks I'm with somebody else or at least hanging out with somebody else,,, but I have no desire to be with anyone else because everywhere that I go wasn't place that she and I went to so it's not the same without her face in front of mine!!! All the little bitty cute things that she did and doesn't even realize , I absolutely Miss and would love to see those things for the rest of my life!!!! Even though overall I have suffered tremendously not just the pain of being sorry and ashamed and embarrassed but suffered so bad because I broke her heart and she didn't deserve it…. So I can say a cheater can change you just have to have something worth fighting for in your heart to make your mind agree!!!! Almost 40 years on this Earth and I can honestly say I've never been in love before this woman came along but I was so blinded by my interbeing I guess that I never really thought about it or even paid attention to love!!!! So now I feel better about myself because I've made myself better and I'm continuing to make myself better to prove to her everyday that I could be the man that she's always wanted!!! The grass is definitely not greener on the other side! I'm learning the hard way but through all of this pain and all this learning it has made me someone I never even thought I could be mentally!!! I can honestly say that I respect and love myself but never even thought of that before this happened!!!! Good luck to anyone out there who cheats because in the end it's not worth it but if you know what you want fix your problems and be sincere about it!!!! They always say that true love is worth fighting for

11,"First off i am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. But lately i have been having these episodes that last from a few hours to a whole day. A dark feeling of doom and i don't feel like moving. I get panicky. It does not include feelings of guilt and worthlessness or being suicidal. I do feel some sadness in these times and for short periods of time i get a sort of numbness. I also become hyper aware. It seems like it goes up up up up and peaks and than comes back down over the coarse of hours. 

I have done alot of reading and it seems like these episodes are too long for an anxiety/panic attack and too short for depression. It happens about once per week otherwise i am doing really good. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I can’t explain why I have so many irrational fears, I just do, and that’s one of the reasons I hate myself, another reason is because I have 0 self-control and can’t tell myself no, even if I know what I’m doing is wrong. For example, I masturbate 1,2 or sometimes even 3 times a day, after I’m done with the act I feel shitty. I tell myself I’ll change, but honestly I probably won’t get any better.

22,"My career in teaching has really messed up my mental strength. Last year I was completely in tears all year which was apparently normal, but I had a breaking point and started to see a therapist. I didn’t find it helpful so I quit in the summer.

This year was so much easier. It was going by so fast. I thought I was on a roll. But then I started noticing things, and now I’m taking a week off work. According to a test, I have depression and anxiety. I can’t look at my work email anymore- I don’t even know what the principal replied regarding my doctors note and that I’ll return on Monday. I don’t want to go back to work. I don’t touch any of my paperwork. I oversleep on weekends and it’s hard to leave bed.

I remember times when I was on top of things and I was the one giving advice to others. I stressed and got angry, but I always tried to problem solve or move on. I don’t know what’s going on, and I hate it. I don’t know if I can work. I don’t know how to open this discussion with my mom who believes I’m doing alright now- and I hate to imagine my mother being sad. I’m still pretending to go to work. I don’t know what the hell im doing walking or taking the train aimlessly at 6:30 in the morning. I just want it to just stop. 

This antidepressant from yesterday is making me too nauseous and I can’t sleep, and I’m calling my doctor when the office opens. I’ll call a potential therapist to see if they accept my insurance- or I’ll go back to the therapist I didn’t click with from last year.

My mom had depression, but otherwise I can’t really talk about this to some people. I’m someone that was known to be on top of everything. My boyfriend said I don’t have to worry about how he views mental health, and I want him by my side all the time now. But he needs to work, and he wants me to get better. But I want him to just hug me all day. I feel really scared. 

But I just want to able to manage stress better. I want to wake up early with energy, tackle work stress normally, and stop avoiding every conflict and angry parent.

I hate how I feel. I hate how I’m behaving. I hate the thoughts that go through my head. I don’t want to be crazy. I want to be normal. I want to face conflicts and work.

I am prescribed an anti-depressant (Prozac), anti-psychotic (Depakote), and stimulant (Adderall IR) for various mental health illnesses. I have taken Adderall in some form for six years now, but my prescription recently had to be altered when I began using Medicaid for my health insurance. Medicaid didn’t want to cover the 20mg Adderall XR that I had been taking for years, and instead wanted me to try taking two instant release pills during the day.

It was about 12 months ago that I made the switch from taking one 20mg Adderall XR pill every day to taking two 10mg Adderall IR pills (one in the morning, one in the afternoon) every day. At first, this seemed to work and be okay for me, but in the last few months I’ve realized this dosage isn’t the right fit for me. I feel that I functioned better when taking the extended release pills.

I would like to discuss this with my psychiatrist, but I am a 23-year-old college student so I always get nervous talking about increasing my dosage of Adderall. It may seem silly, but I worry that the doctor will think I am selling them or something. This fear probably stems from all the people I have met in college that went to a psychiatrist and were able to get an Adderall prescription w/o any kind of ADD/ADHD diagnosis.

35,"Lately I have been feeling worse. I cry a lot. Even the smallest things will build up in my head and I start overthinking and thus crying excessively. It sometimes involves me screaming in ”pain” despite not experiencing any physical pain, shaking uncontrollably, or hyperventilating. After a while I manage to calm down and stop crying. Then, whenever my mind crosses whatever issue I have at the moment, the whole process starts over. 

I wouldn’t claim to cry more often than considered normal for someone my gender and age, but it has definitely reached a point that is far beyond what I consider normal for myself personally. I used to not cry very much, but my crying has slowly but steadily increased, both in how often I cry, and how intense and long lastning each crying session is.

For almost a year now, I have been feeling worse and worse. Apart from the crying, I have also been more anxious, felt sad more often, felt more worthless, been way less motivated to do things etc. I have started to take it out on my eating habits. (Eating less, restricting what I eat, counting calories). This is not new for me, as I used to struggle with depression and an eating disorder a while back. I got ”help” for it, but it didn’t do anything. I managed to recover on my own with the help of friends, and leaving a toxic relationship, but things are bad again.

I don’t want my parents knowing, because I don’t want to be a burden or for them to get too involved in my life. But I also don’t want to seek help on my own, because I feel like I might be exaggerating my ”problems” when they aren’t real issues. 

I’m just so overwhelmed. I have a boyfriend, but no friends. I have tried keeping a positive mindset, but it feels impossible. School is getting too hard. I feel so suffocated. My lack of motivation and difficulty to focus has lead to my grades getting worse. So far, the difference isn’t huge, but as someone who is normally straight-A student, even the slightest lowering in grades feels horrifying.

41,"Okay so I have several fears that range anywhere from the mild range to the severe range. A very particular fear of mine could pass as moderate, but the reasons and thought process leading up to the fear are rather complex and bother some, so I'm gong to rate it as severe.
I have a few categories for this fear as well, which Im going to break down. WARNING: You may judge me.
Anyways here it is:
1. The fear of people judging my intelligence.
2. The fear of actually being incompetent/lacking potential 

Sounds stupid huh? Let me explain myself.

Most things about to me, regardless of what it's related to, tend to be misunderstood or have complex reasons behind them. I'm a difficult person to truly get to know, and in specific ways have a rather complex personality. 
This is one of the reasons Im terrified of IQ test. If I had a low score people would simplify my problems, and pass everything off as just related to a disability. Even IF I did score bad (I don't know what my real score is), that wouldn't be the reason for the majority of things related to me. 
I. AM. MORE. COMPLEX. THEN. THAT.
So that's one reason, people simplifying my problems to the core and missing the other traits.

-----------------

Another reason it bothers me for people to judge it is because they don't have all the information.
I have a family member with schizophrenia, and most educated people know it's more then just hallucinating and believing shit. He also has a speech impediment.
Due to the fact I have a family member with this illness, I highly suspect I may have a mild form of it. Mainly because I share mild traits in common with the disorder, especially having speech issues.
In some ways it actually depends, because I LITERALLY go in a pattern between having really good speech and having shit speech. It CHANGES.

Regardless of my very decent speech sometimes most people have encountered me with a bad speech impediment because Im more prone to it in the same environments I develop derealization. As a result, I tend to look ways I don't actually think. A lot of people I know have narrow perspective of things and believe everyone with communication difficulties is unintelligent. I can prove that perspective wrong, since the impaired relative I know scored high on the IQ test.

The reason I don't bring up mental illness while describing my reasons is because I screwed myself over in the past. If you want me to be truly honest, I've been diagnosed with high functioning autism during my early teen years. As a result of it, I got overly preoccupied with the diagnosis and blasted social media at one point because I always felt different and had the extreme urge for everyone to understand me. If I tell people it might of been wrong and the symptoms are probably a result of psychosis, they're going to think Im an idiot.

--------------------

The other reason it bothers me so badly is because I have an uncontrollable perception. Throughout my childhood and teen years I've envisioned myself becoming a zoologist or getting involved in psychology. If it turns out I'm not actually good enough for my interest or career plans, I would probably have a huge cow. Im somewhat emotionally attached to the way I see myself in the future and fear I am not actually good enough for this world. Im currently a cartoon artist (which is my biggest hobby throughout my life), but want to get involved in OTHER things AS WELL.
Im not going to lie, I don't know everything about biology or animals, but I used to own several animal books during my childhood and enjoyed learning about the categories and facts about those animals. But the knowledge I possess on animals is SUPER easy. 
As a child I was obsessed with learning about animals, and I believe I can gain my knowledge back and perhaps learn more advanced info.
I also took a strengths and weaknesses test in high school that told me I would do great at biology.

Regardless of all that, I still possess the fear I may not be good enough for my goals or career plans, and that I'm not actually meant for anything better in this world.
I enjoy perceiving myself as a character that may be complete bullshit as well, which just adds up to the possibility. 
I also imagine people perceiving me as the career plans I identify with. A cartoonist type of character who enjoys learning about mental illnesses and is into zoology. My inner world is EVERYTHING and I NEED to live up to my ideals.

------------------------

It may seem like my fears are slightly narcissistic in a way.... But if it actually does turn own I have potential or a decent IQ level, I think Id actually become an even better person. I won't necessarily boast about it, but would probably tell a lot of people so they avoid judgment or are better capable of understanding me as an individual.

So to shorten it all out:

#1 I'm a pretty complex individual who's misunderstood on so many levels, and possess the fear people will link my problems to all the unknown answers.
Like, people believing they have all the reasons to my problems specifically because of the results, or missing the coincidences (As I said earlier, I don't know my real IQ).

sorry for the shitty way I explained that lel.

#2 Im highly concerned with accuracy, and can't tolerate people believing I'm thinking of nothing when in reality my thoughts are racing. I imagine things most people don't realize and think through a lot, REGARDLESS of what my actual range is.

#3 Sometimes I genuinely don't feel good enough, and worry a lot about lacking potential. I don't want my world to crash down on me.
I would no longer have the ability to daydream without imagining scenarios related to my idiocy. 

#4 I care about specific people on a super very high level, and would die if they perceived me as an idiot. I don't even care if they view me as average intellect, I just don't want the reputation of being incompetent by the people I love so much.

#5 Im pretty sure there's other reasons it bothers me to, but I need to get some sleep. Also, the fact I posted this during a state of going too long without it is the reason I may stop including extra info for now. If somebody replies I may talk to them later.
Sorry if I wrote anything stupid, was tired while typing it down. ",01May2018,1
42,"So it’s not as much a habit as it’s a ‘tick’ of some kind. It’s something I am struggling with so much it ruins my day. I can’t go to a psychitrist for this as im never gonna be able to afford one (only 18 y/o). 

Masturbation was never spoken about in my house it wasn’t a taboo but I’ve never learned it as something that is natural but also not as something that’s unnatural. For me it made an image in my head that it shouldn’t be spoken about something that’s still  there with me but im learning to get over step by step startimg with this post.

So like every kid in his teens I masturbate it’s something that reliefs stress for my studies and burdens of regular social life everyone has at my age. Only thing is i created this habit of what I do after. I shower like every normal person would but I wash myself 9 times in a row in one sitting. After that I still feel ‘dirty’ I can’t put on new clothes, i can’t go to social events, i can’t go to play sports or fitness. I can’t do anything cause i feel like I’ve done something that’s so unbelievably unsenitary it just sticks with me. 
I’ve been doing this for 4 years. 

The last 4 weeks I’ve been trying to stop it. I thought i was getting rid of it at first by ignoring it bothering me. Yesterday it hit me hard. I was totally unable to do anything. I stayed in bed from 2 PM to 5 Pm the next day. I felt miserable and sick. It hit me so hard I felt the need to post this for advice. 

I don’t think this is natural i feel like im getting restricted from livig my life the best I can. If anyone has ever been through something similair please give me some advice.
Anything to help me with this it’s been getting so bad I’m starting to think im gonna have this for my entire life. ",01May2018,1

44,"for some context, I stopped self harming for almost a year..and within this past month I've watched as my mental health has deteriated faster and faster.

I feel like I'm losing my mind

I've lost my ability to concentrate... I'm struggling to write cohesively..

Getting WAYYYYY ""Better"" at being able to self harm 

\(Ie. progressed from cutting my thighs, to my outer arm, to my inner arm, higher up, more frequenly and in different directions trying to avoid slitting open a vein that could kill me\)

the last few days have been weird since I got a new roomate and had a trip to go on, so my ability to sleep has been messed up a bit, but there are perioss of days where I literally struggle to get out of bed for anything except work.

and I have some support back home thats amazing, but I can't help but keep thinking about how its all temporary and I'm going to lose them someday somehow anyways...",01May2018,1
45,"I'm not sure where this exactly belongs, so I'll be posting it to a few subs.

I need some help sorting through my feelings about my mom (doesn't everyone?). Growing up, my mom was awesome. She made all my Halloween costumes, homeschooled me (well, I might add), fostered my huge love of reading and the arts. She was funny, beautiful, kind, and very strong in her faith. She had/has depression but she was open about it and took medication. She sacrificed a lot for my siblings and I. She wasn't perfect by any stretch, we still had our normal mom-daughter spats but, I really respected and looked up to her.

But everything changed when my dad left and they got divorced when I was 15. She turned into the perpetual victim and what was once well-managed depression became full blown alcoholism. She went to work and worked hard but was not present for my younger sibling or me. Instead she got drunk every night and many nights, I had to go out looking for her because she didn't come home. She became very promiscuous, which after a fairly strict Christian upbringing, was a complete 180 from what I was taught.
Being extremely type-A, I picked up a lot of slack, especially with my brand new license. I took my sibling to all their various activities, packed lunches, bought presents. I was so mad at my dad for leaving that I went no contact for about five years, and truthfully, he was having his own breakdown and I really couldn't handle it.
I see now that my behavior really enabled her, but at the time it was all I could do to keep from losing it. I developed anxiety disorder and started having severe panic attacks. I was running around trying to be mom, while also trying to go to school, work part time, and still be a normal teenager. I was trying so hard to keep everything together and keep up appearances.

Everything came to a head when I came back from a mission trip Spring Break of my Sophomore year, and the whispering at school about my family was too much to ignore. I was the last to find out about an incident that happened with my mom and sibling while I was gone. It's too identifiable so I won't go into detail but lets just say she completely embarrassed me in front of my entire peer group. I was (am) a tight-ass, trying so hard to project an image of perfection and kids were making jokes about my mom in class.

After all this, and her continued drinking, I lost all respect I had for my mom. It's like she died when my dad left and the person who remained was not my mother. I was so angry with her and as soon as I graduated, I left for college and didn't look back. She stayed in home town until my younger sibling graduated a couple years later then basically dropped younger sibling and left the country.

Now she lives several states away and I end up seeing her about once a year. Her behavior hasn't really changed, although she tries to maintain it has. She tells me she doesn't really drink any more, but all her social media is photos of her at bars in skimpy costumes. I'm still so embarrassed by her behavior that it makes me act completely crazy when she comes around. After the last time she was here, I decided that I cannot have her visit any more and will tell her as much when she tries to visit this year.

I barely talk to her now and it still makes me feel so guilty. I'm constantly second guessing my reaction to her. Like, compared to other parents on the RBN sub or JustNoFamily, she really isn't that bad. Am I being too harsh? Should I figure out how to just accept her as is? We don't have anything in common and I get really embarrassed and nervous when she talks because she has no filter any more. I can't tell her about the good things going on in my life because she seems to turn it around to be a pity-party for herself, while still maintaining that she ""loves her life"" and ""things are going soooooo great!""

For my mental health, I do not follow her on social media and I have VVVLC, but that fact alone still leaves me feeling incredibly guilty, because if my child didn't talk to me, I would be devastated.

I'm just looking for some advice on how to handle her and if I'm doing okay. I think if she had been a shitty mom the whole time, this would be a lot easier, but somehow I can't let go of the extremely fond memories I have of her growing up.

She lost memory of a lot of things. On the way home we had an argument after she told my dad every terrible thing I've ever said about him and she tried to jump out of our car while we were going 70 miles an hour. Yesterday we got home and she spent $500 we can't afford to lose on a bunch of stuff that she refused to let me return ""because it's helping me."" She's convinced herself that she has a sensory disorder (she's a teacher and has a lot of mental health education, she actually has an endorsement to teach mentally disabled people). She met a woman in a coffee shop yesterday and told me she's going to quit her teaching job to work with this lady at an app startup.

My mom suffers from depression, anxiety, substance abuse with probably some other disorders not diagnosed yet. She has tried to commit suicide multiple times in the past year. I have never seen her this bad.

She desperately wants help, but it seems that all of the therapy she has found costs too much. She is low income in the southeast US. Today she called me to say her friend recommended this AMEN Clinic to perform a SPECT scan ($3500). She thinks it will find all that is wrong and be able to fix her. After some reading I am very skeptical.

Does anyone have experience/knowledge on this?

If not, what treatment should she be seeking out and do they offer any assistance to low income individuals?

I don't even know if I want to find out what I truly have, but I have this one symptom that bothers me the most. I have been lacking a personality and sense of self for about an year. I just feel like I don't know who I am. Nothing gives me strong reactions anymore, I don't have an inner voice anymore, I don't feel like doing anything, and I feel apatethic towards everything. If someone asked me to tell them a few words about myself, I would genuinely not know what to say besides my name and age. I don't have likes and dislikes anymore, I don't have core values, ideas and even the memory of who I used to be a few years ago has faded.

56,"Hello everybody, and thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to offer some suggestions here. I will try to describe my situation as briefly and as accuratelly as possible.

Background: 
I am 35 years old. All of my life I have been very clumsy, have lacked physical coordination, have had difficulties to engage socially and personally, my discipline issues caused difficulties at school and university, my decision making has always been poor, I am very emotional (get triggered in any good or bad emotion quick and easily), I have used alcohol and drugs for more than 20 years (not as an addict but clearly with lack of self-control). I have been changing cities frequently for the past 10 years.

Situation:
Despite all of the above people has always considered that I am smart, but I think that they are tricked to believe that because I can articulate my speech well (I don't stutter, I finish my sentences, I listen and conduct conversations with structure). Now I have grown professionally and can keep growing at least two steps more in the ladder in the next 5 to 10 years but I feel that my difficulty to understand the big picture or complex systems is very very very limited.

I would like to train my mind to increase it's ability to understand and memorize this complex systems with interconected subsistems because right now I can only see linear unrelated sequences, I am not connecting the dots where other people can do it fast, I cannot remember simple facts or figures that other people keep the back of their mind, I don't consider all that is necessary to make business decisions, I don't ask the right questions when receiving proposals. Although all this can be dealt as separate skills/competences I feel that overall I have a cognition problem that I describe (because it feels just like that) as having a big stone inside my head that doesn't allow thoughts to flow correctly.

In the past I have been to a neuropsychologist who told me that everything was fine with me. In Chile a psychiatrist prescribed me paroxetine which I quit when moved to Denmark (where I am now). I have described this to my GP (as it is very difficult to get a psychiatrist appointment here) and she ordered blood tests and an ECG.

What I request from the community is to suggest a booko or online resource with exercises that can help me gradually overcome my lack of intelligence.

Once again, thank you

What happened to being a dependable daughter? What happened to being capable of being independent while dating? Why am I suddenly so scared? I don't know who I am anymore.

65,"I'm from the UK and I'm having issues with my brother, whom I suspect has a mental disorder.

I'm 19. He's 15 currently, but it started when he was 6. He's been manipulative and antagonistic almost his whole life - me and my mother have had a running joke of 'oh he'll be better when he's' and then say however old he'll be next year. He's only gotten worse. It's a 3 person household - my father left over a decade ago, and I haven't seen him for many years.

Manipulation is really the key word here. He's mainly terrorizing my mother, and I worry for her health. He's found out what areas she's most fragile: She doesn't want other people in the house as she's ashamed of the state of it. She doesn't want outside interference or escalation of any event. She wants to keep the peace, and more than anything else, she cares for the safety and health of me and my brother. She's a really good mother, but she's suffering at the hands of a really bad person.

He targets every single one of her weak points directly, in order to get her to do what he wants. He threatens to call the police, child protective services, he threatens to invite people over in any way he can. He has taken photos of the house and threatens to send them to people should he not get what he wants. If something doesn't go his way, he ALWAYS escelates things, and makes situations more and more toxic until things go his way. He threatens to cut himself, and commit suicide. He uses it as a threat - a weapon he holds over us. He hoards scissors and knives to make things worse. If he doesn't get his way, in the past, he's stood in front of my mother, cutting himself until she caves. Until she gives in and does what he wants. It's necessary to say here that she's also disabled, and can't physically get up to stop him.

He makes demands, and threatens punishments for everything. Even when he's in no position to punish; if I don't do something he wants, he'll threaten to get my mother to take away something I value, such as the internet, in order to have power over me. He uses his dominance over my mother to control me too. If it weren't for concerns about my poor mother, I'd abandon this household as quickly as I could.

He's a compulsive liar. He'll lie about anything, even things he has absolutely no reason or motivation to lie about. Of course, he'd tell you otherwise. He's shockingly good at it too - he'll keep up stories for months at a time until it's accepted as fact. He is hell bent on painting me as a liar, and me as violent, even when he has to reach years into the past for any example of violence. If he's trying to push the story, he'll come charging down the stairs, whimpering and claiming I was behaving violently, and continues acting skittish until my mother's empathy kicks in. I don't know why he does this, I don't know why it's so important for him to uphold lies. In his eyes, everyone else is the villain.

He's completely self-serving. Even if he's acting nice, he's doing it because he's getting what he wants, or there's something he desires. He'd pretend to form a meaningful relationship, pretend that everything is improving and getting better, and that he's taking a turn for the better, until he doesn't get what he wants. Then it all comes crumbling down and it's back to threats of suicide. He has friends, but never for very long. When he does have friends it's because they provide more to him than he has to provide himself. Even if the things they provide are simply endless compliments - if that's what he wants, that's what he'll make people give.

He loves to be in control. If he's ever not in control of a situation, he'll go through the weakest person available until he is. He seemingly has no empathy or remorse... but again, he denies that. He denies all of it. He thinks of himself as infallable and great. He's incredibly protective over his intelligence, and wants everyone to 'know' how smart he is. Despite this apparent wisdom, he forced my mother to get him withdrawn from school. He gets everything he wants, and when there's nothing left for him to want, he'll go out of his way to degrade my life. Everything always has to be better for him, and worse for those around him.

He goes about it any way he can. With threats, emotional manipulation, and what he does to my mother I can only describe as psychological torture. That's what it is; it's torture. She cries constantly. She is not happy, but he doesn't seem to care. He'll beat her when she's down and torture her more as long as there's something he can get from it.

From an outside perspective, everything's fine. He acts happy in front of his friends, and is even quite charming, but inside his nest everything is different, and he's the tyrant. He's only gotten better at it over his near decade of practice. No matter what, he never sees fault in himself. Why would he? Denying fault is only beneficial to him. He's manipulative, malicious, and cruel. He bullies my mother into subservience, and uses her command to issue control over me.

The worst part is, despite seeing all of this, nothing changes. I've spoken to my mother at length, she knows all that I do. You just can't win; this isn't something you can beat by knowing about. When he wants something from me, he twists my mother until she's begging me to give in and do what he wants... and it's really hard to say know. It's hard to look her in the eye and disobey her, and make her cry harder. And he knows this; if this wasn't the easiest way to take control over what I do, he'd find some other method.

I've tried talking to other people online about this, but he spies on everything I do, and threatens all that he can. If I don't stop talking poorly about him to people he'll never meet, then clearly I deserve punishment in the most severe form he can give.

I need help. I really need help. PLEASE. what's wrong with him? what can I do? anything that immediately comes to mind has been tried. Anything that involves him having a say will default to going well for him (so obviously he'd refuse any psychologist analyzing him), so I have to beg you - the people of this subreddit. What do I do? I'm running out of options and hope. I don't know a worse person out there, his cruelty is endless. It's making me question my attitude to life of ""everyone is a good person at heart"", because if you show any kind of remorse or empathy, he'll find a way to use it for personal gain.

What is wrong with him?!
