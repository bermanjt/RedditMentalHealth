0,"My doctor gave me medication to try but I'm too scared to use it.

The medication is Elimite cream.

I'm scared because I'm scared of a negative side effect. In this post, I will be substituting the real negative side effect that I am scared of with another side effect (I'm not sure why I'm doing this, I think I don't want to jinx myself or something).

So to be clear, I will not be mentioning the real negative side effect that I'm scared of.

Negative side effect that I will use in place of the real negative side effect: seizures and death

Also, all the things that happened in the post, did happen. I only replaced the real negative side effect with the seizures side effect. I changed the details a bit so that it works with the seizure side effect but the story is pretty much the same.

I was on google just reading random reviews of the medication. A user commented on reddit that it gave him/her seizures. And the seizure could have led to death but thankfully he/she went to the ER in time. It was only a temporary seizure and he/she was fine again. I didn't think anything of this review, really.

But then that same day, I came across a post on reddit about a person having a seizure disorder. The post was on the front page. This was strange to me because I don't seek out posts about seizures, I don't frequent seizure subreddits or anything. I don't even google anything seizure related. I had no ""interest"" or fear of seizure at all, because it was just irrevelant to me. I rarely come across posts about seizures.

After that post, I still wasn't so scared about trying out the medication. It was probably only a coincidence.

The next day or two days later, my cousin pretended to have a seizure. I'm not kidding. This was when I got really scared of the negative side effect, of getting a seizure and dying.

I don't think it's that my brain is purposely noticing seizure topics all of a sudden. Like you might say, those topics regarding seizure were always there, I just didn't notice them until now. I don't think that's it. I'm noticing them because they are only showing up now.

Later, I was thinking to myself, ""What if I wait and try the medication in 2 years or something? Maybe then I won't have the negative side effect."" Why I had this thought was that, in a way, I have a belief that there is a right time for things.

I do have OCD but I feel like there is some truth in the timing thing.

There are ppl who didn't find out the answers to their medical problem until like 5 years later. For example, a woman had cough variant asthma and the doctor didn't diagnose her with the correct diagnosis until 16 years later. And that's actually a pretty long time to get a simple diagnosis.

 So I feel like timing is pretty important. I got pretty hopeful that the medication will work, without the seizure and death side effect, if I just wait and give it more time. If I wait a couple of more years, I will be X years old when I use the medication. But right after I was thinking this, I went on YouTube and the first video was about a seizure. I'm not joking. And I do not watch videos on seizure disorder on Youtube, ever. The video was from a channel I frequently watch, but still. 

I then went on Reddit and the first post on the subreddit was something like, ""I am X years old"".     
The person was X years old, the age I would be if I were to wait a a couple years to try the medication. I don't know if this is a positive sign or not. Meaning maybe if I give it a couple of years and wait when I'm X years old, it will be fine. But it showed up after the seizure video. 

A couple of days later, my aunt made a remark about something seizure. How she can't really start a business because of something seizure.

It seems as if all the signs is saying that I will have the negative side effect if I try the medication.

I do have OCD so I'm trying to brush it off as just mere coincidence. But the thing is, don't even normal ppl, ppl who have a healthy mind, ppl who don't have OCD, don't they also consider things that happen to be a sign from the universe as well? Like even a normal person will think that if there was a thunderstorm on their first day of work, that it might mean this job isn't for them. Or that if they missed the 9/11 flight, they will think, ""This is a sign from the universe, God was helping me.""

It's not like I went out to seek these signs. They popped up first and I only noticed them. I'm trying to tell myself, it's all just a coincidence but I don't know.

I don't know. I don't want to try the medication and get a seizure and die. The real negative side effect is something that will significantly lower your quality of life.

Because I have a history of OCD, I'm having a hard time recognizing that the signs are just a coincidence, they don't mean anything. But at the same time, there were too many signs.

Even though I have OCD, I'm still trying to not assign meaning to the random events regarding the seizures. I try to analyze the signs objectively, like how I would without OCD, and the signs still seem a little strange for me.

I don't know if it's my OCD that is making me think there is a connection or maybe the universe is really giving me signs, which, even normal ppl without OCD thinks that the universe gives them signs too.

I would like for the signs to mean nothing. Can anyone guarantee this? Can any doctor guarantee 100% that I will not get the negative side effect?

Edit: A user commented that I should post the real negative side effect if I want advice. Real negative side effect is blindness

7/21/18- Last night, I had a dream that I had a seizure and I could not stop it.

I don't know if I'm having this dream because I'm thinking about the negative side effects of seizure and death (they say you dream about what you subconciously think about, or what you think about often) or if it's a ""sign from the universe"".

Believe me, I am trying to tell myself, all those signs about the seizure and death is just a coincidence. I am trying to not assign any meaning or relevance to them. I am trying to be positive. I am telling myself, ""I will not get a seizure and die."" I am trying to only think positive thoughts.

I do not have a job atm because I do not want to spread scabies to the community. I need to work though. I don't know what to do.

Regarding the review where the user had a seizure from the medication, I realize that the user may have used an older medication like Lindane. Maybe he/she left the cream on for too long. Maybe he/she had pre existing conditions. Despite all these possibilities, I'm still scared to use the medication.",22Jul2018,2

And the thing is, my psychosis has been getting worse recently because my insomnia came back and now I'm sleep deprived. I made the mistake of acknowledging a hallucination in front of my worker, and now she wants to send me to the hospital.

3,"I cannot even ***BEGIN*** to articulate what I am feeling right now.

backtrack: My first bout of what I believe is depersonalization occurred when I was in 5th grade and I experienced it again in little bouts till now (15 and going into 10th grade). However, what I have been going through as of late is so different and scary. I don't even KNOW if it's dp/dr or if i'm going PLAIN CRAZY. It's as if in the past week my life has turned upside down.

It all began last week when I began to feel vaguely depersonalized. However, last thursday night, it full blown hit me. And I don't even know if it is DP, because I don't have all the usual signs this time around.

I am afraid I am going to be the girl who went mad, the girl who forgot herself, the girl who went insane.

I do not know what is wrong with me. 

as I said before, I've had depersonalization before, for sure. The simple ""I dont feel like im in reality"" sensation. It's horrible and yet when I'm in the thick of it I know WHO I am. I simply feel distanced from it, from the world, from myself. So i'm not even sure that is what i'm suffering with. It feels that mine is on the other end, the insane end.

I don't necessarily feel as if i'm questioning reality like I used to but rather I'm questioning MYSELF.

It occured about a week ago. I suddenly felt, with distinct conviction, that I don't know *who the fuck I am or supposed to be.*

Even now, it feels like an act. It doesn't feel like dp or dr. I don't feel as if I am in a play or slow motion, I merely feel confused to be in my own skin, to be writing this, to responding to my own name, to regard pictures and videos with myself in it. Who even is that person? I feel as if my sense of self is dying, as If I am truly mad, as if I demand medical attention because for some reason I am so lost. I feel as if I am playing the life of this girl, but I am not her. But her memories are not mine. But I am not sure HOW I am supposed to act. WHO I am supposed to be. And it's scary. and it's fucked up. and I need straight jackets and morphine and tranquilizers because a wave of hot panic rolls over me when I think about who I am. I am afraid  I will never find 'home' again becasue I QUESTION EVERYTHING. My brain is in self destruction mode. anny semblance of familiarity or normalcy it seeks to destruct. 

I don't know who I am. I don't know, I'm scared.

I want to live again. I want to look at my eyes in the mirror and knnow with a burning conviction it is ""me"". Yet what I fear is that I am so far gone that person, that PERSON, isn't even IN me to be found. I need a godly miracle, I need hypnosis, I need a blunt and some music and a late night drive for 10 ish hours and maybe a beer and a long, long, nap. Nothing matters anymore. 

I am not afraid of anything else besides this. I want nothing but to feel normal again. if i were to ever return to myself I think I would just cry. I think I would just weep and wake up grateful every single morning. such a small and innate thing that I had a week ago feels like the biggest blessing and treasure in the world that everyone in the world has except for me.

I feel like this isn't DP (although i HAVE had it before) and rather I'm just plain insane. I look at myself, I look at all the old things this person used to do, and I don't feel comforted by them anymore. They don't feel familiar.

I just want to curl up and sob and cry and never wake up, ever again. because living is more painful than any death ever could be. i am so far gone. each time i think about who i am i realize i don't really know. i feel like i am surely they only one in the whole world who has ever experienced this because no matter where i look, no one seems to have had this which seems totally different and separate from dp/dr although i was feeling depersonalized leading up to it...that's why i think I'm going insane. i just need a hug and a good cry and a time machine :(((

living in my own brain is too scary. i have stopped being productive and just sit around all day trying to drown out my own brain with youtube videos and music, afraid to think or exist, because of how further down the rabbit hole i will go. i expressed this to my parents and actually had 2 meltdowns but no one gets it.

4,"Hey guys, how are you?

I have a dilemma that maybe you guys could help solving. I have took clomipramine for 1 year until april of this year. Then, because of my side effects, my doc switched me to zoloft using a fast cross tapering scheme. Cross tapering went OK since I noticed tinnitus and my doc and me decided to stop all meds to check if tinnitus would persist.

With that, tinnitus persisted, I am not 3 months without any med, and I'm feeling very anhedonic (but uh, I've never felt this, I wasn't depressed before the meds!). I'm also very anxious now.

Routine is being hard with feeling no pleasure at all, and it depresses me to check posts on survivingantidepressants stating that recovery can take YEARS.

That being said... what would be my best option? To reinstate on clomipramine with a very low dosage? Is it a good idea after 3 months without med? Or is it better to keep the cold turkey scheme now that 3 months have passed?

What would you recommend me?

Diagnosis prior to this- OCD/Pure-O, andBPD,

Hey, everyone. 

I posted in here about 2 weeks ago about some things that were stressing me out. But now it’s consumed my life and I am unable to function. 


A little less than a month ago I started developing this random illness. 
I came home from working the dream job I had just been employed by. 
I drank a sleepy time tea(my nightly tradition at the time) and as soon as I went to lay into my bed I broke out into horrible chills. 

The next day I woke up covered in sweat and with a fever that was completely kicked my ass. I couldn’t even stand in the shower 


Well I go into work anyway, power through it assuming it’ll work it’s way out of my system. 

I start to feel better throughout the day, not the greatest. But I power through it. 

By the end of the day, the fever returns and I’m beat. 

I try to make it to a patient first, but by the time I’d have gotten there it would’ve been closed. 


I go home and take another rest and aim to go there the following morning. 


I wake up again with another fever and a sore throat. 


I go to the urgent care down the street from my house. 

They think I might have strep throat, but the swab test was negative. 

They give me a set of anti biotics and write it off as an oral infection. 

I take them and I think things got worse from there. 

I began getting horrible sores throughout my entire mouth to the point I couldn’t talk/eat. 

I also had thrush. 

Swollen lymph nodes started, and so did a slight pain in my right testicle. 


After reading online for a bit, I came the the possible hypothesis that I had somehow contracted HIV. 

Obviously hoping that was just being a modern day google hypochondriac, I still was set on getting tested. 

All of this was by Sunday. 

That Monday was filled with nothing but pure anxiety. 

My heart was racing incredibly, horrible racing thoughts, and just completely freaking out over the thought of having HIV. It was so consuming. 


I finally get some sleep later that night, except I wake up at 2 am in a horrible panic. 

I had this who/where am I feeling and I shot right up and went into the biggest panic attack of my entire life. 

I ran downstairs staring into my mirror and observing the oral sores and thrush in my mouth and began hearing this screaming in my head saying “I’M DYYYYYYYINGGGG”

I ran upstairs and took a hot shower for over and hour trying to get myself to relax. And genuinely considered going to the emergency room afterwards(it was a mess aha) 

I finally exhaust myself and fall asleep. 

But I wake up the next morning with horrible vertigo. Everything was crooked, my memory was sorta funky, and my coordination seemed slightly off as well. 

Driving felt like I was the captain of an upside down submarine. 


I obviously went to the emergency room immediately at this point. 


I explained to them my fear of HIV, they asked me the basic questions needed for that. 

-Have you been out of the country lately?
(No)
-Have you shared used drug/diabetic needles recently?
(No, I’ve never done a drug in my life)
-Have you had unprotected sex in the past few months?
(Yes, with one person prior to dating my girlfriend at the time. And then obviously my girlfriend.) 

Obviously I haven’t felt as I’ve been involved with any risky activity. But still, ya never know aha. 

They draw blood from me and do routine blood work. They couldn’t test for HIV, but could still obviously look for all the viral sights that would indicate HIV. 

Nothing indicating inflammation. 

And as well as my White Blood Cell Count was perfect. 



They write it off as Hand, Foot, and Mouth and send me home with some stuff to kill off the thrush and the sores. 


The antiviral they gave me didn’t do jack shit, honestly. 

Neither did the magic mouth wash. 

I go to my family doctor a few days later just to get a second opinion. 

I explained to him all of my concerns and at this point that the left side of my head felt sorta numb and just empty. I’m also experiencing vertigo and some memory problems. 

Obviously I tell him about my HIV fear, and possible other autoimmune problems. 

He tells me that even though my risk factors are .00001% of being realistic, that he would still test me for it as well as full bloodwork. 

He gives me something for the thrush that works instantly btw. 

He also tells me that sometimes when you get hit with a nasty virus, it could mess with your head badly. Nothing that you won’t recover from, but it’s not uncommon. 

I go to get full blood work after he writes me the script for it at an outpatient lab. 

They take my bloodwork etc. 



Later that night things get really bad for me. 

I haven’t slept for more than an hour for 6 nights now, and I haven’t eaten anything other than vegan protein shakes in the same time period. 

Everything starts spinning horribly, I feel disgustingly sick, and I’m honestly freaking out at this point. I couldn’t even talk straight. 

Weird part is ever since this happened. My OCD compulsions have completely become dormant. 

Well anyways, I have to Uber to the emergency room again. 

I tell them all the issues I’m having the best that I could at that moment. Ya know, having cognitive issues out of nowhere and haven’t slept properly in a day short of a week, you’d probably come off crazy as well. 

They didn’t believe that any of my problems were real. 

The whole room was spinning and they thought it was just anxiety. They don’t give me any more tests other than another blood test. And then they drug test me on top of that. 

They throw me in the fucking crisis and say that I’m having a bad episode of Health Anxiety. 


They threw me in a room filled with some old guy barking the whole night, some Italian woman screaming for her kids, and some girl next to me with her hair completely ripped out of her head. 

(I hope those people get the help they need and I’m not putting their illnesses down, but I felt like I did not belong in a room that made me feel like I’ve lost my mind any more than I had) 


I spend an entire day in this crisis unit until some psychiatrist lady comes in to talk to me. 

She doesn’t listen to a single thing that’s actually wrong with me.
I feel like I’m actually dying, my worlds spinning, and I’m losing my mind. 

And he tells me “you have health anxiety, you’re fine. Just get rest. Your blood work was fine.”

They release me with my father and we walk across the hospital to pick up my blood work from the lab core. 

I read the results. 
“HIV Negative”

I completely broke into tears. 
Obviously, no part of me wanted to have HIV. 
But now I’m left without any answers. 
I’m losing my mind, memory, and extremely sick without answers. 


On top of that, my full blood work came back spotless. As well did my blood culture. As well did my urine culture. 



Things just get worse. 

I feel like I’ve lost my personality. 

I’m completely weak, and I’m just having tons of other issues. 

My memory is horrible, from somebody with amazing short/long term memory. As well as a very strong photogenic memory. 

My ability to read seems slower than it was. 

My ability to comprehend any situation is also impaired. Not horribly, but to the point where I notice it. 


I’ve also gotten horrible insomnia, and if I haven’t picked up some CBD oil I’d probably still be on weeks of no sleep. 

I had a CATscan done about a week ago as well. 
The results were spotless. Nothing abnormal and was told my brain looked healthy. 

At this point I don’t even know how to handle this. 

I’m constantly expecting the worst news possible, and in return getting amazing news. 

But I’m still sick, I’m having real neurological issues, and not a single test is pointing it out. 


I read a lot of articles this week that talked about Candida. Which is the growth of yeast in your stomach that causes bad bacteria to be born. Which is also an indicator of having thrush. 
I read that having that in your stomach can cause you to feel intoxicated. As well as cause balance, memory, and basic cognitive problems temporarily. 

I’ve always been a fan of herbal supplements, as well as before this situation unfolded. I had drank Apple Cider Vinegar every day. 
Followed a healthy vegan diet. 
Drank a gallon of water every single day. 
And took a multivitamin/biotin pills. 
Obviously a huge exercise freak too. 

So the fact I’ve even gotten sick after taking such good care of my body is beyond my understanding. 


But I had began taking Omega 3’s (Fish oil, I know they’re not vegan but the flax seed ones aren’t nearly as strong as these), 
Neuro-Mag, Ginko Bioblo, B12s, |Tintures- Lemon Balm, Oregano Oil, CBD, Olive Leaf, Cat’s Claw, and Licorice Root. 

Still trying to keep up hydration wise, and still doing my ACV shots daily. 


I also have been making smoothies/protein drinks with packages of Super Foods. 
Been putting WheatGrass in there, tons of bananas/almond butter. Occasionally Dragonfruit. Kale and spinach too!
Then I use almond milk as the base so I can blend it. 


I’ll be honest, yesterday was the FIRST day where I had a HUUUUUUGE bolt of energy. 
I felt promising. That I would recover and life would be amazing again. I’d become myself, just more experienced. That this was only a temporary problem. Even my OCD compulsions were back. 

I felt happy, I was singing in the shower. I wasn’t perfect, but it was a sign for the road to recovery. 

Then 3 hours later, it hit me. Everything went right back into slow motion. I felt like I was walking through gelatin. 

I was taking a walk when it hit, and everything got weird and confusing again. I felt like I was gonna fall over in somebody’s bushes. 

I slept well last night, but I feel super weak today. And just off balance. I also just feel extremely slow. 

Comparison to how somebody with Dementia or being Mentally Handicapped may feel. 


Prior to this happening I was a very socially aware person. Always helped people in need. Had a 4.0 GPA. 
Wrote poetry daily. 
Was gifted in so many different fields. 

Now I’m bedridden. I can’t do anything. 

I feel like the hugest burden to my family as they’re trying to carry me through this. But it’s causing so many issues. 

I can’t work right now, and they’re helping me win my bills. 

I’m constantly going in and out of doctors with them. 

I’ve gotten so obviously to the brink of suicide that I’m no longer allowed to be alone at night and I have to sleep in my parents room on a blow up mattress.  

My step dad’s begun drinking again. 

My grandmother’s crying every day. 

And my mother’s yelling every single day about how her summer is ruined. 


On top of that, ever since any of this started. My best friend hasn’t believed a single word I’ve said about being sick. He thought I just freaked myself out from reading HIV articles, and that this whole thing is a product of my imagination. 

He hasn’t reached out to me not once to see how I’m doing. 

And the only time I messaged him about it was to ask for help driving to get groceries because I didn’t feel safe driving/ going alone. And the the dude flat out yelled at me. 


I feel so alone. 

I feel like I’m living my biggest nightmare. 


All I wanna do is live the best life imaginable, but this is no way to live. 

I can’t do it anymore and I’m constantly thinking about taking my life. 


I wanna hit a reset button. Or go backwards somehow some way. I want some guarantee that I’ll be okay. I want some sort of answer of at least what is wrong with me. 

But no doctor will listen to me. 

Nobody in my family thinks there’s a serious problem.  


I feel like I’m in Hell. 

I can’t take watching myself continuously getting worse as I’m trying so hard to heal myself. 

This is no way to live. ",22Jul2018,12

After that I was in a two week day hospital program, and fell apart with no change immediately after and went back to cutting myself prolifically and watching suicide videos.

I continued in therapy and was still suicidal and cutting myself. My therapist left and I was supppossed to start with a new one but never did as I have trouble starting tasks. I'm in a DBT group once a week which isn't helping either. I'm going to start therapy again. I don't know what to do at this point. 

In some ways I've actually gotten worse since the hospital. I experienced seizures either from PNES or medication side effect. I've started abusing benzos after being introducsd to them by my doctor. I think about suicide all the time. My psychiatrist thinks I might have ADHD.  I have very severe rage issues and bite myself and struggle deeply with social interaction.  I have memory issues. I hate life and wish I jumped off that bridge or offed myself as a kid.

I'm a survivor of child abuse and have attempted suicide twice. I've been diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder, insomnia, depression, anxiety and considered for OCD and PTSD.  ",22Jul2018,4

23,"Technically more of an anxiety issue, but for me it goes hand in hand with my problems with depression. It usually only happens when someone asks me what’s wrong, I’ll open my mouth to answer and literally nothing comes out. I’ve been like this for years, but feel like it’s gotten much worse recently. It seems to be worse with the people I care more about or am closer to. Currently the worst part is being in a new relationship and it’s causing problems already.  He knows I’m trying, but says it still feels like I don’t trust him or feel safe enough to talk to him. 

Just wondering if anyone had experience dealing with this or any tips to help me get past it.

24,"So in a relationship there is supposed to be some level of understanding of eachother, a level of trust. Now i know that there is supposed to be some level of criticism that's healthy and well meaning. But i didn't know the difference between abuse and criticism.

During my last, which just so happened to be my first, relationship i was happy. I was amazed that a shy, quite, nerdy guy like me could get with anyone. Yeah i had some crushes here and there but this girl approached me. She made me feel like i was on top of the world. But i should've seen there was something beyond that ""I love you"" she told me every day.

As the months went by things got bad. For one she was horney as all living hell. Now i don't havr a high sex drive, i know this might me cringey to say but when i wanted a relationship, i wantes love. I wasn't ready, bug she convinced me anyway. Let me be clear, i wasn't raped, i don't think i was at any point. But i did feel disgusted with myself, i felt a great deal of dissapointment. But i convinced myself that this just what a relationship was. So i told myself to get over it.

Riding along this time, every month she would break the relationship up so i would beg her to stay. She would convince it was my fault for the end of the relationship for the 8th time. It always ened the same, with me on my hands and knees begging for forgiveness, then after she felt she was convinced and i felt i could go to sleep, i would put my face in my pillow mumbling to myself, ""I'll be good to you this time i promise"".

I couldn't have my own privacy, she forced me to give my passwords to all my social media accounts, i couldn't talk to any other girls, not even my bestfriend who is a girl, and if my girlfriend didn't like someone, i was to cut all contact with them. 

She always stated that she was the man in the relationship, that she was the one to pull weight. She would tell me that i was either too fat, or too skinny which lead to me either not eating, or eating more than i would.

At this point i felt alone, depressed, and sexually frustrated. She made me feel like she was all i had, all i will ever have, and all I'd ever need. 

After months of this, i just felt like a dick appointment, when i expressed i wasn't in the mood, she would often make fun of me. Asking me why she had to push sex, or if i was gay. Eventually getting me to comply, often reluctantly. She would cry, and get angry with me when i fully explained why i was uncomfortable. I convinced myself she loved me even if it was only in her own twisted way. But when i wake up to my pants unziped and her rubbing my crotch while she was leaning over me, at that point i realised i couldn't trust the very person i was supposed to be sleeping next to.

We have long since been separated, but even then i still don't feel all that right since those months. I feel very self conscious about myself, i can't make eye contact with myself in a mirror. I often find myself wondering what is wrong with me. I feel so anxious about everything. I always feel as if everyone is silently judging me for being either too weak, too fat, too weird or too much of a pussy. I feel nervous and anxious about women that i find attractive, and this often leads to intimidation. I don't know how to react to a complement from other girls even if it's something small. Like if a girl says she likes my shirt, that i have nice hair, or that i have gorgeous eyes. When a girl touches me like taps me on the shoulder, nudges my arm in a playful manner or offers a high five i flinch. When a girl even so much as smiles at me my mind goes in so many directions.

I feel like there is something wrong with me because when i try to explain this vaguely to my guy friends they often react like ""oh poor you"", or ""you should've felt lucky why are you complaining"". Sex jokes are commen with them and one time one of my friends said, ""I'm gonna shove my dick down your throat if you keep talking"". They laugh and i laugh only because i developed laughing as a coping mechanism for this. 

I don't hate women, I'm scared of what could happen if i go into another relationship. And when ever some girls flirt, or i think they're flirting with me, i get scared. I think that they're going to take advantage of me like last time. I just don't know how i feel, or how I'm supposed to feel anymore.

I want to deal with this. I just don't know how to go about it in a way where i don't feel scared or worthless. I'm not making this post for attention, I'm making it because at this point i don't know how to properly handle my emotions with others, especially girls.",22Jul2018,1
25,"&gt; Feeling like parts of your body do not belong there and are not “part of you” is related to body dysmorphia.

Do I have body dysmorphia? 10 years of therapy with six different therapists says I don't. But some redditors think I do. Who is right?

***

**Goal:** to be more comfortable in my body **Problem:** I feel very dis-connected from my sexually and reproductively dimorphic characteristics. I've had these feelings since I was about 12.

I don't like having breasts, hips, any of that. Don't even get me started on down there and up there and *in there*. Can't bring myself to have sex of any kind with anyone, or to try it myself, because I feel so dis-associated from those parts.

I don't feel I could use anything *in there* to carry and birth a child. It doesn't *feel* real. Intellectually, I know I have all the reproductive parts (except Fallopian tubes, because I had those removed), but it doesn't feel as if I *should* have reproductive organs at all.

None of my past therapists have diagnosed me with BDD, despite my insistence.

* My issues aren't mostly about my appearance. The biggest problem I have is with my uterus, and I can't even see that.
* I don't think about it for hours each day. I don't have ""persistent and intrusive preoccupations""
* My breasts are neither imagined, nor slight; I have mounds on my chest that anyone would agree are visible
* I don't avoid work or social situations because I fear others will notice my breasts or hips, it doesn't matter if others notice
* Most BDD sufferers seem to find issues with facial features, hair, skin, fat, muscles, etc. but these aren't the issues I have
* Mostly, when I went to BDD forums, their experiences didn't seem to fit mine.
* The only symptoms that applies is ""seeking surgery"" and camouflaging (I used to wear a chest binder, but I gave that away today because it's an unhealthy coping mechanism for BDD).

**I think I probably have *partial* DID because I'm only dis-associated with some specific body parts, not my whole body - I feel very disconnected from my reproductive organs/breasts/genitals but not from my arms, hands, legs, feet, face, skin, hair, heart, lungs, liver, etc.** I feel very ""real"" and ""in"" my body, except I feel that these specific parts (reproductive organs/breasts/genitals) are not a part of me, as if they are foreign objects.

Some past therapists have diagnosed me with gender dysphoria, but I am female and am comfortable moving through the world as a woman, so I'm not transgender. I *wish* I was transgender so that I could have top surgery and a hysterectomy, both of which I want, but I'm not trans! I just wanted to know what people here think. Thanks!",22Jul2018,0

27,"My step father who has been in my life for nearly 10 years has suffered from bipolar/depression since he was a teenager. He is 49 years old and we’ve always had a bit of a rocky relationship (I’m 20) and it’s been due to how he treats me, my siblings, and my mother. When he goes through his manic episodes, he says and does awful things that have scared my family to death, but my mom has always been forgiving because she knows about all of his illnesses. She has always chosen to forgive him because she believes he can’t help it. 
He’s said things to me like “I’ll always be more important to you than your mother”, lots of “fuck you” but sometimes he doesn’t even remember these things. He sometimes mixes his behaviors with alcohol and it makes things worse. 
My thing is, he doesn’t apologize, and my mother doesn’t make him because she says you can’t blame someone who doesn’t have control over their behaviors. She takes the blame and she says sorry, deals with the things he puts on her, but she always stays and I applaud her for that. Some days are so bad, some worse, some fantastic, and she says every day is different and she never knows what to expect. She won’t ever leave and I know she won’t. She’s so dedicated to loving him and all of his problems even if she feels like she’s in hell. 
My only issue is it affects my older (21M) and younger (16M) siblings. They are both sad at home and don’t understand the mental illness. I don’t live in the house so it’s easier for me. I personally don’t understand his problems either, and I’ve chosen to forgive because I’ve had deep conversations with my mother about what she goes through and I feel for her. I wouldn’t leave my love if he got sick.

And then the words slip out of my mouth, ""I want to die"". And it feels like a whole scene plays out of my head, me doing it, the aftermath of it all... Every. Fucking. Time. I tend to avoid alcohol now because even 1 beer triggers it. Some days it feels like a struggle to get on through, and I don't know why. But the worst is after the moments over, it just goes 'poof'...like the thoughts and emotions were a sick joke my brain played on me.

32,"I went to emerge a few days ago and they diagnosed me with borderline. I've been in therapy for 7 years but when I heard the diagnosis, everything made sense.

I'm truly not in a great state and I haven't been for years. My health makes employment very difficult. My abuser (my dad) who had a huge part creating my trauma died a last month. He was abusive to the end. My ex broke up with me 6 months ago and what destroyed us was my mental illness.  I'm in a lot of pain right now. I just want my life to move forward and improve. I don't want to live in the past like I have been for the last 6 years, I don't want to hurt myself because I don't deserve all the self hate I feel.

I'm just trying to not feel bad and to move on with my life.

One big change I want to make  I want to be employed.  i'm 25, and I've never have been able to keep a job for a month because my anxiety is very strong along with being very deeply damaged by my abuser. I'm very behind in life and I feel so much shame. I have unrealistic ideas about societal pressure and I need to stay calm. I can barely get through employment programs without feeling emotional.

I also want to add even with exercise and medication, I have poor sleep. I often can go two nights a week with no sleep because of rumination. The stress I feel thinking all night often consistently makes me exhausted, and drained. I'm often sleep deprived. I can't stand the fact that I've been struggling with employment for so long. because of my health and poor attitude.

I was employed for a day as a cashier but I was very discouraged;  I felt so much guilt about how slow I was on cash register. I messed up and I made the company lose money. My boyfriend at the time expressed how my anxiety felt unprofessional. My boss told him he felt like I was going to cry at any moment. I felt bad my best wasn't up to par. After that experience I left. That was about a year ago. I am so demoralized how I'm going to get a job with my sleeping issues and self esteem issues.

when I was younger my dad would paint the world as unforgiving and tell me I was useless unless I overachieved, and now I feel horrible and anxious in new situations to torturous degrees.  I beat myself up over how stupid I feel and how nervous. I feel my life hasn't moved forward in years. I know though this is a stepping stone I need to get over to actually be employed long term though.

I sent my resume to a few places and I want to try again but I'm trying to let go of the shame I felt. I want to go in with positive feelings. I've done a lot of volunteer work but every time I go in I just feel so useless like i'm not contributing to anything meaningful. I want to be a valuable worker.

Can anyone give me tips on how to cope with these thoughts i'm feeling? I see my illness as another reason why I can't get employed but I know some part of me is capable of employment despite my challenges. This was really hard to write because it's a vulnerable topic for me and I'm sure not everyone is going to understand, but this is where i'm at in my life and it's been this way for so long. I want to break free.

I wanted to add, two months ago I had a wonderful experience at a print shop. I made it to 4 out of 5 days a week, which seems horrible but considering my health  It's huge. I was happy where I worked. Unfortunately during the last two weeks of the program I spent 3 days awake with no sleep except for 2 hours and started hallucinating. no nights of sleep are very common for me, but not hallucination. I had to stop the program for my health. I want to try it again once my health is better and my boss said he'd be happy to have me. He strongly believes I can get into the graphic design industry which made me feel amazing, but I want to beat the feelings I get before I try the program again.

Not only when making people laugh this happens after I hang out with my friends.

**Background:**My name is M, I'm a 28 year old male, who works in sales at a cell phone store. I live with my parents and I didn't finish college and I'm depressed. 

I have been for some time and to varying degrees. About 6-8 weeks ago I started taking Wellbutrin (first time taking medication) and at first I felt like it was working. Maybe the initial excitement was hope. But the last few days I've been feeling emotionally drained and depressed. **I don't know what to do.**

It's cylical. Some good things happen, I feel happy and then it ends. And I feel like it's been happening for the last ten years. I feel stuck in this vicious cycle and I don't feel like it will ever end.

I hate that all the things I wanted to do, I never did. And I hate that I'm only now going back to school and it's essentially going to take 4 years (provided I don't fuck it up again). 

Is there hope? What can I do to make sure I don't make the same mistakes again? I just want to live my life. I want to go on dates, go to bars with friends, I just want to feel like I have meaning and purpose. That I enjoyed life as much as I dread it.

37,"This happened in January 2017, at one of the lowest moments of my life.

I had been recently diagnosed with an incurable disease. It had made me quite physically ill for a time - my mental health was compounding that in a terrible way. I lost almost 30 pounds in under a month. I had to fight with hospitals to help me get a diagnosis - some refused to help at all. Some went so far as to say no help was needed. I'd lived on the street before, but literally feeling as if you are physically and mentally helpless, and then being refused help by those who take an oath to do no harm - that's almost like an iron nail in a coffin.

It got so bad one day, that after an exchange with my stepmother, I decided that I needed to kill myself. It would be better for everyone. As I went out to my balcony (22nd floor), I made preparations. Based on what I had read online, you needed to jump with intent and forward motion to ensure that you died - I didn't want to live and be crippled and suffer as more of a burden in my family's eyes.

As I went to jump, I reached the balcony and something stopped me. I'm not sure if it was fear or what, but as I stopped (I was sobbing at this point - and I don't cry a lot) ancestors seemed to be around me - just talking. No ""don't do this"" bravado. Just there, as if to calm me, and someone said ""go inside and drink the bottle of wine"" and I argued a bit, but I ended up going inside anyway. As I went to get the wine, apparently I fell so hard I crushed my garbage can and blacked out.

The next thing I remember was waking up on the floor next to my garbage can. I surmised from the pain in my side and the state of my (now crushed) garbage can what had probably happened.

I don't know why I'm here. But after that experience, apparently some people do know why I'm here. I haven't had any serious suicidal thoughts since that incident. I'm certainly not free of mental health concerns, but that's a big one that has gone out the window since then. And for those wondering, yes I am under appropriate care now.

41,"[Backround info:]

In 2014, I was hospitalized on a 5150 hold for a suicide attempt and diagnosed with MDD. I saw a series of Psychiatrists who would drop me without a word after an appointment or two, but who wanted to diagnose me with BPD and PTSD. This was after 2-3 appointments in the same company. 

Fast forward to 2016-2017 - I had a new Psychiatrist who actually listened and tried to give a bit of support, but who also recommended I see a Psychologist while she was treating me (which the others failed to do). She wouldn't tell me my diagnosis, but she disagreed with BPD and agreed with PTSD. She had me on a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants. Before I discontinued them, I was on Sertraline (Zoloft), Mirtazapine (Remeron), and Divalproex (Depakote).

I had one session with the Psychologist that she referred me to before I left because I was sick of switching between doctors and meds constantly, and when talking about social anxiety with the Psychologist, her solution was to just talk to someone (which is a very big step from where I was). She would often interrupt me before I could get my statements out, and overall, I felt like she didn't really understand or care. 

I stopped seeing both the Psychiatrist and Psychologist in early March of 2017. I also stopped my meds without tapering. I didn't notice any major issues from doing so.



[Current Info:]

It's been over a year, and I've had my ups and downs, but lately I have been under a very large amount of stress relating to current relationship conflict, as well as my sleep cycle, and my schedule.

I work night shift, and I work 4 days a week. I go to school 2 days a week. On the last extra day that I have, I sometimes get asked to cover a shift or I end up doing schoolwork. 

I don't really hangout with anyone outside of work or school, aside from my partner. I usually stay inside and only go out for grocery shopping or other similar tasks.



[Possible symptoms I've noticed:]

I've been massively forgetful lately. I've left the keys in my car in the ignition in a public place about 3 times in the last 6 months or so. I have also forgotten extremely important due dates, such as midterms, and I sometimes have small lapses in memory regarding conversations I've had with people - I usually need reminders to catch my memory back up.

I've also noticed that my thoughts have slowed down. They used to be there constantly with internal dialogue, but lately (for the past month and a half or so), I've been having moments that can span up to an hour or so where my mind is literally blank and I don't have any thoughts at all. Usually the thought(s) that follow that are along the lines of ""Wow, I haven't really thought anything for a while"". 

I also feel very empty. As in I don't feel emotion very much anymore. I used to feel too much, and now I find it very difficult to genuinely feel anything at all. I can laugh and react in conversation appropriately, but while I do, I feel absolutely nothing. This has also been happening for the last month and a half or so.

I feel like I've lost my ability to relate to people in everyday conversation. I can still sympathize and empathize, but when I'm talking with them, their words register, but I really don't have any internal reaction to what they're saying.



[Wrapping up:]

I know this is extremely long, but I don't know where to go from here, except to a Psych office, and that's not something I can do right now with my current schedule. I have to wait until at least December when the semester is over, and that's a very long way off. I'm wondering if anyone can relate to, or identify some of the symptoms to explain what the fuck is happening. I feel like half of my personality just walked out on me, and I don't know how to fix it.

42,"Background: I'm in my 30's/female, have been diagnosed with OCD and social anxiety, and am going through a significant depression for about two years after a major health issue. 

This isn't a new symptom, but something I can remember dealing with since I was a kid, but has gotten worse. Whenever I'm enjoying myself with my family, with friends I can't help but remind myself that the people I love are going to die one day, or something equally awful. It competently takes me out of the moment, and it sends me into a rapid spiral that makes me feel desperately unhappy and powerless. 

Tonight, for example, tonight I had a really nice visit with my siblings and after everyone went home I couldn't stop crying because of these thoughts.

43,"Okay, here’s a little backstory for where I’m at now: 
My mother died in 2013 from cancer a week after my 18th birthday and I’ve never been the same person.  (im an only child who grew up solely with my mother).  And her death really cut me deep. (I’m 23 now) 

I went through a major depressive state from 2013-2015 where I didn’t really sleep/ eat or go out. I lost a lot of weight (went from a UK size 12 to a 6/8 in a month). Mind you I decided to start university during this time, something I deeply regret as it just made my mental state worse. As a child I was raised to be distrustful of my extended family so I completely pushed them away during this time. I changed my number and moved away. I didn’t have the support system of s family that most students had and I was very distrustful of the people I met during my time there as I didn’t really know them and could not figure out their intentions. I did not tell anybody, other than people who knew me before uni about what I was going through. Kind story short I was very socially isolated during my time there, I smoked a lot of weed to self medicate and in my first year I quit. I came back the following year to retake and flunked out. 

I was raised in an academic house so education was my only plan. I applied for university again as soon as I could. Fast forward to now... I’ve almost finished my undergrad, I’ve got one module to complete as I had to defer it. I’ve been on a two month work placement which was interesting and great experience. My issue now is going into the big bad world. For so long I was focused on getting my degree. I haven’t really made any plans for what to do after. I don’t really set goals for myself because it does feel like there’s simply no point. I feel like life is so unpredictable why bother. 
I’ve not been sure that law is what I want to do. I feel like my mother wanted me to do it so I did. I never really had the opportunity to step back and ask myself if this is what I want. That being say people always say do what your passionate about. That’s kinda hard when you’re in a depressive state and there is nothing about life you’re passionate about. 
I just feel like my life is an awful movie that I’m just hoping would end already. (FYI I think about death all the time but I’m not suicidal)


I haven’t left my house except to buy food since my placement ended last wedenessay. I’m just don’t feel like going out or facing the world. I don’t really have a social life so it’s not like I’m missing anything. Although a friend had a birthday gathering yesterday and I made something up and said I didn’t want to go. I do have a particular friend, an ex co worker who I used to go on nights out with quite a lot but now our relationship has been relegated to her calling me and telling me about her life. 


One BIG part of my social isolation is I’m a stress hoarder. I have loads of things. I can rarely throw things out. I’m always buying new things which makes the problem worse. I can’t invite people over to chill because of this. 

I’d like to get my life together and tidy up, apply for jobs, build new friendships, etc. I just don’t know where to begin. I keep telling myself I’m not depressed but that fact that I haven’t left the house in almost a week says otherwise.... I just don’t want to sink any further into this rut.

44,At 13 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and ever since it has taken over my life. I can’t get out of bed in the morning to go to work or do anthying. My family do not support me at all the give me a hard time about my mental health making fun about me to my face and telling me to kill myself. I am 17 and finding it hard to move out to start life over because I can’t find the courage to either go to work or get a proper job is there anything I can do to try and get my life back on track? ,22Jul2018,2
45,"My friend has disclosed that they are schizophrenic and in having a discussion about mental health they described a lot of symptoms they experience that my schizo-typical ex had. The relationship I had with my ex was codependent and abusive and took a huge toll on my mental health that’s taken about a year to recover from. I have no interest in a relationship with my friend and they seem to be self aware, at least moreso than my ex was, however discussing things that remind me of my ex is incredibly triggering and I’m not entirely sure how to change the subject or set boundaries properly. Emotional detachment only goes so far and I have a hard time balancing my own mental health (bpd, adhd, anxiety) with cluster a symptoms. I can’t avoid them since we work together and we’ve bonded over mutual interests but I’m wondering what the appropriate way to state that discussing their symptoms is triggering to me due to trauma without invalidating them or making them feel like they can’t confide in me.

47,"Hey everyone, I don't really know who I should have talked to about this so I feel like reddit was an okay place. I'm uncomfortable with discussing it in person with anyone anyway.

Simply put, I have huge urges to put other people in serious danger and it's very hard to keep under control. Whenever I feel this way I can either act on them or keep it in and let my chest burn. It's like a rush that comes all over my body and I get very shakey and nervous. When this happens I feel like I want to cause everyone around me to suffer and die. Sometimes it makes me very upset and I end up crying or laughing because I'm confused.

The urges aren't the only problem, however. The feelings are constant.

It gets very bad at night. I barely sleep anymore because my mind won't shut up and I can't make it stop for one single second. It's extremely scary for me because I can't escape myself or make it stop, it's me. Whenever I am lucky enough to fall asleep I wake up from very disgusting dreams that I would rather not talk about.

I habitually daydream and fantasize about causing people to suffer and it has de-sensitized me from feeling sympathy or empathy for anyone I see in pain.

Honestly, I don't feel very well in the head and I'm aware of it. I try not to be an irrational person and keep it all in, pretending to be decent like everyone else, but the real emotions slip through. It has caused every relationship I have ever been in to end because I feel like I want to die knowing someone else loves me. I did a great job on keeping myself calm but I just couldn't love her. I tried so, so hard. Even after giving up I tried pretending to love her, but the delusions caught up to me. I've ended all my relationships carelessly so I don't bother with them anymore. Every time I see other people in a relationship I almost feel bad for them, wondering if they are pretending to care about each other. I have come very close to convincing myself to suicide but I'm pretty sure I'll never do that, because I see no point in it.

Anyway, thanks for reading. This has been very uncomfortable for me to write as I hate talking about it.",22Jul2018,1
48,"This always happened to me. I like being playful, joking around, laughing, being cheerful...when I'm into this mood I feel energetic. But I noticed there's a downside to this mood. Everytime I feel like this, after a while I feel like crashing down and burned our if this is the right term. 

For example yesterday I went on a trip. I saw new things and got excited, I started to get into this ""playful mood"", laughing making jokes. After some hours, at the end of the day, I started to feel gloomy, and suicidal. These new feelings were mixed with the previous ones. I felt tired, though things like ""life is pointless why am I still here"".

So I noticed that after the playful mode I always get suicidal or irritated. It's like there is a limit to this playful mode and when I surpass it my brain can no longer be in it. 

Now my theory is that being in this mode is really consuming. You are constantly excited and tire your body and mind. I think laughing too could be tiring for the body, after you laugh you feel worn out. So the mind wants to find a balance, can no longer sustain these feelings. Then to compensate maybe you get sad, gloomy, it's a way to find the balance and rest. Is this a thing?",22Jul2018,15
49,"I don't often rant to people, so excuse me if I sound a bit unhinged, but I'm just really frustrated.

40 days ago, I posted here about things taking so long to happen in the mentally health system, and here I am. Since I posted that, I have had a single meeting with a counsellor, she said that I could talk to the psychiatrist when he got back from being on break at the start of July. 

Well here I am, nearly at the end of July and nothing has fucking happened despite me emailing the service that's supposedly to help me. I mean, it's been almost a month and a half, I've started self-harming again, I feel awful, I want help, and nothing hasn't happened!

50,"I don’t really know what’s wrong with me as I’ve finally got the motivation to go to the doctors and they basically said, “you’ll get better when you want to get better” and i need to stop being a victim. 
Basically, what I think (or what I’m willing to admit) is that i’m a very manipulative and controlling person without realising it sometimes? If i’m feeling insecure then i’ll end up making other people feel awful and it’s like it’s not me? bc after i calm down it’s like i’m picking up the pieces from a mess that someone else made? i’m having a hard time describing it but it’s like a completely different person takes over me and wants to make everyone else feel how i feel for some reason. i have no confidence and i can’t trust my long distance girlfriend for reasons to do with past relationships and red flags in our current relationship so i end up not controlling her, but manipulating her so she feels like i’m not controlling her? my grandma was badly ill earlier in the year and i felt nothing, she could’ve died and i honestly felt nothing, no sadness, no worrying, nothing, i’m probably missing vital bits of information and this is probably hard to understand so any questions are more than welcome, thank you if you somehow managed to make it this far through the post",22Jul2018,1
51,"I'm 31, male and have by now around 9 months of therapy behind me.

First 2 months daily ambulant therapy, so it went there in the morning and went home in the evening like work, just to work on my mental health instead of a normal job.

Then I had 24 weekly therapy sessions, each being 50min long.

So it's not like I haven't had help yet.
It's just that I'm at the point where I'm my biggest problem.
And that I currently have to bridge the time until my group therapy starts in this state...

I'm not expecting anyone to be able to cure me, hell I doubt even a professional could do that, but I hope to find advice on how to stabilize and prevent myself from drifting back into my void.


Anyways here's the list of the issues I am aware of right now:

- self-care
Caring for my self is hard because I don't feel like I'm worth the effort, so I only do some minimum maintenance.

- self-acceptance
Can't see this one happen any time soon, the sheer thought of accepting myself sounds to my like being told to ""set myself on fire"", why the hell would I do that?...

- self-responsibility
This one's failing because I'm afraid of taking responsibility in the first case, no matter what for.
I'm used to disappointing people who put responsibility for whatever into my hands, but there I didn't choose to be responsible, it was just forced upon me so I can somewhat cope with that.
But thinking about taking responsibility for something scares the hell out of me because I'm so afraid of fucking up.

- sadness
I've got a huge amount of sadness inside me which wants to be released. The problem is that my own mental self-preservation keeps it locked up because it was once way too much for me to handle.
So it's locked away from myself with no way of getting to it to release it but at the same time it's not locked away enough to not bother me.

- regrets
If I had to sum up my life in one word it'd be regret. I've made so many choices which I wish I wouldn't have made or made differently and I simply can't accept the fact that it's the past and won't change, no matter how much I hate and regret them.

- loneliness
I've been single almost my whole life, for a while by choice, atleast I convinced myself, because I got from relationship horror stories the impression that most girls just want to abuse you one way or another, trick you into spending money on them without giving back anything in return and if you refuse to they run around saying you raped them and whatever.
But eventually I realized that I simply can't be alone. I need a partner, I need the closeness, the warmth, the compassion, the feeling of being safe, of being valued, of being wanted.
For a short time I actually got to experience this when I met my now ex-girlfriend.
The first year was rough because she had trust issues due to her ex-boyfriend, but after she finally started to trust me we had a great time.
Sadly I eventually managed to fuck up and hurt her trust by accident and her subconscious was never able to forgive me. Not even years later.
We were together for almost 10 years but the actual relationship lasted maybe 3-4, with the last years of that already being the beginning of the end.
Now I'm back to the feeling of never finding my significant other.
Worse even, since I managed to wreck my last and so far only relationship I'm even more anxious about the next, because I might manage to repeat this.

- feeling of belonging nowhere
In addition to the above I'm also extremely uncomfortable around other people.
Especially when there are groups of friends or couples around, like at events or such.
It gives me a feeling of being a sheep hiding in a herd of wolves, trying to not be noticed because it'd be my end, so I instinctively want to sneak away.
And if isn't this bad then I tend to have at the very least the feeling that my presence doesn't matter, like if I were to go away no one would even notice.

- social anxiety
And now an addition to the above of this: I'm also afraid of social misbehaving, like doing anything that'd make people look weird at me or laugh at me etc.
Doesn't help that there are so many social rules that secretly develop so you don't even know that you broke one.
So whenever I'm ""out there"" I constantly worry subconsciously about social missteps.
One example is talking to a girl: the main thought that comes up is that I don't wanna bother her, because then everyone would look at me and be like ""look at that asshole bothering that girl there"".

- failure anxiety
I also have a strong fear of trying things, thanks to school where my attempts to actually partake in class ended up teaching me that trying something and failing is worth than death.
I know that this is completely bullshit since years, but the emotional reaction is almost unchanged, and just the thought of trying something where I can't predict the outcome from positive experience (aka, next to nothing) is to me like standing in front of a bear.

- sex drive
And the best (not) at the end: despite having depressions for 20 years now is my sex drive unchanged, aka still that of a boy in his puberty who could (sometimes) spend the whole day having sex.
It's luckily not constant but if I lack sufficient distraction and aren't drowning in self-pity/hate/hopelessness then all I can think about is sex.
Worst is when it surfaces while I'm outside because then every cute girl I see makes me aware that I neither have a girlfriend nor even an F+ and then I feel like shit.
Sometimes it's so bad that I even forgot for a while why I went outside in the first place.

56,"I am a 21 year old male. I have a history of depression and anxiety, and been taking different medication since my early teens. Last year was an incredible year with stabilized mental well being. I moved out from my dads house, I managed to work for 8 months, and I moved to another city to live by myself and finish my highschool studies. Life was great, I had a great social life, I started doing exercise on a regular basis and my problems seemed just a distant memory. It felt like I could finally stop worrying about what was wrong with me and start worrying about my goals in life instead. Bear in mind that I have taken Mirtazapine (30mg) for 3 years. And since last year I decided that I didnt need them no more. Without psychiatric consultation. And it has been a mistake I will never do again. 
I was stubborn enough to cope with the effects of leaving the meds for 3 months. Each month getting worse. First I started sleeping badly, only 4 hours each night. Then came the anxiety. For no apparent reason. Just there all the time. I was feeling abstinence. And in July 4 I was going on a trip to south america to see friends and family. And there is when my brain started to really behave strange. I began feeling lost, my thoughts were blank. I felt so many weird experiences. I had to cancel the trip one week in and get back home and get in the hospital. Started taking 30mg again and only some days now I have started feeling normal again. DO NOT QUIT MEDICATION BY YOURSELF. Dont be stubborn and who cares about society and judgemental people. For real. It is very dangerous to play with this. ",22Jul2018,40

58,"I fall in love with animals, and only animals; since I was a kid, as hormones kicked in, since then it's been so, I don't know any different.

And please stop talking about consent and comparing animals to children, you have no idea how tired I am or hearing that; it's selfish to think only humans are sexual and that verbal human communication is the only there is.

I am a rather friendly and easygoing, I mean no harm to anyone; but I cannot just pretend, put a mask and go around.

For whatever I do, currently working on moving to the countryside, I just have to hide my interests thoughtfully; while I don't care of judgement, it's the whole persecution part, people tend to be very fucking intolerant, and they'll fuck your life over if they want to; makes me wish not to talk to anyone, not feel close to anyone, and to be careful of everyone.

It is very stressing, older people I've talk to tend to isolate themselves because of this; people have such a fucking sense of superiority they reject anything different, even when they clearly don't give a shit about animals, just look at the state of the meat industry, but hey, if you love them you are fucked, you are a designated criminal for no reason at all, because love is worse than killing; made up BS.

I don't know if you ever feel society sickness, oh it's okay to be gay but not this; even when you completely fall in love and cannot hurt these creatures, no flimsy society broken ethics say it's wrong, even if in some places in the world is totally ok but being gay is wrong, it's very arbitrary; yeah I just happen to be both, so I'm a bottom; but apparently it is still rape, somehow.

Fuck this, no flimsy human made taboo legal BS is going to stop me, I was born this way; if anything it only makes me hate society more and more by the day. Because all this corrodes me, my zoophilia isn't a problem, society is, just like being gay in the 50s.",22Jul2018,1
59,"I love animals so much. They immediately make me feel so much calmer. It doesn’t matter what it is it could be a bird or a pig or a dog; if it’s happy to see me it immediately makes me feel lighter. 

Growing up we’ve always had dogs in the house and when the house is empty for whatever reason I feel kind of distressed, because when I feel sad I go and just lie down with our dog on the floor for 20 mins, but when she isn’t there I don’t have that comfort. I am currently out of town away from our dog.

I’m staying with my grandma, she has cats and it helps a bit but I went to a party yesterday that gave me a panic attack. I went outside desperate to get away and a dog came out of nowhere and sat next to me. I felt so much more relaxed with a dog next to me. She was the neighbor’s dog, who called her back shortly after she came up to me. I knew then that if I had an animal by my side in situations like this I would feel so much better. 

I’ve thought about this before but never felt it more strongly than yesterday. Yesterday was such a bad day. I started bawling as soon as I got home from the party. I would love so much to have a service animal. I know pretty much any dog can become an emotional support animal but if they weren’t specifically trained as a service animal I wouldn’t feel comfortable bringing them into inappropriate situations like grocery stores (where I often have panic attacks) or stranger’s houses. 

Also our family dog has trauma from being a stray and a heartworm treatment that was very hard on her, so she would have too many issues becoming a properly trained service animal. Like she is very uncomfortable with strange dogs and always pees if we take her into Petsmart. 

I’ve looked into purchasing service animals before but they are far too expensive and I doubt a charity would think my cause is worthy and there are so many people like me.

61,"So I'm a sixteen year old high school dropout doing nothing productive with his life. I dropped out about a year ago, and at first it was relaxing, not having to go to school or do homework or leave the house or interact with people. But now It's taking a toll on me. I don't have a sense of purpose or anything, but life seems, well, real shitty.

A bit of background: I have an often verbally abusive and occasionally physically abusive father. My mom yells often, but she's the nicer of the two. My brother and I get along, but we don't talk about our feelings ever. I don't like talking to people in general, so I try and avoid them. This leads me to often being nocturnal, which gets in the way of appointments for my mental health (life coach, psychiatrist etc..). I'm writing this just after 9 in the morning, as I got hit with a wave of insomnia as I was trying to go to bed. I'm super tired but I can't sleep.

Anyway, I've been having these thoughts like, ""What's even the point in living,"" ""Life is JUST pain so why keep going,"" and ""My parents don't like me, so who does?"" You know, suicidal thoughts. Thing is, there are so many things I haven't done that keep me going, so I don't want to die. These include: Having sex. Living alone. Buying something more valuable than overwatch. Having a steady job. Experiencing love. Growing a beard.

So I'm caught in this dilemma. I don't want to be alive, but I can't kill myself because I have so many things I still need to do. Sitting on my ass all day isn't helping me reach those goals, I know (my parents tell me EVERY DAY don't worry).

Just so you guys know, I've never actually had serious thoughts about killing myself, I just HATE being alive.

P.S. I think there might be some physical health problems that are contributing to this hatred of living. Stuff like malnourishment, dehydration, lack of exercise, and zero sleep schedule. I'm obviously not a doctor, just trying to find SOMETHING to explain any of this.",22Jul2018,26

I am a guy at his 20's and I have this weird problem. I don't think it's that bad but I feel terribly nothing. I can't feel sad, happy, or even mad at someone.

I feel easily frustrated and confused.

I am starting to feel like everything is a chore. Eating is a chore, taking a bath is a chore, and brushing my teeth is a chore.

TV shows, playing games, painting and those things I once enjoy feels nothing and whenever I try to do this activities it feels like I am doing it for the sake of doing it, nothing more.

I am starting to have this doubt at everyone, it feels like they were doing something bad behind your back.

It feels really weird. I would be cheerful because of simple things with friends, or loved ones. I'll be really happy whenever I'm with them though I'll be my usual self the moment they left. That feeling of nothingness feels more terrible after that. Prolonged company will start feeling dull eventually though.

I won't go too in depth into it because I always write way too much but I will write just enough so you understand my situation and can give me meaningful advice. 

(IF YOU WANT TO JUST RESPOND TO MY POST WITHOUT ALL OF THE BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE JUST SKIP TO THE VERY BOTTOM AND I HAVE A LIST OF SPECIFIC THINGS I WOULD LIKE ADVICE ON, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ALL OF THEM JUST WHATEVER YOU THINK YOU CAN HELP WITH BASED ON YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES)
      
       I didn't have the best family life as a child and was emotionally and sometimes physically abused by my older brother throughout my whole childhood. We got along sometimes but he just had some sort of anger problem that he would take out on me I guess. The rest of my family wasn't close to as bad, I had different disagreements with them because they just didn't know how to support me or my interests and would never let me choose anything for myself and suffered from their own mental health issues. They just shrugged all of his behavior off as sibling rivalry and I finally worked up the courage a few years ago to confront them about that and they wouldn't listen to me, they just don't know how to listen to other people's opinions. I still have awful anxiety dealing with him and the rest of my family to this day along with pretty much everybody that I know but it's way worse with my family.

     I was always intelligent but never was able to make myself study or do homework in school and those bad habits began to catch up to me at the end of high school and beginning of college. The only things I could really do were escapism hobbies like reading books, playing videogames, watching TV and things like that. My brother would make fun of me for anything I enjoyed as a kid and I have gotten a lot better about learning what I like and sharing my opinions with other people but I still cannot fully open up to anybody and continuously use escapist hobbies like the ones listed above along with frequent marijuana use and trying a lot of other drugs for the experience but not doing them often, just a couple times each to feel the differences in how my brain thinks when I'm on them if that makes sense. 

    Around 4 years ago I started to go to college which is the point that I think everything started to really collapse in terms of my mental health. I was unable to hold myself responsible and buy my textbooks so I was never able to do homework, I had awful anxiety attacks from the whole new situation and not knowing anybody and I just started to sleep in my room and not go to class. I flunked out after 2 weeks and didn't tell anybody but a few of my online friends. I began to get extremely addicted to League of Legends, unhealthy food and TV shows and that is literally all I would do for the entire semester. I never told my parents or a counselor or anything because my anxiety just had too much hold over my brain and ability to think logically. 

  I moved back in with my parents after that and my brother also did the same thing and it was just awful my anxiety and depression got even worse from dealing with my family and the shame of it all and I felt like a massive failure and waste of my potential. Eventually I started working minimum wage jobs and paying off my college debt and I eventually did that. After awhile, I decided I needed to get away from my family to find out who I was and what I wanted myself to be and just understand the world around me and I moved into an apartment with a couple of my ""friends,"" for a couple of years. I enjoyed being there more than living with my family because I didn't have someone constantly trying to control me as much as my family did. My car broke down and I had to take out a loan for one that I was unable to make the payments for after my rent and bills and what not and I was sued by them and I still have 4000 dollars to pay off and they just randomly take money out of my bank account whenever I have money in there so I can't save anything up along with my inability to stick to a budget and other issues. 

  Now we find myself in my current state, I was unable to be able to pay all of those bills and still focus on my future so I had to move back into my parents apartment and I just hate it here, they leave me alone for the most part because they know I want to be left alone but I'm just trying to figure out how to live my life without depending on anybody but myself and they don't really understand that I guess.

    I have tried numerous antidepressants, anti anxiety medications, cognitive behavioral therapy, reading self help books, reading books and articles about how the human brain forms habits, reading philosophy, meditation, yoga, lifting, cardio, acid trips, journaling, making music, writing code, just going for walks outside, and a lot more that I can't think of off the top of my head. My main problem is I just fall back into the same bad habits after a minor set back and I just don't enjoy life when I'm not appeasing the bad habits in my brain. I just can't make improvements over a long period of time and I am proud of myself for trying all of these things but I know I have the ability to do anything I put my mind to I just don't have the willpower to stick with them.


  Now that I have given you a small background of who I am I can get to the specific things that I need advice on. This list is not ranked in terms of importance just the first one that popped into my head.

SPECIFIC ADVICE SECTION:
        
       I have spent the last 4 years thinking about what I wanted to do for a career, I still don't really know for sure I guess until I actually do it but right now I am leaning towards working as a web developer. Over the past few weeks I have been learning CSS, HTML, and Javascript and although I can still barely do anything I genuinely feel that coding clicks with how my brain operates and it's an intriguing topic to me. The problem is my brain just doesn't work with uncertainties and whenever I try to make myself work a certain amount of time on it I just fail and stop doing it at all. This is how all hobbies work for me. The second that I feel I need to do it, I can't focus on it anymore and I just develop a mental block preventing me from thinking about it and I just sink into my hole of bad habits. I have researched it and found out it is possible to get a career in web development without a college degree although it is obviously harder. I would like to spend as much time as I can learning all that I need to to get on this career path but my parents want me to leave their apartment in 4 months and I still have $5000 in debt that I need to pay off based on 2 lawsuits regarding my car debt and chiropractic bill debt. I can't afford to pay that off while also developing good habits like eating healthy, having a gym membership and things like that along with unexpected problems that constantly happen to me like expensive car repairs, emotional spending binges related to my mental health issues and other things like those. I just want to get to the point where I can afford to live on my own and not have to worry about having enough money for basic necessities and affording the things I need to live a healthy lifestyle but these time constraints and my anxieties just can't figure out a way to get all of these things together. I only have 4 months to do all of this and I know it's not enough time and I just don't know what I'll do when my parents want me to leave in January. I barely could get by last time working on minimum wage and I have no friends left that I could live with anymore because I cut everybody in my life out and forgot how to socialize and nobody can stand me anymore. Anyway if you have any advice relating to this particular situation I would much appreciate it.

      My car can barely reach 30 miles per hour and it has an engine problem that I can't afford to fix and if it breaks down I would have no way of doing anything, I have health problems such as breathing issues, chronic thoracic and cervical spine pain along with tight muscles and ligaments all over and I always worry about what it is and don't have the money to constantly go to doctors and get tests and fix it and I always worry I have something serious, I worry about messing things up because I always do, I am a burden to everybody who I am in contact with and I want nothing more than to just figure my shit out and get it done but I just can't and nobody understands why even myself and I am resented for it. These are just a few of the anxieties that haunt me on a regular basis and I just can't deal with this shit myself. I have tried for the past 4 years, I've tried including my family, friends, therapists and everything but nothing changes me I'm just stuck in this awful cycle and I have contemplated suicide many times in the past for just the eternal nothingness of not feeling these burdens in my mind but over the course of my acid trips and some other experiences I have decided I want to be proud of myself at least a little bit before I die and I just can't die feeling like this. I think about this then I get a burst of energy for a week or so but then something happens and I slip back in the deep dark depression hole. The only things that make me feel anything in my heart are using drugs, music, comfort food and other escapist pursuits to fill that hole in my heart. Those are the only things that don't make me feel completely numb and like a waste of space in the world around me and that is I guess why I keep falling back into the same bad habits and wasting all of my time accomplishing nothing and being completely stagnant. There is just a mental block in my brain that I just can't get out of there no matter what I try and I just can't do anything and I've never received any advice that actually works for me. I don't know if my brain wires are just all crossed beyond repair at this point but I really do try and everyone has always just thought that I am just lazy. 

       I just have trouble accepting the imperfections in the world around me and that I will never be able to know everything that I want to know. This is totally selfish and naive but I guess I'm just an extreme perfectionist in the sense that if everything around me can't be exactly as my mind sees it as it should be then there is no point in trying because it's impossible to be just as I want it to be. I love many things about the world around me. For example, music is the most beautiful thing I could ever imagine. Just hearing how all of the different notes and patterns and lyrics just arrange into small glimpses of perfection in my mind's eye fills me with such joy. Music is the main way that I experience emotions as I have basically no real connections with any other people. There is so much imperfection that I see in people that while I know nobody can choose the way they are I guess it's mostly because I hate the imperfection in myself and seeing it in others reminds me it is present in my own ""soul,"" for lack of a better term. I binge on those little pieces of perfection to the point where I can hear one of those songs a few years later and feel nothing. I crave the emotion I felt in my heart when I listened to those songs in the past and how they helped me get through rough times. It's times like that when I just hate myself for not being able to feel anything at all. I want nothing more than to feel everything but I can't it's like my heart is dead and I can't get it back to life. Then a few weeks later I will love music again and I feel those capsules of all the emotions I want to feel and I am happy again. It's a constant cycle of feeling everything and feeling nothing and I can't tell if it happens naturally or if it's just random. I don't fucking know what to call it or if you even know what I'm trying to say whatsoever. I've never been able to put these feelings into words properly and nobody has ever understood when I've tried explaining this to them. This is the best way I can describe it... there's a chunk of time where I feel way too much, all of my emotions and just my entire sense of being are extremely vibrant and I actually feel alive and then there's a different chunk of time where I just feel no emotions I feel like a god damn robot on autopilot unable to feel empathy or care about anything, especially myself. I don't want to label myself as having any particular mental disorder as I understand everything is on a spectrum and nobody experiences a condition the exact same way as another person. I just want to find a word that describes this feeling of everything and nothing existing at different times in my brain so I can find other people who feel similar to me and I can feel like I belong on this planet for the first time in my life. I don't know if what I have is just bad depression and anxiety, bipolar disorder, a personality disorder of some sort, ADD, a combination of some of those or maybe not even any of those. I just have no idea and nobody I've tried to get to help me understand has been able to understand what I mean. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, ADD and depression but I never know if those numbers on their little test questions can even relate to how I feel. I can't put how I feel on a number scale I just feel complete or I feel completely empty. I don't know if I'm making any sense right now I'm sorry for all of this rambling. This is probably like 200 paragraphs more than it needs to be I cannot find the words to describe this, I never have been able to and it frustrates me. I just can't live with that empty feeling inside of my heart. I just always crave that feeling where I feel calm and at ease and like I understand everything and everything is going to be alright. I just want control so I can always feel calm and happy and I want so badly to help anyone who feels like me but no matter how much I meditate or try to work on my willpower my problems always return in full force. Please if you can see any part of your past self in my words just tell me how I can fix this and change who I am because this is not working for me and I am really trying so hard I just want to have a positive impact on other beings without being a burden to the world around me.",22Jul2018,2
66,My SO is starting to worry me. She has been through a lot and has been hesitant to seek professional help until now. We asked around and the lowest we could find was $120 a session (uninsured). Does anyone know of a place that I can take her to? Thank you for your time.,22Jul2018,2
67,"My mind just goes on an onslaught. Whatever thought that was bothering me in the day, at bed time it is x7 worse. I feel like I am constantly fighting off panic attacks as I try to sleep. It used to never be like this, I actually slept like a rock for a few years until I had a sudden panic attack back in April. Ever since I've just been so aware of going to bed, knowing I could have another panic attack. What should I do? I'm thinking of getting on sleeping medication, that will hopefully knock me out as soon as I get into bed. Maybe a Benzo could work, but I'm afraid of the whole withdrawal/addiction thing ",22Jul2018,3
68,"* Posting with a throwaway because I'm talking about my boyfriend as well as myself, and he's very private. * 


I (F42) have struggled with extreme anxiety for most of my life, and intermittently with depression.  I've also been diagnosed with Asperger's, ADD, PTSD, and Borderline Personality Disorder.  I recently learned about Pseudobulbar Affect (Inappropriate and uncontrollable laughter and tears) and I'm pretty sure I have that too.  I have severe memory and concentration problems.  I've worked with many counselors and therapists over the years; Some were helpful and some were not.  I made slow progress for many years, but after I was diagnosed with BPD and started working with someone familiar with that disorder, my recovery took off, and I made a lot of progress.  Then I lost my insurance, and for a while, I was paying out of pocket for a session with my counselor once a month instead of the weekly sessions we had been having.  But lately, I haven't even been able to manage to pay that much, and I haven't talked to her for more than two months. 

I've been struggling with my job for a while, and for the past few months, I've been feeling like I couldn't go on.  It's been getting harder and harder for me to go in each day.  For the past few weeks, I was struggling to even keep walking and talking because I wanted to crouch down in corners and cry.  I felt like I was constantly on the edge of a panic attack.  I struggled to comprehend what people were saying to me because I was so scattered, and I had a hard time staying present because I felt like my head was floating off my body.  In the past, I had spoken to my supervisor about my anxiety and hinted at some of my other mental health problems, but I hadn't told her how bad it was because I was embarrassed, and I wasn't sure she would believe me or take me seriously.  So I just kept doing the best I could.  For a while, I was getting Xanax prescriptions from a community clinic, but because of billing conflicts (long story), I stopped going there, and I haven't had anxiety medications for a couple months.  While I was writing this, I realized that I lost my counseling sessions and my meds at about the same time.  No wonder I've been having such a hard time. 

I was hopeful that I would be able to see a counselor at a sliding scale clinic, but it turns out there is a long waiting list, and when I finally do get to have individual sessions, I can only have twelve of them.  In order to stay on the waiting list, I have to go to group sessions, but they are crowded and chaotic, and they're only making me feel worse.  At this point, I'm thinking I should just stop going.  I have an appointment in a couple weeks with a doctor from the same clinic who can hopefully prescribe meds.  When I was taking meds in the past, they made me sleepy and dopey, which created other problems at work.  So I tried to save them as a last resort, but even knowing that I had them in my purse in case I needed them took away a lot of my anxiety.  This time, I'm planning to inquire about trying meds for some of my other disorders in addition to the anxiety meds. 

I've been having fantasies of quitting my job, even though I'm living paycheck to paycheck with debts.  I've been homeless in the past, and I found it to not be as awful as everyone else seems to think it is.  Sure, it was hard, but I got by with free food from soup kitchens, showers at the Salvation Army, hanging out in libraries, etc.  Ever since then, I haven't been afraid of ending up like that again, even though I obviously don't want to.  But this time, I have an apartment with my boyfriend (M35) and he's counting on me to pay half of the rent and other expenses.  He's physically disabled, and suffers from terrible back pain every day, but he still keeps working.  I didn't want to admit to my boyfriend how stressed I was at work because he's having problems working too, and I didn't want him to think I was minimizing his pain.  Physical pain is a lot easier to understand than mental and emotional pain.  He knows I have problems with anxiety and BPD and other mental health problems too, although I've never gone into detail about how the anxiety and BPD affect me or what the other problems are.  One day when he asked me how my day was going at work, I told him I was having a rough time.  He asked why, and I decided he deserved to know the truth.  So I started to describe the problems I'd been having.  I was right-- He didn't understand; He thought I just needed to calm down and get a grip.  He didn't understand it isn't something I can control.  As time has gone by and we've talked about it more, he's become more sympathetic, but he is obviously still confused. 

About the same time I'd pretty much made up my mind I was going to quit my job because of my mental health problems, and just let the chips fall where they may, I found out that I had accrued 40 hours of paid time off.  I applied for the days I wanted to have off, and I got approved.  Then, I decided maybe I should wait until after my week off before making any decisions about my job.  In the back of my mind, I was pretty sure I was going to quit anyway, but I didn't say anything that hinted at that because I wanted to use the vacation time I'd earned, and I also wasn't ready to burn that bridge. 

One of the ways I've helped myself to be calm and focused at work is to do journalling, write notes to myself, and read notes I'd previously written to myself.  I have a lot of files on my phone, and when I start to feel scattered or panicky at work, I find a quiet corner for a moment, and read one of my notes, or quickly type a little reminder to myself.  I also sometimes send and read texts from my boyfriend, but only if it's a very short message that only takes a couple seconds.  I never do any of this in front of customers.  When I was first hired, my manager specifically said (without me asking) that it's okay to keep my phone with me because there will be times I'll need to text or call her with questions.  So, I never had a reason to think there was a problem with me using the phone since no one ever said anything to me otherwise.  The day before my vacation started, I found out that I had been written up at work for using my phone too much. 

A couple days before that, I had been having a particularly stressful day, and I was sitting down for a few minutes and journaling on my phone to try to calm down.  The store manager saw me doing it, and thought I was just being lazy and playing games.  She didn't say anything to me, but she told my supervisor, who called me into the office a couple days later to discuss it.  I tried to explain what I was actually doing, and how much trouble I've been having at work.  She listened politely and seemed to be sympathetic, but I was still written up.  And now there is a new policy that no one in my department can have phones with them while working.  I'm panicked.  If I was struggling so much even when I thought it was okay for me to use my phone, I don't know how I'll manage without it.  Someone at the clinic suggested I keep a little notebook and pen in my pocket, and write notes to myself that way.  She also suggested writing out some of the notes beforehand and keeping them on little cards.  I will definitely do that, but I don't think it will be good enough; the notes I used to use are long, and I would just quickly skim them. 

I'm in the middle of my vacation now, and I can't enjoy it.  I can't relax or stop my mind from spinning.  My thoughts don't even make sense.  Writing my thoughts down has always been helpful for me to get them clear and organized, and I've been doing a lot of journalling.  It's helping somewhat, but I can't stop the anxiety.  I am panicking.  Worried I will lose my job (even though that's what I want, it's still scary.  It feels worse to be told I have to leave than to decide to leave).  I'm worried my coworkers will know my behavior is the reason for the policy that affects everyone, and that will change how they treat me.  Even if they aren't specifically told it was me, they will probably figure it out; our department is small, and apparently, other people have been noticing that I use my phone a lot, and not mentioning it to me. 

For a while now, I've been considering applying for SSI and SSDI benefits.  About six or seven years ago in WA, I was approved for SSI, but it was a tiny amount.  At the time, I didn't know about SSDI, and it didn't occur to me that I might be able to get a larger amount.  I received benefits for a few months, but since the amount wasn't even enough for me to rent a room, I got a job-- fish processing in Alaska.  It was a good opportunity and I was grateful, but it ended up like every other job I've ever had; I couldn't cope with doing it every day, and I left after a few months.  I don't know why I didn't apply for benefits again after that.  Maybe I was embarrassed that I had quit and tried to work.  If I was going to apply for benefits again now that I know I might be able to get more, I would need to have some kind of income for the application and waiting process, which I've heard can take years. Apparently, I can earn up to $1,170 during the application process, but when I think about going through the job application and interview process again to find a part time job, I feel overwhelmed and exhausted.  (For a while, I was considering moving to part time with my current job, but if I'm not full time, they can only give me four hours a week)  

In the past, I was self-employed buying and selling used clothes, and for about six years, that was my only source of income-- By far, the longest I ever did anything for work.  I never made much money, but I scraped by.  I was very happy to be self-employed which made it easier to be broke.  For the past six months, I've been thinking I'd like to start that up again.  But, it's been much more challenging than I expected.  I had figured that since I did this for so long before, I could just jump back into it.  But then I remembered that when I started the business the first time, I had a lot of free time, and nothing to lose.  It took me a few months of devoting myself to it full time before I started to be profitable.  I haven't been able to give very much time to it while I have a full time job.  Now that I'm on vacation, I have been getting back into it, but I am undecided if it would be wise to take the plunge to only do this.  If my boyfriend wasn't counting on me to pay half the expenses every month, I would jump right into it without any hesitation.  He wants me to be happy and fulfilled, but he's worried about me being able to have enough steady income. 

My boyfriend's mom has started to teach me how to collect and sell scrap metal, which is what she does for a living, but she can't offer me steady work at this time, and I can't do it on my own since I don't have a vehicle or a driver's license.  My boyfriend has a van and he said he might be interested in learnung to sell metal, but he's still working full time.  I can donate plasma for about $200 per month.  And I can definitely make some unknown amount of money from selling clothes now.  But if I do succeed in coming up with $1,170 per month without my job, that would not be enough money for my current small budget.  My boyfriend and I would have to find somewhere else to live, maybe with his family.  Both of his parents live in this area, but they are both pretty down on their luck too and live in small homes.  His father is already receiving disability benefits. 

A few weeks ago, I applied with a state program that helps disabled people find work.  I wasn't sure I would be approved since I already had a job.  But I went in for the appointment and I told the truth.  I was very prepared with a detailed description of each of the challenges I have that affect my ability to effectively work.  At the end of the interview, I was told to wait for them to contact me, so I did.  A few days ago, I got a voicemail from the woman who interviewed me.  She said she's ordered a full psych evaluation for me, and I'll get details in a letter in the mail.  I've been checking the mailbox every day, but so far nothing.  Since today is Sunday, I'm really hoping it's there tomorrow.  Even if I find out that I'll have to wait a long time for the psych eval, I'll feel a little bit better than when I was just waiting with no info; When I have info, I can make plans, and when I have plans, I feel more focused and calm.  And when I have an idea of how long I'll have to wait for something, then it's easier for me to endure the time until then. 

Another concern: When I try to get help, I worry that my mental health problems themselves will make it hard for me to communicate what my problems are!  I have trouble with concentration, memory, clear thinking, logic, keeping a timeline in my head, and other basic cognitive functions.  My thoughts are usually a swirling morass of confusion. I can express myself pretty well in writing because I can get all the words out in whatever jumbled, crazy way they fall onto the page (or screen), and then organize them.  I can see the words, so I have something real to move around and make into something logical.  But when I try to talk, my memories and the words all spin around and I can't grab onto them.  What if I'm not believed because I can't explain myself in a way that makes sense?  This isn't a baseless fear; This exact situation has happened more than a few times in my life; So I usually avoid talking about my mental health problems.  But if I want help, I'll need to find a way to get it all out in a comprehensive and logical fashion. 

A couple weeks ago, I reluctantly asked my mother for financial help and told her openly what's been going on.  I told her everything.  I had come up with a bare bones budget that would just cover my basic expenses, and I asked her for that amount for two months.  I explained that I am hoping to get my old clothing business going again, but I don't know how long it will take.  I talked about possibly being able to scrap metal in the future, but that it won't be reliable income at this time.  She readily agreed to give me the amount I asked for, which was a relief, but also embarrassing.  I've always tried to be independent, and it's really hard for me to ask her for help.  My relationship with my mom has always been strained.  Things have been getting somewhat better in recent years, but I still have a lot of resentment for my childhood, and I struggle to not blame her for making me this way.  Even though I know intellectually that the only person I hurt by holding onto my anger is myself, and that the only way I can move forward is to forgive her, I don't know how.  I don't know how to convince my subconsious mind that that's what has to happen.  I don't trust her.  Other than my boyfriend, I don't trust anyone.  So all of this is going through my mind when I think about accepting her financial help.  I have lots of mixed feelings. 

Part of my tiredness and discontent is because of the area I'm living in.  I'm from Washington State, and I'm currently living in Florida.  I came down here to be with my long distance boyfriend (It didn't work out, and I met someone else down here).  I am very happy in my relationship, and I wouldn't dream of leaving him.  But this place feels alien and uncomfortable to me.  I've adjusted to the heat a lot better than I thought I would.  But I still miss cold weather.  I miss the crisp breezes of autumn, and I miss snow.  And the plants are strange to me.  For most of my life, when things got this hard and I couldn't calm myself down, I would walk into the forest or to the beach.  I'd breathe in the smells of the seawater and seaweed or the moss and rotting wood, listen to crashing waves and shore birds or wind and rustling leaves, and soak in the sights of the familiar scenery.  It would always help me to clear my mind, and calm down.  I haven't found any place down here that feels peaceful and relaxing to me.  There are parks here and obviously plenty of beautiful beaches, but they don't make me feel like the forests and beaches in WA do.  I'm used to bracken ferns, rhododendrons, squishy wet moss on rocks, and towering Douglas Fir trees.  I'm used to seeing rushing streams in ditches by the side of country roads, and finding little, rocky waterfalls in the forests.  I'm used to soft grassy fields with little daisies and buttercups, where I can sprawl out and watch the clouds.  There is none of that here.  I feel lost and alone, even though I have my boyfriend who I love very much. 

I'm trying to stay calm and positive, but it's hard.  I would love any feedback or advice. 


TL;DR: Having trouble at work, worried I'm in danger of being fired.  Seeking help from an agency that helps disabled people find work, and considering applying for SSI.  I want to start my clothing resale business again, but I'm worried how the finances will affect my boyfriend.  Anxious all the time.  I just want to talk to someone about it.

69,"Lately, I've been feeling more and more...I don't know, sad? Sorta depressed in a way? (and I've been through that once so I know how it felt back then, this is different)
For a backstory, I've always been very altruistic, always trying to help others and make others happy, even though it meant putting myself on the side. And for a while, it made me happy. It made me sorta whole. It's also been a year since my grandpa died, I had to help care for him for 9 years prior to that.
Lately though, everything's been going down and down and down. I feel like everybody has their opinion and expectations of and for me. I feel like even though I have dreams, every time I talk about them, people want to bring me back to the ""real world"" and say that the only way to get there is this way and that way and only by doing this and that will you get the result you want...
Everytime I say no to doing something people want me to do but I do not, I get back a nag. Everytime my mother wants me to do something I really don't want to do, I get back a nag or yelling.
Have I become selfish? I don't know anymore.
I want to follow my dreams but everybody just says that the way I want to go at it is wrong. I've lost a lot of motivation, I've lost my will to go after my dreams when I'm feeling down (the will is present but it crashes to a low when that happens...)...
What do I do? I don't know anymore...",22Jul2018,2
70,"So I have crippling depression yo the point where I can't do anything.   Have had it and struggled with everything my entire life.   36 now and decided that disability may be my best hope even though it seems being poor for the rest of my life.   Psychiatrist doesn't know what to do with me as I have been on literally every depression med out there and nothing works.   I am sure he would sign off on my disability paperwork.

I did apply about a year ago and got my first denial which is common from what I understand.   My next step was supposed to start an appeals process or whatever it's called and get a lawyer to help.    Instead I did nothing because I am so unmotivated.   I even had the disability people call me a few times to remind me yo get going on it so I could receive a good chunk of back pay when I finally get approved but still I did nothing

By now I have to start the entire process over again.....I just can never follow through with anything I do in my life......I can't even follow through with giving up.   Bah!

71,"cross post from r/travel cause I feel like this may be a better place for it, so hi! I got back about two weeks ago from living in New Zealand for 4 months. While I loved the experience and have no regrets, I definitely experienced some culture shock while living there. aka feeling trapped, increased anxiety etc. I sent a lot more time alone than I was used and separation from friends and family which gave me a lot of time to think about my life and my relationships (maybe even a little too much time tbh). I figured all this would go away when I returned to my home country (the states), but now I think I may be experiencing reverse culture shock, with symptoms including:

\-boredom

\-frustration with people particularly loved ones

\-isolation

\-anxiety

\-feeling purposeless

etc. In general I just feel really mellow and unexcited.

I go back to my university I went to before I left in about a month, what are some solutions, cures etc for this problem? or has anyone gone through this or relate? As of right now Im trying to find a job to work to make back some money i spent before school starts, but currently not working (or doing much really). Thanks!",22Jul2018,8
72,So i have a friend who is voluntarily staying at a mental health centre and he is out on a pass right now but doesn't want to go back. I'm telling him he should go back get his meds and stuff and he should be able to leave. The other thing is he's on probation and its almost up woth no curfew just keep the peace. He literally just does not want to be surrounded by people who are much iller than he is. What are his options right now? Can he just not go back? ,22Jul2018,2

74,"Hi, to give some context, I'm a 20 years old guy who was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder back in December 2017 and I've been on Lexapro 10mg, Lamictal 100mg and Qurax 50mg (Quetiapine, the laboratory is Royal Pharma but it's basically Seroquel but a little bit cheaper). 

I was recently switched from Qurax to another brand of the same molecule but I'm concerned as to whether there will be some side effects because I switched meds (I started taking the new one 2 or 3 days ago). 

Thanks in advance, I hope you're having a good day or night! :\^)",22Jul2018,4

77,"Recently (past year or so), I’ve been having quite explosive rages during which I have sometimes harmed myself. It ranges from punching my forearms (most common, and has once or twice left a large bruise up my forearm) to pulling my hair out and scratching myself both with finger nails and reasonably blunt knives (the knife thing has only happened once), didn’t pierce the skin but left marks. I have on two occasions actually done quite a bit of damage. The first I punched a wall and snapped one of my metacarpals and broke a knuckle. This lead to an operation, I was also stupid as I left it a week before getting it looked at. The second I cut myself with a corkscrew on my leg quite deep and has since scarred. 
I’m not sure why I do it and I’m quite worried, it does seem to help with the anger/frustration, especially the arm punching thing. I think I might do it to stop me from lashing out at the people that I’m arguing with which tends to cause the anger. 
I have had reasonably bad anxiety in the past and recently have been thinking I might have some mental health issues but not too sure what to do. 
Not too sure why I’m posting on here just don’t really have anyone I want to talk about this with.",22Jul2018,5
78,"Tl;dr at bottom.
I've been feeling like shit lately and i've wanted to write it out but haven't had the energy to. I'm going to my therapist on tuesday but i don't know what to tell her. She really sucks tbh but she's quitting soon so this is one of my last meetings. I've just been really depressed lately and i've been dissacosiating severly for atleast 5-6 months. I've been lacking emotion and started to doubt my identity (i'm trans ftm). My suicidal thoughts have come back and i've started drinking (alone) more (keep in mind that i'm underage). I have severly high functioning depression and somehow keeps going because in my eyes i don't have a choise (i also have a horse, which forces me to be active everyday and get out of my bed each morning). I've started to loose motivation for just about anything and my eating disorder is comming back.

My parents are in denial about mental illness and want me to stop going there. This has caused me to in turn doubt my own feelings and problems making me belive i'm making it up for attention. This also causes me to fear telling her how i really feel sometimes and makes me hide my feelings for my parents. This makes me unable to talk to people about my problems and making me lock myself in. My friends wont listen because i'm just a hopeless case.

Tl;dr: my mental health has been extremely fucking terrible lately and it's just getting worse. I have parents who are in denial and are making things worse (they want me to quit therapy). My therapist is also quitting and has suggested me quitting therapy becase i fear telling the truth to her and suck at formatting myself, making her believe that i'm better. And i don't know what to tell her because in a few days i'll have one of my last meetings with her.

80,"I have been lurking for some time on this sub and in my life. 
Just finished filling out the forms for an admittance to a mental hospital.

Although I know I need to do something or else nothing will get better, it actually makes me cry right now that everything went out of control to this extent.

Once I said to myself I just need some rest, and then I will stand up again.
It's been five years, nothing got better, even more happened and I neglected myself.

My PTSD controls me and any aspect of my life, my emotions rule me and the worst is that I forgot who I am, and don't  recognise who I became.

Seeing the confirmation email with all the data just crushed me. I knew I got lazy, but not this.... from once malnourished then healthy to now obese! I wasn't aware. I wasn't aware of anything, I just wanted everything to just end, not bother me.

I realised just now to what extent my life went out of control. It's very bad.
And accepting this and facing this, it crushes me. But it's pathetic at the same time. The abuse I endured from others lead to me abusing myself by neglecting my mental and physical health. I just want to wake up from this nightmare like it never happened.

Can somebody tell me it gets better?
Because I know it should! I survived so much already but instead of getting stronger, I got weaker. My once positive outlook is now utterly crushed as my dissapointment in myself is at it's highest it has ever been. It should motivate me to change, but I am tired of trying anything.",22Jul2018,45
81,"Hi everyone, so I'm new to posting on Reddit, but I could use a little insight from others. Long story short, I have a history of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and mood swings. Then periods of time where things were going just fine. A few weeks ago after some major changes in my life, I hit a really, really low point. Some of my loved ones suggested I consider counseling, and I finally made the appointment. However, the appointment was and still is weeks away. So in the meantime I did what I assumed they would suggest I try in order to manage anxiety and depression. I started reading about and practicing some of the techniques from CBT/DBT, recognizing unhealthy thought patterns, and doing all the things Dr. Google turned up. 

It's only been a few weeks, but I feel better. Better than I have in years. I'm worried it's a type of false progress though and am unsure whether to keep the appointment. On one hand, my issues have been cyclical before and always came back. On the other hand, I've never tried (at least more than a half-ass attempt) to recognize and change my behavior. Has anyone else had second thoughts as their first appointment approached? Or second thoughts during their treatment? What did you decide to do? ",22Jul2018,2
82,"I am a paraplegic in my mid 20s. I have a little brother with autism, and two non disabled siblings. In addition to having occasional serious health concerns, my mom, who has anger and anxiety issues tends to dote and cling to me. Sometimes, this happens at the expense of my other two siblings. I feel bad about it and I wish it'd stop, but they keep coming to me about it as if I can do something about it, which I can't. From my experience as a ""clingee"", talking to her just makes her angry, defensive, and anxious. If anything, she clings harder.

I don't want them to think that I don't care, but this feels like triangulation to me. They're coming to me because they feel that they can't talk to my mom, and I'm the second closest to the problem who will actually listen, even though there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.

They also seem to be doing this, at least subconsciously, in a ""zero sum"" way that happens a lot to people with disabilities. Instead of acknowledging that we all have unique needs and that they all deserve attention, it's like anything that they get has to come from my loss. as if their lack of attention from my mom is due to me inflicting my differences on everyone.",22Jul2018,2
83,"I had to miss my sisters baby shower today. I live about 4 hours away from my family and I live with my boyfriend and son. My boyfriend has been crazy sick for the past few days. I had to take him to the hospital with a fever that was at 103.4 and climbing on Friday. Since his fever hasn't come back I had on planned on doing the drive myself and coming back home but he didn't want me driving that far alone so he peeled himself off the bed this morning so he can male the drive himself. 

The antibiotics have worked his stomach so bad since he started taking them and we stopped like I dont know how many times so he could use the bathroom. I finally convinced him to turn around after like 2 hours of driving. 

I get home and call my mom to tell her why I'm not there and I'm already feeling small before I even say anything because she's ruthless and doesnt understand I why moved away and makes me feel like I'm betraying her and the family name and makes me cry everytime I disagree with her. I tell her that I had to turn around and go back home and she starts getting mad at me even after I've told that my boyfriend had been going to bathroom the whole way there. As I do I apologize and make myself sound small asking her what she wants from me and her tone changes and she just says I hope to see you soon and leaves it at that. It felt like she slammed the door in my face which is something she's done many times after I did something that was better for me and not her way.

Like wasn't supposed to move out of her house till I was 25 and paid off my student loans and found a husband and house so i can give her grandchildren. When I did at 20 after we got into a physical fight after I got home late from my now ex-bf's house she didnt even say bye or look at me. I even said Bye Mommy I love you and she kept her dead pan face looking straight. When I was nineteen she conviced me to get this factory job that had me working 16 hour night shifts a few days a week and she tried to get me to have an other job  but I told her no that I was working enough. ""Well when I was your age I had two jobs. You come from a family full of strong women."" Of course then she had my brother who was 5 and me a tiny baby and we were homeless living in a damn car. Not to mention her invading in my past relationships, this is the first relationship I've had that I've stuck up for myself towards her but I still try everything she want but she refuses to come to my house and visit me.",22Jul2018,2
84,"I don’t really know where to post this so maybe here is the best place to let it out. I’ve never put any of this into words but here we go. 

Sometime I’ll be sitting there and the smallest thing can happen to give me anxiety or make me mad. Most times I don’t even know what triggers it. But my chest will feel sunken and my mind will go crazy. For example one time I was sitting with my SO and their family. Something their nephew did annoyed me and I’ll fell into this sunken state of anxiety and anger and I literally thought about what the repercussions would be if I picked up a knife on the table and hurt someone with it. I don’t know if I could have ever done it but I ran through the situations in my mind and didn’t think it was weird at all. I could sit there for a few minute and then snap out of it and go right back to being happy around the family 

Another example I was at work and I don’t even know what happens but I went into the same feelings and it took a lot for my to not physically hurt the co worker I was with who I don’t even remember doing anything wrong. But eventually I snapped out of it. 

This feeling happens all the time and most of the time I can’t even remember what triggers it I don’t always get violent feelings, but there is always an intense anger and hate. those are just the ones that stand out in my mind. Is this bi polar? Is this depression? Is it anything? 

Hopefully this makes some sort of sense to someone else.

86,"After more than ten years suffering in silence, I've decided to write about this problem, as it has already given me too many unnecessary headaches and I think it's about time to face it. 

My father used to be an alcoholic (he is kinda rehabilitated now), and this used to bring about very difficult situations  in my home. Altough he was not aggressive, he spent all our money in alcoholic drinks and rounds for his friends, used to show up at home at about 4 am and made up lame excuses and lies. My parents had terrible arguments regarding this topic and I had to stand them. This situation ended when they got divorced. 

Nevertheless, ever since I was around 10, everytime I see someone drunk, or under the effects of any drug, I feel exactly the same way I used to feel when I saw my dad in that state. It doesn't matter whether they are friends, my so, or even strangers. It's a terrible feeling, I'd call it a mix of anguish, rage and impotence. I wouldn't know if defining it as anxiety, as I'd say that is more serious. In the most acute cases I even end up crying. 

*I'm 18 now and I've never drunk alcohol, not even a beer. I haven't tried any other drug neither. 

I'd like to know your views on the problem, as well as some recommendations to get over it. I've never been to the psychologist, and to be honest I wouldn't like having to resort to that. Thank you so much for reading my post. ",22Jul2018,2
87,"I’m 17 and have felt depressed many many times throughout the past 2 years.

I called Childline or whatever it’s called once late at night but got as far as the lady asking me if I needed help but hung up then. I rarely feel happy, even though I’m working on my lyricism in rap and my acrobatic skills in freerunnig. Even though the worst year of my life so far feels over, I still feel nothing, sometimes sad but just empty most the time. Idk how to ask my parents if I can see a therapist or counsellor.

88,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 16, but had been suffering from the symptoms since I was perhaps 9-10. Feelings of worrying, inadequacy, and inexplicable sadness seem embedded into my childhood memories. But it was only until I was hospitalized for suicidal ideations that I was diagnosed, and ever since then I’ve undergone all sorts of therapy, medication, and more hospitalizations. 

- Office therapy? Haha not sure what to call it. 1 hr per week
- Individual and family in-home therapy, 2-4 hours a week
- Admitted and readmitted 7 times to three different outpatient programs, each period varying 1-3 months, including 2 treatment periods of a specialized DBT program
- 5 inpatient hospitalizations, each ranging from 4 - 21 days
- A residential inpatient treatment lasting 6 months

Here’s a list of the medication I’ve taken, max dosage levels, to the best of my memory:
Lexapro 15mg, Zoloft 200mg, Abilify 1-5mg, Vistaril ?mg, Trazodone ?mg, Depakote 1000mg, Effexor 112.5mg, Remeron 15mg, Welbutrin 150mg, Risperdal 1mg

Also important to add that I’ve taken Estradiol and Spironolactone for my trans dysphoria, which I stopped taking after a month due to severe mood disruptions. I do intend to restart again, since my dysphoria carries its own urgency, but I’m too destabilized at the moment to practically take them, and either choice of hormones/no hormones exacerbates my condition

I’m now 18, going on 19 in a month. I have yet to acquire all the credits for my high school graduation, work at my first job, or complete a written driver’s exam. And there’s always a looming sense of guilt and shame for not being ever responsible/self-supporting, and often overwhelming. 

I wish I could muster up the will to kill myself, because I personally think this is all pathetic. I don’t want to remain a emotional and financial liability to my family, especially one that doesn’t support themselves in any way financially. I have friends, but none that I reach out towards locally, and none that I want to depend on for consistent emotional support. My dysphoria meanwhile still remains a burden, but with so much pressure from myself otherwise, I don’t think it matters as much as it could.

“What’s next?” I wonder that a lot, in regards of my treatment, or whatever efforts I should make towards getting/feeling better. I’m especially interested in alternatives for SSRI/SNRI’s, and ECT. And alternative root causes of depression, such as hyperthyroidism. Actually, I’m just baffled with myself -- I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve received so much treatment, so much personal insight, so much support from my family, friends, and school, yet it all seems negated by, well, me. And sometimes I want to continue to dig deeply into more skeptical possibilities, like repressed trauma, but we’ve already done that. And family issues? They’re honestly all too lovely for that.

I feel desperate. Maybe the appropriate response would be to focus more on stuff like introducing structure and self-care, but it’s obvious that I’ve spent lots of time trying to doing so, and in evaluation of the vast variety of professional help I’ve received, I hope it’s understood that I’ve probably heard most advice along those lines. But still, shoot. And thank you always for reading. Thank you, thank you. I really mean it.
