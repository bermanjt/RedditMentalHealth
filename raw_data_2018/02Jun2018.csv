1,"I can’t go a single hour without thinking about Muslims, this started when I was 9 after the 7/7 bombings, that’s when I started hating Muslims and also it’s not just when they do terrorism, they do other bad things such as grooming gangs, honour killings, welfare sponging and wearing burqas and niqabs and I feel that they aren’t integrating into British society and don’t respect our way of life, the most recent terrible thing the Muslims have been doing is grooming gangs and they only target white British and Asian Sikh girls, I feel this is a direct attack on my people. Is it normal that I have these thoughts about Muslims?",02Jun2018,0
2,"(first time posting sorry)
So I’m a 17 yr old girl from Canada dealing with anxiety, depression, and OCD for context.
This past year my life has pretty much spiralled; I hardly attend school, my grades are so bad that I may not graduate when I should, I have basically 0 friends, and 0 ambitions.
My biggest issue is avoidance
Things are so bad at this point that I have NO idea where to start to try and fix things. I can’t even think about it without dissociating. 
I’m scared to do anything because I can’t deal with failure.
I have no talents or goals and am truly at a loss as to what to do with my life that could possibly make me happy.
I feel trapped in my own life. I’m fully responsible for screwing myself over by not going to class, not completing or handing in any work, and isolating myself socially. Now I’m in too deep and need help badly before it gets any worse.
How do I end my cycle of self-destruction?
How do I regain touch with reality and actually do something to help my situation?
I am on medication and have had multiple therapists, psychiatrists, and support groups attempt to help me to no avail. I know I need to deal with my problems, but am so overwhelmed that I can’t see how. I’m hoping at least writing these feelings out will help me to face them.

3,"My boyfriend's depression, which has never really been treated, is worsening, and he finally admitted he needs help. However, he refuses to go to counseling of any sort. Part of tne issue is money (he doesn't have insurance), and part is a negative history with forced therapy. I'm a big supporter of therapy, been doing it basically my whole life, but he has this misconception that therapy is used to manipulate you in a nefarious way, and he hates feeling like someone else is dictating his life. Until that changes, forcing him through more therapy will not do any good.

He needs help, and he wants to be happy... But he doesn't know where to start. Neither do I. Any suggestions?",02Jun2018,2

6,"A friend of mine has recently gotten onto medication, notably Gabapentin, and has become totally detached from reality over the last two weeks, and has talked about feeling suicidal, how she will see her dead friend again soon, and how it won't matter, because if she dies she will just come back as someone else.

She has been an atheist all her life, but literally overnight has started claiming to be a believer and that she has met god and god isn't what anyone thinks, and that we are all god. (please note that I am not claiming that belief in god is a mental illness, I am just saying that this is a RADICAL change in her behaviour, literally overnight)

She is saying that everything is real, all the fictional characters are real, and we can meet them all if we just allow ourselves to be free.

She is hypomanic and types long strings of random characters in the middle paragraphs, and a few videos she has posted and then deleted are showing her being very jumpy and skittish and talking to nobody, as in proper conversations. 

She says she is going to fix the world and how money is now obsolete, so she is going to start travelling the world by credit card because debt isn't really real.

I know these things might not sound that bad but this is NOT what she is normally like. Normally she can hold a long conversation on lots of topics, she can debate and discuss maturely and in detail. 

Now she can hardly put a sentence together. 

The local PD have been called several times to do a wellness check on her, and they told her to stop posting on facebook, then left. 

She claims that she is finally well, and that this is how she should be, how she wants to stay hypomanic forever so she can fix everything.

She is in Wisconsin, in the Marshfield area I think. I have even messaged Mental Health America for that area, but they have't replied. I have contacted her friends and family, but no response from them either, so I think she is pretty isolated. 

I am in England, so there really is nothing I can do from her other than try to get people to help her somehow. 

Can anyone help me do that or offer any useful advice?

Sorry this has been a bit hard to read, I am just worried for her safety. I don't want her to kill herself, or to risk snapping when the police are at her place and get shot or something. ",02Jun2018,2
7," I didn't really know where to post this; I have dx'd ADHD, cPTSD \(from childhood trauma/adolescent abuse/sexual assault\), GAD, depression, and possible ASD. Today \(and every time\) my boyfriend leaves town for a few days, or our plans change, or I wake up and it's a Wednesday/arbitrary *x*\-day of the week, I get into a depressive, hopeless, unmotivated, anxious state where I can't move or talk or think properly. It happens most often with him, though it also occurs when I leave my dad/stepmom after a visit, or a close friend. I want to cry but there isn't a reason to, so the tears won't come. And I have so many things that could be occupying my time but I just can't do any of them.

So then, the thought crosses my mind to reach out to a friend, my boyfriend, family, etc. But I'm unable to, for some reason. Even though every time I have in the past I've been met with support and love. I just can't help but feel like they're getting annoyed with me, that I'm useless and unworthy of their attention, and this is getting repetitive. And then there's the strong belief that I should be able to get through this on my own because I logically know the 'answers'. I just can't seem to unlock them. Like, there's a giant wall that gets erected in my mind and only people I trust can break that barrier. I don't want my boyfriend to feel smothered, because we spend every day together, and I don't want him to think he has to hold my hand through every step of life. He is absolutely amazing to me, and he knows my history of past abusive partners and childhood trauma. And I'm grateful to have him in my life, and I take care of him well. Yet, when he doesn't show me what my brain thinks is *enough* affection, I get wildly paranoid that he doesn't really love me anymore or that I've done something wrong. Which is a thought that's unfair to him and to us.

I'm also currently between jobs \(the disorders combined make it difficult to keep up a full or even part time job\) and therapists, which just lends more credibility to the thought that I'm just failing at everything I try to do. I'm not hopeless in the sense that I don't want to live, but there is this crushing weight of inexplicable terror that's making it truly hard to breathe.

Sorry for being so dramatic. I guess I just wanted to get some of this out of my head and into words, and maybe someone in the world will be able to relate and/or offer some helpful tidbits.",02Jun2018,1

9,"I hope you can make it through this long post, lol.
This is a VERY long story, but is important.
Please read it and please tell me your thoughts on what this ""demon"" is. I really need help, lol. Sorry :)

I am going to try to make this quick, but it probably won't be, since this flipping computer deleted a nice and well explained paragraph that I had written. Let us begin.

*I, for some reason have memories from as early as two years of age. In these memories all the way up until age four, I do not remember being able to speak at all, kind of like a mute. I am pretty sure that I could give responses like ""Yes"" or ""No"", I just don't remember it.

*From about age four until early seven, I would repeat everything that I said (which usually wasn't much, not as in broken sentences, but as in quick to the point), or I would repeat what the person I was talking to said. I would repeat it, however, in a quiet whisper. I remember one day, that my sister asked me why I repeated everything that I said. Obviously, I had no control over it, AND I was a four year old, so I don't know what she expected me to say as an answer. To this day, I can occasionally find myself repeating what I or somebody else said in my head, but I am able to stop it before I whisper it. 

*I have GI issues. As a little child, I was ALWAYS constipated for AT LEAST two weeks tops, sometimes longer. I went to the doctor for an answer when I was like, around six years old, and the only thing the doctor gave me, was a warning, and some laxatives. The warning was to ""go"", or my colon would stretch. I was SIX. And I could NOT control my constipation. I don't know what was going through ANYBODY'S minds back then. I needed help, not some warning that I couldn't understand. But my doctor (still the same to this very day) is a really nice person. I think it was just my mother not explaining it properly, and it wasn't her fault either, because I didn't know how to explain what was going on. As of right now, my issue is pure diarrhea and stomach colic afterwards.

*I have the WORST, MOST TORTUROUS, RASHES, that come up more often than they should. They are always all over my body, in places that I didn't even KNOW I could itch. The very first time I got a major rash, in 2008, I got some medicine, and it went away. The second time I had a major rash, I got medicine as well, and nothing was working. The dermatologist (I think that's the name...) said that it had to be something psychological. Finally, it went away. Right now, as I am typing this, I am in the middle of a third major breakout. It started in January 2018, and these past few months, I have taken everything from Zyrtec, to Xyzal, to generic, and this stupid rash is going nowhere. I am due for a doctor's visit later in June or Early July, and my mom said she is going to mention it. But there is no way I am going back to the dermatologist to have them say it is psychological again. I know quite a bit about the human body, and I believe it may be something neurological. I have no PhD, however, so that's just a little theory.

*I am **WAY** too freaking sensitive. I know that my environment is just slightly too bright, and vivid with the colors. I know this can't be normal. I HATE to be touched. I can touch myself and feel just fine, but when others do it, it TICKLES WAY TOO FREAKING MUCH. I jump and flinch because of it. Sound is another issue. Sometimes when things are way too loud, what will happen is everything will seem as if it is at one volume, and *every little sound, every door slam, to every small tiny pencil click*, will cause my ear drum to move. To experience this, get a Q-Tip and touch your ear drum with it. Hear that sound? Can you feel the force? This is what sounds do sometimes. I have to cover my ears to make it stop in public, leave the room with the noise if I am at home, or turn down my headphone volume if it is my device causing it. Smells can be too strong to the point that I can no longer breathe (No, it is not asthma, either.), and taste is one of the worst senses to have (for me). It's so bad that it gets it's own paragraph.

*Food issues are too severe. I can eat almost nothing. I am constantly being yelled at for being ""too unhealthy"", but the taste of almost everything makes me immediately gag it up. For certain foods, it's also the texture, and some, it is only the texture. I WILL gag it up. My mom says that ""it's all in my head"", which is a no-crap moment, since it seems that I am the only one experiencing this.
I am not overweight, at least. I don't care much for sugar in food, maybe that's why. But, I can tell that the unhealthy food is starting to attack me, but it is all I can stomach. The same applies for drinks. I mostly only like things with carbonation. I love carbonation. It is like it stimulates the back of my throat and adds a somewhat very faint salty twist to the drink. I love seltzer water. But, the only carbonated drinks I could have in the past were Pepsi and Coca-Cola products. I live in North Carolina, so we also have drinks like Cheerwine here. I love that stuff! But, once again, it is attacking me. I've already had gout before, in my left knee, and have had UTIs. Acidic UTIs at that. Stab in the belly button UTIs. Luckily, every time one has came, I caught it early enough to immediately drink water and get that thing out. Now, as I am posting this, mineral and vitamin filled seltzer water is very cheap. I try to get her to buy it as much as she can, as it's probably the most healthiest carbonated drink you can get (I know it still eats away at tooth enamel, so I have ways of taking care of that, and drink plenty of milk to regain calcium) and I am not putting that unhealthy syrup into my body constantly. My mother does not know I have had gout or various UTIs, because I would get non-stop lectures about how unhealthy I am, and then the only food in the house would be green crap and the only drink would be plain water. I WILL starve myself if that ""diet"" ever happens. I. CANNOT. STOMACH. THESE. THINGS. But, NOBODY LISTENS.

*Abnormal Behavior is another issue. When something gets to be too much/frustrating, I lose all sane control over my body and start beating the floor, jumping, shouting, etc... It actually just happened, because the paragraph I had written before got deleted and it made me too mad. When I was younger, I would throw things across the room and I would do very bad things like hitting myself in the head and biting. I still can get to this point today, but something *really* has to hit the wrong nerve. This next topic right here is kind of unexplainable (*cough*, inexplicable, but I didn't know the meaning of the word when I was typing this a few minutes ago), but I find cats so cute that I am unable to express myself. I will start talking in funny voices to the cats, I will smell their backs, I will kiss them (not like making out or anything romantic, but the same way other people kiss their animals), I will sing weird songs about them that I made, it's embarrassing, really.

*Relationship issues are another problem. It is dead impossible for me to connect with anybody. And my connection with my family is kind of odd. I have quite a bit of personal interests. More than two or three. I have around ten/eleven, BUT, they are the only things I normally like to talk about. If I have a diehard opinion about something, I am able to talk about one of my interests, or I really just want to spew out everything that's in my head, I will talk NONSTOP. People have frequently said that I almost never talk to anyone, but when I do, I cannot shut up. I am also told that I have said something rude quite often, but I never understand what's rude about what I said. Also, more cryptic sarcasm and jokes, I cannot understand to any point at all. The jokes are unfunny, and I take the sarcasm literally, and find it TOO funny. This makes me really distant from society. From a small child until age 11, I wanted to be alone, so I could care less. But, 11 to 13, I wanted friends really bad. I was treated like trash from everyone I talked to at school (At a large school mind you, not a small student body place) and often called a know-it-all or annoying or something to that effect. Me being a white boy from the most remote parts of the NC Mountains, living in a rather *meh* city in Central NC, going to a very ghetto school (and will be attending another one next year for High School) where other whites are far between few, and where the student body seems to think it is 1990s Compton or something already doesn't help that. So, my desire for friends decayed and was replaced with probably misanthropy, I think, i can't quite understand how I feel, but it may be that, I haven't decided yet. And now all I want to be is alone again. Abnormally alone, however. Like on a mountain hundreds of miles away from everyone else abnormal. On another planet in another solar system abnormal. And I have been alone like that before. And I enjoyed it.

*I am often in another world. I will daydream, literally. I will have myself inside my head, fighting evil enemies, or flying space vehicles, or doing cool stuff, and I completely zone out of whatever is going on. This causes me to jump and run down the hallway, and spin in spinning chairs, or rock in rocking chairs like crazy to release my excitement, because if I don't, it builds up until it is unbearable.

*There are other issues that I can't even categorize. Sometimes, out of nowhere, these bright white dots will appear and start moving across my vision. This isn't Schizophrenia, they look like cells or something organic of some sort, NOT a far off hallucination. And sometimes when I get up, I will feel really dizzy and confused. Certain thoughts will make me cringe really bad. Out of nowhere, I will get random of thoughts, like somebody dancing really awkwardly, or something, and it makes me literally cringe to the point where my mind will break if I don't struggle to think of something else. And if I don't get enough sleep, or I am awoken abruptly (which is everyday, because of crappy school, which is getting to the point where I can't take it anymore.), I will feel a bit sick. A rattle noise, sort of like a small chain necklace, will come from my throat, and just flat out nausea occurs.

*I have been called a hypochondriac by my mom. Mainly for the skin issues. I am NOT no damn hypochondriac. These have all been lifelong. I have no desire to have something wrong with me, and I have never been worried about being ill in any way (apart from now), and calling me this is getting me as far away from help as possible. My (genetically, not relation-ally) distant family has a small number of hypochondriacs, so I know what Hypochondria is like. It isn't me, I have a real issue that I DON'T WANT.

*My mom has said several times before that she thinks I have some disorder. I can't remember the name, BUT, I remember that it starts with the letter A. What disgusts me is that everytime she stated that she thought I may have that illness or whatever it is, she said she was going to ask the doctor for a diagnosis/referral. But everytime we would go to the doctor, SHE WOULD NEVER MENTION IT. The last time she called me that A illness or whatever name was in the Summer of 2017, Late June, and hasn't mentioned it since (I would remember it immediately if I heard it, because it sounds kind of German or Latin or something like that to me). What I do notice is that everytime she called me that word, it was when I was talking nonstop, getting on her nerves, and saying (unknowingly) rude stuff. Unfortunately, the only thing she calls me anymore is ""Hypo"" and not that one word. If she did, I would nag her to death to take me to the doctor since she called me it, just to see if it may be an answer, but I don't think it will happen, so, there goes a possible window shut. Also, it isn't ADHD (which I believe is way too overdiagnosed now), it is not that I am hyperactive when I fidget, but I am too excited. Like, when I get a gift I really like, which, is almost never, since I never usually get gifts, I will start flapping my hands. I have no idea why, but I don't like it.

*For anyone wondering why I don't just ask my mom what she thought I may have, I practically know I have very bad anxiety (so no, that's not the A-word either) and that makes it impossible to ask her or the doctor these things. And I don't tell her about the Anxiety because that only contributes to the Hypochondriac label. I can understand why someone would think I am just being a hypo, these are a lot of issues going on here, but I promise this is a real demon in me.

Info about me:
Mid 14 year old male, in case age/gender is relevant
Lives in North Carolina, in case environment is relevant

Mental Disorders/Illnesses that run in my direct bloodline:
Cognitive Disability (formerly known as Mental Retardation)
Minor learning disorders (Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, etc...)

Schizophrenia is present, I believe, but is very distant and **very** few family has it. I think only two members have it.

I have none of these at all. Unfortunately, Cognitive Disability is extremely common in my family. The second and third, not so much.

Also, about speech delay, I asked my mom about what age I first spoke and her reply was ""I don't know?! Probably when you were one. I believe I was able to answer ""yes"" and ""no"" type questions, but I find it funny how she says I spoke at one, BUT I have quite a bit of memories from two, and three, and in every single one of them, I was dead mute. I was probably just a late talker. 

I know almost everything about most severe mental disorders since they all run in my family (just not in MY bloodline), but I haven't heard of one to explain this crap.

Nothing makes sense anymore. I am so confused. 

It's in my nerves, and it wants to get out. I can feel it.

11,"I'm an adult filled with self hatred and self doubt. I think part of it stems from having overly critical parents and also being teased when younger. 


It has now gotten to the point where I have a very weird symptom. It is this impulsive, subconscious ""tourettes"" like habit of blurting phrases out loud such as ""I hate myself, I'm an idiot, I'm so stupid, I'm so ugly"" and so on. I don't know how this developed. It's really weird because I've never experienced a problem like this before. I never used to talk to myself. My mouth just started blurting these things out loud without my conscious awareness. I don't even realize that I said the thing until afterwards. It's like my brain has now decided to start vocally spewing out the subconscious thoughts it is filled with.


I really don't want to see a psychiatrist/psychologist/etc. I hate nothing more than intimacy, and having to tell a person face to face about my problems, I am also paranoid about them writing things down on my medical file. I don't really think it would help much either.

13,"Hey friends. Going through a really rough patch atm and not sure how to cope. I have this placement coming up for uni and i’m struggling with feelings self-doubt and fear of failure. I feel like sometimes I fantasise about self-sabotaging because if I don’t try then I won’t fail or something like that. 

I think the real problem is that day to day i’m not coping. My mental state is really interfering with my ability to keep on doing the things I need to do and I end squandering my time giving up because i’m overwhelmed. Can someone help me understand what’s going on from a mental health point of view?

There’s this dilemma also in that sometimes I wish my life would fall apart so I could deal with these issues but I feel that I don’t have time because there are things I need to do, like my life can’t stop for my head if you know what I mean?

14,"To give some context. I'm a 20-year-old male who has been driving for a little under 2 years. I have severe ADHD and have a tendency to day dream while driving. Yesterday I got a new job at a warehouse. Like the idiot I am I decided to jog several miles before working in a hot warehouse where I'd have to lift 50-pound bags all day and stay on my feet for 10+ hours. On my first day at the job I had to stay an extra 4 1/2 hours to assist another employee who was trying to catch up after calling out sick for two days. I guess this was a test from my manager on my first day to see how I can handle extra work hours, so he decided to pick me to help him. So, I worked from 4:30 PM to 7:30 AM without eating and jogging a shit ton before my shift. I was constantly lifting 50lb bags for the whole time in a hot environment. After work, I was more tired than I had ever been, even worse, my phone wouldn't turn on and I wasn't familiar with the roads to get there. I had used google maps to find my way to the warehouse. I was blinking constantly and felt like dozing off but stupidly didn't just take a nap in the car because I just wanted to go home. I tried to retrace where I drove from, wasn't paying attention and ended turning in on the wrong side of a highway ramp and realized I was on the wrong side of the road with oncoming traffic. From my point of view the grass area that divided the two separate roads looked okay enough to drive through just to get on the right road, but the grass was tall and hid how deep the ditch was, so I got stuck in there and had to wave down for cars as I couldn't use my dead phone. I am aware this was illegal, but I could not turn around because there were too many cars coming my way. A lady pulled over and called the cops and I asked for someone to tow my car. The cops came and gave me a ticket for improper lane change/use. I just rode with the dude in the tow truck to get to my apartment, he dropped my car off there and I paid him for it. This is probably the most dangerous and stupid thing I have done in my life.",02Jun2018,9
15,ok so i take prozac for anxiety and depression- i usually take it in the mornings but yesterday i had forgot and took it at around 6pm instead. at like 10pm i had a headache so i decided i would take some advil pm because i was going to sleep anyway. i went to sleep about 15 mins later and as i was laying down i got this wave come over me- i felt really dizzy as if i were about to pass out (my anxiety causes me to faint so i know the feeling quite well) my heart was skipping beats and my head was fuzzy. i was terrified of falling asleep because i thought i was going to have a heart attack- i’ve taken advil pm before i started medication and this has never happened before. i think it might have something to do with the meds because they give you more energy while advil pm does the opposite. is that what happened? or is it just a side effect? ,02Jun2018,1

23,"Well. This is the only place I feel alright with putting this because no one knows me. Well for starters mental illness runs in my family. My mother has manic depression aka Bipolar disorder. My brother was diagnosed with Autism. (aspergers) Two of my fathers siblings have bipolar as well. But my brother is a very high functioning. He has loads of other things like OCD, depression list goes on. He’s been to therapy in the past. But it’s hard for me to even start thinking this. A close friend kinda made me had this realization. I don’t think I can ever get helped. My parents culture doesn’t really believe in therapy but since my brother was so severe before it they did it. But I don’t want to be another ‘burden’ on my parents. They are already so drain by my brother ever since he was born. I don’t want to tell them anything. I hear voices in my head that sometimes aren’t mine. Maybe about a year ago I used to see rats in my dads house but we live where rats don’t even survive but I believed it so much that I told him and begged him to get rat trapes. Months later he then told me they were probably just Lizards in the house but I know I saw them. Things in my head I believe what they tell me. Sometimes I would just stare at the floor. I don’t
know why. I have a fear of Meeting anyone that I haven’t met in person but online. If someone doesn’t answer me in a certain amount of time I think they will say bad about me. I feel like people will come to my house and tell my parents that they know how fucked up I am. I have so much trouble having social interactions. And keeping up a conversation. On school nights I wouldn’t sleep because I felt like everyone knew that I was scared to talk. I kept replaying the situations in my head. I never really thought too much about any of because I was always the one that was normal in the head.   I don’t want anyone to have to worry more. To think I’m gonna pull something. But I don’t know what’s wrong with me. If there’s anything wrong with me. If it’s even a big deal. Know writing all this it doesn’t seem to much of a deal. Should I get help? I just wish I had someone to talk to. I have a boyfriend and I’m afraid to tell him all this because I feel like he won’t understand. And I try to act and pretend like it’s normal or doesn’t exist but I can see myself act out in these ways with him and I don’t even know what to tell him. Because we both relate in the way that life is hard you’re lucky to have food on your table. Your lucky you have a place to sleep. And that is sometimes my mindset. That I should just be happy I have somewhere to sleep and not be bitching about inside my head cause that really doesn’t matter. I don’t know. Any advice to what’s wrong with me? What I should do?

24,"Backstory: my name is DJ, I'm 22, Male. I've been going to a county mental health center due to extreme debilitating anxiety, major depression, and bi-polar disorder. I am living with grandparents and literally have no money and debt due to student loans after dropping out with a mental breakdown. I have been going to the mental health center for 8 months+ and was just now about to get anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds on Monday 6/4/2018 when I had my biological father offer to pay for them. I have been suicidal in the past but am not currently and have not been for a few weeks. I got picked up last time I was suicidal by police/ambulance and taken to the mental hospital after being told that I have to go ""Or else they will make me"". This is my biggest fear. To have the last bit of control taken away from my own life and forced to take medication against my will. When I got to the facility I was told that I did not have to be there and was very confused. why? I was told that I did! I could finally relax after having multiple panic/anxiety attacks.

Current situation: One of my friends has been worried that I have been suicidal (I have not been) and called the crisis hotline on me multiple times because I said that I was ""hopeless but still moving for now"" and that was an alert to her. My therapist questioned me about it and I said plainly that I was not suicidal. On Wednesdays visit I was told that my therapist thinks a voluntary visit to the hospital would be beneficial and reassures me that I would only have to be there for a minimum of 24 hrs and I could refuse treatment If I was uncomfortable with it. I declined at the moment, She said to ask any time for a referral, and I decided to think about it.

When I come back Friday with trust/confidence in my therapist and decide to try. Every muscle in my body was fighting me, and I was incredibly nauseous, But I pushed on trusting my therapist and asked to go voluntarily. I sat in the lobby for 2.5 more hours and was brought into the therapists room and told that some doctor that I had never met decided that I could only go involuntarily through a court order, that I have to stay a minimum of 7 days to 3 months maximum, and I will have no say in the medication, time I stay, and other treatment. I never got a choice. She knew this was my biggest fear and she said nothing and just went along with it. she tried to prevent me from leaving but I ran out and drove to another state. I was wanting to get better... I wanted the meds and needed someone to talk to but now I feel betrayed and like I cant trust any of these facilities or the people in them. I had an appointment for Monday for meds that I really can not live without and the police will be looking for me and I dont know if I should or even can go to the appointment. Im scared, Homeless, and so fucking distraught.

Before anyone says I overreacted.... I SAID I HAVE *EXTREME** ANXIETY*

Help. I don't know what to do to fight the court order. I cant survive on my own with no money and going to the mental hospital is not an option if I am force to be there. please help.",02Jun2018,2

27,"This applies to all sicknesses/issues but we are focusing on mental health. 

As a company or a business you want to do well. You know how vital employees are and their efficacy is important. So many places offer benefits that include counselling or money for therapy but if the employees don’t feel like they can utilize it, what's the point? 

So many people I have talked to have gotten this warning in some form (including myself) :

You have a hardworking employee who has put in countless overtime hours (a lot for free as they are on salary), worked from home on top of office hours. 

You get them in a review to tell them: you had too many sick days this year, and you are being monitored. 

They have now shut you out, there was no support or understanding (or even asking if they are okay),  now they are angry, hurt and scared to lose their job. So they stop doing what they need to do in order to function, they will also stop being as productive.

-They come to work sick and make others sick, some even landing in the hospital.

-They are so tired from working the night before (and everything they have to do in their own life)  that they are falling asleep at their desk.

-They miss vital tests, appointments, counselling out of fear of retribution, they miss a diagnosis, continue to get sicker. They have a heart attack, a mental breakdown, or commit suicide (yes, it is this serious).

-Or, as someone with a sick child like me, they have to take a day and they live in fear of losing their job and money.

(and yes I hear you, you offer holidays and flex days, sometimes for a period of time someone needs a little more support).

Trust me, I hear ALL your rebuttals, and I have heard them all before.

You want to keep your old school views?

-""Hey, they should be grateful they even have a job"" (guess what? most are grateful, they actually want to eat and keep a roof over their family's head, they cannot control what needs arise).

-""In my time, we had to suck it up"" (yeah, sounds like you had it good?) - they will suck it up and push it down until they explode, meanwhile giving you about 50% or less, as they are to exhausted and stressed to do more.

-""We don’t want problem employees"" - seriously? this has to be one of the most weak excuses in the book. Everyone is HUMAN and has something come up in their life, needing extra help. You don't consider yourself a ""problem"" when you have an issue, so why would you apply that to someone brave enough to state what they need. 

The list could go on forever.

I am here to tell you without a doubt, you are losing money, time, productivity, and extremely loyal good employees. You will one day have to pay people out, end up in a time consuming lawsuit (taking time and money away from your actual work and company), word will get out one way or another and you will be judged by everyone who is doing business with you. 

The people who take advantage of kindness are easily and quickly exposed due to their attitude, social media and how they respond

Now the flipside:

This is a personal experience one back in 2006 I believe. (I have been on both sides, being supported and being discriminated against) : I was having some serious, painful bladder issues that required extensive tests. This was physically and emotionally draining. I approached my HR department at that time and was candid about what was happening, that there will be more tests, but I have used all my vacation and flex days on this already. 

The response : You are a hard worker when you are here, you are valued and do your part. Do whatever you need to do in order to get better. Don’t worry, you will still have a job and we will still pay you. They NEVER brought it up again and I continued to do what I needed to get better. 

The relief was instant, the fear was gone. I got my tests and it took about a year to find out what was wrong and get treatment (now I have no pain!).

This was exactly how to handle it, and do you know what? Because I was free from fear, filled with gratitude, they had an employee who would go above and beyond for them. I worked extra hours and lunch breaks because I believed in them (so the work was more detailed and careful because I cared). I spoke so highly of them, everyone wanted to work there, I was one of the most efficient employees they had in that department. I created training programs, and training engagements to help others with the software and helped them ultlize their time more efficiently. When I left there due to moving to another city, the Controller came into my office and stated ""I have never met anyone who cared about their job as much as you"". Well, this is in part because of them, because they believed in me, allowed me to do what I needed to do without fighting for it. They showed me loyalty back (I don't care if it was real or fake, it changed my life for the better). This company gained money, time, and productivity not only from me, but all the people around me. All from this simple act of compassion and follow through.

  We have entered a new time of acceptance and support, a lot of  companies are still in the dark ages (although I give you credit for the places trying to make changes). Discrimination and bullying someone for being sick or stressed in anyway is no longer tolerated. Between people needing to go on disability (a lot occurring from the lack of support within the company), payouts, paying to train new staff, bitter people who will only do the bare minimum work. You, my dear companies are on the losing end of business. 

If you help someone on their path to being whole, you have now gained loyalty (from them and others who witnessed your support) , saved money, made more money and increased productivity tenfold. Your company can thrive like you have never seen it before.

28,"I should be dead, well should I be dead? I mean if I was supposed to be I would be, right?
Someone is watching over me. I say it’s my Angels, God
It can be whatever you want to call it, as God does not judge, there is no right way to believe as many would like you to think

You see the pretty pictures and nice words on the wall. You think you don’t have faith because it portrays this calm tranquility that you have never been able to reach. 

You hear of people saying “just hold on” “ it will get better” “there is a reason for this” 
“have faith”
And you want to punch them in the face, as they have no idea what this is like

Faith, my friends can be downright ugly, terrifying and lonely. It is not fluffy and pretty. I am not saying always, but this writing is about the other side of faith

Understanding why in the moment doesn’t always happen and it is truly hard to have faith. Could I say I have always had 100% faith? No absolutely not.
Even now, when I have always been okay, when I have been saved too many times to count, I doubt

For me, Faith came from the darkest place, on my knees pain. No understanding why this was happening. This is not a one-time thing. This is many times. From being trapped physically, to being trapped in my mind to the point I could not speak. The death of someone I could not bear to lose, to being homeless. I remember pain beyond despair at times. Here is the thing, when I was given the signs; It was not always this calm peaceful feeling that everything was going to be okay. Faith was still getting up each day; Faith was continuing to reach out for help, even when I thought no one would hear me. Faith was putting one foot in front of the other. Faith was painful, I had no idea why or when this would be lifted. My deepest faith is arriving much later, sometimes years later, after seeing some of the pieces fall into place. Some of the answers I still do not have. I was hurting, angry, scared and devastated. Sometimes I even hated the answer. I mean kicking, screaming bawling hated.

Don’t expect calm, lovey dovey feelings. Faith is not about feelings. It is the action.
You don’t have to buy into the hype, or see spirits from the sky. Just get up and move, Cry, yell, scream, laugh, anything, the rest will be taken care of. The answers will come if you are open to hearing them. Well, they come even if you are not open.
If you can’t keep moving, that’s okay. Just stay. Please stay. I know it’s dark, terrifying, the worst you may have ever felt. I know you don’t see a reason why. I cannot tell you when you will see the reason why but it will come. One of my answers took over 20 years to appear

Faith is...beautifully brutal

This isnt a real cry for help, more as a statement for where things stand.  
  
Im 24 years old and I have gone back and fourth through so many phases in my life. My internal feeling mechanism has changed...I dont know if that makes sense. Simply put, I have changed. Inside and outside.  
  
Anyway lets get to it.  
I think there is a machine that is able to control humans to such a infinite degree, that nothing is possible.  
I think there are people following me.  
I think this has been going on for so long that people already have an idea of who I am...Like everyone on Earth.  
I think that people lie to me about these ideas.  
Im pretty delusional but my therapist says that people are able to live with there illnesses. Kind of like the Movie A Beautiful Mind. Where hes crazy but he's able to live with the illness and even create new theorems and shit, you know?  
I just dont know where else to write these ideas down and I would really like someone elses opinion about these ideas I have. 

It all started in 2011 when I started to surf, I was so scared to catch waves but I knew inside I could actually surf these waves. I felt like it was a machine following me, people holding onto me, not letting me do anything, not achieve any sort of happiness, not do a damn thing...

But that all changed when I finally got the balls to go to therapy, and be honest with my therapist about the way I feel it.
I guess Im just always like this, these ideas, they are just forced into my head. Thats just me, I just live like this, exactly like how I wrote down.

I just want to say, its not to late, if you're struggling. just understand that you are able to function. you're a human. I deal with this shit every *single* day.

Anyway thanks for reading this, it probably sounded like a shit faucet.

31,"What Everyone Should Know About Psychiatry:

1: No physical test for a ""mental illness"" exists:

""Mental disorders don't really live ‘out there’ waiting to be explained. They are constructs we have made up - and often not very compelling ones.""

-- Allen Frances, DSM-IV chief in “DSM in Philosophyland: Curiouser and Curiouser” in AAP&amp;P Bulletin vol 17, No 2 of 2010

Also:

“there's no definition of a mental disorder. It’s bullshit. I mean, you just can’t define it.”
-- Allen Frances @wired.com

2: It's impossible to have a physical test (for a ""mental disorder"") because someone still must decide which behaviors are bad. (Subjectively.)

(Even if a physical test linked ""behavior A"" to something, someone would still have to decide which behaviors were bad.)

3: ""Mental disorder"" theories justified slavery &amp; more:

""[Drapetomania] was a mental illness... that caused black slaves to flee captivity.[1]"" -- wiki

""Dysaethesia aethiopica caused laziness among blacks &amp; was cured by whipping.""
-- wiki

Also homosexuality, transexuality, &amp; ""female hysteria"" (etc )were ""mental disorders.""

4: Psychiatrists sell pills, not therapy.

""A 2005 government survey found 11 percent of psychiatrists provided talk therapy to all patients... and that's most likely fallen since.""

-- ""Talk Doesn’t Pay, So Psychiatry Turns Instead to Drug Therapy""

5: Psychiatrists are paid by the diagnosis.

“You have to diagnose to get paid,” he said with a shrug. “I play the game.”

-- nytimes.com

6: Psychiatrists aren't volunteers (they work to profit, not to ""help you."") They make $193,789 on average.

7: Psychiatry isn't voluntary. Psychiatrists can:

. . A: order you to take pills for life. (With police force.)

. . B: Jail you without evidence/conviction. (eg, if you're accused of bad behavior. Or if you refuse their drugs.)

. . C: Forcefully tie you &amp; drug you. . . Etc.

(Frankly, in a scientific world psychiatrists who use violence would be criminals.)

8: Psychiatrists do not make drugs, but limit your access to them (unless you pay $$$.)

(""The drugs helped me"" != ""psychiatrists helped me."")

9: ""Mental health"" doesn't physically exist:

The mind is not a physical thing &amp; can't have physical properties like ""health.""

35,"Hey all, 

First things first: Sorry for formatting (on mobile). Sorry for the terrible throwaway name. 

I am a paramedic/firefighter and recently we have had a string of calls for “suicidal” patients. I put it in quotes because each call is different and each patient is at a different point in the process of having Suicidal Ideations to acting upon them. 

Our contact time with these patients is usually between 15-60 minutes based on the level of their immediate medical needs. Throughout paramedic school and in our Continuing Education training pretty much the only advice we are given in dealing with these patients is just to “be supportive”. Obviously this advice is good and much better than being judgmental or criticizing the patient, but I am wondering if there is more I can do. 

Each patient is obviously different from one another, so I know it’s hard to give broad suggestions. Other than just speaking to them in a supportive manner and tone/not acting condescending or judgmental, what can I do? 

Time is a limited factor in asking the background of why they are feeling this way, and we are transporting the patients to an emergency room to be medically cleared to go to a psych facility that has highly trained professionals waiting. 

The physical health aspect is easy and straightforward to deal with. The mental health needs of these patients is what I would like to feel more comfortable with.

Ends up with me apologizing for nothing, and feeling like hell for hours / days. And no one knows what actually happened. The person who hurt me hasn't probably even realized hurting my feelings, and I keep apologizing without knowing for what, and at the end everyone is p****ed off by my apologizing.

44,"So I've had depression for 8 years (currently 22~)  and I've since ""recovered"" and have been very stable for about 6 months and off meds for 2ish, however I still get these feelings and urges to just give back into the negative feelings and let my self get bad again- I was told self harm is basically an addiction but I never though it was like a /real/ addiction until now, being an ex-smoker it feels basically the same.

45,"Hello.

I have a problem, and I wasn't able to find out what it is \- I couldn't find anything like this on internet.

It started with hypochondria, I was overly concerned about health problems that I imagined I have. It evolved into something horrible, atrocious and vile \- this problem is literally RUINING MY LIFE. The problem is: obsessive thoughts about dying \(from certain disease/condition, it rotates and changes\) at a certain time. For example I could see a clock with a particular hour \- and it suddenly kicks in eg. like this: you will suffer heart attack/stroke/anything else that instakills you at this particular hour, or like this: playing galciv 2 and colonizing a planet \(the planets have usability classes like 12 or sth\) of class 12 \- boom, after I colonized it \- YOU WILL SUFFER STROKE AND DIE IN 12 minutes \(always related to numbers I see\). And I get terrible somatizations from it \- if the intrusive thought was about heart, I have chest pains, if about brain headache, etc. \+ always terrible panic \- I can't ignore this bullshit cause the intrusive thought instantly defends itself like 'and what if really??'. Please help, I can't play games now, can't do anything stressful, I live in constant anxiety. How to fight this horrid bullshit, please help me",02Jun2018,2
46,"So I want to start with the negative aspects because that’s how my day started. So my mother and I (I suggest reading my last post on my unfortunate relationship with my mother, and her personality at times) went for a drive and things were mostly well. So she tasked me to go in a Walmart, grab an item, and leave. I figured that was since we were doing well since last night.

I recall her mentioning the absurdity of People of Walmart, the page where people are photographed and placed on the website for their goofy appearance. Anyway, for whatever reason when I entered the Walmart, I noticed the people looked strange. I saw a woman with bunny ears, I saw the typical 50-year old man/woman who worked there (who I always feel for), and I just started worrying. I didn’t know why exactly I started feeling nervous and anxious. I think I felt a bit overwhelmed because... well not to be condescending, but the people in that particular store *seemed* like they’d belong on People of Walmart.

I thought I was experiencing social anxiety because the store seemed so crowded. I’ve never felt anxiety in this context of feeling overwhelmed because of ‘strange people’ before. While I was covertly worrying, a woman in her 50-60s asked me for help reaching a tall item. I was happy to help her, but was still feeling strange.

This caused a scary feeling. If I’m correct I may have been detached at the very least, and numb. I was concerned I was suffering from derealization. One somewhat scary thing was I had some intrusive thoughts relating to harm, and they were frightening because I worried if I was actually harmful, but I’m well-aware they were intrusive in nature.

Important to note that another similar fear is worrying if it’s possible to lose contact with reality or ‘go crazy’. If you’d like, refer to my other posts.

However, when I returned home and went for a walk in this hot weather, I noticed all of the vibrant colors in nature and how pretty the day looked. Of course, I was very relieved that the ‘derealization’ only lasted for around an hour, as I felt much better when I went for the walk and such. 

The positive aspects of today were:

* Today I did mindfulness meditation, and it’s really good to hear an instructor (albeit from an app) reassure you that things will be fine, and let you know that you are valued. Sometimes we forget that in our busy, stressful lives.

* I enjoyed talking with someone who isn’t really a friend, but they seemed vibrant and I was happy to be cordial.

* I was happy to calm down and notice my breath.

* During the meditation, I was questioning my grounding in reality and whether or not I was in contact with reality. Shortly after I realized that I am questioning reality, so I must have a grasp on reality. I’ve always considered myself to be a realistic person.

* I am happy and thankful for the myriad of resources available, and I am happy to be alive although life seems very stressful and weird at times.

I am happy to receive support from you all. Am eager to receive feedback and advice!",02Jun2018,2
47," I have BPD , major fucking depression , and anxiety. I can’t keep a job because of my moods and I can’t smile and be happy all day long like expected. I’ve had managers bitch at me about my attitude and not smiling enough which honestly makes me feel like shit because I’m trying hard to appear normal but I just can’t. I also can’t deal with rude customers because I give the attitude right back , I literally cant help it. I’m gonna be applying for disability soon but that in itself is a very long process and I will mostly be denied the first time. 
So I’m wondering if you guys know of any low stress jobs or even company’s that work with people with mental illnesses or something because I’m basically fucked for having income for myself. ",02Jun2018,9
48,"this isn't really having a heavy impact on my everyday life, so i've kinda put off trying to fix whatever's wrong, but i'm sick of waking up and chasing to come back to my senses, crying, and just feeling shitty in a way i can't describe when this does happen. 

long story short, i used to live with my abusive mother till i was 14, then moved to live with my dad. around maybe a year after i moved in with him (at least that's when i think it was) i had a nightmare where i was back there-it all felt so real. these nightmares have kept happening for years now, sometimes spread out over time and sometimes almost nightly. 

while sometimes they're not too bad, and i'll wake up feeling relatively ok, other times when i wake up it feels awful. this is kinda what i'll be thinking/feeling: all the shit i went through in my dreams, i can't be upset about cause none of it was real. but it felt so real. is this real? i know deep down it is but my dream felt real to... and then i'll feel pretty disoriented, kinda trying to distract myself and bring myself back to reality. sometimes i'll hit my arm on something or hurt myself to feel something, or ill let my dog, but either way if it's bad i'm usually crying pretty hard. 

i'm posting this because today was another one of those days. one of the bad ones. idk if it matters, but in my dream last night, i was living back there, and i remember i let my mom borrow my phone and then she started looking through it, getting mad at me for things on it and calling me a slut, we started arguing, and i remember specifically her saying how she'd only wanted one kid, but because i was such a fuck up she'd had my little sister. i remember trying to call my dad and ask for him to come get me, to try and say i didn't wanna live there anymore. the next thing i know it's me, my dad, and my mom and a car. me and my dad both knew it was a dream at that point and i asked him to kill her to end it all. he said he couldn't, and i understood (he's too caring a person). then i remember my mom running him over with a car. it was really graphic, he was really splattered by the wheels. i was screaming and crying at the same time but nothing was coming out, and that's about when i woke up. i think i might have been trying to scream in my sleep, but i'm not sure if it worked or not. anyway

i figure maybe these dreams mean i haven't really moved on, but i don't know what to do to stop them. i want to move on but i feel like this makes it harder. does anyone know what this even is (like is there a term i could put to my situation) or more importantly, how to fix this?

49,"I went to a consultant at a hospital near me, in order to see if there was any reason to why I felt the way I did. To put it into context, I’ve been struggling between extremely high vanity, to the point of narcissism but at the same time I also get incredibly un-motivated and angry at myself. I’ve also been feeling worse and worse because I have incredibly high standards with myself but I cannot seem to put it the effort to do anything, which has lead to a lot of issues. Another issue is that I’ve struggled with trying to figure my sexuality out in an incredibly conservative Christian family and country.
I also have an incredibly volatile temper and end up lashing out at people and overreacting greatly, to the point where I used to cut myself when I got angry to stop myself from lashing out at other people
The start of self harm though, lead me to start depending on it for when I was experiencing any extreme emotion such as frustration, fear or even getting overly excited.
I told everything to the counsellor and she said I had something they called ‘Emotional dysregulation’ (I think that’s the name) and basically said I had a lot of trouble handling emotions
She named no other problems and just suggested I go on the pill to try and tone down my periods in order to help regulate my emotions.
When I went home however and searched the name, it seemed just be an addition to many problems, nothing came up for it by itself 
That’s made me terrified that I’m just a bad person and that since it’s not connected to anything it’s a problem I’ve brought onto myself. I was wondering if anyone else has gone through the same thing, or if anyone can give advice concerning this?

TL;DR: My councillor told my I had emotional dysregulation but no other problems, so is it something I made up and is it my fault?

52,"So, I'm going to join college in a month or two. I worked super hard to get into the top college of my priority list. I got my 2nd prior university. That's okay. But, I'm tired now. I don't feel the excitement of this new thing. I'm not even interested in the subjects that I felt devoted to my entire life.

I took a gap year and have been mostly isolated. I worked on different things but never really got to know someone new. I seldom meet my old school friends (perhaps, once in 2-3 months), who are currently in a college. But that's not the thing. The scary thing is that I never felt a need for it. I never felt a need to have a friend. I seriously don't know why. It isn't that life just went flawless. I have had serious difficulties this year, but I always tried to tackle these myself. In the process, I might have become tough but one thing's for sure, I have become socially inactive. I know that's equivalent to 5-6 cigarettes a day. 

Nowadays I don't feel anything. I feel that I'm lost even though from someone else's perspective my life is completely normal. Moreover, I'm having extreme mood swings. I'm a male. So, I really don't know why. Sometimes I get up in a pretty good mood and then something pisses me off during the day which makes me completely think about destroying this whole world (of course I know I can't do that but who was stopped me from trying).

The above sentence might make you think that I'm a psychopath but here's another scary thing. If you'll ask anyone who knows me, you'll get to know that I am a good person to talk to. Probably, that's why my old school friends care to meet me and not other people from school.

I think I've changed a lot in this gap year. I think I need help. Sorry for the wall.",02Jun2018,1
53,"So I’m not even sure if this means I have a mental health problem or not. I made a new account for this because I don’t want anyone to know this about me. When I was about 18-19 I had an imaginary friend for a year. It’s so old to have one, it wasn’t even something I meant to do. 

So it started when this image of a girl would just come into my head. Black hair, black plain clothing and a white face. Looks like a fairly normal goth teen about 20 years old. The images of her just kept popping up in my head like a memory, but I don’t know her she doesn’t exist 

Then I started to involuentarily imagine her in the world. If I was laying down, I would imagine her next to me. I would then start to imagine her interacting with me. Like hugging me. Not in a sexual way becuase I’m straight and not into women

It got weird when she started talking to me. First I imagined what she would say, then it became also involuentary. Like it wasn’t me controlling what I thought she said anymore. She’s called Mary by the way

She became to be an almost constant presence in my life. Always next to me whatever I was doing. Sometimes commenting on things and talking to me. I started to do things like smile at her and touch her in a friendly way in public. I quickly stopped this to not seem weird, but she was disappointed when I didn’t talk back. I would lay next to her in bed for ages talking 

She started to get more annoying and aggressive. Wanting me to not do things without her. I stopped speaking to her, and she went away periodically. When she returned she was aggressive and annoying. I decided to get rid of her becuase it was getting to be a distraction. I imagined where she was contained within my mind, then imagined her being torn apart by turning to dust

This got rid of her but it’s still messed up that this ever happened, especially at that age. I don’t want Mary to ever return to me. What does this mean for my mental health anyway? Is it that bad?

By the way this is real. It’s not some sort of story or anything. It may seem like some bullshit but please don’t think it is",02Jun2018,2
54,"Hi Reddit, sorry if this post is very messy I just wanted to make sure I got everything in. I’m 13 by the way.

My first problem was picking up random crap from the street. Most likely hoarding. Nothing of value, receipts, feathers whatever. I know this is weird, but I guess I kind of felt bad for the rubbish? Like I felt bad that it had to fly away in the wind? Or I was  afraid of never seeing it again and losing it. It’s like I attach sentimental value to objects that are worth nothing and I’ve seen for about ten seconds. This one could get dangerous, I have tried to pick up stuff from the sides of roads so one day I might go too far and get run over. Not to mention the germs and diseases trash carries. Although I don’t want them to go, as long as I don’t see it happening it’s usually fine. Like if I dump it in my room and my mom cleans it away I won’t freak out as long as I don’t see it leaving. The sheer quantity of the stuff and how it’s all similar (trash) it makes it hard for me to become too extremely attached to them which helps, although other objects that are more distinguishable I find myself treating as if it’s very dear.I have mentioned this to my psychiatrist, she brought me on a walk around the car park and I didn’t pick any leaves up so she said she didn’t see much evidence of it. I resisted because the leaves weren’t flying in the wind, they were staying there. I could tell myself “it’s fine - they’ll always be there later for me to get”, the movement of the object changed my actions a lot. I didn’t go to the psychiatrist because of these problems, I originally went because I had food allergies and was too anxious around food and started avoiding people who ate things I’m allergic to and refusing food even though it was safe. Anyway, I was discharged two weeks ago so I’d have to go through a long sign-up process if I wanted to go back and I’d rather not do that if possible.

I feel like I absolutely have to record and document everything that I see in case I can’t remember it in the future. This feels as though I’m hoarding thoughts or memories in a way. Something that is a huge problem for me is clouds. Clouds change a lot through the day and form different shapes, whenever I see a cloud I have to take a picture of it or else it will change shape and it will be lost forever. But if I try to remember it I might not be able to, or I might remember it wrong. Walking down the street can be very hard sometimes as I can’t look at the sky in case there’s clouds and I can’t look at the ground in case there’s objects, my only other option would be to close my eyes, look weird and get killed. The other day I panicked, I was watching a YouTube video and a random image showed up on the screen for a split second then vanished, I was pacing up and down the stairs mumbling to myself and running around with my heart rate as if I’d just chugged ten cans of red bull. I had no idea what this image was or came from, it’s something that might irk or bug someone but times a hundred. I later realised it was a freeze frame from the video. Another issue for me is people saying things. If someone says something and trails off/mumbles I often have to ask them to repeat it to the point where it’s becoming an inconvenience to my friends. Although this one doesn’t matter as much.

TLDR:  I keep feeling like I have to document or record random stuff such as cloud formations or certain ways objects are placed in fear that I won’t remember it in the future despite having no need to. I also pick up random trash from the street because I am afraid of losing it despite it having no value and in general feel like I need proof of even irrelevant things. It’s a big problem for me and I keep thinking about it for the whole day if not longer and it’s really making everyday things hard.

55,"I think I'm mostly posting here so that I can remember everything to talk to a doctor about, once I can figure out how to get health care and get to a doctor.

I need to figure out how to narrow down my symptoms for the five minutes I'm going to get with a doctor, seeing as how I'm low income.

Terrified of upsetting anyone ever. Lashes out inappropriately with misplaced anger at people that I care about or most recently a complete stranger who was an obvious meth head and was bothering me. 
Incredibly low self-esteem, zero confidence. 
Have barely left the boat (boat life) in six months.
addicted to Phone, watching Netflix, 
sitting never going anywhere, never exercising. 
Binge eating and yo-yo dieting. Sudden burst of energy that make me feel like I need to get everything done right now, or start a diet or life change. Sometimes I'll be going and going, anxious and irritable but trying to make things better for myself, for a day, or weeks, but then I get super depressed again. My lack of confidence has made it incredibly difficult to find a job as I just really haven't been able to imagine being around other people in over a year. Two years. Five years. On and off. I'm a musician so this has super fucked my life.
 I get hyper focused on my phone and it honestly feel anxiety without it. I try to do other things I enjoy and I lose focus or get irritated or upset. Like guitar and singing, drawing, making things, writing, reading, being around other humans. I can't do any of it. 
I smoke way too much weed. 
I don't trust myself. I cannot make decisions because I do not trust myself to honestly know what I want because it seems to change so often. 
Social anxiety, lack of focus/hyper focus (I started a jewelry business in six weeks and was succeeding, couldn't stop working, spent zero time with my boyfriend who lives with me) but then dropped it when I got too overwhelmed/depressed) 
I don't recognize myself anymore.

56,"I am a 17 year old male

To be very short In the summary of my life, my mother left me, my dad is abusive, my dads girlfriend is abusive, My whole family has degraded and called me a worthless piece of shit that shouldn’t exist, my dad has threatened to murder me and hide my body so no one can find it.

Whenever I want to go with friends, they always ask who it is and say they have to meet them, but I don’t want that to happen, so I don’t hang out with anyone. I don’t want anyone to see what I see. As a result, I barely talk to anyone, it’s hard to socialize. I haven’t dated before, because for the same reason, I don’t want my parents knowing about them.

I have moved to 12 different schools, and have been moving for most of my life, but each time I move, I make sure that I cut all ends, so I can ensure that my family won’t know them, because I have run into issues before with my family ruining relationships. I have no strong relationships.

During times of depression I feel the following:
Nothing matters anymore
I’m a piece of shit
I don’t deserve anything
I feel fog headed
I stop talking to people
All I do is play video games and browse the internet, by myself
I’ve severed any sort of communication with my family and friends
I am alone, I don’t speak
These are all very literal, when I say these

When I was younger, I went through a depression when my mother left, I felt extremely depressed, I stopped talking to a lot of people, I had a couple of friends, but over time, I was in a situation I was with someone else for a few years, and felt better.

Now I’m older, I’m in high school and I’ve been with my father and his girlfriend for a couple years and I feel the symptoms I listed above, I want to know if this is common, or if these are understandable.

I was in a situation that caused me to feel far more depressed then I was, I couldn’t feel anything, I was emotionless, I stopped caring about everyone, even myself. But now, I feel some emotion, why is that? I’ve lived on a porch with no insulation, where I’m from the winters can get to the negative temperatures. I’ve struggled to stay warm. Every day my family fights and scream st each other and me, I’ve followed my dad down a road to make sure he didn’t end himself because he took a gun with him and announced he was going to kill himself. 

I feel time just flies by, and I’m alone and by myself inside my head.
Nothing matters

Is this normal? Is there something wrong with me? I don’t want to feel like this, but is there a way to recover from this second depression?

63,"Hi! I am currently working on my masters of social work degree. 

I am very, very excited to be starting a field placement at a state hospital working with the criminally insane. I have my pre-employment physical exam coming up, and though I am in good physical health, I take medication for depression and anxiety. Both conditions are well managed, and I see a therapist and a psychiatrist regularly. I’m beginning to panic a little, however (thanks, anxiety!) as to whether these conditions may cause me to fail the physical. 

In California, employers can legally rescind their offer if findings from the physical exam indicate that the employee may not be able to perform the duties of the job. So, in theory, they might be able to claim that being “mentally unstable” could prevent me from effectively carrying out the job requirements. 

I don’t think it will be wise for me to lie about having these conditions, as I will need to disclose one of my prescriptions that will show up on the drug screen.

Has anyone had any experience with a situation like this, and/or any knowledge of what the typical state hospital pre-employment physical entails?

I don't want to say I hit rock bottom because there is no such thing, I thought I had reached it many times before but there are infinite shades of black in this hole, now I just descend through the vortex as new enemies and illnesses appear. I don't trust people, not myself, not books, I've read enough to know words won't heal my mind. I was betrayed and get betrayed on a daily basis by this stupid society we live in, I try to be of help whenever I can, I do good deeds, I really do, I try not to hurt anyone, I tried to protect my bleeding heart but lately I'm feeling a fire inside that just wants to consume me and everyone around me. The fire eats my flesh, I'm 1.76m and 49 kilos, I wish I could keep the fire to myself, but I've been getting agresive with the people around me.

I was diagnosed with aspergers this year, I'm 20, I always knew there was something up with me, everyone knew but we just didn't had a word for it, I was just the dude from outer space, you know? I've always felt like I'm not from here, my close ones told me I was special, and I hate to fucking admit it because I hate myself so much but I am, someway, somehow, in a way I can't describe, but what use does it have if I'm not happy, if I don't have a place to call a home or another sentient being to call a friend. I've lost faith in humanity and its ways, sometimes I just want to end it and let these people alone, let them live their meaningless lives, live the illusion, they are not even my race so why bother... Other times, when they hurt me, oh man, they don't know the size of the void inside... I fantasize about things I don't want to talk about.

*Parenthesis (Fuck everyone who thinks aspergers are apathetic, I'm the dude to carry homeless and injured animals to my house, the one who talks to people who seem depressed in the street, the one who gives money and a talk to homeless people, really, fuck the neurotypical bastard who made that claim, fuck him for all eternity).

I stopped doing the things that made me happy (if I ever was). Since a kid I convinced myself I was going to take my own life and that's written in stone, I've never felt at home, my family has a story of mental illness, schizophrenia, OCD, anxiety and depression, and I got the aspergers, HA-HA DAMN ME (I fear I'll go schizo in the future as I experimented with drugs, I don't blame myself for it, those were good times). I'm thinking ""Why even post this, why even tell them about it, there's no faith left and you know it, you already know what happens next"" but fuck it I'm posting because why not, at least someone who reads this can feel that he is not the only one feeling that way. The intensity of my hate if proportional to the love I have (or once had) but fuck my eyes are pitch black right now. Is anyone good at talking to rocks? I'm really descending into madness, help.

69,"Hi. I think life is 99% discomfort not good. And maybe 1% decent ok good. And only in the recent times it got this 1% (medicine, electricity etc). It feels like that to me. I don't like how most people live. It seems to me - the masses of men live lives of quiet desperation. 

How to live life? It seems like constant hell unpleasant things not how I like? Basically another day another struggle. 

Like frustration and more frustration and unpleasantness discomfort and pain.

71,"There's someone I know on tumblr who has been incredibly hateful and aggressive towards someone struggling with mental health problems and posting about how they'd like to hurt that person for being ill and struggling but not getting better. Obviously, it's been pissing me off and I really want to go on anon and tell them they're being toxic and harmful \(in an advice sort of way, not an attack\) but i'm worried they'll somehow figure out who sent it to them. Has anyone here ever anonymously talked to someone on tumblr about mental health related stuff? Would it be a good idea to do this?",02Jun2018,2
