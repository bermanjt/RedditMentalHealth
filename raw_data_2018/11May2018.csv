1,"Hey guys I believe to have people living in my head. There's about 6 of them that I could identify. I know their names and what they look and act like, I'm not bothered by what they say but they do bring up and notice things that even I don't since they can see and hear what I can. I can't seem to focus at school because of them, they don't get me into trouble or anything but I do zone out quite often sometimes even for a couple minutes. They always get into arguments with me and eachother. I don't necessarily hate it since I've known them for a big portion of my life. It feels extremely normal to me, they've become a big part of my life. does anyone else have this? ",11May2018,3,

5,"When I'm in a good mood, it feels like my brain is getting an electric message. I googled it and the only thing I could find that kind of explained it was brain zaps from antidepressant withdrawals, but I'm not on antidepressants.

6,"i have taken three antidepressants (citalopram, fluoxetine and venlafaxine), a mood stabiliser (lamotrigine) and an antipsychotic (aripiprazole). none of these have helped stop my pain. i’ve had CBT and a few other therapies to learn techniques to stop my emotions from causing me to feel pain but it’s not possible at all

what is next? my doctor says there is buckets of hope yet because there are dozens of treatments we haven’t tried, but i do not believe her because she is trying to convince me to retry old medications and won’t talk to me about anything new. when people tell me i need to learn how to spot signs that my feelings are getting too intense and stop them from becoming dangerous using therapeutic tools, i don’t understand what they mean. my emotions dictate everything. i have zero influence over them. no knowledge will let me combat that.

i don’t need anyone to tell me what my doctor should and shouldn’t be doing. i am just asking for a lifeline or a straw i can cling to. there are other medications i can try, but are they similar to the ones i have been on before in that they have terrible side effects and withdrawal symptoms without actually affecting mood? is there a therapy out there that will actually help me have some insight as to why i am so powerless in my feelings, and even teach me how to change that? i am speaking to a neurologist too but they say they can’t help me either. is there any other specialist who might be able to help? what about spirituality? does that help people like me who really can’t tolerate being alive for another day?

please give me anything. nothing has worked so far and my pain is gradually gradually getting more insufferable every day. i need something. no-one is giving me anything to survive on",11May2018,2,

8,"It’s been a year since I was last discharged. I was stable for about eight months when I entered into an abusive relationship. Like, he acted like he was going to kill me. Lord knows how I stayed sane while I was with him (my campus survivor advocate says that it’s common for victims to be in survival mode while they’re in the situation). When I left him, I developed PTSD. Caused me to start cycling (I have bipolar II). When trauma and mental illness meet, it’s just a recipe for disaster.
My life has fallen apart since then. School is bad. I only finished one class this semester, am taking incompletes for the rest. Sometimes I have to miss work if I’m having a particularly bad depressive episode or panic attacks from flashbacks. My apartment is a mess. It’s hard to clean when you’re suicidally depressed for a week, manic for a couple days, maybe stable for a day, then depressed again. I do some crazy things when I’m manic that I won’t get into. When I’m depressed, I isolate myself.
Pretty much, my life has become so dysfunctional that I can’t continue without some sort of intensive treatment. So I’m going back in the morning.
It’s a weird feeling. I know that I need to be here, but I never thought that I’d have to be back here, and that makes me disappointed in myself. Like I don’t have enough grit and should be able to heal and get my shit together on my own like a normal person. Like, isn’t one go at a mental hospital enough?

10,"Now most people would expect these words to come from someone much older. I'm not sure why I feel this way at my age.

Tomorrow is my birthday. I'm turning 20. Ever since I turned 19 the idea of getting any older has me terrified. I feel so much anxiety as my birthday gets closer and closer. I feel a huge part of this had something to do with me not feeling 20.
 
I went through a very traumatic time basically from age 14-17 and my life literally stopped those years (would rarely leave my house) I'm in a much better place now however I feel like I am reliving all of those years missed. I feel I should just now be around 17-18 since I feel like I have to relive the times I missed. I never got to experience how the things normally teens experience because my life stopped during that time. So as i get older and acknowledge that my age isn't how I feel it really makes me panic because it's like I feel I'm running out of time. I'm getting older and older and now I'm not even a teenager anymore yet I feel I never truly got to experience being a true teenager. 

I feel like I am running out of time and I'm not where I want to be, however I am working up to being where I want to be. Just the idea of doing this as I get older and older is terrifying. Any advice?",11May2018,5,
11,"Last June I had a nervous breakdown after living at home with my parents post college. They gave my anxiety especially since I felt I had to hide my mental health issues from them.

Upon this breakdown, I felt intense anxiety and panic and intense inner rage wanting to burst out of my mind, but I was blocked by fear and panic attacks. I wanted to smash the windows in my house, but of course I didn’t.

I tried to express my emotions to my parents but felt so blocked. I desperately wanted to leave and take a break from home, but I also feared this weird panic rage that left me rocking back and forth?

13,"For starter I'm 22 , I'm diagnosed with GAD and partially diagnosed with bipolar disorder ( I say partially because when I was younger it was a toss up on the diagnosis one Dr. said ADHD ... I'm not hyperactive , my attention span is fine other than when I'm distracted by stress ... Another said major depressive disorder , two said that Bipolar is hard to diagnose and not wise to treat in a kid but with a strong family history of it ,well yeah ... It's become more apparent as I got older, sorry for the long explanation of that ) 

I'm non medicated as I was ran through a whole list of pills for different things and soon learned they all gave me crazy horrible side effects ...though thanks to Lexapro I got through years of emotional abuse without really taking it to heart because I was a disaccociated zombie. I feel like I have more control without meds and am ( though I struggle ) really me, and I like that 

ANYWAY: 

For about a year I've had days where every muscle in my body is sore ( or my joints swell ) the only line I've drawn as a corrolation between those days is it always happens when I'm not in the most stable of mental states. 

Most days I'm fine ...days like today, started with me having night terrors all night , waking up angry and feeling physically like I had been in a car accident. I tried to do my morning yoga session ... Got mad at my body being unflexable and my mind being unable to silence and ended up feeling angry and embarrassed in an empty house , crying , stuck on the floor because my hips and knees where to stiff to allow me to stand up. Went to work because I'm embarrassed to call in for a mental health day. Manage to feel every emotion I own in an hour ... My hips loosen up , but my neck remains stiff lower back tight , feet and ankles on fire ... Hands and wrists swollen and to stiff to do stupid tasks like hand people change , fill glasses , grab sauce packets lift fryer baskets 
Things I do every day. And I got MAD over it ... However it must be noted that I don't have outbursts when I'm angry ( occasionally a growl or deep sigh)  it just silently boils in my chest but apparently it shows in my eyes as I had a few customers ask me if I was doing ok and one take my hand and tell me that days like this pass , and not to beat myself up ( thank you random older gentleman you made my day ) 

I ended up leaving early , my manager supported me , I'm pretty sure my boss is really angry but hey I felt useless as hell. 

When I got home I relaxed and tried to quite myself. most of my pain subsided but my hands are still sore , not nearly as bad though. 

Anyways Tldr: I guess I'm struggling with weither or not the physical pain is part of my mental inability to deal with stress, or if my physical pain is causeing my mental state to flip flop?

Can widespread pain and swelling be linked to mental health or should I be worried about something else?
 ... Like I've been told by a few people to be tested for RA ... But the symptoms for that are much much worse than what I experience . Also thyroid issues , and I should get my heart checked , run tests for fibromyalgia ect.... All of this kicks my anxiety through the roof as medical situations are that #1 fear  and besides with a written on my medical file ""anxiety tward medical situations"" usually if I go in with any complaint about my physical health unless it's blaintantly  apartent get turned away as ""your having an anxiety attack or are probably imagining it ""

25,"I’ve been “recovered” (very reluctant to use that word now) from my ED for 1-2 years. I haven’t thrown up since August 2016. 

For some reason today, literally about half an hour ago, I threw up. I never thought this would happen ever again. I pretty much have a normal relationship with food now; I wouldn’t classify as an ED sufferer at all. I thought I was totally recovered and I don’t know how to process what I’ve just done. 

Basically what happened is that I ordered a takeaway this morning, which was a silly decision in itself because I always regret that, but I was hungry. Anyway, I have a legitimate gluten intolerance - consuming it causes me serious stomach problems including severe bloating and painful cramps. I thought everything I’d ordered was gluten-free but as I was eating it I began to feel queasy. After I’d finished eating, I realised how bloated I was. I freaked out a bit and, thinking I couldn’t hack the idea of spending the next few days bed-bound from stomach pain, this voice in my head told me to just throw it all up. 

So I got a toothbrush, headed to the bathroom and purged. I regret it so much and I feel so guilty and ashamed. With that one stupid choice, I feel like I’ve regressed in my recovery by months/years. Not to mention I’m now lightheaded and feel even more nauseous. 

I’ve been extremely stressed lately. A family member of mine had brain surgery yesterday and some other serious stuff is going on. Does this have something to do with why I did this? I’m terrified I might relapse. I don’t want to go back to that delusional ED mindset I had for 5 years.

Some reassurance would be amazing. ",11May2018,6,
26,"Probably going to edit this in the morning but I just need to get some of this off my chest and see if anyone has had a similar experience. 

I moved far away in August after living my whole life in my home state. It was a very good change considering where I was coming from (a bad place) and I've absolutely loved my new life. I have a better job, volunteer, am an artist, and have a small but solid circle of friends. As a previously depressive-despondent person I haven't had an ounce of relapse. 

Recently, as in w/in the past week, it's come back, and is seriously fucking w my head. My grandfather died a hateful recluse in the same house as my loving grandmother. As in, he locked himself in his room and didn't attend to his own family's functions happing right under his roof. I never really met him (for aforementioned reasons) but I can imagine he felt as I feel now. That is to say I think this is a hereditary mental illness, and I'm terrified.

You might wonder why I'm calling it ""despondent this/that,"" and that's because when I've had episodes before, yes they were brief, but STRONG. I'd be (mostly) in a social setting w friends/family, and I'd just shut down. Say cringey grandfather-like recluse shit and close everyone out. It would feel like a prison-where you have this one side of you imprisoning the other, happy side. All I can do is look out and wish I could be nice.

So this whole ""split mood"" thing is back, and is seriously threatening not only the quality of my life but I fear my life itself. In my job I need to be social and outgoing, and as soon as It starts,  I know my day is over, happiness-wise. I'm sitting here on my day off vaguely hating everything about everyone and myself and actually wishing to never be happy or nice again, not even to myself. 

It's so confusing. I love people and life to fullest everyday, but when I'm in a mood all I can think about is being mean, driving people away, and hurting them. Not physically, but with words. This side of me has an explicit MO: lure people into a false sense of friendship, and then destroy or f**k w that trust. Essentially this side of me wants to be mean to people and to be completely alone; but I don't want that, of course.

I've already lost friends and distant family bc of this before, and I don't want to lose anymore, especially now that ""my people"" is such a small number. But even tonight I've canceled plans with friends and actually have visualized telling my family to f themselves. I'm looking at something not myself from the inside and I'm helpless to my whims when I'm like this, which has been, in the past week, about 40% of the time. It feels like I'm possessed by hate.

I can't live like this, or let it get any worse. If anyone has read this far I thank you for that alone, but if this sounds familiar to any of you please help me.",11May2018,2,

""Hey everybody \&lt;3

I just wanted to quickly thank everybody for being so supportive, especially in the last little while.

Some interesting things have come up after admitting what has been going on.

\*TRIGGER WARNING\*

In case you are out of the loop, I admitted that I was feeling suicidal… Way more intense than usual…

I shared about some of the main reasons as to what could be the causes of some mental health issues and the reasons for feeling so. To sum it up, I think it has been difficult to deal with these events considering they have been because of strangers, coworkers, bosses, landlords, friends, and worst of all, family. I have dealt with, directly and/or indirectly: mental health issues, suicide, drug abuse, addiction, rape, corrupt governments, car accidents, racism, sexism, ageism, residential school, the Vietnam War, neglect, sleep issues, anxiety, depression, PTSD, personality disorder, cancer, death, diabetes, abandonment, physical abuse, psychological abuse, emotional abuse, LGBTQ, feminism, poly, and the list goes on. The worst of all was feeling as though I was alone or abandoned when I needed people the most. 

The more I have opened up, it has been comforting to feel as though this “craziness” is very reasonable and that I am not alone. Very often, I look at others and wonder why I feel so far behind. Even as a child, I couldn’t understand why kids were loud, immature, and so different from me. 

I went to the island to see family and friends. Thanks so much to those who I got to see. As for others, there will be next time someday. I am not going anywhere soon \&lt;3 

Some interesting questions have come up:

\- “Why don’t you want to go back to Vietnam?” – After all these years, they never really wanted to hear why. However, because of their past, being logical seems to be a defense mechanism to protect themselves growing up in similar situations, households, and histories.

\- “Why do you want to forgive these people?” I want to be able to live in the moment. I want to be able to be civil and polite. Especially if and when Brad and I decide to have children, I would very much so love to be able to show my children the beauties of the cultures, languages, food, and so on that I wish I grew up with – especially being a half Vietnamese, half Native Canadian poly LGBTQ woman who was raised with as most simply put: Canadian \(/western\).  

\- “There is no such this as intergenerational ripple effects of colonization and war.” The fact that I have come across \*free\* counselling for LIFE shows how real the ripple effects of residential school has been on our country. \(Please feel free to ask me any questions if you or your relatives have been affected by residential school. I would be more than happy to help. You may also find information online.\) Some direct evidence and proof is how native communities can still be stereotyped as alcoholic junkies, the racism between natives and other races, Canadians not even knowing about residential school and our own country’s history, other countries only knowing about American history, Canadian schools still teach about all kinds of history but not our own, people “don’t know don’t care,” our people don’t speak our language, our people don’t know our own culture/customs/traditions, and the list goes on.

\- “I had no idea you’ve been going through this.” – This is coming from a best friend who I’ve known since 1996! This shows how so many other families can be hiding their shame, how children could be stuck in broken homes not knowing any better and learning from negative influences \(and in turn end up in abusive relationships, become the abuser, turn to drugs/gambling/alcohol, etc.\), how spouses could be in abusive relationships and feel stuck, and so on. 

I am relieved to come across younger generations who are excellent at communicating issues, respecting one another, being honest about needs while taking others’ needs in mind so it’s win\-win for everybody. 

Some terms have come up which might sound inconsiderate, but it really does make sense. The term “white privilege” is one of them. Something that is totally normal for certain friends and family with cultural difference could giggle about getting spanked, beaten, raped, dealing with suicide, and so on, but lots of “white” people cringe and do not understand and simply cannot relate. I feel like I can relate to competing against people who have been raised with “white privilege” unfortunately. 

People have told me that there is no such thing as mental health issues. I tried explaining triggers.""",11May2018,3,

## Maybe this isn’t appropriate for this subreddit but here goes:

Three months ago, I was assaulted in an unprovoked attack, protecting my now ex\-girlfriend, with a knife and I was punched up pretty bad which resulted in a fractured jaw.

Since then I’ve felt quite withdrawn from most aspects of my life, I often feel incredibly anxious and put myself down a lot. I have waves of depressive episodes and since the assault have had some pretty dark thoughts.

I had a bit of turning point this month, so I went to my doctor to refer my to therapy, the waiting list however is quite long.

So I'm asking for advice really to deal with trauma as a whole, I've been withdrawing from my studies and social interactions, I feel quite unsafe wherever I go and am constantly on edge. I often find myself self\-regulating my own behaviour. I also find it quite difficult to concentrate.

What’s the best steps to rebuild my confidence , reduce anxiety and trauma etc, become more engaged in social settings?

Sorry if this is rambling and all other the place, its difficult to place my thoughts.

35,"I finally made up my mind, and am going to spend my savings on therapy instead of travel. I went for the first session a few days ago, and everything was fine. She was kind, she remembered my name \(I've had previous experiences with therapists not doing this!\), she understood what I was saying \- and asked the right kind of questions, I feel. She explained what my major issue was, what she wanted to work on/ how long it would take... basically, a very great therapist. \(based on my research\) 

Except... I showed up in my usual get up. I'm a 24 year old woman, and I'm overweight and I **hate** how I look. As a way to hide myself from the world, I dress like a 10 year old boy. Always, always, always jeans and baggy shirts and coats and sweatshirts and sweatpants and sneakers; and all my clothes are Black, Navy Blue or Grey if I really wanna go light. I don't own a pair of heels, and I've never in my life worn a skirt. Ever. I don't brush my hair, I never wear make\-up and ... none of this is because I don't want to, or that I feel good in my skin the way I am! No, it's the exact opposite. I do these \(or don't\) because I think there's no amount of make\-up or heel or pretty clothing that can save my obese acne\-filled ugly self! So why even bother, right? 

My therapist asked me *not to wear sneakers* to the next session. She also told me to to wear at least one item with a girly color like pink. I don't own anything pink, and I don't own anything other than Nike Running sheos or Vans. I carry backpacks everywhere, and I have shirts with Millenium Falcon on them. lol ... I'm so used to dressing the way I do that I sort of resist any other way. I just don't feel comfortable, and I don't wanna do it... but then, I don't wanna be difficult. I also hate being told what to do! I told her that I didn't have any other shoes to wear, and she told me to buy one for myself. I laughed, and said ""why? I would never wear them!"" and then something else, and then she said something about meeting my future husband, and I just had to say: ""I'm actually never getting married"" and she's like, ""we'll fix that too."" lol

When I'm suicidal, I have so much trouble trying to do anything let alone study.  It just feels that on a subconscious level, I just can't motivate or discipline myself to do anything because there's just no reason to; my priorities are just completely skewed and I can't do anything with any sort of delayed gratification since I just want to die asap anyway.

I try to read a page, and my memory just can't retain any information, I can't process any concepts and I can't seem to just consciously think about any one topic for more than a couple of seconds at a time.

I just really want to ask if anyone has any advice.  I know if I start small and develop good habits, my symptoms will improve and I'll be able to study more.  But the thing is that I know that even if my studies were on par with my expectations \(or even above\), I'll still be just as suicidal.  I'll still hate myself and everything else will still be the same, which is so overwhelmingly more significant than my grades that I can't even get my brain to put in the effort for such seemingly irrelevant return.

I know if I just get on top of my studies then it's one less thing I need to worry about, and therefore easier to tackle the next problem.  I just need some help gritting through the incessant pain of waking up every day so that I can at least get some shit done.  I can't seem to do anything unless it directly gives me pleasure or money at this point.  My psychologist said it's best to do a little bit at a time and reward yourself with something you enjoy after, but I never seem to be able to come up with something that would actually make me feel good.",11May2018,4,
39,"Hey All, I hope this is an appropriate place to ask this question. I'm not asking for myself, but for my roommate/best friend.

So, my roommate is currently experiencing what I would say is his second psychotic break in the last month. Here are some of the symptoms he's been experiencing:
-""The Family"" is all around, watching him to make sure he ""doesn't mess anything up"". He can't say who is part of ""The Family"", or how he knows the are.
-He's been arriving to, and leaving, his work whenever he sees fit, and accusing his managers of not understanding why he's doing it.
-Waking up at 3/4AM and walking around town for 12-14 hours without his phone
-Not being able to describe what he did, or who he talked to/saw, in coherent terms
-Flight of thought between topics, and his descriptions of things do not seem to be in touch with the reality of the situation

There's other stuff too, but these are the ones that stick out most to me. I work in the mental health field, but Schizophrenia is not my area of knowledge, so I'm not 100% sure of my own take on the situation. Basically, I'm really scared to see these dramatic changes in my best friend, and I do not always feel safe in our apartment anymore. He does return to rational thought/speech patterns, but becomes very emotional and unpredictable when at all escalated. 

Has anyone else experienced watching a friend develop Schizophrenia? What was it like for you? Do you have any advice for how I should handle this moving forward? I don't want to lose my best friend.",11May2018,3,

Everyone is still reeling from what's happened, I almost don't believe still despite physically seeing him pass, and I have a number of mental health issues as it is, but this has just sent me off on another downward spiral of self doubt and fear that I'm losing my grip on reality.
I keep thinking I'm seeing him when walking to the cornershop, and keep getting excited thinking he's going to turn around and say it was all a joke, even when the person looks nothing like him. I know how that sounds, it's tearing me up inside too. I'm going to end up caring for his son a lot of the time, something I have no problem with, but it will mean I will have to do my law course part time and drag out all of the costs which I don't think I can afford. I'm living hand to mouth at the best of times, and that's affecting my mental health too, the desperation is drowning me almost.
I will find a way to cope with that somehow, but my main concern is that my negativity and my depression is going to rub off on his son and I don't want to be that kind of influence, but I don't know how else to cope with the loss as he was so close to me during dark times in my life. His fiance was surprisingly calm but the shock has finally hit her, and yesterday she was taken into hospital as she's having constant panic attacks (something I suffer with too so I can appreciate how she feels), and I just do not know what to do next. I have a therapist I see when I can afford it, but currently can't go see, so I thought I would ask the lovely people of reddit for some feedback.

I'm a socially incapable person, and the only one I ever talk to is her.
Just being with her makes me happy, however; she likes to ""show me"" to her friends and wants me to hang with them.

Being around people / more than one person at a time just makes me really sad due to me not having anything of worth to contribute with in conversations and what not. I don't like when people listen to me and I feel like if iv said something to someone I don't need to ever say that to anyone else, even if they have no idea what I said.

Being in groups of people I'm just sitting there listening to them talk and if they ask me something I try to give them the fastest most accurate response I can or a lie sometimes if that get the attention away from me.

I do however like listening to people talk, I just wish I didn't need to... Be there(?). I want to be there, I just don't want anyone else to know so that I never get any questions or attention aimed towards me.

I'm not sure if what I wrote is even understandable. Im just a little sad right now since my girl and her 2 friends are sitting outside talking and all I want to do is stop existing until they go home. Cos then I won't need to worry about any questions.

51,"A few nights ago, after an argument, he confessed to me that he had lied about quite a few things in his past. I had found out before that he had lied about a few things (he claimed to have a degree when he doesn’t, he claimed he was in the military but he wasn’t), but I didn’t realise how severe it was, he also claimed to have been the victim of stabbing and shootings, claimed he worked at jobs and visited places he didn’t visit, it’s just a long list of things. He claims he can’t stop embellishing stuff and making up stories. I do believe him that he can’t stop, sometimes we will be watching a movie or something, and he starts going on these elaborate stories about his (nonexistent) time in the military, and when I call him out on it, he says he knows it’s not true, but he doesn’t know how to stop bringing up these fake stories. He’s never cheated or been deceptive to cover anything up. 

We both believe it’s a mental disorder, and we are trying to figure out the best place to start to get treatment. He’s been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, neither of which are being treated (I do know for a fact that these diagnoses are true). He also had a suicide attempt years ago, as a side effect of the anxiety medication he was on. After that happened he stopped working to treat his anxiety. 

I pressured him to see a doctor last year about it after he started becoming extremely angry over minor noises outside, and started hearing noises that weren’t there. His doctor gave him a pamphlet about a support group and that was it. He never went to the support group, and I felt she was kind of blowing him off. 

I’m not a doctor and I’m not trying to diagnose him, but his symptoms seem somewhat similar to personality disorders, like Borderline Personality Disorder (if I’m wrong please correct me). I’m under 26 and covered by my parent’s insurance, he doesn’t have insurance, he also doesn’t go to the doctors for yearly exams or anything. Are there low-cost mental health clinics that we could go to? 

My main question is, how do you even go about getting a diagnosis for mental health? And does this seem like a mental health issue? I genuinely believe he wants to get help for it but doesn’t know how to on his own. ",11May2018,3,

So knowing I wouldn’t be able to make it into work the next day (being a mess), I messaged my boss about the situation and he seemed to understand. 
Today - the day I’m missing.. he messages me and says my absences are getting to be a problem. I missed one day at the beginning of December due to food poisoning. And 2 days a few weeks ago due to the flu. Now I’m missing another, bringing that to a total of 4 shifts altogether. I wouldn’t miss work unless I knew I couldn’t come in so what was I supposed to do? 
Anyway, he ends up demoting me from $15 an hour to $12. I’m shocked. I JUST moved out at the beginning of may and now I’m scared I’m going to be super tight or not have enough cash to afford living here. 
My anxiety and depression are through the roof right now. And to make matters worse, I just switched anxiety meds a few days ago and I’m on such a low dose right now that I feel like I can’t cope with all of this right now.

Sometimes I wonder if I have a purpose.
Sometimes I wonder if the world would be better off without me.

In the past I've had low moments to the point of trying to end it all.
I've been taking olanzapine and a few different anti-depressants since August.
In the past few months I've been having weird things happening to me. A general list of things that have been happening are; my mind and body feel disconnected, I feel that my sense are overwhelming to me and it mentally hurts because of this, I forget things in the short term extremely easily but I remember things so vividly that happened in the past (Examples are like smells cause me to remember something from years ago, I remember specific songs I used to listen to, and a lot of crazy Deja-vu like situations), I keep seeing patterns in things, patterns that I'd never notice before so for example in my trousers I just see reoccurring patterns that seem so detailed that it doesn't seem realistic at all.

I keep hearing things. I'll hear people saying my name when they actually aren't and it's really confusing. Today I was walking past a Zebra Crossing lady and I swear to god I heard it crystal clear ""there's a police man here to see you"". It sounds stupid but I don't know what else she would have said. It got me really anxious and made me contemplate everything that's been happening and whether it's something to worry about.

Also, within the last week I've been having exams and at random intervals within the period an examination is taking place I just freeze, I won't remember anything that's happening and how I froze and only come back to reality if a teacher comes up and actually talks to me. It doesn't feel like daydreaming or falling asleep. One time when I 'woke' from whatever the freezing thing may be, this loud noise just played in my head. It's really hard to explain but it was like a really sustained bass drum. It was loud and I knew it was in my head.

63,"Hello.This is my very first reddit post, and I have to admit, i'm nervous. I very much apologize for any grammar mistakes and such.

(I'd like to mention some physical attributes about myself, I think they'll help a little with understanding my situation. I am a 17 year old, 5'5 lightweight girl, with little to no physical strentgh and musclemass. The cousin (also 17) in the story is taller slightly and heavier than me, and undoubtedly stronger than me) 

Let's cut to the chase. On the 19th of last month, my cousin approached me with very questionable motives. This happened at our grandmother's place, as we like to meet and hang out there from time to time. That day, he had been unusually ""touchey-feely"" with me, and otherwise made some very explicit jokes and comments about me earlier that day. Now,our humor IS a bit raunchy and sexual at times, but this time it felt more...personal, and directed right at me, so I was visibly uneasy and he noticed this as we were chatting. It all escalated that same evening, when he texted me from the other room.


""Can I ask you something really really fucked up, and will you freak out about it?""
""Cause i'm not going to ask, if you don't want to even hear me out""
""I can ask irl too, But I would rather ask outside""
This really tipped me over, and really, just, twisted my gut. We (at this point) Were VERY close friends, having met eachother often as children and such, he was like a brother to me)



I didn't want to hear anything from him anymore, the texts having been the final straw. So, trusting my gut, I ran off into the nearby forest. It was pouring and cold outside, So I took shelter in an abandoned shack on a hill, where I sat, fumbling with my phone as I seeked quick advice from an internet friend (Bless you, Zach) 

This all ended with me convincing my grandpa to take me home, it was already late (10 pm to be exact) so he was understandably hesitant. Only bad thing was that he decided to take the forementioned cousin home on the same trip, and I had to huddle in the backseat in my soaked hoodie and sit there quietly until he was gone. My last interaction with him so far, was when he at the end of the trip opened the back seat and leaned in, asking me whether i'm alright or not. 



I've been keeping away from him after the incident, and so far it has worked alright.


Mothersday is coming up where I live, and my new problem is that we traditionally gather all at grandmas for almost every holiday. Meaning I WILL have to meet with him possibly this Sunday (two days from now) I am not quite sure what to do. I'm hoping I can pull off faking sick so I wont have to meet him again but I would like to have a backup plan incase I'll be forced to attend.
