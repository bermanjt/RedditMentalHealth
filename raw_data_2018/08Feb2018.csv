2,"Just as I think I‚Äôm going to have a good semester, my depression is creeping back in. I‚Äôm exhausted all day and given the choice I would spend days in bed avoiding the world and consciousness. I have never found a good remedy for fighting off the urge to nap or go to bed for the night at 5pm. Caffeine sometimes keeps me up and the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù it gives me can change my mood given enough of it. I have also been struggling to eat enough food everyday, I‚Äôm not having body image issues, it‚Äôs more like I forget to eat or the stress of deciding what to eat or having to make or even get it out of the freezer just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. As I was writing that last sentence it hit me that not wanting to/ being able to get myself food is 100% my depression üëé. 

Anyways I‚Äôve missed the first 5 days of one class and the first test is after the next 6 class days so that anxiety is making me sick. The longer I put it off the worse it will be, and I really want to graduate from university in May but we‚Äôll see. Thanks for reading üòï",08Feb2018,1

I‚Äôll never be able to pass an interview. I have undiagnosed expressive language disorder and because of it, I am most definitely unable to convince anyone to hire me.

I don‚Äôt have any work experience, I can‚Äôt socialize at all, I can hardly communicate with anyone. It‚Äôs even hard to talk to my siblings who I‚Äôm close with.

I can‚Äôt talk about anything, or even explain anything about myself. I can‚Äôt even lie or tell stories, true or fake, because I have no imagination. I wish my parents noticed something wrong with me when I was younger so I could get help but they thought too little of it, they just thought it was my personality. Thought I was just quiet.

But now I can‚Äôt do anything. For the past 5 years since I got my ged, I haven‚Äôt done anything. I just sit on the floor all day and stare at this screen, feeling guilty to my parents and feeling bad for myself for turning out this way.

I wish I could have a job but I won‚Äôt answer any questions in the interview, I know it. I looked at sample questions online and I can‚Äôt think of any good answers to anything and can‚Äôt think of anything at all for the ones where you have to explain certain situations.

6,"My best friend has been going through a lot the last year. She has several medical issues, two were diagnosed 10-15 years ago. Hyper-mobility was diagnosed recently. About that time she started having random symptoms but no known cause. Spring 2017 she started being treated for Lupus after 10 years of random symptoms.

Her marriage of 8 years is pretty much dead. She and her husband have been discussing divorce for a while. I thought they'd be able to amicably and they had hoped to work things out without an attorney but there was a disagreement about custody of their soon to be 5 year old. That was early June 2017. Her husband is sleeping with somebody else and questioning the closeness of our relationship. (We know each other and he knows that I‚Äôve known her for years longer than he has)

She moved into the guest room in their house the first week of July after clearing years of junk and then a few weeks later, she lost her job.(She got a job offer in October but it requires a security clearance which can take months.)

 September we had a hurricane and the stress of preparing for the storm, husband being a jerk and making the decision to stay or move further west in the face of an erratic storm pushed her into a flare. She went to her Parents and the storm turned West and followed her. The weather was better here. She was sick from September until recently at one point in October sitting in chair too almost too much energy. In November doctors ruled out all autoimmune conditions but Lupus. (I've been going to a lot of appointments with her) 

A month ago she was told she needs surgery to repair a labral tear in her hip. The surgery will repair the tear but most likely wont prevent needing a hip replacement, just delay it.  She‚Äôs been freaked out for the last 6 weeks. She needed to stop her medications about a week in advance and the surgical center told her to stop like 80% of her medications 6 days prior to the surgery. She‚Äôs changed her mind several times and her current decision is to ‚ÄúFuck it I‚Äôm not rescheduling, I‚Äôm just not having the surgery‚Äù

I‚Äôve told her I think she should delay until she gets the answers she needs and have the surgery, but I cant make the decision or force her to do anything.

I'm worried about her mentally being able to handle all of this.  If I suggest she see a counselor I think she‚Äôs going to say no as it‚Äôs just one more doctor to schedule and deal with and she already has a team of various people. Primary care, Rhumatologist, orthopedic surgeon for hip, orthopedic for shoulder and podiatrist for feet. 

Is there anything else I can do to help her?",08Feb2018,1
7,"Reddit, my life sucks and I'm starting to make some pretty bad plans again. 

I spent last year in and out of hospitals with no success in getting a grip on this thing. Every doctor I've been to has given a different diagnosis. Depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, and others have all come up.

A few months ago, I was put on Paxil and Abilify and finally started to feel okay. Not good, not great, but okay. It was a huge upgrade over where I'd been for the last few years.

Welp... my wife lost her job. I can't find one. We don't have any insurance and the state hasn't responded to our application (which has been in for 3 weeks now). I have about 5 days of meds left, so I feel like I'm back against the wall.

9,"Two weeks ago I had my first appointment with a new psychiatrist since getting out of the hospital the first week of January. He told me to stop taking what the hospital gave me and to start taking what he prescribed. Ok, sure. He tells me these meds will need to be preauthorized for insurance or whatever and that he will take care of it. 


I still don't have my meds.


I started calling a week after the appointment. Every time I call they say they will take care of it and yet the preauthorization still hasn't been sent in. Pharmacy says the doctor just hasn't sent the paperwork. 


Why? I'm so frustrated. My therapist is a bit ticked too and has offered to call him on my behalf so that'll probably happen tomorrow.


But I've been unmedicated this whole time, waiting, and getting worse. My therapist is suggesting I seek outpatient treatment at the hospital.


This psychiatrist is 45mins away because they couldn't find anyone taking new patients for me when I was in the hospital.

I honestly think I can make a woman happy if one would just give me a chance, but it feels like I'll never get that chance. Truthfully I have sexual desires, watching porn isn't enough for me, I want to experience the real thing like 99% of people my age have. It feels like no matter what I do I'll just never make it with anyone, and honestly if that's the case, I'd rather be dead.

27,"This question first came to my mind after my friend accused me of being a sociopath, which I found quite ridiculous. After reading an article he sent me, I became unsure of the accusation's ridiculousness.
I'm 14 years old at the time of this post (turning 15 in 3 months) and am a male. Things about me that triggered my friend's accusation are things like lack of empathy for fictional characters, my introverted personality, me being quite intelligent (although I am skeptical of how smart I am compared to others) and my tendency to lie. 
The biggest thing for him is my lack of empathy or attachment to fictional characters. I find it quite normal to be like this, as I realize they're not real. I do admittedly lie a lot. I lie often as I usually keep information about myself hidden because I don't like sharing things about myself most of the time. I have depression and I would hate it for my friends to find out about this. I don't want them to feel unnecessary pity towards me or treat me differently because of it. 
Am I a sociopath? If you have any questions that might help answer this, then go ahead and ask.

I'm happy I have my boyfriend. I'm sad that he had to listen to what I had to say yesterday about ending my life, it's not a healthy relationship conversation and trust me I can't get through to the therapist and there is no one I can talk to. No one. I'll just reiterate, no one. 

The lack of support from the university tipped me over the edge. I've tried to get help with my mental health, my work, and extra curricular but not in one instance have I been listened to. I'm not sure why but I'm sure they're busy and I'm not important enough. I'm so appalled by the system, by the law, by the world... 

My desire to not exist is grows stronger every time I break down which is happening more frequently. I can't leave my family wondering why, when all their daughter did was work hard to get to uni. Can't have my sister wondering what happened to her older sister, I can't have my brothers believing they can't chase their dreams because the world is too cruel. I'd only ever be so sorry to my boyfriend. I feel like I don't deserve him now, for putting him through the pressure of having to listen to his partner say she wants to kill herself despite her promising to always stay by your side.

39,"Hello,
As the title states my roommate has gone off the deep end. He is my cousin and is 19. Our family suffers from many different forms of mental illness. But I‚Äôve never seen anything like this...

My cousin believes that he knows something and he rest of us don‚Äôt. He‚Äôs been getting progressively worse over the last three months. He goes on about how time means nothing and he controls the universe. Fast forward to today, I wake up really early to find my cousin twirling a broom in our living room. He tells me that he is making the broom go with his mind. He throws the broom around (about breaking my new tv) and tells me that it‚Äôs alright if he breaks it because we are in a dream. As I‚Äôm trying to get a grasp on the situation he tells me that he will be the a god very soon and that he can show me ‚Äúreal‚Äù magic once he cracks the code. Throughout the next few hours he barged in my room telling me I‚Äôm living in a dream. On his last visit to my room I noticed he had taken a sharpie marker to his body and had drawn weird symbols all over his hands arms and chest. At this point I‚Äôm a little on edge and lock myself in my room from 8pm-11:00pm. During this time I keep hearing loud thumping noises. So I get up and go check on him. I open the door and he‚Äôs sitting on his bed with his hands covered in blood. He tells me to look what he‚Äôs done. He had broken his mirror and punched a hole in the wall. Then he took his blood and made circles around the hole. At the same time he‚Äôs sitting on a stack of tarot cards and he‚Äôs holding the one that says ‚ÄúDeath‚Äù. I asked him why he had done this and if I need to take him to the hospital. He told me do not worry it‚Äôs all a dream, none of this is real. He told me he‚Äôs done the math and our universe isn‚Äôt real. Then he tells me to come watch him play on his keyboard. He says he is a musical genius and proceeds to play the keyboard while getting blood all over it. But all he was doing was smashing the keys down in a random way. It sounded like awful. He sat there for about 15min ‚Äúplaying‚Äù it. I took that time to go into his room and bathroom. The whole area is demolished. He tore down all his curtains poured all his shampoo bottles on the floor. He ripped the counter apart, spilled coke all over his room. I can keep going but I‚Äôll stop here. 

It‚Äôs now 12am and I‚Äôm leaving the apartment. He just had got done yelling at me while saying he had a dream where he shot himself last night. He also told me not to tell anyone what I have seen. I‚Äôve become scared to stay there and I leave. On my way out I see him running arcoss our parking lot. He‚Äôs going to another residents door and knocking on it at 12:30am. He didn‚Äôt notice me, so I decided to watch from my car just in case I need to call 911.  

He told me before I left that he‚Äôll have it all cleaned up tomorrow...

TL;DR Cousin thinks we are in a dream, proceeds to cut his hands and draw on the walls with blood. Tells me he can be a god, and knows magic. He was holding the ‚ÄúDeath‚Äù tarot card. 

I‚Äôm scared living in my apartment and don‚Äôt know how to handle this.",08Feb2018,3

43,"I am growing up to be an adult.I am turning 18 this year.But I feel wrong.Something is simply wrong inside of me.
There are times where I am super active.I get super hyped for many things and I feel confident(I have never felt so sure of myself before but these started happening)I talk with my friends actively,I am not shy to strangers.I become socially active and I was motivated to try and improve my life.
But after a week or so,I would feel deprived of energy.I don‚Äôt want to get up.I don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone.I want to be isolated but at the same time,I want to talk to someone,just not anyone real.These were the times my vision seems to turn dark,colorless.I would also have this tiny constant pain in my heart and it seems to be especially painful when I was feeling worse.I would also loose motivation and this is affecting my life.I managed to improve my maths after hours of exercise but I couldn‚Äôt even get myself to do for thirty minutes.I also get angered and irritated easily.
This has been going over a year but before that I had similar problems too.I didn‚Äôt get as irritated or angered but neither did I get an active period.I just felt blue for 4 years.
Funny thing was,I had suicidal thoughts when I was around 7,I remembered it was because of my parents divorced and my father was never soft on me.Every night,he would stick with me to study Chinese(I am Asian,born speaking English)I couldn‚Äôt pay attention then to the studies because I was more interested in reading a story book or running around (I was really weird even among my peers but I wouldn‚Äôt get deep into that)Everytime I made a mistake,he would spank me for to know what I did wrong.Problem was,he never explained what I did wrong and the strength and where he hits was based on his mood.I blamed myself for my parents divorce until I understood I was a fu*king stupid kid and my father being an asshole.He rarely treats people nice and it was only because of his mood.He had his own issues and due to respect,I won‚Äôt talk more about him.But he was my primary nightmare growing up.I never had nightmares that are related to monsters or anything,but my very own father who similar to my mother always says they love me and my sis but never acted that way.Anyway,he made me felt like I was the source of his problems and I felt it was better off if I was gone.
Everytime I saw a kid running to his mother,I felt my tear ducts ready to flood.
Growing up,I didn‚Äôt have many friends until I reached senior year high school.I was pretty lonely during my primary years and my junior years of high school because of my weak Chinese and my lack of communication skills/experience.I blame it on my father who didn‚Äôt let me hang out unless I had good grades(Which were Asian standard and I knew I could not reach them)I stayed at my dads clinic everyday I came back from school and this is where he teaches me Chinese.So I was pretty isolated from my peers(only a few classmates would talk to me because of my difference.I was separated from the class because I caused ‚Äòtrouble‚Äô)
This was all before I was 13-14, and I really wish to forget everything about those times.
When I was in secondary,I was kinda teased for my bad chinese.I was mocked and was the target for pranks.No one stood up for me.I tried telling the teacher,but they shook it off since I had no evidence and it was really minor.But this kinda hit me hard because it showed me that people are capable of unreasonable things and it wasn‚Äôt only my father.From then on,I tried making friends.I did make friends but I was never me when I was with them.I didn‚Äôt want to be alone because I was afraid of getting picked on.
I was getting through a phase of existential crisis and I questioned everything where I tried to solve the questions with the origins of the source.Unfortunately,no one was going through the same phase so I didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to.Again,I was isolated.
One night,I was wandering around. I managed to get my father to let me and sis go out for a specific time for ‚Äòswimming‚Äô.I was having an existential crisis again.This is when I suddenly felt completely isolated from people.I was suddenly disconnected from the people who walked past me,people who were with me when I grew up.I felt I was completely alone.I didn‚Äôt belong anywhere.I never shook off this feeling.
Since then ,my suicidal thoughts grew worse and sometimes I just make plans to kill myself.But I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it.There was a long path of life to walk and I am not going to end it when I haven‚Äôt even walked half of it.
I figured why don‚Äôt I make others pay.Why should I kill myself when I could kill those who made me who I am.Of course,I fought back these thoughts but time and time again.I have these urges to just stab people and I have to make an effort to stop myself.I have been making plans to kill people,make them die a slow and painful death in which they will pray for a savior,only to be disappointed and lose all hope.
I figured the urges to kill people and the plans I make are signs I should do something but during the active periods,I felt as if I was in control and I no longer had these urges,I didn‚Äôt need help.During the depressed periods,I see no point in doing so.Why bother?I am going to fail anyway.So I never did anything.

I have been trying to write this out for a while.I needed someone to talk about these things.I feel confused.I did some googling and they say I may have bipolar disorder.But you could only put so much trust on the internet to tell what you are.I couldn‚Äôt see a therapist because well...I am a high school student with no financial income.I could not share it with anyone because I know full well these are not the things to be shared with and not go to an asylum.I hesitated to post this but I need to express it somewhere .

Sorry for the long post,if you make it this far,thank you!I really need to get this off my chest.

46,"So, I'm a little uneasy about some of my thoughts recently. For the past few months, I've had these constant thoughts about me being morbidly obese and needing to stop eating completely. I can't stop thinking about it, and I can't stop thinking that I'm disgustingly overweight.

I'm 5'5"" and 150-ish lbs guy. My family is pretty largely built, so I have a lot of muscle and bone that makes me look 130lbs when I'm actually 150.

Still, I can't help but think I'm disgustingly fat. I can't help but want to stop eating - the only reason I haven't is because I love food and also because I *hate* the feeling of being hungry.

I've noticed that some days I just won't eat. I'll forget to eat breakfast and then I'll go the whole day basically without eating, and then at the end of the day I'll eat dinner and won't be able to stop eating, and I *hate* knowing that I could overeat easily, and I *hate* knowing that when I don't eat breakfast my metabolism isn't running right and I actually *gain weight* from not eating breakfast.

Is this the beginning of an eating disorder? What can I do about this if it is?",08Feb2018,1
47,"Hi, 
This is my first post here. I live in Canada. 

My significant other is naturally a pessimistic person on their own admission. 

I‚Äôve noticed lately that more and more they are increasingly negative (more-so than usual) when we have conversations. I know they don‚Äôt like their current work team, and is actively taking the steps to change job or team, which I‚Äôm really happy about. But in the mean time, all they do when we talk to each other is vent about the bad things that happened at work, or that they had overall shitty day because one or a few small thing bad happened and thus sets their tone for the day. 

Sorry if I‚Äôm rambling. But as much as I care for them I‚Äôm getting very tired of hearing about their bad day, every day, and its starting to make me dread conversations with them. It seems that even small bad things that happen throughout the day make them in a very sour mood all the time. 

FYI my SO knows they think they are suffering from depression and low self esteem, so I think this is very much related, but is hesitant to seek help because of fear of judgement. Which I try to reassure that either no one needs to know they are seeking help or they no one will judge them (as far as the people I know). 

Is there a way I can either:
A. Help them see things in a more positive light/focus on the good?
B. Convince them to seek the help they need?
C. Tell them kindly that our negative conversations are starting to get me down and cut me some slack?

Sorry if this is too long. I am not suffering from any mental health illnesses at the moment other than anxiety attacks on rare occasions, and don‚Äôt have much experience with people suffering around me, so pardon me if I said anything that comes across as insensitive in this post. ",08Feb2018,2
48,"Hi, I'm new to Reddit so I'm not sure where to ask this. I'm a 19 year old female. I have BPD, DDNOS, GAD, and Depression diagnosed. Last year I began becoming very ill physically with unknown causes. I've been to the hospital numerous times most of the doctors say it's nothing although my family doctor says it may be Lupus and we are taking the steps needed to check that out. If it's not lupus.. I don't know where to go from here. Every day it gets harder and harder to get out of bed. I'm feeling suicidal, alone and lost. I haven't been able to finish high-school because of my dissociation and physical ailments. I have no income (working on disability but I'm afraid they will deny me) my mom gets angry when I bring up how I'm feeling and tells me I don't need to go to the hospital even when I'm having a hard time breathing. She has told me she wishes I was never born some days and that I'm a burden. I'm looking for help, any help I can get. I'm looking for inpatient programs that offer DBT or work with BPD patients. I don't have money so I'm not sure I can pay fees. I looked into the Royal Ottawa awhile ago and they denied me because they are too full. My life is a mess and I really need help.. please. Anything.

49,"So, I am hoping to collect some tales here.  I am wondering what some of your experiences are in relation to having a mental illness and dealing with society at large.  I'll give a tale in return.  One that, for me, has always been a tremendous metaphor.  It should be noted that as part of my condition, I have hallucinations.

So many years ago, my family and I moved to a different part of town.  Down the road from us was, and still is, a farm.  We still drive by this farm on a regular basis, as the road is the major way through the neighborhood.

Sitting in the back seat of my parents' car as we drove by, I mentioned, ""Oh hey, look.  There's a zebra.""

My mother never looked and said from the front, ""There's no zebra.  You're just crazy.""

This went on a for quite a while.  We'd drive by.  I'd see the zebra.  My mother would call me crazy and deny it's existence.

Finally one day as we're driving by, my mother was looking.  ""Oh my god! There's a zebra!""  

From the back seat, I said in a bitter voice, ""REALLY?!? I just thought I was crazy.""

The reality of the zebra doesn't matter if no one's willing to look.  ",08Feb2018,3
50,"Hi,

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and OCD a few years ago. I have been suffering from depression and anxiety problems since 9th Grade(in 1st year University now). I've been on anti depressants and anti anxiety pills for a long time now; my anxiety and depression started to get under control as I reached 12th grade but then I stopped taking my meds and for a while I thought that things were getting better but they were actually getting worse. Now that I'm in university I have started meds again, I am almost passing all my courses, I have really good friends. 

Sometimes I feel like everybody will leave me and I will die alone and everybody is using me in some way or another even though they might not be. I feel like everybody is against me and hates me even though they might not. My friends think that I am a really sweet and nice person, but I think the opposite; I feel like I'm an asshole and shitty person ALL THE TIME.

Sometimes my anxiety gets out of control and I just have to throw up and my heart beat goes through the roof. I feel like meds can't help me and only I can help myself. But then I think that I can't help myself without meds, and this thought process keeps running in a loop.

I feel like my face is really weird and everybody is talking about me behind my back.",08Feb2018,2

53,"Hey all.

I'm a late 30's woman, and have come to believe that I am fundamentally and intrisically broken. I come from a family with a mom (a victim of sexual assault as a child) who pretty much had Stockholm syndrome to my step-dad, who himself was the son of an alcoholic abusive father. He in turn was a very abusive alcoholic.  He never wanted me (he came into my life when I was 7) and I always felt like I was baggage that came with my mom. He often would ""discipline"" me, but in actuality he would beat me until I couldn't sit... He once threw me down a flight of stairs when I was 18 because I didn't answer the door. He told me I was worthless, fat, that I was stupid and would never amount to anything. He told me he expected me to have 5 kids and be addicted to drugs when I was older, living off the system because I was so worthless and good-for-nothing.... It also worth nothing that several of my mom's boyfriends prior to my step-dad molested me and she did nothing to stop it.

I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was 16. Went to counseling but it didn't help. Wasn't given any drugs because my doc didn't trust them.

When I was 17 I got drunk with some friends while skipping school in late November. All was going well, and we were having a lot of fun drinking in the snow outside under a bridge. I got really drunk.. Like, black-out drunk. I ended up being raped by one of my fellow students, and woke up in a snow bank with a police officer standing over me. I was naked from the waist down. I had severe hypothermia and alcohol poisoning. I was rushed to the ER where I flatlined and had to be revived. I had my stomach pumped and for all intents and purposes, I died that day. I told my parents about the rape and they told me I ""deserved it"" for putting myself in that situation.

Finally, when I was 18, I started dating a guy I went to HS with. 3 months after we started going out, I moved into his family home, and stayed for 3 years. His family took me in and ""loved"" me, supported me and our small family until we moved out.

When I was 19, I suffered a late-term miscarriage with my son and that was another thing that broke me. It has been 20 years but I still can't think about it without tearing up (or breaking down). Shortly after the miscarriage, I got pregnant again, and my lovely parents told me I had no right to have another child because THEY had just lost their grandson and that I was being incredibly selfish. This made me feel even more guilty and broken inside... I carried to term with my second son, and he was born healthy and beautiful and absolutely perfect.

My son was diagnosed with autism when he was three. My world shattered again, because my dreams of a ""perfect"" child were gone. My life would be forever plagued by uncertainty regarding him because of the unpredictabilty of autism... (He is 18 now and he is everything I ever wanted in a child.. Kind, smart, witty, sarcastic and compassionate.)

My ex and I started having serious marital problems when my son was 10 or so (he is my son's father). He started a full-time job while I worked part-time (my son had therapy everyday and school and appointments so one of us needed to be more available) and while he was working, he met and became close to several single guys who enticed him into behaving like another single guy. He would spend outrageous amounts of money on clothing (while not really paying his part of our bills), go out with his bros all the time to breakfast, lunch, and dinner. He would never answer his phone when I called... He would go to work and then be out until 1 or 2am without ever informing me... I found pics of some chick on his phone and he told me that it was his BFF's GF (why would he have pics of his friend's GF on his phone?) I felt like I was a single mom to a mentally-disabled child and was run completely ragged and exhausted all the time. I started lashing out at my son for things he couldn't control or didn't understand. I was completely unstable and all of the things my step-dad had told me when I was growing up seemed to be coming true. I was worthless and unlovable. Shortly thereafter I suffered a mental break that ended with me in the ER on a suicide watch. My ex acted like I was being dramatic and that nothing he had done could have possibly caused it. (Did I mention he's a narcissist?)

I went on anti-depressants and saw a psychiatrist and for a while things were okay. I was a lot more balanced and able to handle things more objectively. My ex started spending more time with me and our son and less with his friends... For a few years things were good.

Then my ex lost his job. He was laid off as his sector at his company was being downsized. I told him to take some time off and I was able to get full-time at my job. He had unemployment benefits coming in so that helped. We did okay.... My ex thought that ""some time off"" from a full-time job meant 6 years... He did start working part-time about 3 years ago (12 hours a week!) but even then he wouldn't pay his portion of the bills, was spending all kinds of money on stuff off Amazon and online games and crap... He would stay home all day while I worked and play games... I would come home and nothing would have been done around the house... Dishes everywhere, floors filthy, dirty clothes piled on shit... And then he would expect me to make dinner. I started having panic attacks, could sleep all day and all night, lots of migraines and weight problems, and was diagnosed with REM sleep disorder... I became so anxious that I was also diagnosed with acute hypochondria... I was out of control again and could barely function. I got so far into debt from credit cards/loans because I couldn't keep up with our payments... Spiraling. My parents also physically abused my son while he was at their place for a visit, and I subsequently cut them out of my life. (My mom likes to email me every so often and say ""THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY GRANDSON AWAY FROM ME"". I delete them without even reading them anymore.)

Finally, after YEARS of pleading for change and threatening to do it, I left him 2 years ago. At that time, I suffered another mental break that cost me my job and I was on medical unemployment for 3 months, then regular EI until I found my current job. I think part of my hesitation was that I wanted to make sure my son was old enough to understand and that his dad and I couldn't be together anymore and that it had NOTHING to do with how much I loved him. When I left, my ex begged and tried to negotiate with me to come back. I told him I would think about it ONLY if he got a job and proved to me that he could function like an actual adult instead of relying on someone to be his ""mom"". This cycle went on for the better part of a year, him begging, me waiting for him to prove that he could be the man I knew I deserved. (It should be noted that when I left my ex, I asked my son who he wanted to live with... He chose to stay with his dad and visits me on weekends sometimes.. I never forced him to come with me and I never took him away from his father against his will.) We never had a formal court thing for support but I gave him money when I could, sometimes several hundreds of dollars a month, sometimes very little (my job thing was a little crazy) but I always tried. His family stopped talking to me after always saying I was like a daughter to them for 20 years... I can't help but feel that he poisoned them against me.

Ex went back to school and got his GED through online courses and finally got a full-time job. I offered emotional support to him throughout that whole process (""hey how was your exam? How are your courses going? I'm proud of you!"" etc.) He now makes more money than I do and likes to flaunt it in my face whenever I go to pick up my son. New toys, new computer crap, more video games than he could ever play in a lifetime... I asked him once to lend me $20 to get medication and he never even replied. Finally, I asked him why he hates me so much, and he said ""YOU ran out on me. YOU never gave us a chance. YOU abandoned your child. EVERYTHING I'VE DONE IN THE PAST YEAR WAS BECAUSE OF ME AND THE SUPPORT MY FAMILY SHOWED ME, NOT YOU."" I clearly and in plain fucking English asked him if he remembered all of the fights we had about him not pulling his own weight financially or even by being a proper ""house-husband"", or the nights when I would come home from working 2 jobs and could hardly walk (I have mobility problems and was working in the food service industry at the time). I asked if he remembered all the chances I DID give him, the years of chances, which never amounted to anything. Unsurprisingly, he never replied.

I have tried to maintain a civil relationship with him for our son's sake, but he just spits venom at me or ignores me completely. I don't expect him to love me still but I expected more from the man I spent 2 decades with. But then, that's just narcissism and his gaslighting/blame-shifting. He's perfect. He never did anything to warrant my ""abuse"" of him.

Anyways, now... I seem inclined to latch onto the wrong people and am terrified of meeting anyone new because I feel like I am so goddamned broken that once someone gets to know me, they will run for the hills. I haven't had any sort of intimate relationship with anyone in 2 years. I haven't even been on a date with anyone. I fell in love with my male friend because he was kind to me and realized that I can't handle any sort of male attention in a healthy way because almost ALL of my interactions with men have screwed me up. 

I keep pushing people away. I have very, very few friends, because I'm so fucked up that people get tired of my drama and drop me. I am so lonely and feel like part of me is missing but like I said, I don't WANT to meet anyone. I don't want to rely on someone only to have them disappoint me, and I don't want to feel like I'm responsible for anyone else's happiness. I barely have enough happiness of my own. 

I am waitlisted for psychiatric help again, but it's been months and I had another mental break on Christmas (which I spent absolutely alone.)

I feel like I should be okay.. I have a full-time job that I love, have gotten debt managed and I pay reasonable child support every month (even though I don't have to legally now that my son is 18 but my ex is also taking care of our dog and cat). I got my own cat last year and it's feels like... all the pieces are there, and they should fit, but they just don't.

I feel like, at my core, my very being, I'm just broken beyond belief. I wouldn't want to deal with me if I didn't have to.

54,"I'm a 31 year old male from Austria and trouble coping with my behaviour in the last months.

SO this will take some time to set up, but here it goes:

I've been in a relationship with my current girlfriend for almost 5 years now, this is also my first relationship.
So she was probably my first everything in regards to relationships, so when she set some rules beforehand (e.g. only an open relationship) I agreed to them.

After about a year she got involved with my best friend and in my stupid ways I felt I was bound by my promise to not say anything against this. In hindsight I should have just shut it down then and there, but you know what they say about hindsight....


Anyway this relationship has taken a toll in me, I am still so in love with her and I still consider him a really important person. Therefore I can't imagine a life without the both of them.

Still my own behaviour has become more and more erratic every time she was alone with him I would freak out and do something stupid or just freak out and have a panic attack

Last weekend I touched her without her prior consent. Which is a behaviour I cannot accept in myself. I think this is one of the worst things a man can do and I am so disappointed in myself.... Furthermore I have no clue what I was thinking at the moment if I was just that horny or that she would like it.... I just can't think how I ever got the impression this was something ok and to go through with.....

I have a therapy session upcoming on Monday, but I needed a place to vent as I cannot bring myself to tell anyone close to me, so here I am thanks for listening.",08Feb2018,1

I am 14 year old boy in highschool, living in a family of 5 with my parents still together. And the problem is that for years (about 2, ever since highschool) I‚Äôve been feeling empty and unhappy. I used to be a really outgoing and happy person, excited to participate in things, excited to do my best, excited to make my parents proud, excited of what is yet to occur in my life.  But I‚Äôve lost all that drive, I just don‚Äôt see the point in, just about anything anymore. Nothing excites me, nothing makes me happy. I don‚Äôt see the reason for me to go about in this life. 

I wake up, go to school, come back and repeat. Everyday is filled with this. Just all day of me trying to figure out the point of me doing this all is, to grow up into a life where I work longer than I spend at school? Doing the same stuff everyday. To one day just die and lose everything I‚Äôve created anyways? What‚Äôs the point of this process? Why is every being caught in this endless loophole of stresses and problems. I just want this to stop, I want to sit in a room, by myself forever, not having to talk to anyone, not having to live up go anyones expectations. I just want to be with myself. Alone. 

On top of this my parents are always fighting, arguing, swearing at eachother. And it seems half that anger than later is transferred to me and my younger brother. We don‚Äôt deserve this? Right? Why are people like this? 

All in all I‚Äôm a kid, and have no where as much experience in life as an adult and I haven‚Äôt ever claimed I do, but is there really much point in all of this? No happiness, no drive to do anything, just wanting to be alone 24/7. How can someone keep living life like that? And I‚Äôm only 14, I‚Äôve got a lot left too. Idk, I just thought maybe someone with more knowledge than me could give me some insight, or recommend something. Idk, maybe its just something I‚Äôm gonna have to live through, but as of now I don‚Äôt see any point in that.   ",08Feb2018,2

58,"Hi everyone-

I was hospitalized in August for a week due to mental health issues, and that was the last time I got a prescription for my mental illness.

I have OCD and severe depression, and medication has always helped, but I got new insurance and very few places will accept it.

I waited months to get an appointment at a place that takes my insurance. I started seeing a new therapist at the end of November, and scheduled my psychiatrist appointment then as well. The appointment was supposed to be next Tuesday.

They just called me to reschedule the appointment for the following week, because Tuesday is Mardi Gras and they're concerned that the parades will be too difficult to deal with, logistically. I wish they'd considered this before scheduling my appointment.

It's completely crushing me. I've waited so long for this appointment. I know it's only an extra week, but it seems like such a huge deal right now. Things are really bad for me right now, the worst they've been since I was hospitalized. I spent all day yesterday fighting off thoughts of how badly I just want to die. I have never self harmed before, but I keep having intrusive thoughts of doing so as well. I would never actually make a plan to kill myself, but I just can't stop thinking about how nice it would be to not exist.

This appointment was the only thing keeping me going. I've been desperately hanging on to the idea. And now that it's been postponed, I feel like I can hardly breathe.

I don't know how to deal with disappointment.

I'm seeing my therapist today and I intend to tell her about all of this, but I just don't know what to do.

I guess I'm going to go sit in my bathtub and try to fight off these thoughts. ",08Feb2018,4
59,"Hey, new to this sub, wondering if anyone here can give a simple overview of how to get into therapy, that is, how to manage the logistics of it for someone who's never done it before. Questions I have:

* how do you choose a therapist?

* how often do you go?

* does workplace insurance (in the US) cover all costs? some? none?

* what should you prepare for with a first visit?

* what are some other things that someone with no experience at all of therapy might want to know before going into it?

My story: I'm in my early 30s and a fairly recent father of one, married to a wonderful supportive partner, steady job, living in a large city in the US. On the whole I tend to think of myself as more mentally stable than average, I don't suffer from any crippling phobias or other mental conditions that stop me from living my life the way that I want to. And most people looking at my situation from the outside would probably agree that I have my stuff together, loving family, advancing in my field, financially stable, etc.

However, addiction and depression do run in my family on both sides, not overwhelmingly prevalent but I definitely have relatives who have suffered. And I think my father is probably an undiagnosed depressive. My primary motivation to start therapy was my realization after I became a father that it was something I wished my Dad would have done for me--see a therapist regularly to help him work out his emotional issues and be more present for me. I see that as a challenge that I'd like to take on as I think about what kind of parent I want to be to my child.

I should also add that I definitely do have some things that could probably use professional attention. I do experience occasional anxiety or impatience with friends/family, and I'm a frequent marijuana user--I can go for weeks or even months using every day. This is just in the evenings to help me sleep, and doesn't interfere with my life otherwise (marijuana is legal where I live, easy and cheap to acquire). But I know enough about dependency and the aforementioned patterns of addiction in my family to know that this probably isn't an entirely innocent habit on my part. (Very luckily I have almost no taste at all for booze, which is the drug of choice among addicts in my family.) I don't actually want to quit, which is probably one of the things that has been making me hesitate to see a therapist--fearing they'll tell me something I don't want to hear. But I imagine that's a common concern.",08Feb2018,1

I don't want to invalidate him and shut him down, he really doesn't have anyone else to talk too and isn't in a position for getting any professional help at the moment.

65,"I want to start off with a disclaimer. I don't mean to be offensive or start a debate, just forgive my ignorance if I use a term inappropriately.

We are both 30 M/F and have been dating 3 years. Considering moving in together up until today.

This morning on my way to work, I called her on my commute like I do every morning. She typically talks to me but said she was tired. I politely told her ""its okay, go back to sleep, I love you."" Her response was blunt and slurred version ""ok whatever love you.""

She has the demeanor that I pick up on from a mile away. Her sweet loving nature is gone during this time, and she comes off irritated and annoyed that I even called her. The ""I love you too"" she told me, is a rushed, begrudging phrase. Kind of like someone being forced to say it.

Later in the day, I called and she answered. Immediately it was this grumpy, irritated tone ""I am on the phone with Mary. I'll call you back. Bye."" Normally we have the ""I love you"" after every single conversation. She typically is genuine and super loving when she says it. Not during this time, she doesn't even say it. It's become so habitually, that the ""I love you"" is a good gauge for me with how she is feeling.

Sorry if this is an over/under thought. It's just something I've picked up on in the relationship.

She doesn't call me back, so at lunch I call her. I asked if she wanted to do lunch together, and that I'd come over around 12 noon. Well my work isn't super scripted, where a bell rings and I can leave at 11:45 and be at her house at noon. I take lunch when I can...today I ordered food and left to pick it up at 11:55 and was on pace to be at her place by 12:15.

On my drive over, she calls me furious about the time. It's roughly 12:01 and she is irritate that I am still 10-15 mins away from her house.

I completely avoid the ""around 12 noon"" debate or even attempting to explain that my office doesn't work scripted down to the exact minute.

Instead I apologize but it doesn't matter. She is irrationally angry at me. Experiencing this for the last 3 years, I've learn not to engage the argument.

As I start to eat my sandwich, she tells me to just fucking leave. ""If your [me] gonna sit there and not talk, just get the fuck out."" To which I complied and started leaving.

She's going on and on about the rudeness of me to be late. She brings up random snapchat from a few days ago, that I posted on my story and how childish it was. It was a tide pod picture titled ""Ready for lunch."" Just something totally out of left field to bitch at me for.

I've learned from earlier relationships how important it is for the guy to stay calm. How a loud male voice can intensify an argument a lot quicker. I've been nothing but 100% indoor voice, polite carefully crafted questions and conversation....all because I know she is a ticking time bomb sometimes.

The problem: I don't know when her period is or when the PMDD phase is. Now as I am leaving her house, I couldn't resist. I calmly ask ""Is it a bad time of the month."" Literally giving her a free pass like I usually do. It's barely a smart ass question, because I am only 50-75% sure that PMDD is the culprit today. I need to know why she is mad at me....for being 15 minutes ""late"" or a goofy snapchat from days prior? Can't be the reason...I'd love confirmation of the actual problem.

She berate me with ""fucking asshole"" as I leave.

Then on my way back to work I get the following texts:

""I'm done, I won't stick around to have you throw my womenly issues in my face anymore. To you, the fact that I'm a women means that I am a free punching bag for you to abuse and remind me how much of a failure I am because I'm a women because I have a monthly period and emotions. Well screw you, i'm fucking done.""

""You are a fucking joke. You work at [my company] and do nothing else but play video games and read reddit. What can you say you've done for others or yourself? Nothing. You are a fucking joke.""

""Hope that makes you feel how I feel and that you hold onto it because that feeling of feeling like shit is exactly how you make me feel constantly.""

I'm literally trying to hold it together as I type this out. She's never texted me stuff this nasty before and I am at a loss for words. It hurts. She really thinks I abuse her? I don't understand the biology that would lead her to thinking this.

I've never hit her, ordered her around, and rarely insult her. The exception was earlier in the relationship when I didn't know about this PMDD stuff. She insults me, I'd insult her back. But it was always generic ""asshole/dick"" name calling. Mine was always more PG-13...with ""bitch"" being the worst I've ever said. Since the first year of the relationship...I rarely if ever, even resort to calling her names back.

I'm devastated right now and need advice. The subject of PMDD is virtually unapproachable. She uses it as an excuse a couple days later...but I can never ask if its the root cause of these explosions she has.

She refuses therapy or medication and starts a WW3 fight if I bring it up. I'm at my wits end.

I love her but feeling like she crossed the line today. I can't even get back to my work because of how useless I feel, how useless my job feels.

TL;DR: My girlfriend uses PMDD, but doesn't want to take steps to avoid or curb the issue. I'm extremely hurt today, and don't know if I have the will to keep going. Love doesn't seem to be enough anymore.",08Feb2018,28

68,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone‚Äôs life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you‚Äôre willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers/personal information you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. 

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

As a thank you for your time, we will enter you into a prize draw where you could win a ¬£50 Amazon voucher, or even an iPad Mini.

Thank you,

69,"Hi Guys,

I have had a psychotic episode 2x. In between my recovering fases I noticed that massage therapy was a trigger for me too sliding back and loosing it. After I noticed it the second time I called up some masseuse therapists and came to find out: They have a contra-indication for massages. Meaning they dont do massage therapy on people who have psychiatric problems. The reason being that massaging the body does something to the mind. It can release emotions that are ""stuck"" in your body and these emotions can trigger you.

That was really a bummer for me because whenever I was stressed and needed relaxation I would take a massage.

I have been looking into things like: Meditation, Reiki, Breath therapy and Bio energetica. But often their is a contra -indication.

I wanted to know if any of you also feel their is a body mind connection? And that things that happen to your body can be a trigger. Would love to hear experiences. I would do anything to stay stable &amp; healthy. But I need to find a way how to cope with stress and how to relax my body in a way it wont be triggered.",08Feb2018,1

72,"TL:DR Gf told me she is a closeted pedophile, What should I do?

So she explained to me that she gets turned on by the idea of having intercourse with very young boys, from 12 all the way down to even toddlers. She says she likes the how ""taboo"" it is.

She swears that she would never do it in real life and feels terrible and almost suicidal when she does get off to the idea. She does not watch or look at pedophilia images, but imagines them.

She says that she tries to push these feelings to the back of her mind and hates that she gets excited by them. I can tell she is not lying and actually means it. She gets visibly upset afterwards and sometimes turns to suicidal thoughts over it.

Should i advise her to seek help? She is really worried this will tear us apart, and i still love her, but this does worry me.

Any advise on how to deal with this is much appreciated.

I am only 16, and i am at the age of consent in my country, but i look rather young for my age. I look between 12-14 and she has told me that my baby face is one of the reasons for her attraction to me. 

I posted this on r/relationships, but it got removed after an hour due to it's subject matter. A moderator recommended me to post this here as i may get a more helpful response. 


She was beaten as a child, could this be a cause? I really want her to help her self and don't want to lose her.


EDIT: She has never acted on these feelings, and cries at the thought of it.",08Feb2018,18
73,"Hello everybody!

I'm a 19 year old boy with an extremely low self-esteem. I would really like to increase it.
So let's begin with the reason that I have a low self-esteem. 
My dad kept dissapointing me again and again which caused me to feel that I'm worth nothing. At the time I thought 'if even my dad leaves me then I must be worth nothing'. He left me when I was 11 years old. I haven't spoken to him in years. 
I think that I'm not good at anything and that I'm ugly. I was able to talk to anybody before, but I feel that it starts to effect my social skills. I usely don't say anything because I think that everything that I say doesn't matter. This is especially with girls. One of my friends tried to introduce me to a girl and I started to panic. I looked at her and turned around and started talking to another friend of mine because I didn't know what to do.
I really want to raise my self-esteem to a point that I'm atleast able to talk to girls again, but I have no idea how to do this. 
Are there any ways to raise it?

Thanks in advance! ",08Feb2018,2
74,"Apparently I‚Äôm not motivated enough to go through with a treatment. No, I guess I love destroying my teeth because I brush them so much, eat only once per day because I love not daring to eat more often as I‚Äôll only do more damage to my teeth, I love having to read all the ingredients because I can‚Äôt deal with anything that could potentially harm my teeth, and I just love not eating and drinking things I like because I‚Äôm so worried about my teeth. 

There are other things I love as well, but those are the most prominent things at the moment.

I‚Äôve been referred to them before, and apparently I kept canceling appointments all the time, when, in reality, I had to cancel the appointments made for my treatment because: I had exams, and the people who were supposed to treat me made me feel terrible. I dreaded every single appointment because it felt as if they were yelling at me every time I struggled with sharing difficult things with them, they always complained about me in their reports, and I felt as if I had to defend myself every single session we had because they always complained about me and brought up my apparent lack of motivation for getting help. 

I have a new session with my psychologist tomorrow, and we will most likely (which means: definitely) discuss this and what to write in a new referral, but honestly... does it even matter? I can get rid of my OCD, but my life will be shitty anyway. In the long-term, it won‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôll still feel the same away about my life. OCD isn‚Äôt even my biggest problem.

And for the record... I despise the OCD-team (we have teams who specializes in treating OCD). I was determined to never go back, but my psychologist got me to change my mind. I was prepared to give it another shot, while prepared to stop at once if it turned out to be a similar experience as the last time.",08Feb2018,7

76,"It‚Äôs just gettin hard to stay motivated and strong and optimistic... I don‚Äôt know.

Stress from my uni courses is really getting to be too much I suppose. I‚Äôm starting to have a hard time managing my own emotions and I just feel extremely overwhelmed all at once like a wolf is coming out of no where for my throat.

I‚Äôm having another one of those mental collapses. Each time this happens the words ‚ÄúDysthymia‚Äù flash in my head. I‚Äôve never been diagnosed, nor have I ever said anything about it before but I just feel like that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs going on. After a really really bad first year of uni 2 years ago I suppose I never recovered and my mental stability just kept slipping further and further. People think I‚Äôm fine but I don‚Äôt feel fine.

That being said I don‚Äôt want to go to a doctor because, what I it is dysthymia or depression or anxiety?  It‚Äôs sounds so bad but I want to work in healthcare and I panic thinking a confirmed diagnosis like that could hinder my already low chances in the future.

I don‚Äôt know, I guess I‚Äôm just tired of having to keep supporting myself and motivating myself since I don‚Äôt have a significant other (never have) and my family and friends aren‚Äôt very...helpful. It‚Äôs exhausting....

Everyone says I‚Äôll do better or to chin up but that‚Äôs even worse because then I don‚Äôt do better and they just give me a sad smile. I know they are trying but it makes it worse. I just want someone to acknowledge my struggles and tell me it‚Äôs okay, and for it to be said so I can believe it.

Hi! I am a graduate student at Pacific University working on a research project regarding social anxiety, social media, and beliefs about counseling or therapy.

78,"I know other people have it worse which makes me feel even guiltier, but like, damn. I‚Äôm not suicidal anymore so yay progress I guess, but I‚Äôm still really fucking tired of feeling suffocated by my own brain. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like it takes tons of energy to send a text or make food. I‚Äôm tired of telling myself I should die and I‚Äôm a gross unlovable piece of shit when I DO actually take care of myself. Like I‚Äôll get up from a 7 hour nap to eat then, ‚Äúlook at you eating, fat piece of shit, all you care about is trying to do basic shit like fucking eat. You‚Äôre lifeless, look at you. You‚Äôre so gross, you even chew gross, you‚Äôre pathetic, die, you should stab yourself with that key.‚Äù Boy I didn‚Äôt ask. I don‚Äôt see someone loving somebody like this, which makes me hurt even more, why would you love what hates herself. Everyone I know is dating and I‚Äôve never had a relationship bc I‚Äôm terrified of somebody leaving me because of this. And on top of that my brain gets trapped in these rumination cycles like, ‚Äúwhat if I become harmful?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm a bad person?‚Äù Even breathing, checking breathing was an obsession i had, I bought a heart rate monitor because I was so scared my checking wasn‚Äôt doing enough. It looked dumb but OCD can make you dumb. And the hours googling bc of uncertainty about things and when I figure it out just moving onto another, goddamn I‚Äôve wasted my time. I‚Äôm alive but not living. Another thing that‚Äôs ass and a half is, the meds that really help me jump out of bed and have energy and remember to eat and shower also rev up my OCD rituals and rumination cycles like they‚Äôre on roids. And the meds that help those issues calm that anxious suffocation but they blunt my emotions and make me feel lifeless and my mood doesn‚Äôt get better. Also good thing Literally NO ONE understands both of these, it‚Äôs usually one or the other I still can‚Äôt really relate to people.

79,"I was listening to a psychologist/sociologist's seminar on Youtube and he was saying that people 'write' their destiny (e.g., the type of jobs, level of education and relationships they want, whether they want to get married or not, or their outlook on life) between the ages 6 and 7. If they're somewhat smart they can rewrite their destiny between the ages 22-28 with the help of someone knowledgeable (e.g., a psychologist). After that it becomes very difficult (and almost impossible) for people to change themselves. 

This is somewhat true for me. I kind of knew what I wanted/expected from life when I was about 6-7. I want to know if this is also true for other people as well? Did you guys know what you wanted from life when you were at that age and did life give you that? ",08Feb2018,1
80,"I have this weird thing that started a few years ago I think, where getting started on fun things became equally as hard as pushing myself to do chores. Once I get started it's no problem and I still enjoy the activities a lot, but my mind seems to forget that the next time. I'm currently a student, but when I have a job later on, I will only have a few hours a day to spend on something I enjoy, such as drawing and gaming. This is extremely important for my general motivation for anything. It makes no sense to me because sometimes I'll feel ""too lazy"" to even play games or watch series. Instead I just spend my free hours browsing Reddit, Youtube and other sites with no real intention except to kill some boredom. Then afterwards when I go to bed I regret how I spent my valuable time. It's as if I get into some auto-pilot mode when I am tired or after a long day and I can't even bring up the motivation to do something I *want* to do. I also sometimes eat when I'm not even hungry, and sometimes even procrastinate going to the toilet. I don't feel like it's the real me controlling those things. It might be that I just created a lot of bad habits during some hard times and that they stuck to me even though there's no reason for them anymore. Man, it's such a waste because there are some things that I really enjoy doing but every time it's a fight to get started. Once I get through that initial barrier I just enter the zone and get really into it. I don't think it's depression or anything related, but I wish I knew what was causing this or at least how to get out of it, even if it takes a lot of work.",08Feb2018,14
81,"Hi guys

I've just thought about something lately and that is why have my parents never been concerned about my mental well being. They are really loving parents who really care for me but they have never taken me to a therapist or anything like that which is kinda weird to me. And here's why:

All my life I've been extremely neurotic. I've always been very hypochondriac and I've always been a worrier worrying about irrational things. I've also had a lot of trouble with self-esteem and being put down by my ""friends"" and generally have had trouble having good relationships. 

I've also had trouble in school. At first I had a lot of trouble concentrating and I never did homework on time because I just didn't care and had no motivation for it. When it was a subject I was really bad at I could also start crying since I thought that it was so difficult that I couldn't do it. When I turned 15 I actually had to start taking school so I kinda did. I didn't spend all my time on that but I was a bit more serious and I actually got good grades once I actually tried.

And nowadays I've had a lot of trouble with anxiety and being kinda depressed at times. I always feel like I'm wasting my time and like I never have enough time to do things even if I only work a few hours at night and always have the whole day to do stuff. I'm pretty comfortable but I feel way worse than my peers and I don't have any motivation to do anything except being comfortable. Some memories plague me and I can't come to terms with my problems and who I am and stuff like that.

Soo, lately I've kinda hid my bad mental health but shouldn't my parents have picked up on any of the things I've listed?? For example when I was a child, how would they not notice how bad I was at times?? I feel like everything that has happened to me has led to my mental health now and I feel like I've always suffered from something my whole life. I can't deal with life the way many people who are happy can. I'm worried and feel like eventually I'll have to get help since I don't know how I'm gonna be able to take care of myself and live life moderately happy.

Thanks if you read this far and comment what you think.
