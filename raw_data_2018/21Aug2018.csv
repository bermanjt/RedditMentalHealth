1,"I’m 24 now and it goes back to when I was 8. 

When I was younger I used to have this weird vision and reoccurring dream. 

Over time, and usually due to stress the symptoms have just become stronger and stronger. 

Sometimes I feel normal, sometimes I feel like putting my head through a wall. Sometimes I can have a conversations, other times I hear voices having a conversation with me. Sometimes I can hold a conversation with people, sometimes I become so out of control the worlds come out so fast I start coughing. 

I’ve been managing it for years through things like alcohol, I need to cut the booze, but I’m so scared of the person I’m trying too drown. 

I have no idea how to help myself. I’m either suicidal, manic, paranoid, hallucinating, or drunk. I have an appointment to speak with someone in a few weeks.  

Have you guys any experience with this? I’m not looking for medical advice, I just need to know for my own sanity.. ",21Aug2018,1,

5,"For some reason I seem to hate vocals, doesn't matter if it's a song or rhyme, I just find voices irritating. I can remember that when I started listening to anything with vocals and music in the background, my brain would automatically focus on music and ignore the vocals to the point where I couldn't understand the vocals. Now it's not as bad but I still fond vocals annoying. The music i listen to ranges from classical to aggressive. For example any piano piece, lebowskick, the caretaker, Boris Brejcha, No_4mat, carpenter brut, GosT, perturbator and so on. I don't usually listen to classical but I enjoy it.",21Aug2018,1,

9,"I’ve been best friends with this girl, T, for 8 Years now. We moved to different places about two years ago but kept video chatting every day. T is 20, has been with her only boyfriend for six years and they have a seven month old baby. The bf cheats on her over and over but she always has romanticized his behavior and made excuses for him. He even cheated while she was pregnant and she had to get STD tested but she blamed this instance on his insecurity, etc.

They live in a dirt cheap apartment and he works full time. They barely make rent each month. Neither of them have their GED’s so he’s kept the same job his whole life. Meanwhile she is stuck in the house 24/7 with their baby since he won’t let her work part time even though she desperately wants to. He never takes her or baby places, even to the park or on a walk to get fresh air. This has made her feel trapped and cry many times. I have begged her to live with me but she always ends up staying. She literally moved across the country with the bfs family so I can’t physically be there for her. 

Out of boredom she started doing tarot readings for people and even opened her own company on Facebook. She told me that’s she’s made about 600 dollars in two months doing “readings” for people. Not sure if it’s true but it does seem like she has many customers. Lately more and more I noticed her talking about the cards. She goes to the cards for all of her decisions and after a while it became all she talked about. It became pretty annoying and I eventually stopped video chatting her as much. Whenever I’d try to talk about my life, she’d say she could help me with a reading to enlighten me, somehow always relating everything we spoke about to the cards. Anyways I decided to video chat her last night since it had been awhile and she asked to. Out of nowhere she told me she’s been trying to talk to MGK (a famous rapper) because she’s destined to give him a reading. She told me that he hasn’t opened her message because he’s playing hard to get. She asked me if she should send him a voice chat and if maybe that’d make me reply. She was not joking and I was extremely disturbed but hid it well. It’s like she forgot or couldn’t even grasp the concept that he has millions of fans and will never see her DMs. The next day she made a post on her personal Facebook that was multiple paragraphs long talking about how he’s changed her life and helped her rebel against Christianity and how they both want to change the world into an anarchy. She asked people to contact him please and that she’s tried on every platform.

She doesn’t drink, only rarely smokes pot when the baby is next door with the grandma who also lives in the apartment complex.. she was an all A student before she dropped out and moved in with her bf. She was always a witty, stable girl and I think never being able to leave the apartment and rarely having any help with her baby, having an “absent dad yet physically there” boyfriend while being controlled has made her mentally unwell. I would tell her mom but she is bat shit crazy and lives far from her as well. No dad or other family. The boyfriends family is absolutely awful as well and has manipulated her into staying many times when he fucks up. Saying that if she left that’d be taking him away from his son (he’s never even changed his diaper.) 

I know that she loves her son and I don’t want to do anything to hurt her but I am truly worried about her well being.. she is delusional and I know she’d be extremely offended even if I kindly suggested that she seeks help. Any advice on what do to would be greatly appreciated. ",21Aug2018,1,
10,(Warnning long and boriing) Idk if its depression or just my situation but I feel like there isn't anyone next to me.  My mother is now working full time and my so is my father so it's just me and my sister and she is always at my throat for no reason at all... Calling me useless and stupid. I've been wanting to self harm and I have for the first time in a long wile the other day. Its the same thing every single day. I haven't been out if the house more then just for an hour or so in a month. I'm wakeing up just tired and full of regret. I'm not sure what about maybe that I'm still hear i dont know. I have 1 friend who I actually talk to and will see very soon with is nice but every time I speak with her it seems that I'm just bugging her. I just kinda want to be consumed be a black hole. ,21Aug2018,1,
11,"I’m diagnosed with depression and I often have panic attacks. I’m not on meds. Recently I’ve been feeling so much worse and I think it’s because it’s summer. During summer I don’t feel like there’s a safe place for me and I feel drowning in the constant daylight and heat. It gets so bad that I start to panic in public places and I have to pretend I’m doing just fine.

12,"I have a tough time buying into my treatment for my OCD, because so much of it seems to be speculative and not based in fact. Humans have incorrectly guessed about what’s going on in the world both inside and outside of us, so what’s to say we are just wrong with the theories used for the treatment of all sorts of stuff, in this case, OCD?",21Aug2018,1,
13,"I’m not even sure if i should be posting this but I’m at a loss of what I should do or how I should feel. It was dark out during a school camping trip activity and a friend of mine had gone out by himself and tried to commit suicide in the lake by the camping area. His attempt was thankfully unsuccessful and he returned to his cabin mates in the activity soaked. He wouldnt speak. Nobody really noticed that he had come back other than his cabin mates, which have been mostly entirely silent about the thing (which i certainly dont fault them for). I had not expected that he would do this, as I talked to him earlier today and he seemed fine for the most part. Looking back he did occasionally seem more distraught then usual.
I am friends with his cabin, and I know about it via one of them willing to tell me. Most of the people in my cabin are friends with this person too, so i stupidly decided to tell them (at the time that i had told them we knew that he had fell in the lake but it was not certain what had occurred or why, although we all knew that this kid has exhibited suicidal tendencies so an attempt was suspected). They understand the gravity of this situation and I trust that they wont spread rumors, as they are genuinely concerned about the well-being of this person. That doesnt mean I dont regret telling them sensitive information that I wasn’t supposed to know. I now have confirmation that it was indeed a suicide attempt. I did not tell my cabin this, and regret telling them that he had been in the lake to begin with. Luckily he’s going home. Word is the camp director will say something about it in the morning.
My questions are these - how do i keep highschoolers like myself from doing stupid shit in this scenario? How do I start being an adult in this situation rather than a kid? How do I limit the damage I might have caused? Also, there’s still plenty of days left in camp, and as stupid as I sounds now, i’ve been looking forward to this all year. I am extremely upset about this friend but I also dont want the rest of camp to be so somber. Am I selfish for this? Will we be able to get past this and have fun? Should we? I apologize for any grammatical or formatting errors as i’m writing this in my bed whilst on my phone.

14,"So I stopped taking my antidepressants...I think 3 weeks ago? My sense of time is dogshit fyi. Anyways--lately ive been waaay too sensitive to stimuli, extremely edgy, and to top it off I've been starting to have horrifying delusions of other people. Like, last night i slept in my brothers room because i thought he was at a friends right? And ive always had an irrational fear of men and being raped, so after he kicked me out and i slept downstairs dumb thoughts circulated through my head.

 Somehow i got the idea in my head of ""what if he touched me, how can i trust him"" but im trying my best to remind myself that. None of that makes any. Freaking. Sense. Im honestly pretty terrified, I really don't want to lose my grip with reality or anything.

So TLDR; can you guys help me understand why im so paranoid after stopping ssris, and help me keep a grip on reality?

15,"I’m struggling from an eating disorder. I restrict my calories to under 1000 calories a day. If I go over my calorie limit by even 100 calories, I force myself to purge it back up. I was in denial for awhile. It started out as healthy weight loss and wanting to drop a couple pounds. As soon as the pounds started falling off, I realized I wanted to see how skinny I could get. I wanted to feel beautiful. I longed for the ways guys look at me when I’m my thinnest. I have another problem though: I’m not underweight, so when I bring up my eating problems to professionals, no one takes it seriously. They all try to convince me that since I’m considered a healthy weight, despite dropping 30 pounds in less than four months, that everything is ok.  And that’s not ok. It’s not ok to feel immense guilt when I eat something, and it’s not ok that I punish myself for indulging in a sweat by making myself puke it back up. I’m feeling a bit stuck. I’m not quite sure what do to at this point.  It’s hard for me to accept that I have a problem if a professional doesn’t believe I have one. Thanks for listening.",21Aug2018,7,
16,"Everyone no matter what their situation or life circumstance faces the possibility of struggling with depression.  Some folks unfortunately have a genetic predisposition to experiencing depression and often have to fight a lot harder than others to cope and live a functional and fulfilling life.  Thankfully, everyone possesses some level of the ability to be resilient and bounce back from hard times.  While often we don’t have much of a say in preventing depression from hitting us, we do have the ability to choose what we do in response.  Our choices and behaviors often influence which direction we are going, whether that be towards recovering from our depression or regressing, and sinking deeper.
Depression is like a parasite.  It wants to live inside of you.  It convinces you of so many irrational thoughts.  If you allow the parasitic thoughts to take hold of you, it will keep you from doing things that bring you joy.  Rarely will the depressed person replace those activities with others that bring them joy.  Spending too much time in life working and dealing with all of life’s inherent stressors without engaging in joyful activities that bring reprieve will only cause depression to spiral downwards and out of control.  This is how depression can gain momentum and cause disastrous results.
When thinking of depression and momentum you can imagine it like a very heavy stone wheel rolling in one direction.  The longer it rolls and the more you take either actions or decide to inaction that pushes it along the path, it rolls faster and is harder to turn.  Giving in to depressive thoughts that cause you to isolate more, think negatively about yourself, and give up joyful activities feeds the depression and pushes the stone wheel in the direction towards being completely controlled and debilitated by your depression.  This thought may be terrifying but it’s very important to be continuously aware of.
The good part about the stone wheel and momentum is that it works the other way too.  There are certain things that lift our spirits:  Spending time with loved ones, maintaining a healthy diet, exercising, maintaining good sleep habits, getting out of the house and into the sunlight, and engaging in pleasurable activities that bring you joy.  If you are or have been depressed you probably realize that you’re either slacking in some or all of these things.  Given that depression can cause a severe lack of energy and motivation it can be difficult to have that “get up and go” to make changes, but it’s still possible.

17,"Hullo everyone. So I experienced a few weeks where I had no trouble getting out of bed in the morning, getting out of the house, focusing on my school work, controlling my emotions - I had no urges to lash out our be mean to the people in my life, I WANTED to spend time with people, I didn't ruminate as much, I had no brain-fog &amp; could function healthily in my personal and work relationships, I even had control over what I ate - my binging cravings disappeared and my cravings for sugar weren't an issue, I suppose 'cause my body wasn't thinking it needed lots of extra sugary energy to work properly. Exercising stopped being so hard to put some time aside for. I was all like, about my depression, 'IT'S GONE, IT'S GONE' lol. (While in the back of my head I KNEW that it wasn't 'cause as everybody says you just learn how to deal with it, and it will always come back. )

I've had depression for 7 years now, and those 2 weeks were SO GOD DAMN WEIRD. I felt HAPPY. And now that sort of bliss is gone and I feel a bit messed up &amp; disoriented, like I had forgotten what it was like to be """"happy"""" so I was really used to that sort of emotional pain and brain fog (aka functioning - not having a break down every day and ruining all of my relationships).  Now I just feel extremely disappointed, sad and even more frustrated than ever before. I do EVERYTHING in my power to get better and I'm honestly just feeling angry? Like the world finally gives in and lets me feel OK just to take it away again? 

In all these 7 years I've never had a period of time like this - maybe a day or so every now and then. I want to ask if any of u have experienced this. What does it mean actually? Was it something you were doing or did it feel really random? 

I'm going to go to the doctor soon, I've got an appointment for early next month to get some professional advice, but honestly any thoughts or help anybody could give me would be really reaffirming. Thank you. 

Things I do to keep me sane:
- Routines at night and in morning including going to bed and waking up at the same time 
- Daily yoga
- 12,000 steps a day
- Regular more intense cardio (at least twice a week I'll make sure I build up a sweat) 
- Drinking lots of water &amp; eating lots of fruit &amp; vege
- Socializing when someone asks even if I don't feel like it. 
- Being careful with time management so I can manage my stress from school and work. ",21Aug2018,1,
18,"Over the course of a year, I've lost everything that ever mattered to me. Somewhere along the way I even lost myself.   A series of events led up to this life changing moment and after everything that happened... It's truly a wonder how I'm still alive. 

My name is Andrew.    


On January 18th, 2018 a small army of police, a SWAT time and a police helicopter nearly killed me over an umbrella.

19,"I haven’t been able to go to bed feeling like I’m going to get a good nights rest lately. 
About a year ago I quit caffeine all together, a month ago I took midol for some cramps not realizing a key ingredient is caffeine, I had what was called a caffeine overdose that mixed in with my anxiety, depression, and depersonalization caused me to be extremely fidgety and uneasy all day not to mention unable to sleep. I paced my house for hours. 
Later realizing I could have just worked out to burn the caffeine, it was one of the most uncomfortable I have ever been in my own body. 
About two weeks ago I thought a lot about death having lost my grandpa three years ago and my uncle only a year ago, those thoughts brought back my fear of death. 
Ever since those events if caffeine and fear I have been unable to sleep I crawl into bed in a panic unable to catch my breath. 
I have tried everything I can think of, I upped my antidepressants/anxiety pills, I work out, I use essential oils, I splash cold water on my face but nothing seems like a long term solution each night I get scared to go to bed like I’m going to die there.

20,"Hey guys- never posted on reddit before but I read them all the time. I have always been kinda an uptight kid w OCD and mild anxiety. Nothing that needs medication or anything but just a nervous kid. I overthink a lot and am super serious. I’ll admit it.

But I got in a phase where I had some druggie friends and wanted to try a bunch of things out. Before this I had only smoked weed and drank. 

One night I decided to take half a tab with my best friend. It was tested before hand. It wasn’t really much of anything- some minor visuals, only when I focused on them. Time just seemed to go by slow. We watched some videos but p much we’re stuck in her room all night, sitting there eating and watching the tv. 

Now keep in mind I was only used to weed and stuff which has physical signs of it wearing off... like your body knows when it’s not drunk or high. But with acid it’s all in your mind so I started freaking out about half way through worrying that it would never go away and that I was screwed up. It was kinda like being mentally blue balled all night Bc it didn’t really do anything but I felt weird. I didn’t sleep that night and eventually was fine.

Since then my anxiety has gotten worse- scary movies linger in my thoughts a little longer. I’ve had a few mini panic attacks. I can’t get intoxicated anymore Bc I don’t like my mind being In a different state. I feel like a darkness is over me and I just feel scared all the time. Like not excited or care free like a college kid should be. It’s slowly gotten worse the more I think about it. Am I going insane? I just feel dark and scared and inside my head and overthoughtful- worse than it has ever been.

So my fears are this- did I permanently damage my brain? Am I depressed? Anxious? PTSD? Hormonal? In a funk? When will this go away. My friends say it’s normal but it’s been three months.

Please, help me to feel better. It’s not very severe but enough to make me feel a little freaked.",21Aug2018,5,
21,"My friend has had a messy life and doesn't trust many people, with me being the main exception. Obviously this makes me quite significant in their life, but i'm not sure how to deal with this. The hallucination they usually see is a person they refer to by name, but I have told them it's probably best to avoid personification, and I never interact or refer to the hallucination myself. They are not currently being treated, and although I have encouraged them to seek help, their current situation makes it very complicated.

Today, their usual hallucination was apparently hit by a car, and they assumed it would come back later as if nothing happened as it has done so before. Instead, they later saw a hallucination of me, which came up and introduced itself. After that it didnt really speak, apparently mainly staring at them or laughing. It was upsetting and apparently 'mean' to them, but i wasn't sure it was best to get into the details too much. I'm rather at a loss for what any of this means, and we're both hoping that it disappears and their previous hallucination returns to be honest, as at least that one was easier for them to manage?

My name is Emma and I am currently completing my Masters of Clinical Psychology degree at Bond University in Queensland. I have previously experienced the passing of very close family members as well as hardship and struggles. Additionally, I have also supported children and young people who used suicidal ideation and self-harming behaviours to manage difficult situations and emotions and cope with their demons. As a result of this, I became passionate about learning more about peoples individual experience

The current study explores the experience of young adults aged 18 - 40 years who have previously been in foster care or had involvement with the Department of Child Safety/Protection and remained with their biological family.

23,"So they have previously been diagnosed a few years back with BPD, PTSD and a few other things I can’t remember. If anything I say makes you think they may have something please mention as it may ring a bell. 
I’m trying to wrap my head around how to firstly help someone that refuses help and also how do I prevent myself from getting more messed up because of it. It’s someone I can’t just cut out of my life. 

Recently they had a ‘moment’ where they snapped and raged saying a lot of nasty things, that also seem delusional. For example: when I was an early teen they threw my belongings on the lawn and kicked me out of the house. They did not recall this at all! Then a few mins later stated they must have done it because they knew *someone* was going to pick me and my belongings up. 
It goes from denial then to admittance but in a different more positive way I guess. 

They love the word abuse. It will be used wherever possible. Eg. “Rob (SIL) hasn’t spoken to me for a month even though we’ve been around each other. That is straight up abuse.”
Well you treated Rob like shit during a ‘moment’ but he doesn’t really have a choice but to be around you as he’s now family!

Can not keep any friends and struggles to maintain family relationships. I, plus a couple other family members are only around as they have a young child we need to try protect/check up on. 

Different personas to the point you know what ‘mood’ they are in by the sound of their laugh. 

This person got help initially when diagnosed as it benefited them financially. Now doesn’t admit to any mental health issues unless talking to someone new and seems to throw it out there to get attention.

I’ve researched BPD. They show some traits but there’s just more and I know there must be something more seriously going on in their mind. I really want to help but where can I begin if I can’t even understand how to deal with them to then get them help. ",21Aug2018,2,
24,"Okay so, I've been for the past 2 or 1 years having these Motivational Swings (And mood swings recently). So my motivation is something, I can't have consistent motivation, either I have none of it or have too much of it and that really annoys me (side note, this motivation swing has been more demotivational than motivational, it's not 50/50) and I'm an artist, I need to have consistent motivation so I can finish a project, but I've been just doing nothing because of it, so, if anyone knows anything about this and maybe could help, please do. And now Mood Swings, recently my mood has been like, here's and example: So I'm watching something funny, and my mood is positive and not sad, then I stop watching something funny and put on some emotional music and my mood goes from positive to mildly depressed in a few seconds after I'm done, it stays for a bit and then I return to neutral or I stay sad, I don't know, it sounds weird but I'll give you another example. So I'm waiting in line at a shop, mood is neutral maybe a little positive, and then I think about some personal things and then it goes to s\*it in a few seconds, stays there for awhile then goes back to normal or positive if I do something. In a few seconds. Again I don't know, maybe I sound stupid, but tell me if it's dumb on the mood swings part. So if anyone knows something maybe some mental disorder or something, please tell me, because I need to know. And if it's nothing, then maybe some advice how to deal with it, on both things.

So i've been dealing with depression and social anxiety. I've been taking Lustral 200mg(for 8 months), Cedrina 25mg(for 6months) and Risperdal 1mg(for a week).

I have a boyfriend. He is a really nice person, he is always there for me and helps with my problems. I've done so many bad things that hurts me and my relationship in the past. Like 5 days ago i cheated on him. But last 4 days i realized that i want to be a good person and want to be with him for the rest of my life. After i realized that, everything was just perfect between us for this 4 days until last night. Last night while we were trying to sleep, i couldn't stop talking to my brain. I was thinking that i don't deserve him. He thinks he loves me but actually not, he loves me because i treated him bad. He reads a lot and i don't. When i am good to him, he won't love me, if i love himi will loose him and etc. So i told him that i can't sleep and he said he neither. We started to talk about me feeling bad. Just like i thought, he was all weird. He was talking like he doesn't love me anymore and he wasn't the same person before an hour ago. I told him this and he said he's totally same, he still loves me but i don't know, everything was weird. Just an hour ago after that, i was sooo happy and calm and then everything changed. I was worried, lost my confidence. It was so hot inside but i was shaking. I kinda wasn't feeling my hands and legs. While i am talking to him, i couldn't look at his face and ended up hiding under the blanket... Can't believe my emotions could change that fast. I could not stay with him more and i went to my friend's place to sleep. I think i had complex too. While he was talking about something, i was feeling bad and ignorant because i had no idea about it. I don't really meditate and stuff but it might be my ego issues maybe? Because i don't know what to think, i just want to give a name to it. I want to find out what is this and get the right therapy and medication for it. Please, i really need your opinion. Thank you.",21Aug2018,0,

I've been given sertraline and a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. 

I was so worried about firstly, having a male doctor... I've not had the best of luck with them... and secondly because I had been brushed off so many times before.

But I didn't have to say much of anything. He'd looked through my file. Asked what treatment I had been given before which was none (which was also on file) though I mentioned I'd been offered medication and turned it down because I didn't feel that I was being listened to. And gave me a prescription which I accepted. 
This time because he has listened. And because I had already resolved in my head the last time I was weeping uncontrollably that I had to do something... anything...

I have been picking my skin for years but it has got worse in the last year or 2, so essentially I pick the Skin on the side of my Thumbs all day every day and I enjoy doing it, there is something satisfying or pleasurable about ripping the skin off the side of my thumbs I have constant cuts &amp; holes &amp; scabs &amp; blood etc. on my hands. I will pick the thumbs even if there is no legion and I will make one, I also keep picking after it begins to hurt.

However on my face and scalp I will pick if I have a lump or a pimple or something rough or dry or anything not smooth, right now my lip cracked and so I have been picking it like I just have this urge and need to rip the dry skin off my lips, I am also picking my ear piercings which are healing so I want to stop picking them but at the same time I don't.

I enjoy picking especially my thumbs and it doesn't bother me that much because I'm used to my hands being a scabby mess but the desire to pick something on my face is more annoying because I don't want scabs on my face...I'm just not sure if it's 'bad' enough to be a problem because I rarely pick anything other than my thumbs and I'm not distressed by it I actually like it.

I don't know if this is some kind of mental illness but i have a hard time keeping motivation on doing anything because the only thing i care are girls (not only sex). I'm always looking for their attention and approvation, i dress well, i take care of myself, i do almost anything just so i can get girls to like me.

Currently i'm dating like 4 girls and one of them is really obsessing me in a bad way, i always wonder if she thinks of me, why doesn't she write me or answer me, where she is etc.. she is acting like super strange one moment very into me and another moment i don't even exist, anyway i'm going to dump her because i can't understand her actions and this makes me feel sick and paranoid with a lot of thoughts on my mind.

I have some hobbies and interests but i can't progress because there always a girl that i think about, and if there is not i will go out and meet one.

I'd like to be a normal person that enjoys the company of other girls (or boys) without thinking about them in a sexual way, i'd like to pursue my hobbies and ambitions without getting out of my way for a random girl.

I think this has something with my teen years, where i never had a girlfriend and girls never looked at me, in fact my first sexual experience was at 20 years old.

When I heard it again a few days ago, all my mind could think about was my horrible middle school experience. I had nearly forgotten everything about my previous school, until that moment. I walked outside, sat down at a cazebo and uncontrollably started crying. The only ideas that went through my head were ""Nobody likes me!"" similarly to when I was in middle school. Later a friend came to talk to me and she calmed me down. It could just be that the booze made me emotional because I have cried before while drunk (meaningless stuff though.

I think about why, as a pretty decent-looking and nice 25M, I have never been able to hold down a relationship with any girl. I kick myself for not being as much of a creative as many of my friends, who are pretty well-achieved and so FOCUSED. They are all leaders in their respective communities, in which they are super productive and venerated...and I feel like the burden on the group, and a bit of an Eeyore.

48,"For those who took part or was interested in the results I've condensed it into the main points below:   


The study aimed to detect levels of integration over three areas (home, social and work) combined to be one overall concept. However this did not work, therefore it was separated into the three areas mentioned above: 

1 . Social: The main factor which had an impact on how well participants socially integrated was self-efficacy. This suggests that if you're feeling better about yourself in general then you'll find it easy once discharged to socially integrate back into your community. 

2. It was also found that within social integration the longer participants were discharged the less integrated they felt into their communities. This may be because, they've struggled to be part of the community and have therefore felt isolated. 

3. Work: There was a low percentage of people in full-time work or education (14%), and a larger amount of people who weren't at work, school/collage or volunteering (28%). 

4. The main factor effecting work, was how long participants spent in hospital - suggesting the longer hospitalisation made it harder to find work, or will to work. 

5. Home: Experiences within hospital are able to predict how well participants are able to live independently. This was the only factor which had any significance in this area.

I repeatedly apologize and ask for forgiveness, and even when I'm a hundred and ten percent sure I've been forgiven, I still can't forgive *myself.* It's something I don't think I've ever told my psychiatrist about, because often when I do go on to talk to her, I tend to think it's not something important.

53,"I have been dealing with depression/anxiety for about 7 years. 

One of the main issues is the fact that it is impossible to have a conversation with my parents that goes deeper than “what’s for dinner tonight” or “my bike has a flat tire and I don’t know how to change it, will you help me please”. I have lived with them for most of these 7 years (and yes I wonder how they could not have noticed me being depressed, although I’ve become pretty good at pretending and wearing a mask).

I know I am not capable of having a face-to-face conversation with them about my depression at this point. They are great people but dealing with emotional things is not their strong suit (never has been) and as much as I would love to open up to them, I know I will shut down and just say everything’s fine and dandy. 

I have written a text that basically explains how I have experienced the past 7 years. It has helped me understand my feelings and what the problem is exactly. I have been feeling slightly better recently and I know what I need to do to finally beat this depression once and for all. I do have a plan for the near future, I am even exited about it and I really want to make something of the rest of my life. All of these things, all of my thoughts are in that text. I love how I have worded certain things so perfectly and don’t think I could describe anything any better. I am so done feeling like crap but I fear it won’t be over unless I talk about it to my parents.

Now I would like give this text as a letter to my parents. Is that a good way to tell someone about this? How do I even give it to them? Sit next to them while they read it, knowing I’ll just start crying as soon as I hand it to them? Send it by email? Put it on their pillows so they can read it before bed? Then how should a conversation about it go? Does anyone see any downsides to this, or any advice on how to open up otherwise?

He doesn't always remember to take his meds and I'm not sure he shares everything with his therapist.

55,"I had been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and major depression throughout high school. It was almost primarily triggered by my toxic relationship with my mother (who has borderline personality disorder), so going to college and cutting off communication with her has made a world of difference. I have been off my medication for about a year and feel primarily in-control of my mental state at the moment. I definitely still experience waves of anxiety or low points in depression, but in general, I feel like a completely different person. All of the physical manifestations I struggled with (loss of appetite, sleep issues, general nausea, etc) are gone. 

Today, though, I went to the campus doctor for a new health issue. Once they saw my medication history, their tone completely shifted and they started asking me more questions about my mental health and less about the issues I was dealing with. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that mental health issues don't cause plenty of symptoms and amplify issues, but they essentially jumped to conclusions despite the fact that I no longer feel that either my anxiety or depression have affected my life in the past 6 months (the health issue arose in the past 2 months). This is not the first time this has happened, either; they saw my health history and said that my mono was just anxiety and stress instead of actually mono. It was mono.    
Does anyone else have these issues with their doctors? I know mental health care in general is a whole shit show, but I'm curious to hear if this is an issue outside of my university as well.

I have what I believe to be real event OCD. These various real events occurred as long as 20 years ago up to as recently as 5 years ago. You would agree the things I did were bad, but were not criminal. I caused harm to people I care about; I confessed, apologized, made amends, and have stopped doing these things. I am religious, so I have also confessed to God, repented, and spent years now ruminating in order to find every single 'root cause' and kill those off.

In spite of all of this, I have these months-long spells of hysterical crying, extreme guilt and remorse, self-loathing, and attempts to 'fix' the people I harmed.

I am taking a ton of supplements to try to help myself get through the day.

So here's the problem: one of these real events involved some coworkers at that time. And one of the coworkers who was tangentially involved, has since become a therapist in my city. She was working on her degree when we were coworkers. Her involvement in the situation made it much worse. We were friends and are not any longer. My opinion of her was that she is highly unethical and lacking in empathy and compassion and a huge gossip.

I live in a city of 1 million+, so it's not a small place.

This is mainly due to my family discovering the lies she has been telling people about getting abandoned as a child, doing work she hasn't done, and other physical abuse related stories. She also has a history of lying and manipulating people already. One example is when my parents almost getting divorced at one point because my mom was led to believe my dad was abusing my sister.

Things got better, mentally but I was then laid off in March. It took me almost four months to get a full time job. While in training for my current job, he said he stopped thinking of me.

But that's the thing, because I distance myself from everyone, I'll pick one person and because theyre the only person I have, I focus all of my social energy on them and become borderline obsessed with their attention and affection and I romanticize my relationship with them and put them on a pedestal so when I inevitably find out that they obviously don't view me the same way I view them (because they have more than one person in their lives unlike myself) my entire world feels like it's burning down. Which is unreasonable, but it happens over and over again regardless of me being aware of how fucked it is that I do this. So, because of this my relationships are always pretty much one sided which makes me feel sad and alone. 

I do have a boyfriend. So, right now, he's my one person that I have. But he is kind of distant and obviously doesn't view me the same way I view him. But, I stay, because I've finally come to realize that I'll never find anyone who is going to be as passionate and obsessive as I am so if I have someone good, I should just keep them. I don't tell him about any of this, he has no idea that I have this issue because I've learned how to hide it all pretty well over the years. If he knew, he'd most certainly leave me. Wouldn't anyone leave if they knew their partner was an obsessive weirdo? I can't hide everything though, which leads me to my next issue. I want to be his number one in the same way that he's mine, and while I hide the intensity of that feeling, I do express to him my desire to be shown more attention and to feel like I'm special to him, etc. Which then leads to arguments and him not understanding because he feels like he gives me a sufficient amount of attention and affection and cannot grasp the concept of me wanting even more because in his mind, there's no reason for me to be unsatisfied. And he's right about that. But, I can't help it, I want more. 

Anyway there have been times where he's ignored me to avoid saying something out of anger, and there have been times that he's threatened to leave me. In both instances, I lost my shit. I cannot handle being ignored by the only person I have in my life and I can't handle the thought of that person leaving me to be alone with just myself without even a friend or family member to go to for comfort...and so, I'd self harm. But in a way that is really embarrassing for me to talk about. I'd claw at my own arms and legs, drawing blood, leaving bruises and marks that would take days, sometimes weeks, to fade. I'd pull my hair, punch myself in the head, take a pocket knife to my wrists or thighs...it was like the emotions I was feeling were just too much to contain and I'd get this weird feeling and I didn't know what to do about it so I'd just hurt myself to release whatever it was that was overwhelming me. My boyfriend has no idea about any of it except for the cutting because that I couldn't really hide. So now I have scars I have to cover with extra large bandaids or wraps and it's humiliating. 

What bothers me the most is that I feel like this is some dumb high school behavior, I'm almost 26 so why do I act like this? The panic attacks, the self harm, the obsessiveness, the detachment from reality and my own version of reality that doesn't seem to fit in with anyone else's, I don't know. I feel so frustrated. I feel like I don't feel connected to anyone and even when I try to connect with someone or go out and make friends or make plans with people I know, I feel so outside of myself when I'm around them, I feel uncomfortable and strange and I can't wait to get away from them despite genuinely liking them. I don't feel at home in my own house, sometimes I have moments where I look around at work and just think ""wow, this is where I come every day"" as if I'm just now noticing. Nothing feels real, I guess. Nothing feels permanent or comfortable to me. Nothing feels familiar and warm. It all feels far away or very separate from me. Sometimes I look in the mirror and don't recognize myself or feel really strange looking at myself. 

And, I have good days and bad days. Somedays I'm just so full of energy and so happy, so sure that I'm gorgeous and smart, and then others I cry for no reason and feel disgusting and sad and hate myself, so sure that I'm a fucking idiot and worthless. So, I have no real grasp of who I am or how I feel about myself. It depends on the day, I guess. 

I don't know. There's a lot going on in my noggin on days like today. I'm just posting this to 1) let it all out for the first time ever, kind of therapeutic I guess and 2) just curious to see if anyone relates.   ",21Aug2018,5,

67,"I'm a bubbly, easygoing person, though I'm also completely neurotic. My PTSD keeps me trapped, both physically and mentally. Some days, I can't leave the house, and usually if I do, I have to have someone with me. Hell, I've only been able to recently start taking the trash out by myself without hearing my ex's voice telling me how I'm going to get raped and murdered. 
I was already struggling before him, and then he took 12 years of my life, and nearly broke me in the process. 
I've since left him, been divorced two years, but he still controls me. It pisses me off, and makes me incredibly sad. One of my coping mechanisms ( which I'm working with my therapist on) was to shove all the feelings and memories in a box in my head. Been doing it since I was a little kid, which essentially blinded me to the mental abuse. I justified it because he never hit me. Some days, I wished he beat the shit out of me, then at least I'd have physical marks to show, instead he's made me look like the bad guy. 
Last month, I had some horrific flashbacks. It was hot out, and I was already upset over some miscommunication, so I went to shower. When I sat down in the shower, I started to remember. All because my knees touched the sides of the tub. He used to force me bathe with him, by arguing with me until I'd give in, which was a common tactic of his  He used to not let me shit alone. I started to remember the anger and frustration, but also afraid of being alone. He used that to his advantage, constantly threaten to divorce me. When I'd confront him, he'd say he was joking. What a fool I was. 
We used to drive around at night, and he'd tell me how he could kill me, and no one would know. Which logically I know is completely bullshit. The messed up bit is I thought this was okay. He made me so passive, and I let it happen. Now I struggle with knowing is something is really bothering me or not. I already had a bit of a submissive personality before I met him, but I was way more independent. Now I feel like I can barely adult. I'm 31 years old, and feel like I have the knowledge of someone who is there late teens/early 20s when it comes to being an adult. It scares me and frustrates me, but yet here I am. 

TL;DR my ex is an asshole",21Aug2018,1,
68,"I started drinking when I was about 15 years old at parties. I've always been a horribly self concious person but following a serious of unfortunate events my mental health began to deteriorate, and with it my sobriety. I developed an eating disorder and would drink whole bottles of vodka on an empty stomach. I didn't care about anyone but myself or about anything but getting drunk. My grades fell, my relationship with my family fell apart, and I couldn't form any real relationships.

This behaviour carried on into university. I would drink all day and night. My eating disorder flipped from not eating anything to massive binges. I gained 4 stone in a couple of months (and now when I look in the mirror I feel physically sick). I had waking nightmares and would see things that weren't there. It made me so anxious and so paranoid. I thought my roommate was going to kill me and so I would obsessively lock my door at night. I became a massive hypochondriac and would to go to the doctor all the time because I thought my heart was failing or I had some kidney problem or, and yes I know this sounds ridiculous, I was having a brain aneurysm. It was hell. The problem was that whenever I didn't drink I was so depressed I would cry myself to sleep. Despite all of this I kept drinking.

I finally tried to find some sort of balance. I planned on only having 2 drinks at each party I went to but I quickly realised how incredibly difficult that was. I'm so overly self-conscious and I was so nervous I couldn't talk to anyone or have fun. I'm so awkard. I spent the past 5 years of my life oblivious to the world around me. I have no idea what is going on the world, I never read any books, I have no hobbies or interests. As a result, I have nothing interesting to say. So I just ended up getting drunk.

This went on for a while. I'd manage a few days sober here and there as I desperately wanted to stop but when I did get drunk, even if I didn't do anything bad, the shame and the guilt would suffocate me. I was worried about money. I was worried about school. I was worried about everything.

Last weekend I went to a festival with my friends, I had been really good all summer and only drank a handful of times but I ended up getting very drunk the first night and it ruined the entire trip for me. Not only did I feel physically hungover and shitty, but I was also just so fucking sad. I was getting stressed out and snapping at my friends. I thought that they all hated me and as a result I hated myself, a lot. I couldn't be bubbly, or fun. I didn't know how.

It is going to be so unbelievably difficult at university to have a social life and avoid alcohol but I have to. I need to work on my mental health because right now I would rather die than have to deal with a lifetime of feeling the way I do. I would REALLY REALLY appreciate any guidance you have on giving up alcohol, having a social life without alcohol, how to deal with anxiety or depression or stress, or just any advice you can give that has helped you in dark times.",21Aug2018,1,

I tried to cool down and i end up crying from all the built up rage. Id say its Anger Management but its anger at everything. I get aggravated when driving around and when some people talk to me  i cant  stand  talking to them because its all pointless. I skip small talk because i hate the concept of it all.

72,"First time posting here, so forgive me if this isn’t the typical format. 

I’m seven months pregnant. I’m not taking medication right now (personal decision to be off of it while pregnant). However, I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have dealt with this for many years. 

I’m in a low right now. Everything is a struggle. I cry a lot. I don’t want to get out of bed. I don’t want to leave the house. I’m not hungry. I’m just tired and miserable. I can’t concentrate. I’m afraid; I’m overwhelmed, and I’m so lonely (despite having a loving husband, a wonderful son, a daughter on the way, and a beautiful extended family of parents and in laws and siblings who love and support me). 

But I guess depression doesn’t really need a reason to show up. And it did. It’s my first big low since being pregnant and dealing with it in combination with pregnancy hormones and balancing the demands of parenting a toddler is a lot. 

The past couple of weeks have been really rough. The only time I leave the house is to go to work. Yesterday I was feeling a little better, I showed up to work with a smile and some optimism about the day. Immediately, my boss asked to speak with me. She said my team had come to her and said I don’t work as hard or fast or as focused as I once did and they feel that they are carrying my weight. (Reminder: I’m also 7 months pregnant. I know I’m not as physically efficient as I once was). 
 

I immediately broke down. I told her I didn’t realize this was affecting my work but that obviously if everyone feels this way, I guess it has. I told her how hard I tried to put on a smile and be normal at work, but concentrating and engaging are near impossible tasks for me right now. She was helpful and supportive and told me that the effort I’m giving “ is my 100% right now” and if my coworkers knew this, they’d be more supportive. 

The thing is, my coworkers are my friends. Some of them know some of what’s going on. It didn’t stop anyone from going to my boss behind my back to tell her that I’m “slacking”. 

I don’t even want to go back. I feel embarrassed and burdensome. My husband is carrying my weight at home, doing most of the parenting and home care. And now my coworkers are carrying my weight at work, and I just can’t but feel like a total loser. 

My job, without giving away too many details, is customer oriented, but also somewhat physically demanding (lots of lifting, moving dollies with pallets of heavy items, and climbing [not ladders, but on top of product to lift and hand down other product— unsafe while pregnant]). I didn’t feel bad before asking others to take the lead on these parts while I dealt with customers, but now, I’m afraid to even ask for assistance. 

The thing is, I really thought I was doing a good job at work. 

Yesterday felt like a step forward in the beginning of the day, but by the end, it was a big step back. I guess this is just a rant. I just never wanted my personal issues to cross into my work life, and now that they have, I’m more miserable and I don’t know how to deal with it. ",21Aug2018,4,

82,"When diagnosing anxiety, it's all about getting to the bottom of the obstacles that plague your mind, the barriers that stop you from having confidence to function ""normally"" - i.e socialize, work, engage in education, etc. 

But anxiety, for a lot of us, goes beyond the thoughts. For most of us, it is also an abundance of sweating, gastric issues, tremors, insomnia, nausea. 

Treating anxiety is not about a cure. It never will be. You can't cure mental health. It's about coping. Sure, send me to therapy so I can cope with the thoughts, but the thoughts will always be there, ergo so will the physical symptoms of anxiety. How am I expected to ""cope"" with that when so much of it contributes to my anxiety. Excessive sweating? You can bet it's stopped me from engaging in a lot of activities. Gastric issues? I had to drop out of college where the gastric issues actually became such an embarrassment. Tremors? I can barely write a sentence without it looking like a spider has crawled across my paper. Insomnia? Well, let's just say I missed college A LOT because I was never well-rested. 

So why are doctors so dismissive of the physical manifestations of anxiety when, actually, they are the worst part of the illness? The cycle of - I have these symptoms because of anxiety, but these symptoms also make me anxious to be in public situations. 

Anxiety is a PHYSICAL issue too, it extends beyond the mind and should be treated as would, say, irritable bowel syndrome would be. ",21Aug2018,124,

Then in the morning she called me and told me she cut and when I asked why didn't she call me she said that she did, and when I hung up was the phone call, she just didn't tell me. Then I realized that I could've stopped it but I wasn't there when she needed me and I started hyperventilating uncontrollably, I felt really frantic, my head got dizzy and I was feeling nauseous. About 30 to 45 seconds later I told myself to breath and did so deeply and I was fine. It was the only time it ever happened to me so I didn't think about it.

Then just a couple nights ago I was in my bed at night just thinking about stuff, and when I started thinking about abortion I thought that abortion was just a genocide of babies and it was funded by the government and if you came out against it somehow you were the one with bad morality and it happened again only longer, and like last time it stopped when I started breathing deeply.

Before I met him, I had a very good self-image of myself, perhaps a little conceited (so maybe meeting him was a blessing) but when I met him he would constantly put me down, no matter what it would be. My smile, my looks, the way I play a video game, the way I sent  a text, completely stupid things that don’t matter.

I talked to some of my other friends, who are friends with him too, and some of them said that he made them feel the same way. He has since stopped being so harsh and me, and we’re okay and this is mainly because I addressed the issue directly to himself. He will still put me down sometimes though, for instance when I was talking about a girl wanting to message (she was obviously interested and flirty) me, he said this, “She wants to message everyone, you’re not special.” This ticked me off because the girl was very flirty with me, and did not sit well with me.

But at the same time I think about how cool it would be to have friends I could hang out with, maybe I’m just afraid of losing my depression because I think it’s the only thing that makes me interesting?

95,"I've been down for a long while but my thoughts of suicide are becoming increasingly frequent. I dont want to kill myself, but I feel that my life has no meaning and im just so tired of being unhappy. 

I want to see my GP but im scared of telling them that I have frequent suicidal thoughts and that I have self-harmed in the past. I want to carry on with my life and dont want to be assumed to be at risk and have my family informed etc because of this, which is why I have put off going for so long. 

I'm just looking for what will happen if I mention my suicidal thoughts to my GP, is there anything he is required to do by law?

96,I just started the medicine a week ago and since Friday I've been having thoughts of killing myself. I'm trying to tough it out and distract myself but I just can't stop crying. Is this normal? I want to wait two more weeks before saying anything since I was told that the medicine won't kick in till then but I'm not sure if this is a side effect. I start college again on Monday so I'm worried that I'd go down a dangerous slope if I continue like this.,21Aug2018,1,
97,"Hi there!

If You are reading this then ,probably ,You already know what is anxiety and what it can do.

In this article I will not post a definition ,but will tell you my personal experience,feelings and will provide You with my suggestions how to defeat it.

So lets start with ANXIETY–

I red many,many forums and blogs about it ,but everywhere i did find just a definition about it,and you know why? It’s because no one knows how it is unless he or she experienced it themselves. 

Its ok to be a little bit anxious day-to-day about everyday problems ,but  with anxiety disorder You worry too much-its nothing wrong with you ,simply,you are more sensitive than others.


 
If this happens for years and years your nervous system start to overheat and they make a backup plan,they start to protect themself,and in this point You start to feel BAD,very very BAD.

98,"As the title says I'm extremely lost on what's happened to me in the past 3 months.

I was at a great university at the time, studying everyday, meeting new girls at least once every two weeks and most of all so motivated in life.
I even went out to a festival where I saw people close by me take (illegal) medications which I was bothered by but not severely(unsure if relavent to what's happening) 

Even since a month or two ago I've turned from someone who was so confident, so driven and outgoing to someone who doesn't want to leave the house anymore to go out, completly lacking in confidence, headaches often, shy, has now OCD and is scared of everything. My anxiety has never been this bad despite I've had it for awhile it was BARELY noticable 

I am so lost at what has caused this, it doesn't make sense at all to me. The only thing I can think of is that I was drugged BUT the problem being I've never felt so overwhelmed that could possibly be the case. I've been around alot of cleaning sprays and liquids recently which I'm not sure would cause it either. I'm seeing a psych that thinks its related to taking medicine in my past but it's been years and that doesn't seem reasonable to me, so they're also a little dumbfounded. I just would like to find out what's causing this and stop it, I want to be okay again ",21Aug2018,1,
