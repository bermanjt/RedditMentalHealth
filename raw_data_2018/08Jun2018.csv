0,In a state that is horribly underserved. The part of the state that I'm in is even more underserved than the state average. I work in an inpatient unit and need our residents to write my admission orders and even do the intake for me. Literally all I can do is progress notes. With all the current focus on mental health recently you would think they would figure out how to utilize out resources.,08Jun2018,3,
1,"I'm 17 and ever since i was a child i thought i was superior to other people, nowdays i realized how completley wrong this thought is and i repress it and keep repeating to myself  ""everyone is equal, i'm not superior to anyone"" but deep down i know i still have this arrogance. I had friends who told me  how arrogant and selfish i am.. I also have really really high ambitions compared to normal people my age.  I don't know what caused me to be like this. But i know i have this thinking since very early childhood, so maybe its neurological? I also have a lot of difficulty of relating to the emotions of others. people also often say i seem like i don't have emotions. It's not true, i cry when i see really really sad stuff. So i do have them,  I just don't experience them as often like the normal person would. I also look at things very rationaly and objectively i never put emotion in my decision making.  Do i have megalomania? and how can i treat myself?",08Jun2018,1,

Problem is part of me is afraid of leaving the midwest. 
This is where I married, had our kid build my career.

3,"So, I’m starting to get angrier and butt heads with my mom a lot more. I just graduated high school and will be heading off to college in a few months, so I assume this is normal; however, my mom takes her anxiety to such an alarming degree that it kind of scares me, and this is something that’s been happening for a long, long time.

Before I delve into this a little more, I just thought I should note that my mother was subjected to my alcoholic father’s abuse when I was a child. She was verbally and physically harassed by him, and the process of separating from him was extremely difficult, daunting, and tedious. It was at this phase in our lives when I noticed that my mother was more prone to panic attacks, and I think that’s something that resonated with me since I got clinically diagnosed with depression at 14. I’ve had my fair share of panic attacks in my life, but it’s been 5 years since I was diagnosed and medicated, so I’ve had a much easier time containing myself recently; though I can’t say the same for my mom.

I can’t exactly pinpoint what triggers her, but I’ve noticed a surge in my mom’s tendency to overthink things. Whenever something angers her, or whenever she’s having a bad day, all hell breaks loose. She’ll randomly scream at the top of her lungs, she’ll insult me, she’ll slam doors, and sometimes, she even breaks things or throws objects across the room. This really, really scares me, and this anger can arise from the smallest of things. 

Today, I drove to the local library and brought my laptop with me so I could quietly take care of some pre-orientation homework for college. I connected to the wifi there, but when I got home, my mom was extremely upset over the fact that I connected to a wifi network that wasn’t secure. This was a bit of a mistake on my part, so I made sure to apologize an assure her that it wouldn’t happen again. She seemed angry, though, so I started getting a bit defensive. She kept trying to let me know that it was risky to surf the web on an insecure network, and I kept intervening to tell her that I understood what she was saying. Because I kept interrupting her, she started crying and screaming, and ended up running to her room and slamming the door. 

I understand I probably shouldn’t have interrupted her so much, but it’s human nature to get defensive, and I feel like I can’t express my own anger and emotions around her without acknowledging the possibility that she could start doing all of this. Hell, I feel like I can’t even talk to her about any of my problems anymore; it scares me too much. I expressed suicidal thoughts a few months ago, and she reacted by calling me a pussy and saying that I might have ended up a better person if my dad “had just beaten the crap out of me.” Yes, she has apologized and admitted she painfully regretted and didn’t mean what she said, but it still resonates with me to this day. 

The worst part about all of this is that my mom seems to be in a good place right now. She has a boyfriend that she and I love, but whenever he’s not around, I feel scared that she’s going to go off the rails again.

I love my mom to death, and I understand all of this could be a product of built-up stress and overthinking, but I’m almost at my breaking point. I hate waking up every morning worried that my mom could potentially go off the rails again. It’s making me more and more upset every single day, and I have to try harder and harder to contain that sadness.

I don’t know what to do, but I just kind of needed to vent; if you took the time to read all of this, thanks.

4,"I have never posted on this sub before but I hope you can help me work through this tangle in my head. I think my anger is muddling it further. 

I have suffered from depression and anxiety for almost 30 years. I’ve tried all kinds of medicines to make it better before I was finally diagnosed with a mood disorder. It’s only in the past two years that I have finally begin talking openly about depression and mental issues on social media and how harrowing it can be on a person, a family, a relationship, a marriage. I come from a community where everyone puts on a fake happy face. No-one talks about their real problems except as a joke and then brush it off. However, whenever I’ve posted about depression, at least two or three people messaged me privately and disclosed how they too suffer from it but they will never, ever acknowledge it over social media and rarely seek help, despite my cajoling. This encourages me to talk more about my issues so I can get people talking about it or learn how to help others who have it.

Today a friend told me my posts don’t do anything but give others fodder for gossip. I told her I really couldn’t care less about that because I felt I was bringing attention to something my community never talks about. Then she said it would ruin my chances if I ever applied for a job and my future employer saw my posts. 

This gave me pause as I am a divorced woman with no alimony who barely gets by. For the record, I mostly described what depression feels like, how to identify someone going through it and how to help, and when I felt overwhelmed and needed some support. Those posts always only went out to people who I knew. But what she said scared me and I started thinking perhaps I should curb my posts.

But the more I think about it now, the angrier I get. I think 90% of the population in the US is on some kind of antidepressant. I highly, HIGHLY doubt ANYONE is going to deny me employment because I advocate mental illness checks and education. I feel like she‘s basically telling me I’m embarrassing myself by posting what I do. And that makes me angry. 

Am I overreacting? Have I misunderstood? She’s a social butterfly. I don’t move in the same circles. I get that public opinion matters to her. It doesn’t matter to me. But bringing employment into this... I’m irked yet now I wonder. 

What do you think? ",08Jun2018,1,

We would be walking around or even texting and she would randomly say “I’m Jane” and continue like it was nothing. I always respond with “I know” but I don’t know if thats a proper response. Would this be connected to OCD?

Another thing she does is say “guys…” and proceed to say something even though it would just be me and her somewhere. 

I don’t want to ask her what she’s diagnosed with because I feel it would be embarrassing if she doesn’t know what she does. Can anybody help?",08Jun2018,0,

7,"Hopefully you guys don't mind me asking this here and it's not an annoying question lol. 

I was recently diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder, but I'm having a hard time believing it or at least understanding it. 

I really am ugly, I can easily see that when I look at myself. Yet my therapist still diagnosed me with BDD, although I was under the impression that to have the disorder, the flaw(s) had to be nonexistent or very slight. Mine (being my whole face) is very noticeable and obvious, so.. I'm confused to say the least. 

I brought this question up briefly with my therapist, saying that I thought BDD was something where an attractive person thinks they're ugly - he said, ""you don't think that applies to you?"" and I obviously said no. He just said okay, then wrote something down on his papers. He ended the session by basically saying it's something in my brain that makes me see myself differently than others do, and recommended I read a book about the disorder. He never really said my thoughts about my looks were inaccurate though, so idk lol. 

Long story short; is it possible to still have BDD while also being really ugly? 
Thanks in advance to anyone who comments. ",08Jun2018,2,
8,"My son has been a stoner, that I know of, for over a year. I found out about two months ago that he had been taking quite a bit of LSD and 25i NBOME, which had given him HPPD. He was a bit unhappy about it when he told me. He cried a bit. He said he wasn't intending to take psychedelics again but wasn't saying anything too strange at that point. I was upset about this, but at that point it was something he had already done so I tried not to make a big deal out of it since he said he wouldn't touch it again.

He graduated from high school last month. Since then, he was getting high every day. I kept telling him to stop, but he would be stoned every time I'd see him. This past Saturday evening, he ate 300 mg of edibles. He took them after I went to bed. The next morning, he decided to get behind the wheel of a car while in this condition. So, I was understandably upset when he came home so high he could hardly walk. When I told him he had to completely stop, that he had gone too far by driving like that, he yelled at me to stop saying that because it made him want to murder me. He's never been violent in his entire life. His yelling at me like that scared me. I told him he had to go with me right then and there and thankfully, he did. I took him to the ER because he was saying a lot of very strange things. He was telling me he had been to the fourth dimension, that he knew what hell was like, that he knew everything all at once, that he was meant to be used in the fourth dimension for sex, that he wants to die, that nothing has meaning, etc. His behavior was so odd, it was like he was out of his mind. They evaluated him in the ER, put him on a psych hold, and he was transferred to the psych ward at another hospital. He's been there since. I visit him everyday, and he still is saying all of these strange things. He says that he hallucinates, gets messages from God, etc. I asked him if he remembered why he was there and he told me it was because he prayed to Satan. He made a salt pentagram on the floor of his room the night he took the edibles. It was there, so that was true. 

I got him to sign a release so I could find out about his progress there. They tried to start him on risperdol, but he had a bad reaction so they discontinued it. They were supposed to give him another antipsychotic last night (olanzapine). Today, when I asked them what he was given, they said they haven't given him anything else. I'm not sure why either. 

Does anyone here have any experience with this? I don't know what to do. It seems they are just going to keep him there a little while longer and just release him to me without any prescribed medications. His dad was going to take him for treatment in CA but he can't get him an appointment there for three weeks. I am so scared that he is going to hurt himself. ",08Jun2018,4,
9,"Hey everyone, 

I'm looking for some advice on where to go/how to take the first step in getting help. 

I really don't feel like myself, and I really haven't for a number of years. I feel like it's finally coming to a point where I need to properly deal with my mental health. There are a number of factors that I feel have contributed to the change/decline in my mental health status, but I don't feel comfortable getting into those online at the moment. My main issue right now is that I'm having a hard time leaving the house to make it to work most days (and often don't make it, or arrive late). When I get home, I find it hard to get the motivation to get up and do anything, including hobbies that I have enjoyed in the past. I'll just sit down, and suddenly it's midnight and time to sleep again. I feel like I'm wasting valuable time that I could be using to be productive and do things, but I just can't seem to find the motivation or drive to do them anymore. 

I've done a shitty job at keeping in communication with my close friends, and actually haven't spoken to my closest friend in months (who lives in a different province), and it makes me so upset with myself, but I can't bring myself to just reach out and call. 

I do a good enough job at keeping together when I'm in public/with family, but I feel like I'm always on the brink of breaking down in tears (like right now while writing this).

For a little bit of background, I live in a small town (~10 000ish) people in Central Newfoundland (Canada), and my line of work brings me in frequent contact with many different members of the healthcare community. I don't have a family doctor in my community (my family doctor is about 4 hours away), and there are not any walk in clinics that are currently accepting new patients. I don't know where to go from here, but I do know that I have to do something. I just want to be able to start feeling a little bit more like what I remember being happy is, and to be able to get up and go to my dream job and feel motivated, instead of barely making it there, and then being unproductive when I do make it. 

TL;DR: I live in a small town (~10 000) people in Central Newfoundland; I don't feel like myself anymore &amp; don't know where to go for help/how to take the first step. Remaining confidential in this process is ++ important for me. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",08Jun2018,3,

If I let my mind wonder too much it starts recalling things I regret or feel ashamed of or something that I did wrong in some way.

I started talking to a therapist on betterhelp but it's become a bit too expensive and we were only able to do a few sessions, I know that negative thinking is a big hurdle I need to get through. Once my insurance gets figured out I'm going to inquire about seeing a psychiatrist. 

I was just curious if anyone had any ideas what the hell is going on with this. It used to happen maybe once or twice a month but it's like once or twice a day now. I worry someone like my wife or someone I care about is going to see me do this and freak out and think I'm losing it. ",08Jun2018,2,
13,"Hello everyone,

I was recently diagnosed (approx a year ago) with unipolar depressive disorder, which frankly i hadn’t heard of. My doctor (psychologist) described it as bipolar disorder (which he believes i may be afflicted with) only without the mania. I was also diagnosed with social anxiety disorder.

I have been journaling my health as of late and things are concerning me. I have been on 40mg of Lexapro for a little while, which coupled with my drinking habits, has made things very strange for me.

I have been having aggressive mood swings. Sometimes i feel okay, like my happy and funny old self. This can be followed quickly, and sometimes very suddenly with painful waves of depression. My coworkers have commented on my sudden changes in mood, and i haven’t told them about my condition.

My swings can lead me to simultaneous suicidal and homicidal thoughts. I’ve noticed my personality has become more addictive, less empathetic, and i’ve never been capable of showing any emotion.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve become addictive, impulsive, and angry. Other times i’m completely withdrawn, lonely, and sad. Sometimes i can’t formulate sentences around other people; sometimes i can be really outgoing and charismatic.

16,"I have a history of having days where I cry uncontrollably and feel as though I can’t get out of bed, but they are few and far between. Recently, I had to move into my boyfriend’s family’s home for a few reasons. They require that I have my own bedroom as we are not married and they are Christian parents. 3 out of the 6 nights I’ve been here, I have not been able to sleep. I can’t stop crying, I feel as though something is missing. It almost hurts to lay in my bed alone. When I was living in my apartment alone, this would only happen during the weekends when my boyfriend traveled for sports since he typically stayed with me on the weekends. I would scream, kick, cry, it felt totally out of my control. Sometimes I would start biting my arms, knees, grabbing at my skin with my nails and squeezing as hard as I could.

18,"Did you know that women could burn between anywhere 210 to 420kJ during sex and men between 375 to 630kJ (during a 30-minute “intimate affair”)?
But what if you’re simply too exhausted and sex is the last thing on your mind? The answer? “Exercise!” says health expert, fitness coach and athlete, Jody C.
“Regular exercise brings physical and mental benefits to the body. It helps release stress and boosts the release of endorphin hormones; the ones that make us feel good. All these benefits have a direct influence on our sex lives. Exercise also gives us more body confidence and self-esteem, which helps to us to participate in and enjoy sex even more!”
So what if you are starting from scratch, now that you know the truth? What kind of exercise should you do?
“I believe in balance. Even too much exercise can dampen the sex drive and it’s not good for the body on any level as it causes an imbalance in hormones, which results in loss of libido and of course exhaustion. Cardio vascular strength is important, as it will enhance ones ‘durability’ during sex. Excessive sweating and being out of breath can be a huge turn off! Strength training can improve stamina and orgasm intensity, which means longer pleasure and enjoyment. No one wants good sex to end in two minutes, right?
“Other benefits of exercise like flexibility and core strength can help with the adventurous side of sex. So you can do a little more than just the ‘missionary’… it helps to keep things exciting,” she says.
Those who take exercise very seriously often take fitness enhancement products, which can actually influence sex drive in a bad way. “Certain of these products have a very negative effect on sexual well-being. Many affect hormones, such as testosterone and oestrogen. Everything from loss of libido, inability to get an erection or maintain one, to dryness and low self-esteem can be experienced,” explains Jody.
If dryness “down there” is a problem for you, Jody suggests using a great natural, safe lube that can assist you.
“It is made from all-natural ingredients and has been tried and tested significantly without any negative side effects. In fact, it is so safe, you can actually eat it if you’re up for it. Whatever turns you on!”
Exercise in the morning versus exercise in the evenings fortunately makes no difference.
“Just take into account when you have the most energy to get the ultimate results out of a workout and when you and your partner prefer sex. If sex is preferred in the morning, perhaps exercise in the evening would be more realistic and vice versa.
“Remember, it’s not just the sex itself that can benefit the kilojoules burnt. Feeling good after great sex can have a very positive influence on your self-esteem and energy levels. Many find themselves wanting to go for a run or a workout, or wanting to eat healthier – it’s an amazing mental boost for your well being!”",08Jun2018,1,

She is 15 and lives with a strict grandmother, who has zero tolerance for mental health issues. The girl came to me a week ago showed me some pictures she had drawn and then burst into tears. She said she was sad then asked ""why do i hurt my self"" and gave me the knife she uses to cut herself (a fucking rusty craft knife) 

I have taken it to the school and while well meaning, it seems little will be done as the grandmother is blocking attempts to take her to a psychologist the next town over, fesring reputation damage. The teachers say she trusts me and i am now brought to every ""meeting"" they have to discuss ""why"" she is sad. Yesterday she gave me a heart breaking little journal stating ""something makes me sad without reason. Something that made  me run away from it by hurting myself"", im afraid of my body"", I'm scared of tomorrow"" and ""i want to disappear from what i am"" and so much more.

25,"My girlfriend has very complex mental health issues. She went to a psychiatrist before we met and she told me that they made an assessment based off her family’s mental health records and not her, herself. So she requested to see someone else and has been placed back on the NHS waiting list again.
We know she’s having another assessment in September. However her mental state is declining quite rapidly due to a series of events in her personal life.

I know self diagnosing isn’t a good thing to do but for the purpose of helping you understand her, she practically ticks off every box as having borderline personality disorder. 
When something upsets her she turns very angry and pulls in all of the other things that she’s been unhappy about over the last couple of months, and looks for someone to blame and take it out on. And that is always me. She shouts at me and sometimes physically harms me, (squeezes my arms really tight is a common one), I’ve told her she isn’t allowed to do that or take out her feelings on me. In response she turns to self harm, which obviously I don’t like her doing that. I’ve stopped her before instead of accepting her choice to do that. That was naive on my half. Now when she self harms I often feel like she does it to spite me as she tells me in advance such as, ‘I am going to make myself throw up until I can’t throw up any more’ or ‘I’m going to take all the pills in the house’.

I can’t talk her down, or say try looking at the situation like this, or even try to distract her from her thoughts by asking if she wants to do go out and something else or watch tv. I get a blunt ‘no’ in response. I know it’s not her fault as much as it is that she has bad coping mechanisms. She’s lovely most of the time, but I can’t deny it’s putting a massive strain on our relationship. I want to support her and show her that she can rely and trust me to be on her side and stick by her, but she pushes me away and tries to make me angry and rile me up for a reaction, I’m not sure why. She also refuses to take responsibility for her actions, by saying but so and so can do that so that must mean I can do.

My boss was great and my co-workers were super welcoming, but I guess being in this new social environment really made me uncomfortable (compared to school where I am very comfortable/outgoing around my friends and even to people I've just met). 

I would always come home after a day at work or after a social event for work and obsess over everything I did and how awkward I was, and how the people around me responded, and how they must think worse of me now. These thoughts were constant and seemed to almost take over mind, all this anxiety caused me to keep thinking ""I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself"" 

Now I am back working this job again, because I do truly love it. But I'm having the same problem. I don't mean to sound overdramatic  or anything, but this has been causing me a lot of distress latley. During most of the year I would maybe have a maximum of two times per day that I would think that ""I hate myself"". Compared to the last hour in which I've thought ""I hate myself"" over 8 times.

28," 20M, I feel like I've hit a brick wall. I have something akin to anxiety and depression (nothing officially diagnosed mind you) and I feel like I've always been pretty good at dealing with things though. Lately I've been struggling to keep up and I feel like I'm walking a tight rope in terms of my mental health. I work full time and I'm applying to a RN program this fall. Work is tiring but it keeps me occupied. Working graveyard shift as a nursing assistant is wonky but I don't hate it and pay is decent. My friends joke that my sleep schedule is fucked and it gets me paranoid that maybe it IS having some physiological effect on me. But that's not what's stressing me.

My mom died about 6 years ago, last year it came out that my brother is a heroin addict, my dog of 10 years died, and I'm only starting to realize that my father is a serious alcoholic. The stuff with my mom I feel affected me more when I was younger and I don't think school provided a counselor who was necessarily equipped to deal with that sort of stuff but overall I feel okay in regards to her death. She was my closest family member but I remember her fondly and don't feel torn up about it. Mostly I just wish she could see me as an adult and that I could talk to her as an adult.

My older brother (23) got into drugs when he was in high school which isn't so bad to me because I did some stuff in high school too like pot and one time I did mushrooms and he and I were part of similar groups in high school but I found out last year that he got into heroin and that his current girlfriend is addicted to it too. I tried being supportive and tried getting him into a program but his girlfriend tells blatant lies and is incredibly manipulative. My brother and her became increasingly aggressive, slamming doors, a broken window, cracked the wood on our front door (my brother claims he closed it too hard but there were marks on the outside as if someone was pounding on it), arrested for shoplifting, used needles in the bathroom, needle caps on the front porch, garage, bathroom, etc. She all but threatened to kill me, my brother tried to fight me two or three times; in others words, really fucking unpleasant? I was scared shitless and frustrated and I called the cops which I regret to some extent but I didn't know what else to do. They left the house about 8 months ago and it feels like I'm constantly afraid of them coming back.

This entire time with my brother, I was 19 and basically the one in charge of getting him help. My dad would just yell at him and treat him like shit and refuse to acknowledge that his behavior was pushing him away. He wouldn't help me with talking or trying to do an intervention, he kept letting my brother and his girlfriend come back after they moved out, and wouldn't put his foot down in regards to drugs in the house.

Since then mine and my dad's relationship has gotten better, I haven't spoken to my brother but he texts my dad occasionally. My dad told me that my brother was in town and was maybe coming home yesterday night. I felt all my anxieties and fears kind of unfolding and I told him I was scared shitless. And he just started yelling at me and belittling my feelings telling me to man up and stand up straight and how he and I were only fighting because my brother's gf causes ""chaos where ever she goes"" completely ignoring my concerns, calling me a piece of shit. I just bailed out and went for a drive. While I was out he texted me saying ""I told your brother not to bring the whore. Happy?"" Well, obviously not because I don't want you calling her a whore and making him angry. I didn't respond though. When I got home he came into my room to say ""have you seen her brother?"" and when I said ""no"" he said ""me neither because you fucked me over"" and slammed my door shut. I feel like I've lost my family. It's so hard for me to feel empathy any more for my dad or my brother or to forgive them when I know it's their addictions causing these problems. But I don't see myself having a relationship with either of them in the future outside of some spontaneous change. We don't have any extended family and my dad is basically the only one I had left. And what's left of that just feels like it got snipped.

It feels like my life is divided into two parts: the new parts and ""The Good Ol' Days"". More and more things from the TGOD are disappearing (my family, the house's maintenance is deteriorating, my mom's old car broke, our pool is a foot deep algae mosquito pit, my dog died) and I'm just finding myself overwhelmed with bleakness. It feels like an aura of decay is following me and that things are just breaking down. I miss feeling mostly happy and when things felt ""clean"" for lack of a better word. Everything just feels dirty nowadays.

tl;dr i live with my dad, he's and alcoholic, blames me for my brother who's addicted to opioids for for leaving home, just feeling desolate right now",08Jun2018,2,

30,"I woke up at 6am. I was supposed to go to MacRitchie reservoir park at 10am with a friend I knew online though Reddit. When I looked at my phone, I saw a message from him saying that he couldn't make it for the outing later. I said ok and I went back to sleep again.

I woke up in the afternoon. I did not have lunch prepared by my mother. Therefore, I drove to West Coast McDonald drive-thru. I wanted to be independent. I wanted to be able to buy my own lunch even when my mother did not prepare lunch for me. Otherwise, I would look down on myself and felt useless — for being too dependent on my mother. My dog Moo Moo wanted to follow me, but I couldn't bring it along — I was going outside to buy lunch, so I couldn't bring my dog out; I won't be able to multi-task.

When I was outside driving, I learned to peep through my dark glasses. I felt safe and assured that no one was looking at me. I still had that fear though — maybe I was too dependent on my mother. Luckily, I still dared to buy lunch driving through the McDonald drive-thru — I couldn't buy lunch from food courts or hawker centres yet because my fear was still there.

It was a fine afternoon. I loved to drive to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) ferry terminal on a fine afternoon. Ten years ago, I used to be very afraid of coming to this place. I was going to the army myself without my mother and I have limited social skills, so I was often being bullied in the army. Nowadays, I liked to see army people going to the ferry terminal — I loved that nostalgic feeling; I was not the one going to army anyway, hehe :P

At night time, I had a relapse, because I wanted to work badly and yet many staff (my occupational therapist, psychiatrist, and others) who knew me temporarily do not allow me to work. I am a very violent person — when I was not wearing my dark glasses and earphones and I heard laughter, I would immediately punched that person who laughed. This is the reason the staff at Institute of Mental Health (IMH) Singapore did not dare to allow me to start working yet. I was angry with myself for having such behavior and I told myself that I was going to join the empowerment programmes first, and after many sessions, I was still not violent and only then will the staff allow me to work.",08Jun2018,2,

32,"It doesn't happen all the time, and certainly not with every guy who likes me. But the last guy I only knew for 2 days while overseas and the one before lasted for about a year. It's the same this time, but as always it's special and different. 

We meet and I feel an instant connection. I'm an attractive girl so they're interested. After spending a matter of hours together I'm happy he's on my mind and the fantasies, narratives start of our romance and life together. 

To them, I'm the pretty sweet girl they've just met. But to me it's more than that and I'm invested. 
If I can hold out, I manipulate them into having strong feelings for me and it feels good. If my emotions are too strong, as always happens eventually, I suffocate them and they back away. 
This is always absolutely devastating, whether it's been 2 days or several months. It feels like genuine heartbreak. I can't stop crying, I feel sick to my stomach, I can't imagine feeling the same way about anyone else again. 

Now, I've had a healthy relationship before. 
I've struggled with depression and anxiety before but generally I'm a pretty normal girl. I have a decent job, a couple of good friends, I like to have fun. 
But this, this doesn't feel healthy or normal. 

This time we met a few weeks ago. He was so sweet, and everything he said and did told me he was falling for me straight away too and it was special. Fast forward to now and I'm crying and worrying that he's seeing other girls or he was dishonest with me or just changed his mind and it hurts so much I can't stand it.

What's wrong with me, why do I feel like this? How do I make it stop?

34,"This is a question about getting a private plan, not about getting on disability. 

A friend of mine is self\-employed and wants to get long\-term disability insurance.

About 5.5 years ago, he spent a few days in a psychiatric hospital after his father died. He was misdiagnosed with having a mental illness (it didn't occur to them it was merely stress and grief. They labeled him as being bipolar) but the damage is done and that is in his record. He hasn't been on any medication or in need of therapy since that period.

I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Schizophrenia in 2015 and since then been talking Setraline and Aripiprazole. Things starred to improve thereafter with mild incidents here and there. But then I realized that my ability to think clearly started dwindling, like difficulty to concentrate. So I stopped the medication since a couple months (I didn't ask my psychiatrist for this). Now the symptom seems to return and right now I am sort of in a middle of extreme paranoia and a lot of stress. I don't want to go back to medication as it will again affect my thinking ability. If any other alternative solution exists, please recommend. I really need to get out of this. It is mentally very draining and I cannot study. It also affecting all walks of my life. It has taken immense effort to write this message down. Please help me.",08Jun2018,1,
37,"I didn't really know where else to explain this because it seems a little obscure to tell but I really want to know what to call this that my friend has and how to talk to her about it. Her family also has noticed/tried to talk to her about this issue but she stops listening instantly or cuts it short, so they've asked me to talk to her as well because she listened to me a little but more. 
So my friend is the same age as me, we both graduated the same year four years ago, but since then she has not done much. since high school she has become almost a compulsive spender, but not really clothes and material items, more of health products, and organic foods. her diet/living style is completely impacting her family and their economic state because of how much she spends. I'm not saying her being vegan is the problem (i am also vegan, and so is her whole family) but when she goes to shop at the store, she has to get the most expensive food items, and a lot of times her fresh food goes to waste from being unused. she also buys very very expensive herb supplements to help her with her digestive issues (which i might think her 'severe' digestive issues are blown out of proportion, as she has a reason that she's always sick and needs these healthy living supplements for everything). not only is the food issue a problem, but she will not eat any other food unless she cooked it. She does not eat her mom's food, her sister's food, even vegan food that i make her. even when i tell her that i did not use oils, used all organic, she still does not eat it. she does not want to go out to eat at vegan restaurants either, which is upsetting to not only me (i want to take my friend out to eat sometimes you know?) but also her mom who wants to be able to take her out for her birthday to eat. we are in another country right now visiting her family and they accommodated to all of our diets but she still refuses to eat their food and is spending a lot of (her mom's) money to feed only herself. it comes off as very rude and selfish. 
she spends a lot of money going to the chiropractor, acupuncture, massages, needless checkups, etc etc. the reason why this is an issue is because she does not have a job and is spending her mother's money. she has siblings that try to talk sense to her but she does not listen and her mother is very passive and afraid to hurt their feelings. most recently they have come into money issues and have been really budgeting to the bone in  a way for her to keep living her lifestyle, but they are running out of money. her mother comes to me at certain points and says to try to pursued her to go to community college with me, to get a job, other things etc. but when i do talk to her she makes excuses that she's ""signing up"" or ""looked at it"" and kind of talks her way out of it. 
There's a lot of things I can say here but down to it, I some things I speculate is that she is still having a hard time adjusting after her father passed away (2009 I believe?), she is afraid of change, moving on, and trying new things (no job, no college, stays at home all day unless to go shopping), and is maybe a bit of a hypochondriac. she is very very smart and is very into nutrition and has gotten an online certificate in nutrition but spent all that money to get it and not do anything with it, or even start a nutritional business in a way. she has invested into projects that she did not have a lot of knowledge in and has wasted what sounds like thousands of dollars, but has not/does not feel bad about the amount of money she is burning through. I want to talk to her but I also want to talk to her mom as well to stop enabling her and setting her up for failure in the future. I'm very worried about her, her future, and her family because they are trying very hard to get through to her but it seems like she has been babied her whole life and is used to that, so a transition of any sort is very scary to her and she refuses it. I don't know what to call what she has or how to approach her the right way and was hoping to get some help. sorry this is so long. if you have anymore questions about her I'm willing to answer.",08Jun2018,1,
38,"Hi guys i have one problem. I feel like there is one button in my life that is activated and cant be turned off.

I always give my best to be good with people.

Even my family starting fight,verbal fight so close like they want hit me in face i dont speak word because i know they are angry and that i know i didnt do anything wrong so it doesnt bother me.

I dont get angry back i dont say even word, because argue with angry raging person is pointless. 

( My thoughts are)

""Whats wrong you are angry about something and throwing it on me,but feels like you talking like you are hurted from your deepest soul and you want throw that pain on me so i can feel it too""

but im not psycotherapist i cant talk with anyone in this way that would be rude

So people like to insult me a lot  and make fun of me when i was skinny and weak. 

Thats why i never wanted friends, or to be in contact with family when i found job and live alone.

I live in small town , all jobs i had, worked for very low cash i was doing well but i was quiet because i didnt want ruin anything or say anything wrong that will hurt anyone. Mostly it was job for 10euro/8h for week. 

I rather choised to sit and wait instead sit on machine or track and do what boss didnt tell me.

But instead i got different reaction. My bosses (for real) were bullied me verbaly, all jobs i were doing. Then that lowed my motivation work for A LOT. 

Then when after that my coworkers would come and told me why are you so slow you dont do anything you dont speak you shouldnt work here. ""we hope boss didnt hurted you, but you know....Hes right, you must do it better be stronger be faster"" 

(but will still have right to hold you like doll on strings when we want for your poor 10e cash)

If we are talking how we feel, then we should sit together and speak like we know each other for long and i should have right to tell my boss i can report him in police because he was verbal bullying me and i recorded all that on my phone. 

But all of this for physical job for 250e for 1 month is too much. 

Then ,i dont trust friends. You found friend very,very spontaneous. 

Life give you a human that is real friend for you when you dont search it. I never had best friend and when i had one he broke my trust very fast. 

He was sleeping with only girl i had in life and i was dating with. My other ""best friend"" whatever he called me to hangout, he said we will be alone. 

Then he called his friends i see first time. 

That wasnt problem if they didnt drugged me until i had to vomit,

 And again that same friend always call me to hangout and say we will be alone, then he called  those his friends who i barely know and they hurt me, like wait me to get high then drop liquid on me, punch me on back, verbal bully. 

If thats what i need for that one friend then better leave him and try to find another one.,but then again i trust him and he come with words ""are you gay why we must be alone, whats wrong?"" then he call other his friends again and broke that edge of trust which make me feel i dont want be honest with him and friendly if he doesnt give it back. 

I never had girlfriend or friends because i will be quiet until everything stops and i feel trust wire , but people who kill trust broke trust in me for other people,

 I think destiny  give you friends and everything NICE spontaneous when you dont expect it. 

I write this because i dont  have real friends, not even girlfriend and i am 23yr old, my only option is to go on college end studies, find decent job and live alone and find my own peace ",08Jun2018,1,

41,"There is someone who I don't really speak to much anymore but I hold them dearly in my heart. While this person was in my life, he was very depressed, isolated, workaholic, lost. This person has suffered abuse in his early life which has set him up for lifelong depression and addiction issues.

In light of the recent highly publicized suicides, this person has crossed my mind many times, mainly because he follows a similar template - successful on the outside but deep down bitterly unhappy, emotionally isolated, etc. I imagine there are many people in his life who would be shocked to find out the demons he battles. I'm one of the few people he has ever opened up to.

My heart is telling me that I need to reach out somehow, but it's a delicate subject. I don't want it to come across as ""omg, how are you feeling, I have been worried about you and thinking about you"" because that is patronizing and insulting. Instead, I want to send a simple, kind, geniune, unloaded message that lets this person know they are in my thoughts and I hope they are well. That, in case he is in a dark place again there is someone out there who cares about him on a human to human level.

I am probably overthinking this but I have never really been seriously suicidal so I have trouble putting myself in those shoes. So I'd like input from people who have been there how someone can reach out without being assuming, intrusive, or nosy.  Thank you",08Jun2018,2,

44,I'm just curious. I have really strong predatorial instinct for animals but never for humans. And it's usually the appropriate animals that look like smaller defenseless or like typical animals people eat. I generally am very carnivorous in my preference in food. So I generally am very aggressive to animals and I enjoy committing acts of violence against them. But never to humans or says dogs or other animals I wouldn't generally see as vulnerable. It spike my adrenaline which sets off my dopamine. But my dopamine is asily set off by anything honestly. Anyhow I read that humans don't have predatorial instincts usually. But I know I do. I generally crave meat much more than I do vegetables or fruits etc.... I also grew up watching nature shows since I was 2. And my mom never hid where meat came from. I was reading how it's usually thought to have an instinct this way means something is wrong. I don't get why it would be wrong if humans are supposed to be omnivores don't they usually crave both meat and fruits.

45,"This might be long, apologies.

So, after a hellish bout of depression which lasted a few months, which then kicked my anxiety disorder into overdrive, I was put on medication. I was really hesitant and nervous to take medication. I wasn't really concerned about the stigma, but mostly concerned about developing unbearable side effects, and how it might change me for the worst. I was put on 10mg escitalopram (lexapro). After a hellish 2 weeks or so, I finally started feeling a little less anxious and stuff. I started to feel hopeful that my medication was working and that through my talk therapy and medication, I was on the path to healing. It's been since January 1st that I started meds. I feel like I was expecting more. I mean, i'm not as panicky and hopeless as I was, but I still get a little anxious every now and then. I also don't know if it's helped my depression. I'll try and explain further;

Throughout the 8 years i've been dealing with this anxiety disorder, my anxiety episodes kind of come and go. I find that i'll be ""okay"" for a few months, and then i'll be hit by major anxiety. It usually passes after a few weeks or so, but this past episode in December wasn't going away. I was having nightmares, waking up having anxiety attacks, and would have to take an ativan. If I wasnt at work, i'd have nothing to do, and when im bored and stuck at home, that's when the anxiety is the worst. I just wasn't able to shake the anxiety. Everything set it off. But after 2 weeks of the meds, my anxiety tapered away to a manageable level.

But now, im wondering if the medication is even doing anything, or if it's just that this anxiety episode is going away. I still have dark thoughts, and sometimes the thought of dying comforts me (even though im too scared to commit suicide). I still kind of don't get that much pleasure out of a lot of stuff, still kind of feel numb, and my libido hasnt changed much (I know lexapro causes sexual dysfunction, but I was dealing with it before, so I don't know if it's back to normal or just the meds killing my libido and ability to orgasm). I almost feel exactly like how I feel between anxiety episodes. I do feel like my anxiety is a little dulled and numbed, but I still sometimes feel like my sanity and mental well being is on the edge of a knife. How do I know if the meds are even doing anything? Im too scared to taper off because of withdrawal, and im nervous about switching medications because I seem to not have any side effects with lexapro. I'm alright now, but I feel like I could be better. But I also don't want to switch meds, and wind up worse off. I really can't go back to where I was in December. I'm kind of lost right now...

51,"(Tl/dr) How do I (35m) help a family member (35m) who’s mentally ill whom I don’t respect and who’s taken advantage of me and those I love? (Tl/dr)

Located near Toronto, Canada. 

My (35m) cousin (35m) is clearly mentally ill. Depression most likely. He’s got abandonment issues from his dad fucking off at a young age (around 13yrs old). Mommy never said I love you enough (despite giving him money, a roof to live under in an amazing and luxurious house, a car, multiple jobs etc). She wasn’t exactly the best example in the relationship department but she tried to do the best she could otherwise. He recently got dumped. This has now become the whole families problem. We’re having to rearrange our lives to console him lest he hurt himself. Yesterday was the last straw, I think, for me. 

After getting into a fight with his recent ex, who’s not helping matters by trying to remain “friends”, he wigged out, took 8 anti anxiety pills, left the house into a forest, called my fiancé and basically she had to talk him down and listen to him ramble as he was stumbling around, falling into creeks, claiming “I can’t feel my legs”, being incoherent, etc. I had to call 911 and rush out of the house to try and find him, until the cops told me to go back home and let them search. As my fiancé is trying to compose herself and get information out of him, she’s relaying the info to me over text, and I’m relaying it to a police officer who got called to my house, who’s relaying it to other officers in the field trying to track him down.

Eventually he was found. When the cops arrived he was still on the phone with my fiancé. She could hear him perk up immediately and act like he was perfectly fine. Speaking clearly. Standing up fine, etc. My fiancé called me after and she was hysterical. Truly traumatized. She thought she might have to hear him OD over the phone. Was this piece of shit putting on a show the whole time for attention? I suspect it’s somewhere in between.

He got taken to the hospital, where he told them he was perfectly fine and only took 2 pills. Tried to get them to let him leave. I sent the screenshots of the messages my fiancé was sending me about what he was saying to her to his mother who was at the hospital. She showed the doctor and they were enough to get them to hold him for 72hrs. He’s there now. Apparently crying and wailing. Saying shit like “nobody cares about me”, “my family doesn’t care”, “my friends don’t care” etc.

This fuckin POS can’t see how the whole family has had to rearrange ourselves for him this last month since he got dumped. Constantly consoling him. Taking him out to try to get his mind off it. My mother took him in cause he’s got nowhere else to live. My moms too old to be dealing with this drama and I fear it’s taking a toll on her mentally. She’s got enough problems of her own, including having to take care of a mentally handicapped adult daughter 24/7. The whole family is in constant contact trying to handle this. He’s cut off his mom and his sister because a therapist told him they were the root of his issues. He asked his mother for an apology for not showing him more love and his mom (also stubborn) refused to apologize for doing the best she could and proving him a life of luxury.

I’m sensitive to mental illness, I truly am. But I also believe someone can simultaneously be mentally ill as well as being an asshole. I also believe mental illness is contagious. His inability to get a hold of himself is directly causing fractures within my family and directly traumatizing the rest of us. What my fiancé had to go through yesterday was inexcusable, imo. We’ve all tried our best to help him. To listen without judgment. To reassure without pressure, etc. We’ve acted accordingly and spoken accordingly. What else can we do, lest we hurt ourselves in the process?

I’ve decided to no longer reach out. If he reaches out to me I’m going to calmly and sternly tell him that his sickness is contagious. I have tried to help him but he has to help himself. I’ll tell him to no longer contact me or my fiancé unless he’s healthy. He has the resources to seek professional help, especially now after this hospital admission. It’s not fair for us to suffer because of his illness.

Of course I fear this is just another form of abandonment, but it didn’t come to this until his actions started causing direct suffering and trauma to me and those around me. I recognize he could hurt himself. I recognize it could be fatal. I truly don’t know how else I can try to help him avoid that path. If the unthinkable happens I will grieve and cry and be sad for a long time, but it’s a reality I’m prepared to face, while being able to look in the mirror and feel no guilt - only sadness and sorrow.",08Jun2018,1,

About a year ago   I found out my mother was murdered by a drug dealer with a Jeffrey dahmer fetish. A short time later I shipped to fort Jackson. I spent a month 1/2 with 30 guys that fought a lot  poor health. Almost no sleep and my own thoughts. You can guess how that went but essentially I was just discharged for having paranoid hallucinations and got an epts for ""unspecified psychotic disorder ""    that was a year ago.

54,"Hey everyone! I'm a long timer lurker and first time poster! After hearing about Anthony Bourdain and other famous people I realized mental health impacts everyone. I have been diagnosed with Dissociative PTSD and I have been in counseling 3 times a week for the last two months. 

A little about me i'm 35 Hispanic and I was diagnosed with PTSD in my first session of therapy. By my third session I was diagnosed with dissociative PTSD. It was hard to hear about my diagnosis, but at least I knew I wasn't crazy. So many people think mental health means you're crazy and people that don't support you distance themselves. I felt it was such a big need that I took two months of leave without pay (LWOP). Along with two months of LWOP I decided to see my therapist 3 times a week. It has been the hardest two months in my life and I have seen and done some good and bad shit in my life. 

Each one of us will go through this moment different times in our life. Some of us may understand and move past it, but some may be so consumed with mental health that we can't heal. Unfortunately, I hated when people told me what I needed to do to get better. This is MY journey, NOT YOURS. So, I say to you, this is your journey, no one else, but you don't have to do it alone. 

What helped me through some trying times was r/GetMotivated. Music, Talking, sharing, texting, writing, and funny enough the gym. I'm almost 300 lbs and going to the gym I would hear a song and just start sobbing. I can look back and share it, but at that moment it was hard. 

As I sit here typing this I know it's hard to either reach out, share, or trust someone with this. It's easy to be anonymous and reach out because it's hard to be vulnerable, and trust me I hate vulnerability. Luckily, I have a great circle that has helped me through my tough times and I know some or most people don't have a good positive circle to help them. If you need someone to talk to, text, or just listen without judgment or advice please send me a DM or message me on KIK pinupslife. 

This can be the most terrifying or loneliest time of your life, but you don't have to do it alone. Reach out to me, to someone, but don't hold it in. ",08Jun2018,0,

Looking back I feel horrible, because yes, I was whining about my own problems of frustration. However she thinks I did it for attention. That was not my intent at all. I realize now I overreacted and I try to explain how she caught me at the wrong time. Of course, she thinks that is an excuse. I just don't even know if there's a proper way to explain my behavior.

Around five years ago I suddenly stopped enjoying things. One day I was fine, and the next I was literally incapable of getting any real emotion from anything. I went to my doctor and he basically said 'yeah it sounds like depression', but since it was already starting to improve he suggested waiting it out to see if it wasn't just caused by stress (I was about to sit important exams at the time). It did continue to get better, but I still don't think that it's completely resolved. I don't feel motivated a lot of the time, and some days can't even feel anything from music.

I have problems with anger and frustration. I just graduated college and I cannot find a job, it is hard, it frustrates me and it just makes me angry. The labor market is full of fools that don’t even look at apps and it just angers me.

I have been a frustrated and angry person for a long time. I just feel nothing goes the way I want to. This happens in life goals, in looking for jobs and in romantic life. No girlfriend, no jobs, no money. This is way I like music like hardcore punk and death metal. It just makes me feel less lonely in frustration and anger.

I have been a privileged person: my family loves me but I still feel misunderstood by many. Sometimes I just do not feel privileged with the fact that it costs me to have a fucking job and I want money to buy whatever I want to buy and to depend on myself monetarily.

I do many things to mask these feelings: I hang out with friends, my dog, my family, I smoke marijuana (it is controlled and I do get less anxious, sad and angry from it), masturbate, go to the gym a lot, eat well, listen to A LOT of music and watch TV shows and movies.

I feel like I have a lot of things and talent and good things in me but sometimes bad feelings just get to me because of frustration. I need some kind words to assure me everything will be okay, and I want to know some advices.

66,"This is in regards to ADHD, but it seems to be turning into depression and burn-out.

Summary: Thanks to the encouragement of my 2 therapists, I decided I need medication. My general dr was willing to prescribe it only once (even then, she was very hesitant) to help me know if it works. It did, well mostly. For a little while, I felt human. I was able to appreciate the birds and little things in life, and I enjoyed doing projects when normally I am tormented by them.

But after 2 weeks of calling and visiting places, no psychiatrist is willing to help me. Either they are too booked, don't want to deal with my ADHD/Asperger's, or they push me off to another clinic (which I already called and/or visited).

So I am denied the fucking human experience – that is, I am denied the medication that helps me feel human. I've never thought about self harm before, but I find these thoughts piercing me (""What if marks helped them understand my internal pain?"") which I've never had before, and I'm not at risk for harming myself, but the presence of these thoughts is sign that I need help!

So I don't know what to do. For what it's worth I'm married, male, in my 30s, and I am in California. During my 30 years on this goddamn planet I have done some amazing things, I have lots of hope and potential. However my ADHD has caused our savings to deplete (impulsive ""fuckit!"" evenings out to dinners or events to escape my overactive brain) and it has caused us become late on most of our bills, it has caused great distress for the company I work for – risking the company itself – and we are being kicked out of this apartment in 1 month due to remodelling, and we have no savings nor place lined up to move into...

68,"I need help in understanding depression and how I can be supportive to my wife as she struggles with suicidal thought and erratic behaviour. Here's a little introduction to our story. Since meeting she's always battled with on/off depression and we've got by through it all together. She aspires to be midwife and is starting her course in September, hopefully all things going to plan. I, myself am in the military and I'm based 12 hours away from her and our 8 month old child. It is since having a our child and me subsequently being drafted elsewhere that her struggles have started to get out of hand. I realised this last weekend when i came home to see them, our house was a state, dishes piled high, curtains all closed, both my daughter and her were a tad unkempt. I didn't think too much into that as she's a new mother and there are far more important things to focus on than cleaning. I thought i'd take her out to take her mind off everyday stresses and have a bit of us time. This is where I went wrong as soon as we were out she was drinking to excess, went off the rails and ended up doing cocaine out of the blue. It was a nightmare, after asking what was going on, she broke down, she was in hysterics the whole night saying she just can't do it anymore and how she doesn't want to live. I was out my depth I got her family involved, told my Divisional officer who has given me 3 weeks compassionate leave. After telling her family she has began to despise me, saying I've made everything worse and she refuses to see them now as she's embarrassed. The more I try to help the more she pushes me away, calls me controlling as I'm trying to get her to cut back on drinking as that's a known depressant. I've contacted her GP and Health visitor. I want to help her, I really do, I just need help. I don't know how to approach the situation without making it worse. At the moment I'm taking care of our daughter, making sure my wife eats, drinks plenty of fluid, try talking to her about it  to which i get rebuffed and told how much she hates me as I ruined her life by telling her family and the GP.

Yet, I was really numbed to things and even though I was in love and had a boyfriend - I honestly wasn't feeling too much. I've described it at living at 5/10. 

But now that I'm off them - though I feel terribly anxious or depressed (my downs are 2-3/10) - I get these brief periods of feeling happy (which I didn't get while on medication). My anxiety has come back and I need constant validation at work or by friends. I feel like I'm a monster. I feel like the time I was on my meds I was just living in an illusion - a fantasy.

70,"I just need to get this off my chest,

I am celebrating my birthday in 10 minutes and I am contemplating about either killing myself or going into psychiatric hospital. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression but apparantly I am good at masking these things. 

Ten years ago my mother, only parent I still had, was diagnosed with cancer. She did not take this very well and was depressed, suicidal throughout the whole disease. I stopped going to college and went back home to live with her and take care of her. It was not an easy time but I did what I had to do. We lived in the house I grew up in. Just outside of a major town. She decided for me that I was going to start a family there and live there. I hated the place and never liked living there. When she passed away the last thing she told me I was an asshole. Fun thing to live with. 

After she passed I moved in with my ex\-girlfirend. Who suffered from severe trust issues and constantly thought I was cheating on her ( which I was not ). She kicked me out 4\-5 times untill I said enough and moved back to the house I lived with mom. The house I hated but now owned. Everyday I lived there was a day I would wake up and get as far away as I could or get drunk to forget.

After a while I moved in with my grandmother in town. Living in the old room of my grandfather. Not the easiest but better as being alone. My anxiety has slowly been going up but my family thinks I am making it up. I now live in a lie were I just drink to forget and everybody around me thinks I am doing ok. 

I still own the house and it is still full of all our old stuff. I can hardly afford to own it and have been getting in to debts. My family doesnt help with the house and nobody except for me has been there. Now I get a call today my waterpipes bursted and my cellar is flooded.

71,"In the past month I've experienced 2(.5) incidents that seem inexplicable, and the fact that I have little clue as to what is going on scares me a lot.

The two experiences I've had happened without warning, and I'll try my best to explain it, though I'm not sure it can all be transposed via text:

All of a sudden I felt paranoid--not in the sense of people watching me or being in danger or anything, but just a general unease at everything. I also feel almost distant from anything, as in I would walk and see people's faces but feel a strange sense of alienation. Everything seemed ""blurry"" not in terms of vision but just not being able to focus on one thing. IDK if focus is even the write word but everything just felt vaguely off (hence the paranoia). 

The second time, which was just an hour ago and I'm still feeling a bit shaken and rattled and perhaps still feeling the effects of, I recognized the signs as it started and began to panic at being about to panic. 

I also want to mention that both times I experienced a tightening in the chest, and repeated attempts to burp because perhaps I ate too much food. I'm also not sure but both times the weather was overcast and when I walked outside (though these bouts started indoors) I didn't feel good...

I had to repeatedly check my heartbeat to make sure I was breathing alright. I don't know if this is a physiological thing where my heartrate perhaps slows down then all of a sudden I get nervous about that and panic and thus my heartrate increases to panic mode, or if it's psychological/mental where the panic starts first and then that manifests in my breathing.


Talking to people definitely helps and perhaps helps decrease the feeling of sudden aloneness. I don't want to call it loneliness because I don't miss anyone per se, but everything just feels slightly foggy.

IDK if this post gives what I'm feeling justice and I don't know if it sounds as bad as it truly feels. I'm also scared that in the future it will get worse/happen more frequently. I don't know how I'll react in the future e.g. suicide (extreme and I really hope not). So far it's just been this need to just truly run away.
