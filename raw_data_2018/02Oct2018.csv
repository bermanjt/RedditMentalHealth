2,"Okay, back story- I (19F) have been diagnosed with high functioning ADHD, and BPD, and Bipolar type 2 disorder. 

I need help. I hate admitting that I do, but I think I really do. 

I have severe abandonment issues, I have an amazing, loving, caring, handsome man who I almost feel as if I don’t deserve and I’m so scared of him leaving me, he has 3 other times for short amounts of time but it really messed with me, it completely broke me. He is a really good person, I can’t stress that enough, I love him to bits. I used to be up at night stressing and spiralling into holes of why I’m not good enough, and it becomes this irrational figment of my imagination of where I think about situations of other women who are better than me, or thinking about how worthless and stupid I am, and how I just don’t deserve to be in anyone’s life, and ended up going into a secret deep depression which I didn’t tell anyone about, it only really hit at night time when I was sleeping.

Very rarely on the odd nights this happens to me now. I’m very happy with my progress, but this is just the tip of my problems.

I can’t hold down a job. I haven’t been able to hold a job for longer than 3 months before I get laid off, this is a huge problem for me, all I want is to have a stable 9-5 job but I can’t seem to crack the code. This breaks me because I give my all into these jobs, I don’t miss days, even when I feel like it might kill me to get out of bed. I’m very good at putting on a happy face and rolling with it, but I’m currently unemployed and becoming more and more depressed. I can’t concentrate, and I have a very high functioning imagination, so it’s very easy for me to get distracted and get lost in my head briefly. This makes me feel worthless and not as good as everyone else, I’m scared that the way I am will end up ruining my life, I’m trying to hard but I feel like I’m constantly hitting walls. I don’t know what to do. 

Edit: I have only been medication for Bipolar disorder, and mild anti depressants for BPD, but I found that the anti depressants didn’t really do much for me besides swing me out into manic episodes for frequently, so I do not take them anymore. I have not been medicated with ADHD medication as no one will prescribe it due to the type of medication it is, too many people abuse it and therefore it has put a strain on my chances of getting medical help for it. 

I’m unsettled and I’m sorry this is a long post, I feel like I’m crumbling and I hate talking about this stuff to anyone.

3,"Hello to all you kindhearted people,  
2 months ago my wife took me to this senior psychiatrist and i have been diagnosed with OCD, Anankastic Personality Disorder, Impulse Control Disorder and Adult ADHD. Im taking a SSRI and Ritalin for now. Meds made a hugeeee progress. Within two weeks I felt my head is gradually becoming clear just like how clear a road can be after a fog goes away. I started seeing the reality and I could expand my mind to think further and further. I started reading. I felt like I'm slowly growing an excessive thirst for knowledge. I started writing what comes to my mind. Right after a month or so I started taking Ritalin way more than what I was prescribed. And then started snorting instead of taking them orally. As I've told I searched for articles and books and read a lot about my conditions and what good use I can get outta them. That same search is what introduced me to snorting for a quick confidence boost. I feel great after consuming them. But I don't feel that same level of euphoria/ same enlightenment as I used to feel when I started this medication anymore. Hypothetically think of someone who comes to this world with only one leg (still he manages to do everything at the normal speed as everyone else) suddenly someone gets him a working leg. Since he already managed to do everything at regular speed, now with the new leg he can run as twice as fast the others. I felt the same. Around a month ago. I strongly feel like I can achieve many things. Everyone keeps chasing money. They seek money to buy materialistic things which are made by expanding our basic needs. And give those products a brand. And sell it back to us. In exchange of some notes with marked value, which also created by humans. Aren't we funny? We are entirely missing out the point/purpose of our existence. I really want to accomplish something for the sake of us humans who have gone blind by a few things which we by ourselves have created. Please show me some light to get back on my track!!",02Oct2018,1

6,"I’ve was officially diagnosed with depression last year but have dealt with it for the past 2/3 years. I was medicated (Prozac) for 5 weeks last year before slipping into psychosis, trying to kill myself and ending up in the hospital. Started on Mirtazapine back in May after I jumped in the river Thames and almost drowned. The medication still leaves me deeply depressed, but without it I’m worse.

However, the medication seems to make me feel high as hell too, euphoric even, I’ll have giggle fits over nothing for days. I don’t need to sleep and can survive on 3 hours a night then go to class then work. Sometimes I feel so high but I want to die.

I’m in the midst of a love triangle with two guys, I bounce back and fourth. Sometimes I feel intense love towards one and hatred towards the other, this frequently flips. I drink heavily and frequently, partake in risky sexual activity too probably. Feel lost and hopeless then extremely hyperactive. 

I feel like I’m loosing my fucking mind. Help?",02Oct2018,1

That's another story of it's own, anyway the two of them work together she has been stumbling around sluggish on her movements and speech, my wife phones me and says you got to get here and bring her to the emergency!

8,"I just found out that a beloved family friend has died from an overdose, at a young age and without any precedents. Tomorrow, I am going over to my mom's house to tell her in person, but I am unsure of how to do this. 

My mom has severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD which is triggered by this exact situation. She is in treatment, but struggles daily. 

Is there any way to avoid causing her to have a complete breakdown? What should I plan for? What can I do to help her?

9,"Hi, 

I'm a journalist with MEL Magazine, a men's lifestyle publication in Los Angeles. We're collaborating with Anxy—a mental health publication—for a year-long project following the journey of four men managing mental health struggles. I was wondering if you wanted to participate.   


It would involve 4 interviews with me over the next year, the first being in the next month or so. I, too, have mental health struggles in the area of addiction and substance abuse. Everything can be completely anonymous.  


I can offer you the utmost confidentially, empathy and respect. I am happy to answer any questions you might have via message, email or phone.

10,"This isn't a cry for help. I just need to say it and I don't have anyone I trust with it. Since Reddit is (for the most part) anonymous, I feel I can say it here. My girlfriend and I moved 6 months ago to a state her family is in. I have never been here before. I have lots of mental health issues. I am paranoid and have what I have called for a long time ""bad thoughts"". Sometimes during high stress times I see/hear things. I have seen 3 doctors and they think either I am bipolar or ASPD. All agree I have PTSD. No I was not in the army. I have a history I won't talk about. Like I said Reddit is for the most part anonymous but if you have the right know how you could figure out who I am or where I live. Could be the paranoia. 

My girlfriend and I are going through tough financial times. I feel like I am holding her back. She has a degree and could do whatever she wants. But due to some of the family we got stuck out in the middle of nowhere. So since I, the no college/bad history/poor crazy boyfriend the family closer to the city where my girl will be successful is not letting us live together. Apparently they like me but it's some issue with how my girl has changed. She has depression and not the ""oh I'm feeling down today"" she has the real want to kill herself kind. She asks me to kill her (never seriously but still worried) and says how she wants to die. Honestly the only reason I have not just gotten into the people we live with guns safe and blown my brain out is because I am worried she would soon follow me. I think if I just vanished it wouldn't be as difficult for her. We have enough wildlife here so my body wouldn't be found. 

I just think it would let her go live her life better. Especially since she could try and get back in with her family that has more money and is closer to a big city. My family thinks I am shit and her family thinks I am shit. She loves me and we have known each other for a couple years now so it's not like I just hate this new relationship I'm in. I love her very much and I think it would be a kind thing to do. I know it's flawed thinking but it's still how I feel. If anyone has info to maybe not feel like this please say something. I'm kind of at a loss. I know somewhere I don't want to do it because well I am typing this. But I also feel it's a good choice. I hate myself and I am holding her back so why shouldn't I.

Life is rough guys. I know I haven't had it the worst but damn I know have been through hell and I just don't want to wake up sweating and paranoid anymore.",02Oct2018,1
11,"At first it started with me questioning myself and wondering if I was losing my mind but now I've come to terms with it... kind of.. Now I either let people know right away or have them figure out on their own that something just isn't right. Although I admit to it, it still hurts me very much because I feel that although I can identify with my problems, I really don't like them and wish they could be fixed.

Now I've got a nasty cold, and you know how when you've got a bad cold you get all brain foggy? Yeah, so now I've got that *on top* of dissociating.

15,"For the past month or so, I have been picking at my scalp. I did this some in the past fiveish years on and off but this time it's worse. 

What I do is run my fingers over my scalp until I find any sort of bump or scab then I will scratch and pick at it until skin comes off. Sometimes, especially when I pick at the scabs, I do it so much and so deep that it bleeds. Then I HAVE TO get the piece of skin/scab out of my hair. It gnaws at me if I try to leave the piece in my hair, even tho it's a super tiny piece that like no one could notice. Sometimes by trying to get the piece out, I have to redo my ponytail or however I did my hair because I pulled some hair out of the rubber band. Also, sometimes a strand or three will be pulled out along with the piece. I'm worried if I keep doing this I'll get bald spots.

I've resorted to using wide headbands to try to cover the spots I pick at most and am trying a soothing hydrating shampoo (but it makes the scabs hurt). I have scabs on the top of my head that u pick at the most, but the ones further back and on the sides and back of my head can't be covered by a headband. I don't think I could even put cream on the scabs to help them heal cuz that would make my hair look greasy and unclean. 

What do I do? Does anyone have experience with this? Is it considered trichotillomania or OCD?",02Oct2018,1
16,"My entire life I've battled with depression. I'm ADD so that might shed some light on my emotional development.  However, about a year ago I went through (what I thought was) the hardest time of my life. Couldn't go back to college, was sleeping outside with no job or phone or anything. The crazy thing is that was the first time I didn't feel depressed. I filled my body with hate though because, for some reason, that worked really well. I fought through shitty jobs and was eventually trading in the stock market with 2000 in my savings. I got a job at a jiffy lube because stocks are a hard learning curve lol. I met a girl there. She was the greatest thing that had ever happened to me. I moved jobs because I found one with better pay. She came with but to a different department.

This is where the story goes downhill again. I got carpal tunnel in both my hands and lost that job. Right after that, my car broke. It was at this time that I told gf that I would give up my plans to move to Germany and stay with her because I loved her. Well, she said she needed a break. Apparently a break means go find another guy at the place we worked at. I was devastated because I found out through her friend. One night however, she messages me about how sorry she was and that she didnt want to hurt me. She said she wanted to be with me but that she had to get herself together first. I was okay with that. But after a little of her being distant (except when she was suicidal or stressed about not having money) I found she was with that guy (still?) 

I just want to die. I finally got a job but it's a door-to-door job. I have nothing again but this time I can't even build back up. I've tried embracing the hate again but that hasn't worked. I just don't know what to do. I hate myself for saying this but I just want her back. She made real life better than my dreams. I wasn't scared of anything as long as I had her. But she just manipulated me for my money and (if I had to guess) attention. 

Counseling isn't an option. I work too much. I'm back living with my abusive mother. I'm 24 and I swear nobody gets screwed like I do. I dropped out of high school and college. I have no defined skills. I just want to die.

When I was really young I had severe separation anxiety from my mother, especially after my parents divorce. Its been theorized that I have attachment issues, mainly due to my father's toxic roll and then absence in my life, but I always get very very anxious and panicky before I have to leave my boyfriend and go to work, I don't usually have very specific thoughts but lately it's been centered around him being gone when I get home or me not knowing what's going on with him. I don't think he'd cheat, or anything along those lines, it's specifically that he will leave me or be gone or dead and I won't be able to do anything.

29,"Every since I was around 12 years old (currently 19M), I haven't quite felt like a balanced person (in terms of mental health). I always feel sort of dead inside and sad but there are two different cycles I've noticed I go through with this. 

1. I call it an upswing. This is when I feel energetic, confident (not in terms of feeling good about myself but more of believing I am right about things), really angry at the world, easily irritated and very impatient. I also gain a sex drive boost at this time as well. 

2. This is the downswing. This is when I feel numb, lost, extremely tired, lots of self hatred, worry, high anxiety and urges to cut, burn etc. myself come out too. I lose any confidence I could have had from the upswing here and I basically hate myself and wonder why I have friends during this time.

So the way I've found (through keeping a journal) is that I tend to go through these swings periodically. The upswing lasts 1-2 weeks and the downswing can often times be 4 weeks to a month. There have been random quirks that happen too, especially during the downswing. Suicidal and extremely existential thoughts become rampant during the downswing and I sometimes lose any appetite for anything and not eat very much. During the upswings I eat a lot and I tend to eat slightly healthier. I often find the only reason I can find to keep living is for other people. I have some really good and supportive friends and I feel like if I were to end my life, it would hurt them and I would never want to do that to them, especially my family. As a result every day is just me dragging myself along and waiting for tomorrow.

Nothing has seemed to have improved much over the past 7 years. I've gained more social ability and knowledge of the world. I have some coping methods too. The healthy ones are music, writing and talking to people (I rarely do because I'm afraid telling people about my problems is going to make them leave me and I'm terrified of that). Unhealthy coping methods are binge eating and hurting myself through various ways. Everyday it feels like I have to fight myself to not throw myself in front of a bus and I feel a constant push and pull in my head all the time. 

I feel pretty much no genuine happiness anymore, I pretty much only feel irritated, anxious, depressed, lonely, worthless and weak. I do not feel like I can talk to my family about this and I'm currently saving up some money from working to get diagnosed by a private psychiatrist. My friends have been telling me to seek professional help for a while now. I keep on psyching myself out of doing it due to various anxieties and fears. One of my close friends who has dealt with this for a long time told me that I shouldn't keep all of this inside me but I find it hard to not bottle it all up. I do not like myself at all. I think I'm ugly, weak, stupid, awkward and overall just a burden to everyone around me. I dont understand why people love me and I feel like I make them feel worried when they shouldn't have to. I figured I would post here to see what you guys think. I do plan on getting private help fairly soon but I would like to hear your analyzations. 

I'm currently in college if that adds anything here.

Thanks in advance everyone. ",02Oct2018,1
30,"There are a few incidents that have happened in the not-too-distant past (1+ years) that still rile me up and make me angry. I know hating someone or something isn't good for me, since it doesn't add any value to my life. But it's so hard to let go of that anger, especially when you still see the people that hurt you every now and then. 

I've found that other forms of abuse I've experienced have become less of a problem for me through time as well as accepting that chapter of my life as a permanent part of my story. But for the time being, can anyone suggest ways to let go of sudden anger and hatred toward a past person/situation? ",02Oct2018,1
31,"xpost from /r/bipolar but my gut is telling me someone (or society) is going to mess me up real good soon (potentially fatally, if not fullpress then to the point where I no longer have time and only one choice), so wanted to share here as well.

And aside from that maybe being so high energy at times that it annoys people and they want it to be an illness so I am pressured into taking something to shut me up. But for the most part my mania triggers when I get episodes where I think about my friend's death, I mean not just think about but feel like I am reliving the experience. It was a pretty powerful blow that threw me off the rails, it's weakness for sure but his suicide really screwed me up, there were a lot of people that knew him way better that survived and I basically got blown to bits by it. I always feel bad referring to him as a friend as well because I liked him a lot and we had moments at work so I liked him, but he was a coworker and I feel like referring to him as a friend undermines it for people that knew him so much better.

It could also be a ""phantom pain"" sort of thing where my body remembers what it was like to be able to be highly active, which I can't be anymore. There's a lot I can type out, the gist is I can at time come up with rational explanations for my mood swings, but it's like due to finances and/or social footing I can't have the space that's needed to express myself adequately enough for my mood swings to be minor rather than explosive. So since my organism is so hypercompressed and people don't like me due to xyz, I either take meds and am basically dead or am off meds and mood swing wildly.

Anyway. The average life expectancy for most people in my situation seems to be somewhere in the early 30s due to social responses, and people are definitely taking pretty large bites out of me lately. I'm probably going to get eaten alive soon. Instinct lets you see into the future sort of sometimes and I'm seeing a cliff with a black pit coming up pretty soon.",02Oct2018,1
32,"Hi. I’m a 15 year old girl, and I’m a freshman in high school. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar depression and anxiety. I’m taking 10th and 11th grade classes in school, all honors. And i’m scared i’ll fail because my depression is killing me.

A couple week ago I’d walk into class, homework finished, notes taken (color coded, too), dressed nicely, and with a smile on my face. I’d raise my hand, read aloud for fun, and take the initiative.

Now, you’d think i’d been replaced by a twin or something. I’m rarely dressed nicely, my homework is half done or not done at all, and i’m too tired to even think about participating. I’m throwing myself a pity party, aren’t i? since i’m in honors it’s a “no excuses, no late work” policy, and i can get that. but with no motivation, extreme frustration, and no energy having all of my assignments turned in, even if it’s not well done, seems like it’s out of reach. 

I’m scared to ask for accommodation. My teachers know about my problems, but having to say “i can’t do this, give me more time please,” is selfish. i feel like i’m taking advantage of my teachers by using my depression as an excuse. not to mention the countless times i’d go into the clinic crying and having to take anxiety meds before talking to a useless counselor that can only say “mondays suck, here’s a pass to get back to class.”

i cant sleep, i can barely do my work because even when i finally drag myself to do it i get frustrated and tired so i give up and i have so much on my plate my anxiety is acting up. I had to take online courses last year because i’d have anxiety attacks nearly everyday before or during school, i just couldn’t take it. and i don’t want to go the same route.

i feel like it’s unfair to ask for accommodation, because other students have to do everything a certain way and it’s honors, it was my choice (my mom’s choice) to take upper level classes. 

please give me advice, and if you’ve been in the same situation... how did you deal with it? 

PS: sorry if this is all over the phone place, i’m not very good with words",02Oct2018,1
33,"I was in a good mood today but I'm worried because I wasn't thinking very clearly and I can tell when I drive that I had poor focus. I don't much mind being in a bad mood I just want to be able to focus. I was more outgoing and directly impulse-to-mouth conversating but I don't like that. Maybe just none of that is part of my identity, maybe I don't trust myself not to say something dumb. I've had dpdr stuff for a few years, is this maybe it progressing. I know I'm more outgoing I've been commenting more than usual the past day or two. Am I just losing social anxiety? I've been gaining confidence but I don't think I ought to be yet. I'm mostly worried because I just feel dumb because I'm not really thinking about what I'm saying before I say it. I used to be kinda smart but now I'm feeling less and less so since I finished he. Maybe it's because I never sleep well, or am I just unfamiliar with how.i am when I sleep better since I've been trying to fix my sleep habits. Idk, but I can't fall asleep and felt like sharing.

Btw my mom told me once she had a DID diagnosis in like the 80s and that was smart in her youth but now, well she seems kinda ditzy. Similar for my dad, reportedly smart family though I haven't seen them since I was young, but he's a similar kinda ditzy and an ex addict. I was great at tests in school (and i got within 10 points under 1400 on sats which may be good but I didn't try and get perspective) but i never felt motivated to do homework so barely graduated. Bad indicators maybe?

Garbage diet, poor sleep, job where I stand all day, do I just not have enough energy to operate anymore? I'm 19, is this one of those things where hormone changes affect your cognition? I really feel like I'm getting stupider and ""smart"" was the only positive identity I had consistently, even though I think self identity can be a negative thing. Should I just find a way to keep learning like Khan academy or something?

34,"I don’t enjoy the things I used to. I used to dance around my room listening to my favorite bands but now when I put on my favorite bands I can’t feel anything, not happy, not sad. I just feel devoid of emotion. I think I’m so overwhelmed currently with school work/etc that my emotions just turned off. I think the only emotion I feel is anxiety but like constant anxiety that is just a cloud hovering over me 24/7. My head just feels like static. I can’t think straight, I can’t remember anything or retain information like I used to. In class I just feel lost all the time. It’s like my mind is in a complete fog. I honestly just get intrusive thoughts of hurting myself and sometimes even during class randomly. Even the slightest inconvenience such as not liking something I drew, I’m like well time to drown myself in alcohol and maybe jump off the nearest building. The worst part of it all is I can’t make sense of it all in my brain. Sorry if this is upsetting to read, I personally don’t like reading these things on here but I have to vent.",02Oct2018,1
35,"as many of you may know, depression is often associated with emotions like someone could say “my depression takes form in sadness, meaning i typically feel down and disappointed a lot.” 

i’ve been thinking the past couple months i have depression in the form of guilt/anger. i always feel guilty for saying things whether it’s as simple asking for a pencil or when i asked to share a textbook a couple weeks ago. after that i always beat myself up for it (not physically i don’t self harm) but i get really mad at myself for saying such stupid things and it can make me really irritable.

36,"I’m a talker. I talk talk talk. I can’t stop talking. I’m always talking. Why is this? Because there’s a stupid voice in my head that talks too and won’t shut the fuck up.
I can never get silent in my head therefor, I struggle incredibly to stay silent. If someone is around me all I can do is talk. I can’t stop. It’s like I need to fill up space. But the thing is everything I say, is either glible or offensive. I hate how much I share with people when I speak. I always over share my words either it’s my opinion of something or my personal feelings. 
My personality privacy is out the window because I am an open book. Ask me anything and I give you a straight answer instantly even if it is the most personal thing about me. I hate that I have ruin my own privacy. That I’ve shared to much with the world that I really didn’t want too. 
It’s just always the wrong words coming out. I can never get it right when i speak to anyone even my own partner. And I hate myself for it.
I want to blow my brains out to get rid of that stupid voice in my head that tell me what to say. It just never stops. 
I try so hard even meditate. But at the end of the day, every single conversation I have is bullshit. I don’t know how to deal with myself anymore and it makes me what to hurt myself.

38,"Im not sure if I’m in an abusive relationship 
But she tears me apart 

She’s the reason we don’t have a place to live, she got us kicked out of our most recent place to stay. We couldn’t find an apartment before that cause she had a dog she refused to put up for adoption or let family take care of(he has a broken leg that she can’t afford to take care of, and it’s not my responsibility to pay thousands of dollars for someone else’s dog to get surgery.. we have only been together for 4 months. If we were in more of a committed relationship for longer I’d probably help, but I don’t have much money myself..)
She gets so mad at me for even having a girl on my phone screen (even if I’m just scrolling through Instagram or Facebook) 
Constantly accuses me of cheating on her or watching porn. Makes me go through my phone in front of her. 
She tells me everyday that her cousin is the only person that cares about her and that I don’t care, when I do nothing but try to help. I try to make her feel better, I really do. 
She constantly says she’s going to commit suicide, especially when I upset her somehow. 
She has an eating disorder and throws up intentionally, I’m very encouraging of her eating and I always go out to get her “safe food” but if I upset her slightly she tells me she’s going to puke and it’s my own fault. 
She asks me for a ride at least 3 Times a day and if I don’t give her the ride she will freak out and treat me like I’m a horrible monster. 
We argue everyday, EVERYDAY, 5-7 Times a day. 
She has screamed in my face multiple times and even gone as far as to kick me in the ribs and push me when I was trying to get her to stop hurting herself. 
She’s pushed me to the ground before twice forcibly and hard.. (we’re both 6’1 so she can overpower me if I’m not resisting) 
We came 300 miles to come stay with my parents until I could figure out an apartment to rent and within 13 minutes she started freaking out and telling me I don’t care about her. I made the mistake of saying “I care about you more than anyone! I do more for you than anyone! I’ve found us a new place to live everytime you’ve gotten us kicked out!” 
She started running down the street trying to run in front of a car, the car slowed down and went around her and was confused.. 
she then locked all the doors in my car and sat in there for 30 min before coming in. 
Telling me she’s going to bed, and I can take her to a homeless shelter in the morning cause I’m a piece of shit that makes her life a living hell. 
Didn’t realize that trying my best to care for someone and doing everything for them was a living hell.. 
well she also said she can’t wait for me to fall asleep which makes me terrified, and of course unable to sleep while she is sleeping, fell asleep while listening to me weep and cry. 
She doesn’t want to break up with me cause I’m her means of living, food. A ride, a place to live, etc 

I can’t break up with her cause she threatens suicide and makes me feel like it’s my fault whatever happens to her if I dump her ass. 

She won’t let me talk to any girls period, gets so pissed when I talk about my problems to anyone, doesn’t want me to talk to my family, won’t let me go out without her, etc 

Idk what to do ",02Oct2018,1
39,"I know it is really hard to shrug off all those feelings in the morning, mostly bad feelings but this works for me or at least works at some part. 

When you wake up before school, work or anything else you have to do and feel exhausted and without motivation, tell yourself it’s because you haven’t fully woken up yet. Grab a coffee, do something else before going out. I often feel like doing nothing, cancelling all the plans and get back home and go sleep. Wake up your mind first, get coffee, wake up earlier than usual and embrace free time you got before work/school.

Have a good day, you are strong ",02Oct2018,1
40,"So I’ve more or less known I have depression since I was 4 (back then I just thought of it as a constant sadness), but in more recent years I’ve been dealing with thinking about the same thing over and over and over again on a loop and basically can’t break out of it unless I smoke some weed or find a task that commands 100% of my attention. But after the temporary distraction, my mind goes back to it. 

I also get these weird incidents I think of as seizure auras, except they’re not seizures, since  I had epilepsy as a teen and those episodes were very intense/obvious/physical. Basically once or twice a week or so I’ll feel lightheaded and like I left my body a little and my hearing fades out a little and I cling onto my desk or something and squeeze my eyes shut until the weird feeling passes and I feel like my brain is attached to my body again. Idk what’s going on. Is this stuff symptomatic of anxiety or could it be an absence seizure? Idk.",02Oct2018,1
41,To start off I'm severely pessimistic. I view the world through a nihilist lense. I expect and prepare for the worst. Always watching my back for when it gets stabbed. I live my life by one saying. Trust no one. A friend of mine says that's not a healthy attitude to live by. And that shes worried about it getting in the way of being successful. And that I should be more optimistic. I feel that I can still be successful either way. Idk. Just wanting to see y'alls opinions and thoughts. Thanks.,02Oct2018,1
42,"I am really desperate. I feel like there's something wrong with me but I cannot find answers as to what is it. What's wrong with me?

The problem is that I can't control my emotions, it feels like they control me. I am aware of that after I calm down after some rather bad emotional experience but when it's happening, I can't do anything to stop it from happening.

Sometimes I feel like nothing can stop me from doing whatever I can in the world. I buy things, even expensive things, that have something to do with some new hobbies I've never tried before. I pay for courses I rarely attend later. I make plans for the future. Strict plans. Big plans ahead of time. I always obsess with something or someone. Friends and family always say I act as if I was high on something because I crack jokes, jump around and am just very outgoing and extraverted. I never feel like there's something wrong with me. I always remember thinking ""Wow, I am so happy right now"". 

And then, there comes the slump. I slowly start feeling doubts and imagine some unlikely scenarios. But I'm okay. I start to feel the need to avoid people and I began doubting myself from time to time. And then there comes a breaking point nr 1.

 I have an emotional breakdown. Usually somewhere in public. I usually start crying about some absurd thing, sometimes not absurd but terribly exaggorated. I cannot stop even if I try. It's horrible.

 After that I feel regrets about the breakdown and terrible anxiety starts building inside of me. I am unfocused and many times I cannot even get up of my bed. I neglect my responsibilities and my friends. I feel worthless and useless. I have no plans and I feel like I have nothing to live for. I am selfdestructive in my relationships. Sometimes I get furious and potentially violent. The anxiety is building up and building up. 

Breaking point nr 2. I usually have a panic attack somewhere alone in the night. Sometimes I have suicidial thoughts during this one night.

After that, I usually get numb for a short period of times and then switch. I am happy and feel like I can go to infinity and beyond.

I didn't mention sleeping because I have trouble sleeping no matter when. I just cannot fall asleep because the thoughts in my head are storming. Good imagination or bad. 

I tried to hurt myself badly once in the past about 5 years ago (it was a special situation though) and after that I was visiting psychiatrist and psychologist. I got some sleeping pills and basic not very strong antidepressants. I was diagnosed with nothing. The psychiatrist said they think it's just a phase and immaturity. Psychologist didn't help either. The only thing that actually helped from this mix were the sleeping pills but I always felt tired even more than before after I woke up so I ditched them too eventually. 

I don't know maybe it's nothing and I'm just special-snowflaking. I just don't know what to do. It seems to be a never ending story and it keeps fucking up my life. ",02Oct2018,1

I was in a toxic relationship, where my boyfriend used my mental health issues as a way of manipulating me. He’s the only person I’ve ever loved or even remotely cared about and I believed and trusted every word he said. 

Deciding to leave him was the hardest decision I ever made and everything kind of hit me at once. All of the pain and memories and voices and terrifying things that I could block out when he was there came back to me like, what I can only describe as, somebody hitting me in the face. I can’t even put into words the pain and terror I was feeling.

However, this only lasted a week or two, and then it all went away. And now I feel numb. I don’t feel happy but I don’t feel sad. Im finding it hard to sleep but I’m constantly exhausted. Nothing’s majorly affecting me emotionally but I keep uncontrollably crying even though nothing’s happened and there’s nothing on my mind. I’m going through the motions of life and I’m loosing track of why. I’m not excited for anything, I have no plans for myself and my future.

45," So where do I start? I've been in and out of the healthcare system since I was a kid. Today was the worst day of my life, it felt worse than losing my family members, pets, failing college, getting into motor vehicle accidents while at work, somehow today just felt worse, or maybe it felt like it was all coming together to hurt me somehow. It was kind of a regular day for me, but for some reason I'm so mad all the time and the longer this goes on the more I feel beaten. Today well actually yesterday, it's 1 am currently, so mind the grammar, was just like every day. I try to be nice to people in public and get laughed at or snorted at. Hold the door and get snorted at. Say to a parent in the grocery store that he has good helpers and the staff mock me for my laugh. I realize this is super minor but after everything it sets me off, I hate violence but I'm getting more violent,  I hate my mind, I feel like I'm not the original Simon anymore. I know that's not what you are here to read you want to know what lead to me being this way, or maybe it's me that wants you to know. Well guess I should begin at the beginning. When I was young I was always older than my peers, my parents deemed it the right thing to do to hold me out of school until I was a year older. It might have been to them but for a person looking back it merely held me out of life for another year. Later I'm growing normally and about the age of five I lost the ability to use my legs for awhile and my speech also went with it. Well threat didn't last long, I can run! But it held me back another but from learning and growing with friends. In grade six I had a bowel infection and was committed to the hospital for a month, due to not being able to attend I was held back. Back to school everything is normal. I have trouble making friends, I'm to nice, I don't know how to be a true friend, I've never had any it felt like. I had friends but I didn't know them. High school comes and I start acting tough and cool I want to fit in so well. I used to ask my mom if I could get lunch money only to try and buy friendship with it. Grade nine comes and while trying to be cool I tackle someone not playing football and hurt him badly. Later that day he takes me by the back of the head and repeatedly smashes a locker door on my head, this would be my first suspension and fight, and my last suspension and fight, I had known I was the one to cause it, I deserved what I got and more. During a teen night at the pool I get attacked in the shower and my head gets used as a hammer as the back of my head hits the valve to turn on the shower several times, I'm knocked out against the wall, nobody finds me for minutes. I wake up woozy , there is blood wrapping me around my arms like a warm towel. I don't tell my parents until much later after I'm caught skipping school, I was skipping because the kid that attacked me is attending my school and he knows me. I believe I received damage to my mental state as that kid never attended. At this point I'm beginning to become scared of things. Grade ten. I still seem to fit in with most of the people in my grade. I fell in love with a girl who was later thrown from her seat and dies in a car accident. Later that year two students die. I'm beginning to think what's the point. I'm going to skip allot of similar crap because I started this at 1 and now it's 2:19. I fall for this girl who goes by Missy, she's so lovely and fun to be around and cares more for her friends than herself. I love that about her, but she is far to damaged,I try to get her to stop drugs, I talk her out of running away from her step father, I talk her out of suicide, I can't keep UP, I take her to prom and she takes me to a crack party, I leave her there. I'm done. 3 years and I couldn't help her I can't help anyone. I fall for her friend Lassy ""fake name for privacy"", now this is a true friend, if only I had of been. I ask this girl out a few times and she tells me no it's not in her interest ok that's fine and all good. I go out clubbing with her as a dd and while drunk she loses herself to it and I get uncomfortable, after all she turned me down. I ask her about it when she is sober, not a good conversation. I start smoking pot and quit drinking. I get several good jobs. I become a youth care worker. For some reason I get very stressed maje up a stupid reason and quit almost a year in, this is my third job since I was 18 I am now 22. I move into a friends and live off savings. I start smoking pot heavily. I stop sleeping almost all together. I get the opportunity to drive a bus, I start training, a week in I'm sure I have a job, I leave my janitor position. A few days after that I cut in front of a off duty officer while in training. I quit shaken and unsure of myself. A bank error happens, my reasoning isn't all there. 20000 dollars happens to appear in my account. I start living off of it. I get a call from the bank. I owe 24000 dollars, I take out a loan to pay it off, better than jail. I didn't realize it wasn't my money, not sue why I just skipped the process where you think to yourself about things like this. I get a job for a pest control company. I get certified and hired. A couple months go by. I'm still not sleeping, like at all. I get in a giant accident with my work vehicle on shift. I tell my boss I'm exhausted and I'm sorry but i don't know if I'm the right guy. He says don't give me that shit and puts me back on the road. I get involved in a minor accident, I tell the boss again, I'm going to kill myself or someone if I keep driving at this job, he puts me back out. I get in a third accident, lucky not my fault, butt in nervous and scared that this is the last straw, I pay for the damages myself and no claim is made. I get into a fourth and final accident, I remove myself from the road getting a doctors help. I stop working for pest control. I start seeing help from a psychiatrist. She's lovely, motherly. She makes me feel better. I try going back to work. It starts out great, regulars start thinking I'm the boss because of my fancy duds and my politeness and professionalism. I'm not sleeping. My eyes hurt, my body hurts. Everything is blurry. I take to the cooler to organize it. I fall asleep. I get let go. My psychiatrist helps me find a medication that lets me feel a little less stress. But now agree has run out of ideas. She suggests a doctor. I sign up with him and stop seeing her. It's been years. I'm in my upper twenties, I live in my brothers basement. I never see him because I don't want to be a problem, same with friends. I can count on my one hand how many times I've had company in the last year. My new doctor is a prick. On our second appointment instead of giving me sleeping pills he tries to have me physically taken to the hospital as if I'm a danger to others. I run. I'm afraid. My doctor sees this and gives up on the hospital, never says sorry for not asking my permission. Keep in mind I signed myself up for his help, what right does he have to manhandle me. That was earlier this year by the way. He instead gives me anti psychotics and sends me on my way and schedules a checkup for October. So I have to wait four months just to see my support for mental health. Stupid this is not helping me, it makes me angry. I ask for sleeping pills before I leave, he turns me down and tells me I'm not sleeping due to depression, I tell him he is wrong that I can tell the lack of sleep is causing my depression. I tel him I don't like how he is assuming and ignoring everything I tell him. He asks me to leave. I tel him I hate this. That this is making me worse, he ignores my pleas. I start being forced to see his assistant because they think I'm going to kill myself, why should I have to see someone for this! I'm no harm to myself,I just want sleep. I see her yesterday, this Monday.  I had a sleep study done and she has the results. The doctor that conducted the study lets her and my psychiatrist know I need sleeping pills. She says that's not whay my psychiatrist thinks and that's the end of it. I wanted to kill myself for the first time in my life yesterday. I'm not going to butt my doctors are driving me closer to inanity. This is not what I signed up for. So yeah would you please send jokes, support, pictures of cookies something? 

I love everyone.

We have now had over 850 people take part! That's over £850 raised for mental health charities. A lot of our responses have come from Reddit so thank you very much!

In case this is the first time you're reading this post... We are looking for people who are willing to complete some online questionnaires about employment and well-being which we hope will help us to improve services for assisting people with mental health difficulties to obtain and retain employment.

We are developing an employment questionnaire for people with personality disorders; however we are looking for people from all backgrounds to complete it. That means you do not need to have a diagnosis of personality disorder – you just need to have an interest in completing the online questionnaires.

The questionnaires will only take about 15 minutes to complete online. For your participation, we’ll donate £1 on your behalf to a mental health charity (Young Minds: Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Foundation, or Rethink).

50,"When I was 16, after a tumultuous childhood filled with narcissistic parents treating marijuana with the same dependency as narcotics, I was sick. I couldn't eat, was losing weight, skipped about 40 days of my final year of high school.

My mother took me to the doctor, where the doctor told me I had severe anxiety and depression and prescribed me some antidepressants. I suppose I was oblivious to my surroundings, numb from all the abuse. Of course, being the way I was, I essentially threw them out. 

Today, nearly 10 years later, and my anxiety is stopping me seeing a doctor and getting help again. Well, to be honest, I hate using the term 'anxiety'. It makes me feel like I'm seeking attention like the ridiculous percentage of my Facebook friends. They seem to throw the word around every day, to describe something as trivial as their sadness at a movie. I constantly ask myself, 'am I like them? Am I just sad?' I've managed to push aside the misery from my youth, buried in the back of my mind. Am I just bugging the doctor asking for help???

Things keep happening though. Breakups, miscarriages, my car got repossesed at one stage. Have a pretty perfect relationship now, nearly paid off my car, my debts are all in order and half paid off. I should be happy. I should feel some sense of achievement. I don't. An afternoon alone and I work myself up over nothing. I find something, ANYTHING, to worry about. My latest fixation is the reality that everyone close to me will die and my hypochondria leads me to believe I have a brain tumour and will die. This consumes me. 

I find no enjoyment in anything, I have no motivation to do anything, I'm working a trashy retail job because I just can't committ to anything more.

So my conundrum is this - do I find a way to push aside my anxiety and see a doctor? Will I just be bugging the doctor? Am I just looking for attention?

53,"It's like my good and bad days have become good and bad half days. The fluctuation is too much and I can't explain why it happens. One tired life is all it is even when I do enjoyable stuff. My mental health is gonna be my undoing I just know it. There is nothing anyone can do because even I don't understand my mind and just don't like to live life pretty much, it's that simple... 

Right now I am deep in escapism and maybe I even enjoy short periods of life but it's not worth it and the main reason I am still here is that killing one's self is tough to do (that the intent doesn't overpower the hesitation as well as thoughts of consequences and effects on those in life) and if did it, no one would understand man. It is not just thoughts, it's the calm before the storm unless I suppress the storm brewing for no real reason dammit.

Like I want to live for my parents, best friend and dog but these periods of embracing death are still there even when I have the will to properly fight it. Things i regularly do either lift my mood or they don't. The thought of missing out on life doesn't affect me as much as it used to atm really.

I have sought help but idk why nothing has come of it and even when I was able to consult with any kind of local help it never ever worked out positively for me so I will just continue all that I have been able to do and maybe I will not get pushed to the edge I pass by anytime soon :P",02Oct2018,1
54,"Pregabalin to Sertraline ( Lyrica to Zoloft)

Well, 425 mgs of pregabalin a day got rid of most of my anxiety. My fear of having a panic attack in front of people went completely. It's been great....but...It's expensive and my ability to remember simple words was affected. It also has a short half life. I'm considering swapping to Sertraline, or at least combining the two. Any info on tapering off pregabalin and/or mixing with Sertraline much appreciated. 

One month supply of 50mg Sertraline is £10.
For the amount of pregabalin I need, it's almost £90.

One of the booths really interested me... It was a volunteer-based hotline. If I decide to go through with it, I'll have 8 weeks of training, and then I dedicate a minimum of 12 hours per month (I think) to being in the call centre and helping people.

It gets better.

I don't drive, which limits the jobs and organizations I can apply to. No worries! The call center is five minutes from my university, so I can simply walk there. Imagine doing a night shift and then being able to just walk to school in the morning... its incredibly convenient!

I'm really excited, because I've been working with a few people pseudo-therapeutically (some through this reddit actually), and I'd been thinking of starting a volunteer-based therapy program somehow (so people won't have to spend 83266217$ on therapy).

61," For some background I am a 20 year old college student and I have had depression and anxiety for the past four years of my life. I also have had OCD the majority of my life and as long as I can remember I have had a mental theme that bothered me to the point that I would form rituals of some kind.  The strongest example I can remember happened at age 12 and it involved me going to the hospital because I saw a kid in my class throw up and I pretended to be sick so they can see if there was anything wrong with me.I have been oversleeping dramatically lately  and I haven't been taking my antidepressants for about a week. I have difficulty falling asleep and then I end up oversleeping for 13-16 hours and have been missing class because of it.  The reason I post this is I had something very scary happen last night

I woke up in the middle of the night, last night around 4 a.m, and I was wide awake except I was in alot of distress. I was in distress because I was seeing number patterns in my head, I believe revolving around the number 10,000, and at first they were sound and organized but then they started  becoming disorganized and wrong. I had a strong feeling that the world was falling apart because of this and I felt great pain in my head. During this, part of me knew it was nonsense and I was just trying to meditate on it. I am not sure if this was a dream induced state of nonsensical thought (I am dubious of this because I felt very awake and was moving around in bed and even stood up at some point) or if it resembles the onset of schizophrenia. The best way I can describe it is numbers did not feel right and I felt an overwhelming sense that my world was falling apart. I did not see or hear anything besides fairly intense closed eyed visuals.

In the past 3-4 weeks, I've started to hear things that aren't real (such as people calling my name, hearing my suitemates in their room when they aren't there, occasional whispering, knocking on my door, etc.).  A few times a day I'll see someone from a distance, but when I look away and look back to the spot, they're no longer there.  I've consistently had very vivid dreams that seem real, which is making it harder to distinguish my dreams from reality.  At times, it feels like I'm in a dream but later realize I'm not.  I'm mildly paranoid that people are listening in on me, like my next door neighbors (I live in a dorm so rooms are close together).  I've been diagnosed with depression but am not on any medications, and have a therapist I plan on talking to soon.

These things have made studying difficult as I am constantly distracted and have become increasingly anxious, so my grades have suffered as a result.

I am currently 19 years old.
And I honestly can't tell anymore how it feels to be happy.
I behave like I am happy, I laugh, I joke around but there is nothing behind it. The other emotions accompanying me are anger, sadness and  numbness
I used to be insecure about myself social outcast, no friends, I was inside most of my time, alone, insecure.
There was a turning point thou. Maybe 3 years ago I started to numb maybe even sooner.
But the point is, I can interact normally with other people, I suddendly got myself friends and a boyfriend, I became over confident. Got myself the position as classpresident. Fought back against one of our asshole teachers and won.
It's almost as if I had died inside and now since I am shallow I can get behind walls that kept me prison before. 
This numbness, I thought of it as some kind of depression, but honestly It's great somehow.
I can somehow be 'happy' at work and with happy I mean I can do my work and not care about if it's fun or not I just do it without feeling terrible, sad or miserable and I smile the whole time.
I can control myself so well expect when I've got a breakdown. Usually I am crying in my room with my plush penguin in my arm happens quite often. 

But I would like total feel again. 
Because I know, I would care about my friends, family and boyfriend if I could, but at the moment I don't even care if they are still alive. And I guess they deserve someone better someone who actually can feel something for them.

78,"So there are two reasons why I’m writing this post. I need to blow off some steam and write it down for my own sanity and I am after advice on how I handle the potential shit storm in work ahead of me. 
So I am a newly qualified nurse who has just started on a paediatric ward in August. I have been there just over a month. I have worked as a care support worker one day a week on that ward for nearly a year. 
In the last 6 months or so a male colleague and I have become very good friends. We work well as a team in work and we started texting and phoning each other out of work sometimes to have a gossip and a moan about life. It is strictly friendship based as he is old enough to be my dad and I have no feelings towards him. 
Anyway, the last month I have developed quite severe depression. I began cutting my legs as a way of coping with it. I have few people who I can discuss this with and therefore decided to confide in my work colleague. He was mortified and regularly texted me and called to make sure I was ok. This was very comforting and I trusted him. He asked for a picture of my wounds so he could see what I had done and if I needed medical treatment. So I sent and asked him to delete it straight away after he had a look. (This was last week) 
This is where is gets ridiculous. Last night I felt like cutting myself again. My colleague told me to call or text when I get these urges. So I messaged him around 19:30. Only, it wasn’t my colleague who replied. His girlfriend had picked up his phone and messaged me back. 
So at 1940 I get a WhatsApp saying ‘Message my man ever again and this is landing on your boss’s desk, you’ve been warned’ and sent a picture of my mutilated leg. 
I read her reply and instantly felt sick and felt like I wanted to cut so I contacted a sucidal support line to talk as I knew I was in danger of doing some real damage from the anxiety. This helped and they advised me to contact the police. So I did, (investigation on going) 
I was on shift the next day (today) and I decided that I was in no way fit to go in work and called in sick. My manager answered and told me the girlfriend had already contacted her very early this morning and informed her of my self harming, she also got the nursing sisters phone number off my colleagues phone and sent the pictures to her. When I heard this I honestly felt like I was dying inside. 
So this brings me to this point. I have an appointment with Ocupational health tomorrow and I’m seeing another councilor. I’m also reading lots in r/self harming which can be helpful. But how am earth do I show my face on the ward again. I’m so scared of everyone finding out. People LOVE to gossip and i am terrified of people judging me and not trusting me as a competent safe nurse. 
Other than get a new job has anyone got any ideas or even words of support would be appreciated. I am so lost right now and don’t know where to turn. ",02Oct2018,1
79,"To clarify, I definitely think there is something wrong with me, but I am learning to accept my demons. 
Ive been in basic therapy for the typical blah...blah and haven't had an official diagnosis. Let's let you be the judge and I will get to my point. Narcissistic tendencies, percieved abandonment issues acted upon, minimal mental/emotional connection with others (once the moment is gone i feel like a stranger again) reckless spending, driving and sex habits, some substance dependencies. Lovely fluctuations between mania and dysphoria. 
Etc. Etc. I wont bore you. 

A few days ago after work I went out for a drink with coworkers. They get off before me so i normally meet them at the bar. I havnt figured out the trigger but I was enraged upon my walk there. Normally peoples company I enjoy being around I could barely give them a second glance. Over the course of the next 2 hours was a compilation of symbolic self deprecation. I drank to excess, gambled more then my paycheck away, drug use and ignored those who cared for me. My coworker (my adopted work mom) took me home that night where I remember spots of mostly blacked out sobbing with clichéd complaints ""I want to belong, I want to be loved, I want to be normal."" Until I took another pill and passed out. 

So to my point these manic episodes dont happen a lot but do happen. This dissociation with people has always been a problem, same with reckless behaviors. I may have a f@cked up brain but its my brain. It has given me incredibly unique points of view; I am not tied to the generality, nor do I act or think the same. Now sure, mental illness does have its problems but I believe one should learn to control and bond with those demons vs. Masking them with drugs and pseudo-symbiotic mimicry. 
I am an anomaly, (we all are) a ghost in genetic code and design and if maintained properly an incredible asset navigating this mundane existence presented to us. Mental illness shouldnt be feared, but celebrated.... Disclaimer all with a healthy respect for damage it can actually do. Mindfulness, and a path towards self actualization is my percieved key. Responsibility and understanding vs. Control and fear. ",02Oct2018,1

Lately a mental phenomenon that I've been experiencing for a couple of years has been starting to intensify radically. The best I can do to explain what I am experiencing is this: I interrogate myself. A lot.  
Intruding, unpleasant, disturbing thoughts keep popping into my head even if I try to ignore them, and they make me question myself as a person. For example: subjects that I find disturbing, like incest and pedophilia, keep coming up in my head, and I feel like I need to prove to myself that I am not into one of these things; this starts a sort of an interrogation, where i question myself, and every thought that I try and use to prove myself could be turned against me. You can picture it as if inside my mind there is an interrogator, and me, the interrogated. It's really hard to convince the interrogator that I'm ""innocent"", and I'm really frustrated. I feel like I'm starting to lose my mind.

I’ve been in a committed relationship with my boyfriend for 5 years. We’ve already discussed and plan to get married but last year in November he dropped a bomb on me that destroyed me. He had an existential crisis after realizing he wasn’t actually saved and began to panic about getting his life right as quickly as possible. In doing so he came clean about his infidelities. He never had sex with another girl but he made out with and fooled around with a girl who was a mutual friend for a week. He also out of spite made out with another girl at a party that I left because I was trying to avoid confrontation with another person who was there and another time he sexted a girl. Most recently tho he admitted that while ubering last year he made out with a random drunk girl and just this year while high he allowed a older drunk woman to force him to “touch” her sexually by threatening him with a fake rape claim. So in the entire 5 years not one year has he maintained being faithful or trustworthy. He’s always felt the need to lie and hide things from me as well including a weed problem that he’s had and that he quit last year and then secretly started back up a few months ago. I just found the weed issue came back 2 weeks ago because I caught him lying about it. I am terrified of everything now. I have bad paranoia that he’s going to cheat or worse that I’m gonna find out that I was just kept around until he found something better. Idk everything is too much and I don’t know what to do but I know that I can’t keep bottling all this up and not talking to someone about it and trying to rebuild myself. We are still together and I know he loves me but I also know he has his own problems that have led him to making all the poor choices he has in our relationship. Help please!,02Oct2018,1
83,"I have a sibling who is suffering really bad anxiety attacks and really bad depression. I try to talk them through techniques I use to calm and manage anxiety attacks (exercise, breathing exercises, writing, listening to music that drowns out the spiraling thoughts, etc.), but none of these seem to be connecting. My sibling finds these more stressful than drowning in anxiety, or finds them unhelpful for someone ""on their level"" of depression, or like they just aren't capable of any of these. I'm out of ideas. 

I want to recommend some light fluffy videos or something but I don't think they'll appeal to my sibling because they'll inspire feelings of jealousy or the feeling that everyone's lives are better than theirs no matter what etc. this is based on things they say about the people they interact with at school.

Does anyone have tips for dealing with anxiety when depression is just really dragging them down and they have trouble engaging in self-help behaviors at all? I don't know what to do.

The point of my question isn't too disparage those that hold religious beliefs; nor is it necessarily to remand those that hold such beliefs to the realm of the mentally ill.

I'm also keenly aware that one could be considered mentally stable while adhering to a religious or spiritual system of belief. That said,...

89,"Sorry for the long post.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background: I'm a male in my late 20s, not married, no kids, currently single (most recent serious relationship ended a year ago on fairly amicable terms).  I work an office job in a busy and high stress industry, but right now things aren't any more stressful than they had been at various other times in the past 3 or 4 years.  I work out a lot, eat healthy and have a lot of really good close friends that I see frequently and have good relationship with my family and talk to them often on the phone (they all live in another state so I only see them in person a couple times a year).  By virtually every objective metric, I have a very normal life.  I have no history of treatment for mental health, depression, anxiety, etc. nor did I feel like I previously had any reason to be treated.  I've always felt relatively happy, even when things in my life caused me to be stressed, sad, or angry.  I'd express these emotions and then eventually move on to continue a relatively happy life.

&amp;#x200B;

However, for the past 3 or so months I have been feeling very tired all the time, even after getting a good night sleep. I'm also very despondent throughout the day, and I have trouble paying attention to things at work, and often times I feel like I just don't care, even when working on important tasks that could have a huge impact on my company.  Weirdly, at other times I feel very anxious about things that really don't matter.  I might get an email that points out a minor mistake I made that is easily fixable and doesn't affect  the rest of my work very much, but it'll cause me to start breathing heavy, sweating, mind racing, anxiety, etc.  I also find that I am avoiding seeing or talking to friends and family lately.  I don't have any reason for not wanting to see them, but the thought of being around them makes me feel exhausted.  Though, when i actually do see them, I feel good for the time I'm around them, but once we part ways, I go back to feeling stressed, despondent and tired.  I also continue to work out a lot, and I feel really good when I'm at the gym or going for a long run, but just like spending time with loved ones, as soon as my workout is over, there's no lingering good feeling, and as soon as I get home from the gym I go back to feeling down again.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also been thinking a lot about death and my own mortality.  Not necessarily suicidal, and I don't feel a desire to end my life, but it's more of a feeling like I'm indifferent about existing any longer.  I don't think I'm going to hurt myself or anything, but if I was in a plane crash or got hit by a bus or something, I'd be OK with my life ending.  At other times I fantasize about losing my job, my company laying off my department, or getting fired for some mistake I made.  And, again, I feel like I'd be OK with it.  Overall, I think I feel like I want something to happen to me to make a drastic change in my life, but I just don't have the energy or desire to go out and make that change myself.  It's weird, old me would have made an effort to figure out a way I can change my life and then work hard to effectuate that change, but right now I just don't have the energy to do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

It's strange that I can't point to any event or change in my life that prompted this change in me.  My job hasn't changed for the past few years.  My last serious relationship ended almost a year ago, and although i recently stopped seeing a girl i was casually dating, I had only been seeing her for a couple months, it wasn't serious, and I didn't really feel anything negative when it ended.  Haven't had any traumatic events like a loved one dying or getting sick... It's like I woke up one Monday morning with the usual, ""ugh, I don't want to work today"" feeling, but it just never went away and kept getting heavier and heavier.

&amp;#x200B;

Not really sure if anything is actually wrong with me, or if I'm just in a funk and will eventually get out of it.   Or maybe I just need to muster up all the energy I can and quit my job, but I don't really know what other kinds of jobs I'd look for if I did quit or if this is deeper seeded than just being unsatisfied with what I do.  I'm not even sure what I'm looking for with this post, but I just feel like I need something and hoping that putting this out there in the public realm will help, and maybe I can get some encouragement to start on the path toward feeling good again, whatever that may be.",02Oct2018,1

92,"Hey!


I have suffered from depression for about 8 years. I’m now 23 years old, so a large part of my life. 

I have ALWAYS struggled with my moods, my mum always put it down to ‘it’s just you’. But, I really struggled, I could be fine and then something so minor and irrelevant happens and that’s it. My mood has developed into this horrendous mood, where I’m verbally nasty and hate the world. But, sometimes (dependent) I am desperate to come out of the mood. But I just can’t do it. 

Recently, the past 6-8 months I have been having auditory hallucinations. These beings phone ringing, toilet flushing, ticking, knocking. 
Only once have I heard people whispering. 

So, I’ve gone to the doctors about it. 
Which referred me to have an initial assessment done to find out what’s going on. 
I have done some research into psychosis and this is what my doctor used to describe what I’m going through.  But, i don’t really know what I’m doing. As well as that, I’m not sure what I want? 

A part of us thinks, yeah you’re being silly and this isn’t real. Grow up. 
But it’s not like that, recently I’ve been struggling to work out what’s reality and what isn’t. For example, did I imagine that situation Happened or did it actually happen?
I have always been obsessive about things, routines, types of food, relationships. I suffer from bad withdrawal symptoms from people.

I am suicidal, and psychotic. No one notices, or cares. I've told people my crazy thoughts. Professionals brushed it off, because I'm able to recognize that what I believe to be true is crazy. Any one else I told either ignored it, or joined in. Thus, in an attempt to have some one tel me it's crazy as a last ditch effort I turn to the internet. I shall now tell the shortest version I can, and then answer questions.

Hi I'm Lucifer. I don't think I'm the Lucifer from the bible that was mentioned ONE time. I don't believe I am Satan. With that out of the way let's go with what I do think is true. I am the son of Eris, and Hades, heir to the underworld. I grew up with my sister, Umbria, and loved her very much.

When we were teenagers me, and Umbria started a relationship. Not long after I found out I was betrothed to the daughter of Satan, Nephela.(It only gets crazier folks.) I began to date both of them.Later Nephela the marriage wasn't going to happen, because I loved Umbria. Nephela then conveniently one day told me that the dissolution of our engagement meant there would be a war between the kingdoms; thinking I would make a great general, I stormed the war meeting attempting to lead the whole thing. Dad didn't take kindly to this, and banished me.

I've been reincarnating on this play for about 2400 years. In this lifetime I have dated both Nephela, and Umbria, but at seperate times. Just as I had 2400 years ago I loved Umbria more than anything...she recently left me for some one else.

100,"So to start with I’m not a native english speaker, and most likely will have some spelling mistakes... 
—&gt; F20 with ADHD

I’m constantly having trouble with the way I express myself to others. I always speak my mind (thats what I’m told, tbh I just speak without analyzing everything I say) and REALLY DON’T UNDERSTAND why people get so fcking emotional if someone speaks the truth. 

For example, a friend tells me “ohh I’m almost done with smoking” (while he smokes at least 10 cigarettes a day) and I respond back “you really aren’t, smoking 10 cigarettes a day its quite a lot compared to not smoking at all”. After this my friend was kind of sad and told me I didn’t have to be so bitter.

This is just a quick example of what normally happens in my everyday life. I don’t feel I’m being bitter for saying exactly what’s going on. I reaaaally don’t understand why people can’t handle the truth. I know when I’m not doing what I should and if someone tells me “you’re not doing x thing” I don’t feel sad or annoyed it’s just what it is and that’s it

Or if I complain about smth that’s  bothering both my boyfriend and me while my bf is at work and my brother tell me “you have to wait until he gets home so you can talk about it calmly, sending him messages about this issue while he’s at work it’s going to upset him”
So if what’s going on is a situation both me and my bf are experiencing and its equally annoying for both (its not the kind of situation of an annoying gf just complaining) and I think of something and want to tell him, why telling him while he’s at work is THAT bad? 

I don’t quite understand sympathy/ empathy and do feel quite annoyed of people complaining about that, ‘cause when someone doesn’t understand my way of thinking that’s it I don’t fcking care! I dont know why people make everything into a whole big situation, when its just what it is.

My boyfriend tells me I have all the traits of a sociopath, I’ve never even thought about this until some months ago. 

I don’t know if he’s right or it’s just kind of the image he made of me in his head.

Every time I talk about this with my psychologist he starts with “ohh you are just blocking your emotions as self defense” and I’m not, so I just gave up with therapy altogether. I did have a troubled childhood -getting into fights as soon as the age of 4/5, not having friends because I disliked everybody, only one and we had a really toxic relationship (me making her cry and she telling me I was fat, not that I cared or that I was, she was quite intelligent but her way of trying to piss me off was immature for me) kind of bullied some girls just for the purpose of doing it (I didn’t have any male classmates between the age of 6-11). At the age of 12 I started having some male friends ‘cause those kind of friendships were easy like getting into throwing stuff at each other, pissing of teachers, that kind of easy stuff, all this ended when they started seeing me as a possible s.o. 
Also the house I grew up in was filled with violence between my parents, my brother at that time was already living in another house with friends in another city. I never cared about my parents throwing things at each other, only when things got really ugly I stepped in and shouted at them to calm down. 

When I was 9 I tried to commit suicide just because I didn’t understood life, didn’t care, everyone in my class was happy and I was this bitter girl that “just wanted to be different”, also at 12 ‘cause I didn’t see any purpose in even trying to fit in, I never felt the need to fit in, so why trying if I didn’t even wanted to?

Nowadays I do struggle with communication, and I really need to know if someone feels this way.
I’m also constantly being told I strive for too much, that I can’t do everything I want, jokes on them ‘cause I end up always doing everything I do want.

I am M/20 and over the years I have felt my emotions getting less and less deep. When my grandfather died when I was 7. I was a wreck and cried. Yet when my other grandfather died when I was 19, I was not as affected. 

When my rabbit was suffering and in a bad state when I was 18, I cried (same for both of my lizards, which died when I was 15 and 17 respectively)but when I heard my had passed away when I was on an research vessel, I did not react as much. 

When my best friend got rejected from the college he wanted to go to and was breaking down, I immediately went over to comfort him, but know when my friends are not in as good a place my emotional response is less. 

My parents, despite being healthcare professionals, are overweight and I am very concerned for their health. Yet thinking about it does not viscerally worry me as much as it once did. 

I have often wondered what would happen if I found out my nuclear family or close friends died. How would I react? Would I care at all? I don’t know. 

I just feel that while my negative emotions like anxiety, depression, dissatisfaction, jealousy, envy, and insecurity are here in full force, my more positive emotions like happiness and peace are lesser and fleeting, and I don’t feel the ability to feel love as much anymore than when I did.

It hurts me, I hate it. I want to be more empathetic, compassionate, and loving again, I like those emotions. 
I want to be helpful, yet when I try to reach out and help people both on here and irl, I can’t shake the feeling that I am being disingenuous and more doing it for some narcissistic reason. 

I also feel that because I am so introverted, I value people more for what they mean to me rather than for the people themselves. This doubt swung full force when I was with my ex

105,"A few months ago, I was talking with a very close friend about my depression and I remember saying “this will never go away”, and “I’ll be living with/fighting this for the rest of my life”. I truly believed that, simply because I didn’t know the options available to me for mental health treatment. I thought the only options I had were to seek outpatient treatment (psychiatrist and therapist) or to fully commit myself to a residential psychiatric ward. 

Recently I decided that my way wasn’t working, and it was time to try something different. I went to a new therapist who gave me an intervention and recommended that I check out some behavioral health centers. It was the best decision I’ve ever made. 

The center that I called got me in for admissions the next day. I was so surprised to hear the options available to me. I later learned that these are standardized levels of care throughout the mental health services field in addition to normal outpatient care. They include:

1: Residential. 
2: Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP)
3. Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)

Residential is just what it sounds like. You live there. Regular meetings with a psychiatrist and therapist, group therapy sessions all day, etc. Most of the patients that I met who came from residential were there for anywhere between 2 weeks and 2 months. 

PHP was where I started. As an adult with responsibilities, I couldn’t realistically check myself into a residential facility. This was part of the reason that I let myself go untreated for so long. PHP was M-F from 8:30 AM - 3:30 PM. It felt a lot like school. Morning check-ins with the nurse were kind of like homeroom (if that’s even still a thing). Then an hour group therapy session, followed by an hour long group for process (kind of like an open forum), and then lunch. The afternoons varied but were all done in a group setting. Mixed in there, I’d have weekly meetings with my psychiatrist and one on sessions with my therapist. I always had nurses and support staff that I could go to for anything, and it was a very positive and judgement free place to heal. 

After a month of PHP, I stepped down into IOP. IOP was 3 days a week (M, W, F) for about 3 hours a day and was offered in the mornings and evenings. We’d still start with a check-in with the nurses, and the same group therapy and process sessions, and then we’d have another 30 minute planning group. I still saw my therapist one on one each week and my psychiatrist every other week. I stayed in IOP for another 2 months before discharging for good, and going back to normal outpatient care. 

I think I would’ve done this a long time ago, had I just known what options were really out there. I’m writing this now for anyone who feels like they need some real help, but are afraid or unable to do a residential program. You have options. The help is out there and it works if you’re willing to do your part. This is only temporary even if you’ve been battling it most of your life... like I was.

I'm 24, Male

I feel like i'm not able to enjoy anything.  
The few things i manage to for most of the day just distract me from nothingness, giving me less stimuli every time.   
I usually spend my day sitting in front of my pc, boring myself, because i think is almost better to stay in my bed all day. Games, social, drawing, internet...everything feels flat.   
I think  I'm also losing emotional response to music, unless i have a very powerfull connection with that particular song, and the emotion that it give to me don't last for long. Once i had a patience of a saint, but now i snap so easely, and even this don't last long.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel split in two parts: one part is full of my potential (i know what i can do), and the other, negative one. The negative part took a lot of black, sticky apathy, crafted a lot of bricks and built a prison and chains from it. And then locked my positive part into it, in the middle of the dark nothing.   


When i must do something i need to put a wrongly high ammount of effort to start it, and when i start i simply rush it to end. When some friends ask me to go out or throw a party i need to fight my dark side saying ""why don't we stay at home, only for this time?"".  
I'm not able to study properly, and this ruined my university career so badly.  


Now there is something important about my story: my gf died because of  liver cancer about one year ago.  
I know that this may be the trigger of all this, but i feel like all this was lurking inside me for a very long time. Maybe she was like a floating piece of wood right after a shipwrek, i don't know.  


Everything mix with a lot of external factor: social pressure(study, find a job, live your life and be happy), being constantly compared to others (i.e ""your cousin graduate with top votes and found a job while you sit here doing nothing""), fear of the future caused by very poor local and national politic decision (i live in Italy, i'm surrounded by al sort of anti-scientific crap and cult of ignorance and incompetence).  


You my ask ""why didn't speek about this with your parents?"". Because i feel like they will not belive me, that i failed so may times that they convinced themselves that i have some kind of internet or pc addiction.   


I'm also tired to put on the ""everything is fine"" mask with everyone, but i feel like i shouldn't bother other people with my pesky little life problems.  


I know i built this prison for me myself, but i want to go out and i can't find a way to open the door
