0,"So recently I found out that I eat less than 900Kcal recommended for my body type per day , sometimes I eat 1100Kcal less.
Many people tell me "" you've lost some weight"" ""you are thinner "" and all that stuff.
But every time I look at myself in the mirror I see a chubby version of me.
So I was wondering , how is this possible? How can so many people tell me those things while I see myself getting larger?",09May2018,2,
1,"Here’s some context; I suffer from clinical depression or MDD for short. The antidepressants I’m on seem to be giving me nightmares. My psychiatrist told me that it was normal but I have been having them literally every day! Usually if me getting mutilated by a group of horribly deformed “things” with huge grins and cold, milky eyes. Help? ",09May2018,2,
2,"So, I am having suicidal and homicidal thoughts; they both come and go. However, I feel the homicidal thoughts are becoming more frequent. I am scared to share those thoughts with my therapist. I plan on getting psychiatrist by the end of this month; I am scared to share those thoughts to a psychiatrist. I fear what they will do with that information. I am torn between, because I want to share in hoping for someone to help me take a hold of myself. Those kinds of thoughts scare me, and I want to lessen them. I do not want to get in trouble anymore, I just want to get better.",09May2018,2,
3,"Does anyone else get overwhelming urges? Lately when I feel myself going into an anxiety or panic attack I start getting intense thoughts. Sometimes I will envision myself punching the nearest wall, or screaming at the top of my lungs, or I will even get images of killing myself in various ways. It feels like that feeling you get when you need to scratch an itch, like if I do any of those things then the feelings I’m having will go away. A couple of times it has made me scream at my fiancée if she’s talking to me/interacting with me when it happens, and afterwards I feel like the worst person on earth. This hasn’t always happened to me and it’s becoming a lot more frequent. It kind of scares me and I’m afraid it’s going to get to a point where I lose control.",09May2018,6,

6,"Hi, I'm a 21 year old female, I live with my parents, and I have some problems I'd like some help with.
I don't know if anyone will respond to this, but I hope someone will maybe be able to give any advice or criticism.
Before I begin I want to apologize if I'm too vague or unhelpful, condescending, annoying, or too wordy. Id like to use this short time I have to get some help. I will also include a tl;dr at the bottom for you as well. I'm sorry.

I've had concerns about my mental health for about 5 years now. Although I think these symptoms and signs have gone on for much longer in my life, although it's only taken until these past 5 years for me to take notice.
   My concerns focus mostly on depression, severe anxiety, and ocd tendencies. 
    I don't support people who self diagnose, for all I know i don't have either of these problems and it's entirely percieved as such, or I do have something along the lines of those things, but not those exact things.
      My childhood, looking back on it was not very good. As a child I wasn't aware of these problems my family had, I figured everyone had similar childhoods to me, and suffered the same. My elder sister used to torture me, choke me, punch me in the chest, slam my limbs in doors, bully me, and humiliate me as a child. These are some of my earliest memories,  and it was like that throughout my entire childhood. My parents were not entirely aware of the things she did to me, as I was afraid of telling them. I still haven't told them the gruesome details of what she's done, although my sister and I are on good terms now. 
    Elementary school was torture for me, I was constantly bullied because of clothing, looks, and my social ineptness. I was also a bit overweight as a child, and still am. 
   Middle school was tenfold, and probably host to some of my worst memories. The harassment didn't stop at students, but teachers seemed to join in as well.
     Highschool had ups and downs. Sophomore year was the only thing that salvaged that entire experience because I met my best friend, and we are still best friends today. She is my only friend, and if I didn't have her I think I would be long gone. Junior year was probably the worst year of my entire existence, I isolated myself like never before, after my friend moved to another district. I sat in the bathroom the entire year for lunch, my parents would make me food to bring to school but I would never eat it. My weight had changed fast in that year, and it's a shame to say I've gained it all back. I think about my experience in highschool, and I enjoyed learning, but everything else was mediocre, and unnessecarily terrible. Senior year I chose to go to tech school, and graduated in cosmetology and received my license. I was proud, and had a long list of goals for my adult life I had set for myself. 
       After graduation I quickly deteriorated, I still have the same grocery store job I've had since senior year, and while I enjoy it I want to start my next chapter. I've waited too long to get a job in the salon field, and my license expired, preventing me from even going into the industry. I quickly realized how toxic the industry was, how catty women are, and how a highly social lifestyle and environment was not my cup of tea.   
     Ever since graduation, my mental health has deteriorated at an all-time low. Even during my torturous childhood, and what a circus middle and highschool was, I've never felt so self destructive, self loathing, forgotten, and isolated before. 
     Ever since I was a kid, I constantly have picked and pulled at my skin, my fingers are so destroyed by my nails and teeth, and are in the worst shape I've ever seen. They are often bloodied and chewed, and I have a lot of discoloration and scarring on my hands. 
     My room is starting to look like an episode of hoarders, and I have no motivation to clean it.
   I have a hard time eating food, as I've become so picky, my food musnt touch each other, or else I refuse to eat it, if it doesn't look perfect in my vision, I will refuse to eat it. 
   My sleeping habits have taken a bad turn, I don't like to sleep because I feel it's a waste of my precious life time, and don't typically go to bed until 4 am, regardless if I have to work early. I have such terrifying nightmares im sometimes too scared to sleep. I also have terrible auditory hallucinations while trying to sleep. I am often awoken by the sound of a loud bang or explosion, or voices speaking unrecognizably. I often have times where my body is paralyzed and I am trying desperately not to close my eyes, and struggle and hallucinate. If I try to go to bed early, I end up lying there for hours in my bed with my eyes closed, but I am consciously thinking about my entire life. 
    I find that I think violent, and sudden thoughts, almost constantly, especially at work. I often have extremely violent thoughts about myself, like what if I exploded right in front of this mean person, would they laugh, would they cry, would they scream in terror. Sometimes if I think about terrible thoughts, whether it's something embarrassing that happened in my life, or something gruesome and horrible, I cope by rapidly tapping my fingers, spelling invisible words with my fingers, ripping apart my skin on my fingers and hands, or making distracting noises to myself, to distract my mind as quick as possible from these thoughts.
  I constantly shake, and I always feel overly aware of my heart. I feel the shape and weight of it, like I feel it between my lungs, although sometimes i feel like it isn't beating at all, and I wonder if I am dead. I had a near death experience in the ocean, and time to time I feel like I lost my life and I'm in limbo, thinking I'm still alive.
    I have such a hard time interacting with other people, even people who consider me their friend, but I have no feeling towards them. I've never dated in my life nor plan to, as I have no libido or sexual/ romantic interest.
   I have an incredible animosity towards loud children, or just children in general, and often think violent and terrible thoughts about them, and I hate it. 
     I have a variety of hobbies such as ukulele, drawing and painting, photography, hiking, biking, and a lot of other things, and I have developed such an indifference towards these activities, and don't care to pursue them.
   I have an incredible inferiority complex, and even the lowliest of people I see as better, smarter, and healthier individuals compared to myself. 
    I have gained a distrustful mind towards my family, and don't tell them about my problems.
    When I do, my mom doesn't take it seriously and blames it on video games, my dad doesn't believe me, and my sisters over analyze. I feel that by telling them all I do is worry them, or make them feel like I'm pathetic, and confused. 
  I spare my best friend of my problems because she suffers worse mental problems than i, and I feel that by telling her about my mental problems, that she will feel annoyed or drowned out, or unimportant. 
   I've had a few thoughts of self harm or suicide, but not excessively, as I'm scared of pain and death. 
     Back in my childhood, if I felt this way I would have just cried. I no longer cry that often,  I'm not sure why, maybe it's because I distract myself too easily from crying. 
      For a long time I've avoided all communication, and isolate myself in my room. Often just doing nothing with myself.
  
    I've been doing a lot of research, and I want to go into mortuary science. I have a school picked out, and it's within my affordability. I want to face my fear of death head-on and no longer be afraid of suffering, pain, and death. Although I know that isn't entirely possible. 

I want to get help, with some sort of therapist or psychiatrist. I've done some research on how to do it, but everythings giving me different advice, or advice to people who qualify for certain things like veterans, mothers, people who are disabled, and other people who qualify for certain things. Reading articles and how-to's just make me sick because of the amount of information that doesn't apply to me. 

Thankyou for reading this mess, i commend you for even making it this far, i apologize for wasting your time, and please don't feel obligated to comment. 

TL; DR: I have a lot of symptoms for severe mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. I want some advice, some help, some friendly words, and some advice on how to get help, or deal with it myself. Please. Thankyou, and I'm sorry.",09May2018,2,

8,"So I'm kind of panicking because my insurance company, United Healthcare, sent me a letter stating that my depression medication has been approved for the last year (or more, at this point) by mistake and will now require prior authorization. The medication is Nuedexta, which isn't really for depression, it's actually for [pseudobulbar affect](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pseudobulbar-affect/symptoms-causes/syc-20353737), which I'm not sure if I have or not. My psychiatrist is super into research on depression and she says that Nuedexta hits the same brain receptors that the ketamine drugs that are in trials for use with depression hit, which is why she tried it for me. And it works amazing! I was still depressed on my regular depression medication, just not quite as depressed, but things got a lot better when she added the Nuedexta. Hence why I'm afraid to lose it.

I work in behavioral health in the insurance authorization department, so I know how prior authorizations work. I just don't know how different prior authorizations are for drugs than for what I use them for. Is there a chance that I will lose access to this medication? I'm super nervous :(",09May2018,1,
9,"I had an extended nervous breakdown of sorts in my final years of university working on my STEM degree. It was a new program, I was in the first batch of students, they were still trying to figure out workloads and it was hell. My parent nearly died from a stroke senior year, find out they'd had multiple strokes with cumulative brain damage, and they'd resolved to double down on liquor and cigarettes with stage 4 hypertension while refusing to take blood pressure medication. Willfully trying to drop dead any second.

I held together, graduated with honors, then just shut down for a year. Drank myself under a rock, was a nervous wreck.

I finally landed my first STEM job, and the guy I was under was an abusive jackass. Put up with it for a year, before finally quitting with a nervous breakdown. With extreme luck I landed a small position in STEM again the next year. I mean *extreme* luck, STEM is getting stupid competitive with the whole ""experience-of-a-40-yr-old-drive-of-a-30-year-old-pay-of-a-20-year-old"" thing.

Starting to crumple again from anxiety, partly from things connecting to the hell of my last job. Anxiety is screwing up my team-work capabilities for communications, scattering my thoughts to the winds, making me unreliable, and often just making me shut down and have unproductive days that are no fun either. There's nothing wrong with my new job, and management is very nice. It's the normal scrambling to solve problems within a deadline that was bullshitted to begin with while management wonders why things can't be done with the snap of fingers, with a scattering of old fashioned human mistakes. Even my mentor before I graduated confirmed that is STEM in a nutshell.

I can get medication, but at what point do I consider that I'm not stress-tolerant enough to work in STEM? One of my parents is a nervous wreck who can't even leave the house, the other can't even file their own taxes, and my one sibling is an almost non-functional bundle of mental disorders. There's a point I begin to question my pedigree, and think I might have to stop kidding myself and call my STEM degree a sunk cost.",09May2018,1,
10,"I don't know if this belongs here, feel free to link or tell me where it could be.

I have a sister who is incredibly...crazy sensitive. For example, sometimes when I tell her to stop doing something (could be anything) she freaks out and says stuff like its 'its none of your business' or 'leave me alone', even if she's talking to me and it is my business or she's talking to me. This can happen from any sort of confrontation or criticisms of her behaviour and actions. Afterwards there is like a 50% chance she will cry and wail in her room, and its getting more disheartening. 
It's like anything I say will just cause her grief, but at the same time its over the most stupid shit in the world.

For example, she always bosses me around and tells me what to do and what not to do. It's shit like 'don't shower to long' or I need this and that so you can't use it right now. But when I say the exact same thing to her and then point out that she's being a hypocrite for her actions, she flips out and starts crying. It's like she completely blocks out things she doesn't like to hear.

Another thing she does all the time is blame everybody else or everything else for problems, no matter how little or large the problem is.

I don't know how to act around her. On one side, making your sister cry is bad. But on the other she grates my fucking soul so hard I snap and end up saying something (not in an angry way, just a wow stop being a hypocrite) and then the cycle repeats itself. ",09May2018,3,

16,"My SO (23 F) has a history of some mental health disorders (never officially diagnosed) which include depression (w/ suicidal ideation), anxiety, and an eating disorder, where she sometimes enters phases where she just doesn't eat enough (I think it's rooted in body image issues, although she has a slim attractive body). 


I wanted to come to this subreddit here to seek some perspective on a question I have about her behavior with regards to this. Essentially, she can't seem to talk about these subjects without it triggering her back into these undesirable mindsets, or thought loops as she has put it. She always seems to feel worse after seeing her counselor (which she relatively recently started seeing within the last 6 months or so about every other week- thats all she has access to in her school program), and doesn't every really discuss this subject openly with me and if we do talk about it (very rarely), its mostly me doing the talking (I try my best to be as sensitive as possible). She has talked about stopping to see her counselor because she says she always feels worse after, but hasn't gotten around to ending it- mostly I think because she is terrified of confrontation and doesn't want to bring it up with him. I used to not be an advocate of her stopping her counseling sessions but now I'm not so sure.


And that brings me to my question: **Is simply avoiding sensitive, ""triggering"" in this case, subjects a healthy approach to mental health issues?**


I am furthermore concerned because she is a medical student and tomorrow has some lectures on depression, suicide and eating disorders (perfect storm) and is terrified about how it is going to make her feel. Is her approach of basically avoiding all triggers whenever possible an acceptable approach? Will prolonged counseling and exposure to uncomfortable subjects lead her to deal with her issues better- essentially conditioning her? I really care about her and simply want the best for her, but could really use the input of some people with different perspectives than myself. Thanks",09May2018,1,
17,"I'm a married female who has never once questioned my sexuality, and had been in 2 serious relationships before I met my husband. 

I've never liked to be complimented about my looks ( other compliments, I can accept, thank the person and move on) but it almost enrages me if I'm told I'm pretty/ beautiful/ whatever my husband says. Some of this I feel might stem from my childhood because I had a very abusive mother and up until 2 years ago, I was stuck living with her, and I've always felt really ugly probably mostly from her belittlement. 

However, I'm having more and more issues with feeling like I'm not womanly. When I look at myself to have to get in the shower or even clothed, I have a huge complex and am internally comparing myself to a mental rolodex of female bodies I've seen that I feel I should look more like; how I should be more feminine. 

I also have a slightly deeper voice than most girls, I'm not overly girly, and I just don't feel like an actual woman. It's really getting to me that I don't know what this is.

Is there a name for this feeling? I've done so much research and can't find anything.

20,"⚠️Obvious af, but Trigger Warning.⚠️
Also extremely long but if you deal with compulsive lying, depression, being a survivor, or self defeating tendencies read if you’re able. 

I’m basically at the point where I’m trying to get the courage to stay single or do something to myself. But I figured I’d reach out if it helps anyone else and share the story that brought me here. I’m not proud of any of this. 

First off, I have a compulsion to lie. I can’t convince you that this story  is true (as the first response to a liar is disbelief, in my experience) but I need to be honest somewhere and I guess an anonymous burner account works. You’ll probably hate me by the end of this and no doubt wish me ill too. 

I’ve been dealing with depression and dysphoria since I was little. I was sexually molested by a teacher/caretaker while I was at daycare (preschool? 4-5 it’s kind of a blur.) I was forced to do hints to her and other kids. She told us if we told that we’d get in trouble and our family would be in trouble. 

My father was abusive, physical and emotional. My depression set in at that young age because I was constantly in crisis. Probably adrenal fatigue. 

I had always been attracted to men and women, and didn’t feel safe in my skin. I would find out later (just a few years ago in fact) that I’m intersex. I always felt dysphoria about my body and how I looked. Felt out of place and disgusting. I lied to sound cool, to try and be a different person, tried to fit in. Homeschooled but socialized, I wasn’t as much of an outcast as I thought I was, but constantly being dragged down by my own self doubt. 

Soon I moved out of the house, went to college at 15 for highschool completion. Ended up in an abusive relationship (let’s call her L). I left that relationship shortly after for a 10 year one (let’s call her M) that ended when I realized I wasn’t happy ever. My depression caused issues. In that first relationship (with L, about 16-17 years old) I tried to commit suicide the first time. During my long term relationship with M, we had issues but nothing terrible at first. It was mostly me being sad and having lack of energy. I lost jobs, stayed in bed. Struggling constantly, feeling like a failure and a disappointment constantly. I lied to friends still, but had gotten better. 

Sometime right before I broke up with M, I met someone online that was like a breath of fresh air. We went to comiccon and met her and her boyfriend, some other folks. I confided in her, (again let’s call her D) and we hit it off. We were both in struggling relationships and she was in an open one. We were friends first, but flirted a lot. I drifted from M. 

M and I fought more, I started cutting and other forms of self harm. To top off this period, I got a great job and lost it because of my depression. Soon, I was working in a Call Center. D asked me if I wanted to attend another con with her and a friend. I agreed, taking out a loan to do so. M wasn’t happy about this, because she had a lot of debt (which I happily paid off when I had my good job). But I would risk everything to make D happy.  

I attended the convention, even though D’s mutual friend dropped out. That meant we were staying in an air bnb alone. The first night she confided in me that she felt more than friendship for me, and I was starting to feel the same. D had asked her boyfriend if she could make out with me (since they had an open relationship) but he said no. She disregarded that and soon we were having everything except kissing. We had all kinds of sex (minus penetration) and engaged in kinks and such that M was not interested in. We kissed a lot too, eventually. Like young lovers, we said goodbye on our separate ways home.

Once home, we continued to sext and even Skype. She said she’d continue to talk her boyfriend, maybe he would budge and we could be out and open. However I was still with M. This is when I told her that I was feeling we needed to split up. This is also when I started lying again. It’s also where I became a monster. 

D told me that her boyfriend had seen our romantic texts and flew off the handle. He said she needed to stop (one of their major issues was he could bang whoever but she had to check in with him basically). We stopped for a bit but she continued to come back to the romantic and sexual stuff. I thought in my messed up head we might have a chance, so I went along. 

I had been through some serious health issues, and D started to confide that she had more kinds of feelings for me. We were romantic, best friends, we even said soul mates. After treatment, I continued to say that my illness was worsening. M was heartbroken. I had no job, not even the terrible one. I went to D’s state for a job interview, where we promptly met and had sex. M meanwhile could no doubt see the writing on the wall. 

I didn’t get the job. 

But I said I did. I couldn’t stop myself from lying. It began getting worse. Both women thought I had a job and would be moving to D’s state. M, my long time friend and partner, ended up taking her leave and moved home with here parents. 

Once there, I continued looking for a job, and had no luck. I continued to engage in sexual contact with D, and mooching money off of family. I felt awful but I truly loved D. She said she loved me. Then one night, she told me that her boyfriend had made up with her and that she knew we’d never have a legit relationship. Not open/poly, and she wouldn’t leave him. She told me I’d probably grow to hate her eventually. I was broken. 

(This whole time I was on strong psych meds for the first time ever. Celexa, Wellbutrin, and Topimax. Plus a weight loss drug that’s basically speed- the phen in phenfen. All prescribed of course)

After D told me she couldn’t be with me, I started looking for dates in earnest. M and I had broken up and now my soul mate was gone. I told her I got even sicker so she’d stay, but she continued having sexual encounters and got distant. I met a woman (let’s call her V)

This woman was wild. Scary, but in the exciting way. Soon after our first date, we hooked up. I told her the same stories I was telling D, because I couldn’t stop at this point. I was sick, in my lies and (mentally) in reality. She told me she loved me that second night. She looked me in the eyes and said “I claim people. You know my friend X? She’s mine. And now so are you.” And it was scary but it felt so very good to be loved. I told her I loved her too. She started coming over unannounced bringing large amounts of weed (which is illegal in their state) and I lied Lore and said I smoked it. Which I didn’t, I had barely been a drinker even up until that point. Not straight edge, but damn if I was going to let go of my faculties. 

D got jealous. She knew about me and V, because we were still friends at this point. We even had full passionate sex, the kind that we’d been talking about for a while. Soul connection, but with a hit of sadness to come. I know now that was probably goodbye sex, as soon after (on Valentines Day) she came out with the truth to her boyfriend. They made up, and I tried to kill myself then. Losing my best friend and lover, being scared of V and unsure why I was still so far from home and the woman who loved me (M, my best friend of ten years). I threw away almost everything I had and swallowed a ton of pills.  I woke up to them puked all over the place. I decided it was time to go home. 

I told V my mother was sick, because frankly I thought she might hurt me or something. I had just attempted suicide and it was raw. I needed to leave and the lying was rolling out. D wondered why I was leaving so suddenly. She began to question my stories, about the continued illness, money I had given her etc. basically everything thAt could unravel at that point, came apart like a Walmart rug. I lied at first but admitted everything. I told her yes when she asked and when questioned as to why I lied I had no answer. I could only try to backpedal not knowing the cliff behind me was one I’d dug myself. 

She swore she hated me and said never contact her again. I even admitted to things that were actually true but I couldn’t stand to lose her. Trying to impress had been what got me in this mess, feeling no self worth. Soon I got back to my home state. I received a text from V, saying she knew my mother was fine. Now I know D had gone on a rampage, telling all of our mutual friends that I was a liar and digging up some she didn’t know but she felt she needed to tell them all the same. I believe that’s how V found out. She said I ‘Revenge of the Nerds’ r***d her. She called me every horrible name. I just had to agree. I hated myself and three people who had loved me had turned to hating me in two months. I didn’t lie about my heart or who I was, but I took what she said and put it inside me. Even if that isn’t r***, someone I cared about went through what I did when I was little. They felt that hatred I once felt toward the woman at my daycare. 

I got a job almost immediately upon return, stayed wit the same family I had used their money to survive. I felt awful. One night after work, I tried meeting up with someone. I needed to be assured I wasn’t he monster I actual was. After her telling me she thought I was lying about something, I tried to confide in her that I had been a liar, felt awful. I had lied to her about having money I didn’t have, despite her having money. Just a stupid lie. But she wanted nothing to do with me. So I checked myself into the hospital, after nearly jumping in front of a train. 

What awaited me wasn’t mental help, or understanding, or even the ability to tell anyone. They locked me in a cement room with a paper gown and threatened to put me in an institution. I got picked up after 72 hours and went home. Soon after, I lost this brand new job with its new lease on life. Lost my apartment. 

One last romantic encounter. 

I thought I was such scum. I decided to treat people nice, spend all my money and time to try and get love. I met a girl who genuinely was full of life and energy. We went home and (uhoh) basically fell in love after one night of sex. You see the pattern of love addiction I’m sure! We had a great first month together, I felt like living again. Truly a good time, and I loved her as much as I had M for those first few years. Let’s call her T. 

T and I moved out, I got a job, spent all of my time, energy, and money on her. But I soon lied about how much money I had. 

I could see he writing on the wall. I tried to tell her and be honest, but I lied over and over. She’d ask me about it, and I would just confess. Not sure why I had lied, why I was scared to tell her the truth. But I was. 

Eventually she had got a breaking point.  I decided I was a monster and needed to just finish what I’d tried so many times. I told her to go to her moms house, to leave. She called the police, despite me wanting to do it after she left she just knew what I was thing to do. I was going to drown myself in the bathtub with sleeping pills in my system or finally jump in front of that train. But instead, the police showed up, shoved me into cuffs and I spent another three days in a concrete room. I was planning on leaving and doing it after. 

But T came back. She forgave me, and said I would need to prove to her I could stop lying and be a good person. I agreed, but I still felt like a monster. 

It wasn’t long before I did it again. Being intersex meant it was nearly impossible for me to get anyone pregnant. They told me I was essentially sterile. T had had a miscarriage in the past. She knew conceiving would be nearly impossible for her too, but she desperately wanted kids. So did I, but knew it wouldn’t be easy or likely. In a million to one chance, we became expecting parents. She was pregnant and we were elated. Things were good. But we soon received the news that she had miscarried, right at the end of the first trimester. I took off time from work, sinking back to my lowest depression. This effected my job, (again) and I was let go. In the meantime, I lied about my pto and just took care of T. When she found out, this time she left. Rightfully so. 

I got a job, and moved and basically reset again. Missing T terribly all the while, having her tell me how much she wished we could be together. I knew I couldn’t stop lying. I knew should’ve stopped talking to her. Now I’m teetering on the edge, having lost everyone I care about, disappointed my family, and feel like the only way to make sure no one is hurt by me again is to remove the problem: me. 

If you’re any sort of compulsive liar, narcissist, or something similar please- I’m begging you get help, come out of the dark, and tell the goddamn truth.

If you don’t attend to your mental and emotional needs, your quality of life suffers; your work suffers; your relationships suffer; your physical health suffers.Mental health is easy to take for granted. It’s not like a broken arm or a heart attack.

26,"I'm making this post mainly for the purposes of seeking advice and sharing experiences. 

I'm a 19 year old undergraduate student and this semester has been one of the roughest periods in my life. I say roughest rather than darkest or most negative because although it certainly has been dark at times, it's also been riddled with patches of enjoyment. The main thing missing has been stability.

To illustrate myself (I won't be modest): I'd say I'm pretty hard-working. I worked pretty hard throughout grade school to get myself to the college that I'm at and I'd say I'm self-motivated. 

I picked up a lot of extracurriculars this semester. I am the president of an organization on campus and also the president of the council that oversees my organization as well as 11 others. Furthermore, I am involved in our Student Government.

It seems I took on a bit more than I could chew this semester. My grades are not really where I want them as my focus is barely on my academics.

And now the reason I'm reaching out: I could lay in bed and consciously acknowledge that I'm missing class, but still choose to lay there. I've missed some of my classes for weeks now. With finals around the corner, I know I have to start studying, but I keep saying ""I'll do it tomorrow.""

For some reason, no matter how imperative a task may be, I can't seem to bring myself to do it. I still do chores in my apartment, and I still run my organizations well. It seems that I can pull off projects and tasks that involve a large number of people (or at least people to hold me accountable), but I can not hold myself accountable to tasks that are for myself.

In addition, a lot of my relationships have fallen apart. I've been so stressed all semester that I can't remember much of it. 

I've been considering that I have depression. It's something I've been battling with, historically. I'm at my wits end on this one.

I have not had the time or energy to sign up for a job or internship either in order to earn enough money to see a psychiatrist.
In addition, I am attempting to keep as much detail from my parents, since I worry that they will not be understanding. I will need to depend on them for transportation, though.

32,"About to go see a doctor tomorrow.
I got hooked on valium a while back because I used them to get to sleep (I don’t sleep well) and I found myself waking up and doing so much more with myself. I went from barely working and barely trying with my studies and took a full turn in fortune afterwards. I was suddenly working 30 hours a week while studying full time and felt I really had my shit in order.
I realised I had a problem and quit cold turkey. Since then I’ve been so demotivated, lethargic, bumming around so often I quit my job because I couldn’t get up in the morning anymore and haven’t been working and failed a whole semester of uni because I didn’t even show up.
Recently I got my hands on some more valium to help fix my sleeping schedule (I was going to bed at 11am and waking at 7pm) and not only is my sleeping fixed, but within a week I’ve been waking up in the morning, applying for jobs all week, just nailed an interview, and I’m finally getting out to catch up with my friends. I’ve literally caught up on 8 weeks of work at university I’ve neglected and I’m going to pass now. I was on the brink of being kicked out.
I thought I just had a lack of self control before but now I’m starting to think I’ve had something wrong with me and the diazepam was putting me back into a good place mentally.
I’m going to talk to a doctor tomorrow and see what they think. I’ve spent a long time in denial about my mental health but my girlfriend knows me in and out and I think she just doesn’t want to tell me to confront my potential mental illness because I think she’s been worried I’d take it the wrong way, because I’m always upbeat and charismatic around people but I hate social interaction. An introverted extrovert, if you will. I guess she’s the only person who sees the side of me that can’t sleep at night, never has enough sleep, and doesn’t seem to care much when something horrible happens in my life like being told I’m getting kicked out of uni if I don’t get my shit together.
I’m worried the doctor I talk to will just see me as another junkie coming in trying to get my prescription for this or that, but I just want an honest professional opinion. I want to know what’s wrong with me and I hate the dependence I had on valium but I’m starting to think it was necessary and fixing a long underlying issue.
Whether I got a script for it or not it doesn’t matter, I’ve got a reliable source from a guy who gets bulk pharmaceutical 10mg valium. I just don’t want to fail urine tests and lose my job or get arrested for possession without a prescription.

35,"I feel like I have two parts to my brain: one is a rational, fair, and moral part, while the other is an extremely narcissistic, hypersensitive, and selfish part. Every single day, I find myself thinking very narcissistic thoughts. Examples include feeling incredibly envious of another person's accomplishments or the attention that they get, getting easily offended at someone's joke or perceived slights, fantasizing about being incredibly talented, being impatient when another person talks about themselves. Nobody ever sees this side of me, because it all happens completely in my head. But while these things happen, the moral part of my brain is disgusted by it. It feels shame that I would ever think such thoughts and tries to block them out, repress them, convince myself that they are illogical. I try to feel empathy, try to perspective-take, try to take myself less seriously, all in an attempt to erase those disgusting thoughts.

The combination of these two forces creates a ton of tension in my brain, which leads to a lot of stress and internal suffering. I'm constantly looking up articles on narcissism and NPD, trying to convince myself that I'm not actually a horrible person. I try to look up strategies to be less hypersensitive, selfish, to be more grateful, empathetic, and caring. But in the end I still feel that instinctive selfishness all the time and it really hurts.

42,"*I have so much to say and i hope whoever starts reading this really reads through the entire thing and listens to what i have to say and provides me with helpful feedback, motivation or any advice.* 

I  am a passionate person. I have many interests and i am very passionate about them. However, one interest stands taller than the rest. I love music and i would love it even more if i made it my career. Along with being passionate though, i'm very particular. I like making music: writing, producing, singing, etc. I love the idea of creating visuals and telling stories. i want to CREATE. This is something i knew i have wanted to consume my life for as long as i can remember. I'm aware that it's not always easy following your dreams. It takes a lot of hard work and usually you have to start from the very bottom of completely miserable before you can get anywhere comfortable. 

Life really takes a swing at you the older you get, i'm only 21 but over the past few years i've become more and more aware of how hard it is to have time to yourself and to be able to do the things you love. For a long while now i have been struggling with depression and anxiety. I am an introvert working an extremely extroverted job and outside of work i have absolutely 0 energy to do anything else, even something as simple and stress\-free as hanging out with a friend is enough to send my mind into a complete spiral. I work as a cashier, it's a job i never wanted to apply for and it's something i didn't believe i had the will power to even handle. It's helped me in a lot of ways and i'm very surprised with what i've accomplished and it's even safe to say this job has helped me appreciate the little things in life. 

But, i'm getting burnt out. My days are becoming repetitive no matter how hard i try to focus on the things i love. I often times find myself crying before getting ready for work and thinking about all the people i'll have to speak to leaves me feeling extremely nauseous. This same feeling occurred when i was in high\-school. A combination of a steadily declining mental health and the need to be doing something i love left me wanting to abandon this life i was living and do something i feel is actually aiming me towards the life i TRULY want to live. 

so, i did what i wanted. I stopped showing up during my senior year of school, i felt misunderstood, i felt like nobody could ever understand what i was feeling. Every bit of worry and pain in my body beat me and started making the decisions for me. I was an empty shell. My counselors way of trying to motivate me was by comparing me to my brother who was a devious teen making common mistakes and never wanting to show up at school because he thought it was ""cool"" to think school is lame. I'm nothing like that, and for someone who is supposed to be helping me, sitting across from me, putting me down, only made me want to leave even faster. 

 I love to learn.

 I'm no genius but i sure as hell am not stupid.

I never got my diploma, i never got to walk at graduation, every cap and gown and every smiling face during the time of graduation left me feeling so blah. I have never felt so low in my entire life because in those moments i knew i had made a decision i would regret if not for a long time then for the rest of my life. 

These same feelings are all coming back. I want to give up on my job and on any job and focus on what really matters to me and i can't decide if that is actually a good idea for once or if i'm convincing myself that that's actually a good idea.

He had an IEP in school and when he was 21 he brought his problems up to his dr and was basically dismissed. (The dr told him to drink more coffee) A couple of months ago he had an opportunity for his dream job and it didn’t work out. Basically everyone he knows congratulated him on this job and then found out he actually didn’t get it. Since then his anxiety (maybe depression) has gotten a million times worse. Like panic attacks/depressive episodes weekly. Has wanted to go to the hospital during them. His focus/forgetfulness issues have been terrible- and he’s still in school for another shot at this dream job which he’s kind of thinking of quitting. 

Anyway- he finally got health insurance and picked a really good dr who I think will listen to him..problem is he can not be scheduled for physical until July. I’m worried about my boyfriend and think this is urgent, but who can he call? He says he wants to go to the hospital during these like panic attacks but so far we haven’t. Would this next dr take him for like a sick visit even though he hasn’t had a physical with the guy yet?

I need to keep this post intentionally vague, I am not looking for a diagnosis. I have a friend named Bob. Bob is a fairly decent person. He has been diagnosed with ADHD, some form of autism (aspergers?) and anxiety/depression. Bob also claims he has PTSD from an accident about 2 years ago. I have known Bob for almost 4 years now and count him as one of my better friends. Over the past 2 years or so, I have seen him lose 3 or 4 jobs, burn several friendships and tank 2 different relationships. Bob has a problem with marijuana use and from what I have seen entirely too much of the stuff.

No here is my problem. Over the past 6 months or so, I have seen a serious shift in his behaviour. Where previously, he would get upset with minor things and blame those for his failures, he has now weaved a conspiracy around himself that makes me genuinely concerned for his safety and the safety of others. A recent conversation with him included claims of an international gun/drug cartel wanting to drug him for some nebulous reason, a crooked cop orchestrating a multi year investigation involving upwards of 10 police officers/investigators, 3 of his employers being on the Police payroll to ruin his life, both his ex girlfriends are informants/police (previously they where just out to get him or working for someone for some reason).

I am very concerned for his safety and the safety of others. Looking over his facebook feed, he will post articles or rants that without context don't make much sense. But knowing more of the ""backstory"" I know what he is grasping at. Then one of the hundreds of people he has added as friends will proceed to back up what he is posting or agree with him, bolstering how he feels. I want to help him, but I am unsure of what I should do in this case. If I go to the local police department, I become part of the web of crooked police informants/investigators/cops that are out to get him. When ever I challenge him he gets upset or tells me I am wrong and that only he can see these connections because of his ""autism"". During conversations where I try to bring in reason, he will cut me off and continue on a 10 minute rant about why what he believes is what is happening. As an example, he claimed a previous employer was out to get him. He had all this very convincing proof that he was holding close to the chest. 3 weeks later, he has no proof and the sources of that proof have mysteriously disappeared. He has also claimed he has been drugged intentionally.

53,"Title says it all. To give an example, my partner and I have to draw something for a lit project. I was sitting there for 20 minutes trying to get the first few sketch lines done, then he started complaining that I was going too slow and took the paper and started just drawing whatever. 15 minutes later he had already finished the drawing we were supposed to be doing.

What hurts even more than this is that he isn't even an artist, that was the first time he had ever drawn a person. Meanwhile I've been trying for two years to improve my own drawing skills, I'd stayed up late practicing, I'd push myself to do it even when I was about to fall asleep, I neglected food and water in an attempt to make myself better - and in fifteen goddamn minutes he comes along having never practiced drawing in his life and completely destroys all that effort.

And then I realized why he could do what I couldn't - it's because while I was hung up on the details, he could just draw. Just let everything flow.

I was on the verge of crying when I realized that because I have never been able to do that. For me, everything has to either be done right or not at all. It takes me weeks to draw simple things because I'm obsessed with getting them right, and because of that I rarely manage to get anything done at all. I have completely written songs that I've never actually put out because at some arbitrary point I decided it wasn't ready yet and never bothered to figure out what it was missing. It's torture.

And to top it all off, any of the potential good effects of perfectionism, like trying my hardest on assignments and not being satisfied unless it's my best work? Yeah, apparently my brain is trying to get me to kill myself, because I don't get any of those. I half-ass schoolwork all the time. There have been several times this year when I just flat-out don't fucking do the homework at all, and then a few weeks later I'll go fucking insane and have a goddamn panic attack because I don't know why my grades are so low.

This combination of perfectionism and underachieving is destroying every dream I've ever had. Doing well in school? My grades have been slipping since March and it's so close to the end of the year that there's no hope to bring them back up. Working on music? I never can make any because I'm so obsessed with making it perfect that I can't fucking finish anything. Drawing? I can barely do anything after two years of practice because despite all the effort I still didn't improve because I was so obsessed with making everything look good that I couldn't manage to actually draw anything at all.

64,I am going through a family crisis and having a hard time coping at work. I just started a new job where i cannot be sick (as I don’t have sick days on a contract). I have recently found out a family member is a pedophile and is going through the trial now . I have had someone attend sessions on my behalf as I want to know the truth. The truth is proven too much to handle and this case is all I think about. It has infiltrated my mind and I can’t focus at work. I have only been here three weeks and I don’t want to ask for time off but I need some time to heal. This is the most traumatic thing I have ever been through in my life and I feel as though my life is a law and order episode. I am so detached from reality and everything is a blur. I am so mentally exhausted and I need to take time off but not sure how to ask for it. Help ?  ,09May2018,3,

66,"I am 31 male. My wife left me and took my son, which caused me to have a breakdown, and suicidal, my family put me on antidepressants, i managed to build a good rapport with my therapist, CBT he was doing. It has been 1 year i have been on antidepressants now (Sertraline HCL) . the therapy sessions stopped 3 months ago (due to the doctor's own personal life reasons) and i cudnt build a rapport with anyone else, i just cudnt bear to tell me story or thoughts AGAIN. 
Anyways here the problem, for the past 3-4 months i think i am changing too fast into a different person, (still taking meds btw). here are the changes i have noticed.
&gt; I severely mistrust women now, except my mother.
&gt; I have started to see all my past life not with regret but with disappointment at the stupid person i was.
&gt; I have started to see women as rewards of life well lived, of being successful in terms of money and status, rather than beings that will ever love you for your care or love.
&gt;I have developed a STRONG desire to DRINK, i have never drank before, i still havent tasted alchol yet either, (not available in my country- muslims :S) but fuck it i want to try it so bad that i have gathered up all the stuff needed to make home made mead, or a moonshine still.still a work in progress tho
&gt; I have started fantasizing about becoming a psyhopath and i feel very strongly that my GOOD nature and desire to succeed WITHOUT hurting anyone else is why i am not successful.
&gt;Despite having almost genious level IQ and expert level programming skills, i have developed a strong dislike for money and i feel dirty working for or desiring money. i hate the idea of working for money , of which i will have to give almost all of it to my wife for child support, i hardly need any money for my self i have close to no expenses of my own.
&gt;I have developed attraction towards traps and sissy's and tranny's so to speak (my porn tastes have changed) and i find an ordinary naked woman almost boring. (yeah yeah make gay jokes if you want- this is new to me too- i was a complete hetro)
&gt; I have developed bad heart problems, high blood pressure, sometimes very low, headaches, numb limbs, respiratory problems, i have a feeling it could be stress cardiomyopthy but havent got a dygnosis yet.
&gt;Despite all that i havent left my room for about a year now, hate walking, hate moving.
&gt;Prostitutes have started to look very convenient and interesting prospect- havent tried yet.because next point
&gt;Sexual libido is close to zero, get a few high spikes but they go away fast.
&gt;Not suicidal like i used to be, but i wudnt mind dying if it didnt pain my mother.
&gt;I am allowed to visit my son, he is 1.5 year old, but for some reason i get this HUGE pit in my stomach when ever i think about visiting him, i feel like screaming and crying for him, i watch his photos and videos million times a day, but i just cant bring myself to leave the room and go see him.
&gt;My wife is trying to reconnect, give our marriage an another chance for the sake of our son, but i go numb and blank, i keep trying to ask my mind what it wants regarding that, i get no answer, i want to be part of my sons life,  but i am not sure i want to stay alive for that, if it makes any sense.
&gt;NOTHING absolutly NOTHING in the world is interesting anymore :(

67,"I have the following debilitating issues most of which I have had for at least 13 years \(I am 21\)

Involuntary movements, endless facial motor ticks and blurting out random words and phrases \(some of which get me in trouble for being so obscene\),

I suffer daily panic attacks if I leave the house and far worse ones when in a car bus or plane \(hyperventilating to the point of an adrenaline rush\) and random ones at any time.

I  am woken up by myself gasping multiple times nightly for months long spells at a time. 

I suffer bouts of crying even going to the shops sets it off every single day sometimes for hours.

I sabotage any change of improving my life deliberately failing most of my exams, working poorly to get fired etc.

I cannot take any criticism over anything however small and will emotionally break down if someone dislikes the way I do things \(most likely because my parents would hit and kick me over any perceived infraction \(obstructing the tv when passing through etc.\)  and would go ballistic and if I cried or had a panic attack\(which caused me to have more of both\). I'm also trapped living with my parents who deny everything and act nice towards me now because I destroyed any chance of going to university or saving money\).

I feel like I need to urinate when I leave the house to the point where I feel wet and feel it moving down my leg but it is always a hallucination. I hear people insulting me even if I've never met them and they've never seen me \(so a hallucination\).

I think it is some kind of Stockholm syndrome where I am compelled to do things that make me helpless and miserable.

I've tried mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing and progressively tensing my whole body. Therapy places tell me to see a GP when I inquire. I've been to the doctor 4 times for some of these issues and they always manage to get rid of me without doing anything \(though I may have self sabotaged and forgotten about it as sometimes happens\).

What do I do? I've had seven jobs in six months and need money to function independently and hopefully get out of here.  I'd rather have solutions now so I can start a real life. I feel I lost my childhood, I lost my adolescence and now I will lose my adulthood too. I will never have a non online friend \(not that I have even had any of those for the past half decade\).Keeping a job for any period of time, friendships, relationships not having to plan out every second of my life to minimise my panic have become utterly incomprehensible to me. I just want a future that isn't staying like this forever, institutionalisation or homelessness.",09May2018,1,
68,"Hey guys, 

someone writing at an unholy, lonely hour here.

Now I can probably guess how you think this post is gonna go. Some awkward teenager that is riddled with anxiety and thus freaks people out. Everytime my mothe asks ''why dont you bring any friends over?'' Its because I have none. 

It's not that im awkward, I'm just so extremely restless. Nothing feels good enough for me to keep doing it. I'm always thinking I could do something else, stay home or do whatever im doing now but better. 

I've always been kind and social to people, I'm extremely sympathetic and people always come to me for a shoulder to cry on.

I just don't feel a connection with people. I seem so obsessed with being likeable and keeping the other person interested, that i completly wipe away my own feelings. I feel like i take on this like fatherly, role model persona when im with ''friends''. I just ooze something that makes it seem like i got it all figured out and i am so confident. People never really get to dig deep inside of my thoughts, i keep them far away.
I have made so many friends the past couple of years, but I've always seemed to somehow never make them stick. I'm interesting to look at and to hang out with in the beginning, but i have not had friends for long periods of time. I miss someone to crash too, but i dont feel at home with anyone ive ever known

70,"God, my tattoo ""drama"" has been such a hellish source of pain for me for so, so long. 

I currently have a bunch of tattoos, most of which I love. But....

But there are some I despise. And I got them after years of having other tattoos I hated covered, then removed...i.e- i should have learned my lesson, and somehow didn't....it's so hard to love myself when I've impulsively followed the exact same path of self destructive idiocy that I had already gone down several times and begged God to free me from...

The abridged time line/story is:

Age 20
Got a shitty tattoo, hated it, obsessed over it constantly 

Age 23 or 24.
Had a friend design a cover up intended to incorporate the existing tattoo in to a graffiti letter design...decided the letters would look stupid going down my arm but didn't want to disappoint my friend who designed it so I got it UNDER the tattoo I already had but hated with the intention of eventually getting another tattoo to actually cover the first tattoo....the outline looked good, but once I got the color filled in it looked like crap....now I had two tattoos I despised and obsessed over.

Age 25 or 26

Got the original one covered up finally with a Tiki Mask....the cover up sucked, so now I basically had an entire upper half sleeve on my right arm, all of which I hated...

Was despondent because I didn't think they could be removed because when I had researched tattoo removal years before, they couldn't in fact remove the colors I had tattooed (at that time).

Age 28 or 29

Decided to finish the lower part of my sleeve with a tattoo I actually liked, not really sure what my logic was. 

As I was getting this lower half sleeve done, I found out that it was possible to remove the colors that they used to think could not be removed and took out a loan to get removal done on the half sleeve....as this was happening, the lower half sleeve was not turning out the way I'd hoped and I wasn't happy with some major parts of it.

Spent two and a half years getting the upper sleeve removed but couldn't enjoy it because I wasn't happy with the new tattoo on the lower part of my arm. Decied to get some removal work done on the lower parts, but not all of the parts i was unhappy with because some of it was orange and that apparently still could not be removed with existing laser technology.

Age 32 or 33....after getting upper sleeve removed, and removal work done on two other parts of the lower sleeve, I'm still not happy with how i look. The upper tattoo which was removed couldn't be fully removed, which I knew going in, and my plan was to cover the ""ghost"" of the old tattoo with a new one, by the same guy who was doing my lower half sleeve ,which was of course idiotic because I was already not happy with some of the lower half sleeve, but figured that since he is a good artist I should go to him to complete the upper portion of the sleeve to maintain aesthetic consistency of the tattoo....

This is all embarrassing, idiotic, and so full of stupidity on my part...I know...and it's not over yet...

In this time, around age 34, I decided I wanted a small-ish tattoo on my scalp, with a small portion peeking out from under the hairline. I wanted it to be mostly all black, with a small amount of vibrant blue in it. I had a specific idea of what I wanted and couldn't wait to get it. (I should also note that between the ages of 33-present I have gotten some other tattoos which I absolutely love, and are which are pretty big, so it's not as if all of my tattoos are crap).
The artist I had hired to do my neck/scalp tattoo didn't have the design ready on our arranged day and was sick, so we rescheduled  the appointment for 10 days later. The day before he still didn't have the design and was texting me designs the night before. Even though the designs weren't what I wanted, and even after allll of my insane tattoo decisions, I consented to one of the designs he sent even though it wasn't what I wanted...I figured that since he is such a good artist that it will look great no matter what (he really is a phenomenal tattoo artist).

I got the tattoo, and when I stood up to look at it in the mirror I was unpleasantly surprised to see that he had put a red filler in the background...something that wasn't in the design he had showed me....now i've got ANOTHER tattoo I regret, but this on my neck of all places.....great.


During/after that neck tattoo period I was also getting the cover up of the removal job done...for the most part it looks good, but isn't as aesthetically consistent with the lower portion of the sleeve as I wanted, and guess what...I'm not happy with it.


Insane.

After $10,000+ in tattoo removal, unbelievable levels of obsessive regret and self loathing, I still am not happy with my body....the fact that I made so many awful choices is as hard to cope with as the fact that I cringe looking in a mirror. 

The pain has never lessened. I've never learned to ""accept"" it. I have moments where I feel ok with it, but only because I think about what a mess I am and how it's all just par for the course given my mental health condition.

I've avoided the thought of doing even more tattoo removal because I've been trying to get out of debt, and removing the whole sleeve I'm unhappy with and the neck tattoo, and then covering up the ghost of the sleeve (and possible neck tattoo) would cost me another $10,000-$15,000...effectively wiping out all of my hard work I've made paying down debt over the last year and a half, and further delaying my dream of moving from this place and living/working in another city or country.

sigh. It has to be done though. The obsession has only gotten worse. I can't stop thinking about the tattoos. They're on my mind constantly now. I hit myself because I'm so pissed off as my stupidity. I hate the looks people give me. I hate feeling so ugly. I hate that I mutilated my body.

I just want the tattoos that I don't like gone, and tattoos that I do like over top of the remnants of the old mess, so I booked yet another consultation to see what it will cost me and start down that path yet again. It's surreal to have created such a mess of my life and to have created this hellish ground hog day for myself. At least I have the option of going through the removal process again. At least I can access the credit to pay for my mistakes. Wish me luck.",09May2018,1,
71,"I just want to live a simple happy life yet what seems like hundreds of issues mentally/physically/emotionally/socially/other make it seem unreachable. I feel like everything I try to help myself/get helps makes things worst and the more I fail the most weak I get. It’s a terrible cycle that I’ve been facing for years (currently 17 in high school)

72,"This started a year and two months ago, it doesn't happen everyday it's really only happened 10-15 times at night since it started. Pretty much what happens is I'll start to feel very anxious, then depressed, then very scared then very happy but not the ""I feel terrific"" sort of happy more like ""something is definitely not right with me right now"" happy. Then it gets pretty crazy, everything speeds up like I'm watching life on fast forward, I feel intense emotions that I haven't felt before, my body vibrates, and my thoughts are out of control and I'm imaging slot of things (not hallucinating, just visualizing) and my brain feels very weird and when I look around my room everything looks kinda alienish. 

When these episodes happen I have to constantly sub-vocalize something because I fear if I don't I'll completely lose control of my mind. It's a very terrifying experience when it happens, last night was the worst episode and also the worst night of my life. I felt that I was barely clinging onto my mind and was gonna completely lose it.

The weird thing is when I finally fall asleep, I wake up the next day completely fine, a little shaken up from the night before but with no issues. Then I go a few weeks or a month with nothing then it comes out of nowhere again.

What really makes me feel bad about it is that I think of all the people who have a legitimate reason to feel like this and then there is me with decent grades in school, lots of friends, and very kind and loving parents. I used to play a lot of video games, not fun anymore.  Used to play soccer, not fun anymore. Used to play guitar, not fun anymore. I used to really enjoy music class, it was my favorite, don't enjoy it anymore. I also find it weird that I feel worse somehow when I get home from school, even though I typically am the type of student to just wait for the bell to dismiss us rather than actually be productive in class.

For the last 4-5 years, I have struggled with what I would call depression,
however, for the last 3, I wouldn't say thats the proper diagnosis.
I have lost touch with reality at this point. I sometimes feel that life isn't real and that our lives are actually plotted/scripted and that our outcomes are predetermined. On top of this, I feel as if some strangers arent really people and that they are just 'simulated'. I know this sounds fucked but i have always been a very deep thinker to the point where I pretty much lose my mind.
What causes me to feel so isolated and hopeless is the symptoms I have are so random. At one time I thought I had ADD because I have memory struggles, problems focusing, I ramble on endlessly, and I have a hard
time staying interested in things such as work, household tasks, or hobbies. I have also experience really bad anhedonia that seems to be on and off. Mostly on. 
Today, I am amidst some sort of crisis. Its not just questioning my purpose and trying to understand reality, but trying to understand what is wrong with me. I have been treated for depression with several antidepressants yet most symptoms persist. 
I am running very low on faith that my life will ever feel worth it. I have tried sooo hard not to give up but I am getting tired. You can only hear people say ""its okay, things will get better"" or ""dont give up yet"" for so long before it all sounds fake.

76,"I have panic attacks sometimes that really aren't triggered by anything. I can just be laying in bed and then suddenly the sky is crashing down and I am shaking and sweating. The best way I can describe it is that feeling of horror and dread that I character in a slasher film feels right before they are murdered, except I'm lying in bed doing NOTHING. Unrelated however are my real melt down episodes: When I am arguing with someone (usually my boyfriend but not just him) I end up in a complete breakdown that I have difficulty describing. I shut down completely. I am unable to speak. I am shaking and crying, trapped in my own head. When I say trapped in my own head, I mean that I can respond to what's going on in my head but I can't make words come out of my mouth. All I end up saying is ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, help me!"" The room is spinning and everything else. The only things I can think of are not making anyone else mad or upset or whatever. After the meltdown described above^ that's kind of hard. I keep thinking that the person is going to hurt me or they want me gone in some way. I don't behave like a rational human, but its not voluntary. I know that I am melting down and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I don't know what to do. I looked all around the internet and nothing really explains what's going on. Panic disorder fits the first part, but usually there is something that triggers the attacks. I can't find anything that would explain the frequent and severe breakdowns that I talked about in the second part.
