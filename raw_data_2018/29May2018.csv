I understand more when this comes over me when I am around other people and become anxious, but a lot of the time this feeling comes over me even why I am alone and not anxious. It is a very debilitating feeling and I am extremely anxious around other people when I feel this way as I feel I can't function correctly. This feeling comes over me and goes away again all the time. I get it multiple times a week and it usually lasts between 3 to 5 hours.",29May2018,4,

4,"I'll try to keep this concise, although it's difficult. I've known my husband since we fell in love at 16 years old. We married right after graduating from college at 22 years old and just had our five year wedding anniversary. We've had a very loving and close relationship. My hubby is a compassionate man and a deep thinker. He is studying philosophy in graduate school. Over the last year and a half, he started having anxiety and depression. He could not work a job and began failing out of graduate classes for not going to school or doing the assignments. He withdrew from me and would not tell me what he was experiencing. He also started withdrawing from friends and family, not hanging out with anyone or returning calls. He said he had PTSD from relationships and his childhood, even though in the past he spoke very highly of his friendships, family members, and childhood experience. He wouldn't sleep at night, often staying up until 4 or 5 am, and would fixate on projects \(like wood carving, building, etc\) for most of the day and become irritable when interrupted. Around a month ago he had a sudden breakdown and started asking if people were plotting against him. That next week \(on my birthday, actually\) he told me he had been having an affair with our mutual friend for around 3 months and wanted to divorce me and marry her. His parents came and took him back to their house a few hours away to help figure out what was going on. He has delusions \- thinks people are monitoring him through phones and electronic devices, thinks all these unrelated people and organizations in his life have been doing a big family ""study"" and family relationship ""intervention"" since he was a child, talks to himself, has insinuated his logic is infallible and he is a prophet of God, etc. His thoughts are disorganized and he has loose associations. His short term memory and reading comprehension have also been affected, which is hard for me to see, since he has always had so much interest in literature and is a skilled writer. He visited a psychotherapist and a psychiatrist and they have given a working diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I with psychotic features and put him on an antipsychotic. He has been on it around 5 days and not much has changed yet. I love my husband dearly. He has been my best friend and biggest influence on my life for the last 12 years. I'm willing to do anything for him and stay by his side no matter how strange or ugly things get. I love him unconditionally. I just have a few questions for you:

* How long does it take medication to start working? He is on asenapine \(an atypical\).
* How can I best love and support him right now?
* He is willing to take the meds but doesn't seem to accept that he is in psychosis. I think he still thinks it's all part of a scheme. Any suggestions on how to approach that?
* I believe his care for the affair partner is real. What I'm less convinced about is his sudden desire \(it apparently was not part of his plans to end our marriage until around the ""break"" happened\) to divorce me and marry her. She has recently asked him for two months without communication so that she has time to cope and process things and blocked him on her phone so there wouldn't be temptation. One day into it, he became very agitated and kept trying to reach out to her. He said two months were over in ""God's time."" He also keeps talking to me about her without seeming to recognize that it's painful for me. I can't figure out what is ""real"" \(sorry, I don't know what word is better to use\) or what is part of the delusion and disorganized thinking. Is there much hope of him returning to me as my husband and partner in life?
* Any encouragement? My heart sometimes feels like it is hanging by a thread.",29May2018,9,

7,"I'm feeling pretty great actually.

I remember I used to care about work. I used to have interests. I used to be restless enough to do things. Then I kind of started hating my self, life, and existing. This in turn slowly destroyed my ability to function. It got bad, so I started on antidepressants, and they seemed to work as described. My overall baseline mood improved.

Still don't give a shit though. About literally anything. Zero passion. Zero effort. Just having to get groceries makes me feel inconvenienced in a bigger way than pre-depression.

Now I'm content in a 'good day' kind of way but just want to lie around all day. Can barely put effort into the minimum taking care of myself. Can't get shit done for work, am blowing through all my deadlines.

I was kind of hoping antidepressants would change that, since all that came with the depression. Yet, now I can get as pumped as I want, take stimulants, whatever... I'll just end up browsing the web for a bit, eating, and fucking around all day. Zero day every day.

It's like I lost control of my life but now with antidepressants I'm OK with that and continue to have no control of my life.

The inner me wants control of my life, and to be passionate about work again. The real me continues to give no fucks.

Guys what's going on. The negative internal monologues and negative thought patterns are still there. Those didn't go away. I'm just more chipper about them instead. It doesn't make any sense.

I think I'm beginning to understand why antidepressants raise the risk of suicide? I'm just OK with anything despite nothing being OK.",29May2018,1,
8,"So I have a friend going through a rough patch and I'm just looking for some general advice. She's 19 years old, finished her first year of college (away from home), and is now home for the summer. We've been friends forever and she's always been a fairly negative person when things go wrong, but she also has a fun time. She just gets stressed out by situations very easily, and always goes to the worst case scenario. She's a very smart, very attractive girl though.

Anyway, since going away to college she's often told me how she feels like she has no friends (which she does, plenty of), she hated her room (specifically her roommate), and she hated school. She couldn't wait to come home for the summer, but now she hates it here. She hates her family (they're not very close), she doesn't have friends here (all of her friends from school are from all over the state), and she is just constantly stressed.

Within the past week or so she's started talking to me more about the possibility that she may have depression. She thinks it's a serious possibility but hates the idea of being medicated. She has a cat (which she got partially for emotional support), but she often gets frustrated with it. 

My main question is...where can I find resources for her to at least speak to someone? She doesn't have health insurance (in between coverage) and can't afford to pay someone. Any idea where I should look or call?",29May2018,1,

10,"It's really hard to start this post. I've started and deleted things multiple times now so I'm just gonna start typing and see what happens. I feel like I'm going insane. I wake up every day feeling like a different person. Almost like different emotions take control and auto pilot me through my days. Things that use to bring me A LOT of joy are becoming more and more dull to me. I've been hallucinating seeing people I served in the military with everywhere I go that has people. It has led to me not leaving the house much in the past 5 months. I moved near San fransisco for school (5 months ago) and am living with my aunt who is rarely ever home (shes retired, wealthy and travels a lot). I only leave to go to the grocery store, jiujitsiu or the gym. The only other times I've left the house is to go to the VA a couple times for appointments and treatment. I feel like they didn't listen to me. I have been experiencing so many different mental issues like extreme paranoia, the whole seeing people thing, and just the overall feeling of feeling like a different person every day. They labeled me depressed and for the remainder of my time at the VA  they just keep telling me its depression and that meds will help. I feel like they just turn me away though because I'm not fucked up enough or something. I was recently prescribed bupropion and been taking the recommended dose for about 10 days now? I'm not sure honestly. Days tend to blur together because I do nothing with them. I've been having these extremely violent thoughts that I can't escape. Every time i walk by someone, i think they're going to assault me and i imagine defending myself or just wonder what it would be like to beat them severely or worse. I fear that one day I will snap and that will happen or the unlucky bastard who confronts me is going to be my canvas which I paint a bloody picture with my fists. I've always felt like an outcast and different from everyone. I've never been in a darker place than I have been these past few months. I've had a couple suicide... I wouldnt say attempts? But I did hold a gun to my head just wishing I had the balls to pull the trigger. Truthfully the only reason I didnt was because it was my buddies gun and I was watching his cat for him at his apartment and I didnt want the repercussions of me killing myself in his place to burden him. I feel like I constantly forget things too. It makes it difficult to talk to doctors because I always forget to mention major problems because i forget about them. In my last 2 months of the semester, I felt so stressed out that I literally could not read. I felt mentally retarded or like I had developed a learning disability. It caused me to fail two out of three of my classes which will result in me having to pay the tuition fees covered by the post 9/11 GI Bill. I've been becoming more and more distant with my wife (we are currently going through a period of long distance relationship) and fear I am only going to hurt her (emotionally, I would never harm her intentionally) or disappoint her. I want her to take all my money and leave me. I feel my whole life falling apart and becoming a dark void and all I want to do now is either die or blow all my money traveling or something and then kill myself. My wife told me to go to reddit for help telling me millions of people feel like me... if millions of people felt like me, the world would be destroyed, on fire, total anarchy. I've been trying to talk to family and friends about my issues but the more I do, the worse it gets and the more I feel like a complete freak. ",29May2018,2,

I know I have issues with self-harm (I don’t do it anymore, but I can’t say I won’t do it again for sure) and I know that’s definitely not okay, but I really can’t afford therapy nor do I really trust therapists with my feelings.

14,"I'm a 16 year old female and have had a personal and family history of mental issues. It really strarted around the age of 8/9 my grandfather died. Recently after that began to believe my father was trying to poison me and kill me. I didn't want to go anywhere because I was afraid someone was going to hurt me. Then, during the summer of that year I was convinced a clot of dirt came out of the ground with a glowing fire coming out as I heard demonic laughter. Years past after that without any hallucinations (I guess that's what they were). Then I had my diagnosis of depression and that lasted until I was about 14. Then when I was 15 my best friend that I became very close with and had romantic feelings for basically stepped out of my life completely. (It was a lot more complicated than that.) It took an extremely hard toll on me causing me to fail classes, start using drugs and alcohol, I was extremely unstable and refused to go to any of my classes,  I would feel as though I was unreal, I became extremely lethargic and even mildly catatonic. Then in September I started to hear my thoughts and voices. I felt like I wasn't even alive. I believed that I was in a movie and people were watching me. I felt like I just ""checked out"". After I was put on a low dose of Haldol and Trileptal, my therapist and I had a session with my parents and got their point of view. My therapist told me I showed strong characteristics of BPD with psychosis. So after being on meds and going through DBT, I've become much more stable. Though I'm better, I'm still concerned. I no longer have extreme mood swings and I can cope with what happened which is great! But, I still don't feel here. I feel like my friends hate me, I believe my family is trying to kill me and my parent, I sleep with knives because I'm afraid. I still feel like people (mainly people I know) are watching me through my windows, and I still feel like I'm not alive. I feel like I'm in a fog or a constant high (mainly just spacey). I've been having memory problems, my grades have dropped, and my focus is not there.  I've been losing interest in band and choir (my favourite classes). It's basically just clockwork anymore. I haven't been talking to my friends that much anymore. I don't really want to talk to anybody except a few people. I just feel so dead, yet I can be happy a good majority of the time.

16,"So, folks, I've OCD, and hence a shitload of intrusive thoughts, however, they're getting a little out of hand, and they're utterly irrational, and kind of delusional. I've had weed-induced depersonalization, and ever since, I haven't felt the same. However, it comes, and goes in waves. I'm afraid that it might be psychosis, and not depersonalization. I was completely cut off with reality, and I had intense flashbacks, like, I've time-traveled. But, like, it only transitioned into a full blown depersonalization after 10 days of having pot. I'm afraid that it might've given me psychosis. My OCD has gotten too fucking severe, and I obsess over every little thought, it's so fucking insane. I always feel like that someone might try to malign me, like, I have thoughts, and they don't go away until I entertain them to cope with anxiety. I've so many similar thoughts, and I obsess over them, for instance, thinking that everyone around me might be a clone, or I might've sold my soul to the devil. It's like things are starting to get to me, and everything is a trigger. I watched a movie about murder, the other day, I started to recall if I've ever murdered anyone. I start to compare myself with every dark thing, and I dwell on my past like hell, everyday, it's a fucking ritual. Moreover, I've thoughts like: 'Have I ever cyberbullied anyone', after watching a movie on bullying. Another time, I read a thing about laced xanax, and I used to use xanax, and a thought popped up in my mind: 'Have I ever sold laced-xanax to anyone?' 
Ok, so, I don't even sell anything, lmao. I don't know what the fuck is going on, and everything just gets to me. I can't seem to enjoy anything, and I don't feel like going out. I'm so fucking isolated.

18,"Hello everyone. I am a 25 year old male/ practicing Catholic.

Long story short:

I traveled to Rome to undergo the 30-day Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola. In preparation for the retreat (back in March), the director of the retreat told me he wanted me to get off my anti-anxiety medication. I was on 100 mg of Zoloft, and for 7.5 years, this medication very much took care of my severe anxiety/intrusive thoughts. The retreat director wanted to work with me ""without any medicinal influence"". And so, I obliged. However, I ended up having a full-blown panic attack without it. The intrusive thoughts returned full-force. The retreat director told me that ""grace will be enough"" &amp; that I had to choose between the retreat &amp; my medication. And so, we agreed to part ways.
-
By way of background-- 8 years ago I experienced trauma to the point that I had to receive professional psychological help, in addition to spiritual direction &amp; the sacraments. My intrusive thoughts were centered on the topic of ""God's will"" &amp; the many 'what if's' involved in God/Christianity-- for example, ""what if God wants me to be a monk &amp; I want to get married?"" &amp; other irrational fears. 8 years ago, I was in a Catholic seminary which regarded such intrusive thoughts as the voice of God-- for example, if I have obsessive thoughts about becoming a missionary, that means God wants me to be one. These fears/outside reinforcement was coupled by abuse I experienced by a priest on the staff. The time of my life, a full year of college, was the darkest I have ever experienced and many times I thought about suicide as a way to escape the mental torture I was in. However, thanks to a very good priests who is my spiritual director, medical professionals, a loving and supporting family, and God (whom I still very much believe in), I began to receive therapy while on Zoloft (100 mg). The effects of such therapy and medication were obvious in this-- I felt almost completely healed. I did not feel any anxiety with prayer, and the topic of ""God's will"" wasn't an obsessive focus, nor was it understood in an unhealthy way as before.

For 8 years, I had experienced remission &amp; healing... and in a matter of days, my recovery was shattered.
-
Without going into more details, let me just encourage you-- if you are a Christian, it's OKAY to receive professional help for psychological issues. You shouldn't be told that ""the saints didn't need medicine for anxiety, so neither do you"". Medicine &amp; science are a great gift from God. Up until this, I have never, in my life, met a priest who told someone to get off anti-anxiety medication. I feel hurt, betrayed, and wounded.
_
And so, I'm back home, where I will continue to see my spiritual director, frequent the sacraments, &amp; resume therapy/medication. I'm very frustrated, discouraged, and disappointed. I just needed to get this off my chest. I am the lowest I've felt psychologically since the hellish experience of my freshman year of seminary.",29May2018,3,

22,"Warning: length

She's just out of high school, her family tried to get a house but failed due to getting screwed over by the realty company, and now they all live together in an RV and they have to travel around for work. I found out about this because we're in a Discord server together, she mentioned it once.

Ever since I found this out months ago it's been eating me alive. I get feeling bad for her situation, but the guilt is so extreme for me that it's pervaded every aspect of my life. I haven't eaten or slept properly for months since learning about it, so much so that my grades were slipping because I was so tired every day. I can't even feel happy anymore - every time I do, the voice in my head says ""she's still homeless, you're still sitting here with your comfortable life doing jack shit to help her, why are you even alive, you should kill yourself"" and then it just comes back in overwhelming waves.

She isn't even that close of a friend to me - she's a friend of the server owner, who is a close friend of mine. Yet I feel like I was responsible for making her homeless. I feel nothing but overwhelming shame for her situation, like I personally took her home away from her. Logically I know that that's nonsensical and that she would've been in the situation whether I was there or not, but the thoughts keep coming: ""You're to blame. You destroyed her life, you monster. You're taking everything she ever cared away from her.""

The guilt is so bad that it makes me want to end my own life, and keep in mind that prior to learning about her it had been a year since I'd had any legitimately suicidal thoughts. The only thing that really keeps me alive is the idea that I can still save her, that if I get a good enough job and work enough hours that I'll be able to give her enough money to get a real home, to protect her and her family from pain.

I told her about how I feel, about how I obsessed over her and how guilty I felt and hire desperate I was to do something to help her, she basically said that it wasn't that bad because they still had each other as a family and they were looking for a house and they were going to be alright, but in the course of the conversation I found out her mom had to go through dialysis because her kidneys were failing, and of course that just made me feel even worse because I can't get a job or any real money for another few weeks, and then on top of that I feel guilty for being so selfish and feeling bad when she's the one going through this and that I shouldn't get to feel bad, and then I felt guilty for feeling guilty when feeling that way isn't going to help her at all.

She's a talented artist, she cares about what she does and she loves doing it. Even though she barely has anything, she still draws regularly and shares it with us, and were she more fortunate she'd be able to make a career out of it easily. It feels so unfair, that she has so little and yet has potential I'll never have in my life. I wish I could somehow give up my good life and transfer all my blessings to her, honestly she deserves them more than I do.

She told me she didn't really need my help, but still gave me her PayPal and essentially said that if giving her money would ease my own conscience that I could do it. For some reason, hearing her say that simultaneously made me feel better and worse, like now I have no excuse to not be helping her and yet I still have no money and I'm doing nothing.

Some part of me knows this is unhealthy, but in general i feel like if I don't do everything I can to help her, that I won't get to pretend I'm a good person anymore and I should kill myself. I know this extremely negative mindset is clouding my judgment and I need help getting over the guilt and looking at the situation more clearly so I can help her better.

Tl;Dr found out my friend is homeless, and since finding out the guilt over her situation has consumed me to the point where I can no longer function. I need help looking at this in a healthier way.",29May2018,1,

I called the crisis team and feel really annoyed and felt the conversation was a bit patronising... i said I wanted to stay in bed all day and she said ""if you do the same thing every day you'll get what you always get"" I mean, I know I decided against it, but I tried to tell her that when I'm around people it doesn't help. She was nice, wasn't rude or anything, but I feel a bit annoyed. I don't know, I really don't want to be on my own and I don't feel like I can socialise right now.

27,"I don't even know if i would call it sadness, I just feel defeated, and desperately want someone to talk to. My husband is in jail, my family is 1000 miles away, I have no friends... I feel so isolated. I was actually feeling pretty good, despite the fact that I think I'm developing a lactose intolerance, so hello new health concern.  My husband's dog \(German shepherd, very loyal to only him, as German shepherds sometimes are\) is totally out of my control, and no idea what to do. On top of that I probably killed him because he spent a whole day outside in the desert and has been acting strange since. plus he clearly has some small injury on his paw that he won't let me look at. Anyways I came home from work today exhausted a hectic weekend to find he had shit and pissed on the floor as well as destroyed 3 sets of blinds. I lost my temper \(which I almost never do, I've only ever struck another being once and that was a person who deserved it\) and hit him which I instantly  felt racked with guilt about. the whole situation just felt really bad. I've been lying to my husband about getting things done around the house \(like oil changes on the car, and taking care of the pool\), as well as money I've been spending that I shouldn't \(nothing expensive or out of control, but still\) so there's more drawn out guilt. Now I sit here staring at my fast\-food dinner with disgust, a packed dirty bong on my lap, I just want to cry for like an hour, but I can't even do that. I'm just so overwhelmed and at a total loss for what to do.

Edit: forgot to mention the minor visual hallucinations recently, so I think I might be actually slowly going insane, so there's that fun worry too. I want professional help, but can't afford it.",29May2018,1,

Ever since then I've felt my mental health hadn't been so great and I feel not as mentally healthy as I did 3+ days ago. I somewhat feel as if my vision is a little more blurry than usual and I feel a little disconnected more than usual. I also feel as if I'm more anxious than usual. 

Does anyone have any thoughts about this? ",29May2018,3,

33,"I feel like no matter what I do or where I go my life is doomed to be boring, awful, and no good. I feel like I will never have any friends, never have a good job that I enjoy, never have a good home, never fall in love, never be happy. I know it's just the depression. I know those things aren't true, but no matter how many times someone else tells me that they're lies or how many times I tell myself, I still believe them. All I see is the end of a tunnel. I never get out, it just ends. I just hit a wall and it's over. I'm walking through a narrow, black, meaningless tunnel and one day I'll just hit the end. I believe in a God. I grew up believing that there was a plan for my life, but now that I'm older, I'm realizing that some plans aren't good. I'm losing trust and hope in everything. I just feel like I'm floating day to day and it's all so meaningless. I'm just getting older, as much as I push for change, everything stays the same. I'm changing, I'm trying to change, but the world won't let me. My situation won't let me. I apply for jobs, I work hard at school, I try to find friends, yet I still fail time and time again. I don't know that there's really anything anyone can say, I just thought I would vent. Maybe someone out there feels the same, since nobody close understands. ",29May2018,1,

35,"I'm a 38/m who has a history of mental illness and I feel like I'm at another breaking point. I was diagnosed with schizo-affect disorder as a teen and spent over a month as an inpatient and years as an out patient programs. I was prescribed an assortment of  antipsychotic, antidepressants, anti anxiety medication but felt better only after weaning my self off of them. I went from having no purpose or hope to finding gainful employment, a wife, a house and a beautiful daughter. 

I've progressively been feeling worse and worse over the past 5 years or so, to the point now where I avoid most social situations outside of work and it's everything I can do to make it through the day. I have felt my attitude/temper/energy and thought processing change dramatically over the past few months and I worry I'm nearing or am already at a state of full blown phycosis. 

I enjoy my work but there's a tension between my employer and I and I feel he's been slandering my name to our clients as an way to prevent me from leaving him to start my own business. (I know how crazy this sounds) but I've witnessed him do it with other people. 

I am actively seeking other employment but I fear I don't have the energy/fortitude or wearwithall to succeed. 

Does anyone know of any sort of relief program for people in situations like mine? I have mortgage insurance although I don't know if I'm covered for medical leave. I live in Ontario Canada.

36,"A lot of people from all walks of life place this trust in me and tell me a lot of things they wouldn't otherwise share, and it's eating me up inside. It's making me hate. The voices are starting to get louder and I can't bare this all any longer.

Last night a friend was talking about very dark things and then suddenly stopped responding and the idea of them being gone is killing me, I need to know if they're ok or not. I need to know that they're still here alive and well as can be. But all I can do is sit and wait for a response, which I pray comes. I'm not religious but if there is a god out there I'm begging for their safety.

I need to know if they're ok or not, the fact that I don't know is killing me and I feel useless in all of this. I can't lose anyone else, another friend recently took their own life and my only regret was not being there for them when they needed it most. I just want this all to stop.

Last night the voices convinced me that my friend (the one who stopped responding) was gone and just the thought, it fucking kills. They want me to hurt people but I don't want to but the urges are so strong so I took all the sleeping pills I had and obviously it didn't work but they did make me feel like shit. My whole body feels heavy and my mind feels clouded and distant.

I just want this all the bad to end it's not fucking fair how the best people get dealt the shittest hands. I promise this now if my friend is gone, I'm gone too because I'll know then that there is no god, there is no good, no justice only evil in this world.

39,"I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm going fucking crazy! I don't know where to start.

I've had social anxiety forever, but it comes and goes in waves, its at the point again where its getting worse, and I don't know what to do! I have no money! I've been sober for like a week now and I fucking hate it, This conscious state is so shit I don't want to be in it! I can't talk to anyone, I just feel pain or nothing. I use to just use weed, and occasionally other drugs to help me, But I don't have any money atm and I need to pay for things, so I can't. The last time I did anything, I took like 5 pills and sniffed ketamine. It was so beautiful and a stronger trip than I've had from acid, with a weird enjoyable ego death, where I actually really liked the person I had become. I've gotten comfortable in my own skin, due to my drug use, I would love to, but no doctor or therapist has ever help me anywhere near the amount that drugs have! The only reason my anxiety goes and comes is because I was addicted to xannax, but now I don't take it and it goes and comes like I have bi polar wig anxiety (I don't take xans anymore.)

I try speaking to my doctor today, and she just tells me it doesn't seem like something I can't get over, I told her about how I really have deep thoughts on hurting myself, with my family being the only reason I don't, I don't want to disappoint or upset them. My doctor gave me this site, thats meant to help people up to 19, but when I rang they said it only helps up to 17, my doctor told me to ring these people because just about all the cancelling where I live has been cut. (Essex, England).

Now, I'm starting to see and hear shit! It gets worse when I cant' sleep, But even if I do sleep, I still get this, like I'm sleep deprived. I sleep at 10 pm and wake up at 7 - 9 am. And I'll still get this. I'll be walking down a estate, and hear ever door lock as I walk past, or I'll see a person looking at me out their door, I'll turn and the door is shut, Or I'll hear people talking and walking behind me, to turn and see no one. I'm getting worried, as I know weed is meant to not be able to course schizophrenia but bring it out in people that already have potential for it. I don't know enough about mental health to know how valid this is, But I don't think I want to live sober the rest of my life. I am so anxious, but no one helps because I need to ask for it! But I can't because I'm afraid, if I do ask, I need to push it so hard so that I actually get anything, I don't have any motivation to do this! I just can't. I don't know what to do. No one cares and no one is going to.

I don't even think I'm worth anything anyway. I couldn't work a real job. I'm clumsy as fuck and I get fired from any job I get, even though I try my hardest, I still always get moaned at for for forgetting things, (I've been like this since before I ever took any drugs). I want to work in tv and film but I can't even get the motivation to finish my essays, I sit in front of my computer for hours, typing absolute shit, that means nothing and I alternately have to delete as I'm over the world count and I haven't even finished one point yet. I straight, and I can't talk to girls. I have even stopped to talking to guys because I've felt so lonely, but I really don't see why I need to be alive. I can't give anything to society! I can't give anything romantically, and the only things I'm actually good at. (Tv and Film and music). I need to talk to people and make contacts to ever even think about working there! Whats the point! I'm just gonna end up a fucking crack head like all the fucking older people where I live, constantly trying to pay of debt so I can do more drugs and make myself feel good.

40,"Greetings, my screen name is nordic and I'm 16, currently finishing high school in the UK. For some background information, I am autistic and have dealt with some self\-esteem issues in the past, though the possibility of being mentally ill is still unclear to me.

I have dealt with self harm \(Haven't done it in 2 months, but the urge is hard to control\) and suicidal tendencies \(And past attempts and plans\) before. These have been caused by a bit of a rich past with bullying \(Due to my overweight body, hostile behaviour and frequent breakdowns\), unstable friendships and some discouragement from my parents \(Which actually has the biggest impact on me\).

To put it simple with my feelings, I would either be anxious or angry about whether my ""friends"" would care about me to begin with and start avoiding them, the vague worry that I'll break down and make a fool out of myself, or that I will become so angry I will genuinely hurt someone \(Which I did before, but more so to intentionally get hated on\) and feelings of invalidity that cause me to keep feelings away from others even though I sometimes feel like I have no control on the way I open up to others. \(Also worrying about having my venting reach to my parents, when they would only make me feel worse\)

I did CBT before, and to be honest, I disliked it. The therapist was alright as an individual, but I felt like I already understood the cycle of my feelings during the first session, and the questions felt intrusive, and whether I would try to add up an amusing simile to soften the edge, it would be taken literally, which I found embarrassing, not to mention I had to fake some of my feelings \(I.e. hide away my suicidal thoughts at the time\) so I won't be put into safeguarding and my parents won't find out.

I had social workers and nurses come to my school for me too. Same thing, saying that I'm mostly fine in hope that my parents won't see it and question it. I've also been to emergency for my breakdowns. The only excuse from my parents: Autism.

At this point in time, I try to keep myself stable by avoiding everything that would make me break down: I have fallen out with all my friends, I keep everything away from my parents and try to keep a casual mood \(Things seem fine at the moment so that's cool\), and tend to have some small phases of starvation \(Things like scales and calories cause me anxiety too, but that is a side topic\). I have a couple internet friends I often talk to, but one is depressed already \(Not to mention a young adult\) and I fear that venting too much to him would add up to his already messed mood, though I do try to support him as much as I can.

So as a summary: I feel like my feelings are constantly invalid and if I show any negative emotion to my parents, they will drive me to a breakdown and possibly another suicide plan. I have tried some online counselling but it only feels even more embarrassing to me. The plan that I have now is to try to stay strong until I finish my education and become financially independent and seek help on my own without the barriers that currently confine me. But for the moment, what do you suggest?",29May2018,2,
41,"So this might be a broken record with everyone else’s posts here, but maybe someone can lend some insight. I’m a 30 year old male. Ever since I’ve been having sex, I’ve had a very hard time reaching orgasm with a partner. I feel like I’d have to really concentrate hard and clench up to reach orgasm, and the orgasms just feel...underwhelming. When I masturbate alone, though sometime reaching orgasm is a liiiiittle hard, I usually have no problems cumming. My orgasms usually are pretty good solo. I’m bisexual, and the issue of preference to a gender has always caused me great amounts of stress. I feel like I really have a hard time performing and staying hard with women, and less so with men. I still desire women, but anytime I’m intimate with one, I feel so much pressure to cum and stay hard, that I end up going soft and not cumming. When I’m with a guy, I also sometimes have a hard time reaching orgasm, but not as much as with women. It’s almost like when I’m having sex with someone, everything seems mechanical and not that pleasurable. When I masturbate I get more into it. I do only masturbate to porn though. I almost feel like I’ve conditioned myself to only be able to cum with porn. 

I’ve also always kind of dealt with either anxiety or depression, but recently, this December, the anxiety got so bad that i was put on an antidepressant by my doctor (10mg of lexapro). I know antidepressants have a negative effect on sexual performance, but i almost don’t notice a difference because I’ve always had a very hard time with this. 

I haven’t slept with a woman in like 3 years, and have only slept with men, and even then, it’s been mostly me giving them oral until they cum, and then me finishing myself off. I felt a lot of pressure when I thought about sleeping with a woman, but I did want to. Tonight I had sex with a woman, and it was like usual. Couldn’t stay hard, got too tired too quickly, and couldn’t cum. I feel really defeated and sexually broken. I don’t know what to do anymore. ",29May2018,3,

Just looking for others experiences really. I have started taking Prozac about 6 weeks ago for depression and eating disorder which involves bulimic tendencies. 

So far it's going incredibly well and I have no urge to make myself sick at all for the first time in a LOT of years. Obviously I'm really pleased with how it's going, it feels like the urge has just been deleted. 

But I'm nervous because I feel like this can't last forever and I'm not sure what the long term kind of effects of Prozac on this are.

Now I'm not so sure. What do I do? I don't want to get hung up on a diagnosis but also feel it could help me reach out to other people with same issue and find resources to help me. I'm so divided and I think I'm just agreeing to much in general to what they are telling me while at the same time I think they don't believe me at all and give me sugar pills that make me always drowsy (supposedly aripiprazole 10mg).

46,"I don’t really want to state what country I’m in, I’m very paranoid lately, but it’s UK. If I can edit that out, please let me know right away. 
For around a year now, I’ve suffered from an unknown mental illness. I have depression, anger issues and anxiety. But this unknown one I’ve been informed may be caused by trauma. 
I know I am traumatised as there’s been a lot of bad events in my life that I should of received help for or spoken about to get help. 
So far, it’s assumed that I’ve got Dissociative Disorder as my doctor said. Which wasn’t what I thought I had, I thought I developed Schizophrenia as I’ve got a friend who also developed it at a stage in his life. (He’s coping very well, he’s given me some tips which I’ve found helpful). 
I hear a lot of glitched laughter, voices, a main voice I have dubbed her Diana. She sings, pressures me to do things, talks shit about me to the point I sometimes reply. I hear angry heavy Male breathing when I feel violent. The breathing sounds familiar but I don’t know who it’s from, I just know I know. 
I often tremble out of no where especially when I’m paranoid my hands shake, or I tear up even though I’m not distressed or crying, I just tear up. 
I see various things, sometimes I see my past self but very distorted, kind of like a glitch, I see a hooded figure, there’s nothing in the hood, I’ve taken to calling him “Hoodie”. I see random bits of debris and rubble, sometimes making me confused. I’ve walked into multiple things or people because I thought they weren’t real. I also see like flying fish, just giant koi flying happily through the sky. It’s surreal, and I don’t understand. 
I get confused with pictures because sometimes the images move and they stare back at me. I often confuse them with gifs. 
I thought this was schizophrenia, it sounded like it, it still does. The dissociative disorder I looked up, but it doesn’t sound like my problem, it sounds like it should be affecting my personality, not my head. 
Does anyone have any experience with this and know some things I do not? ",29May2018,2,
47,"  In the past, I noticed. I lied a lot. To everyone, even myself. I would pretend and say things that weren't true, or just exaggerated completely. After this became a thought and I noticed my problem. I took action immediately. With the loss of my closest friend, I had to change. Not my just my sake but everyone elses. So they know me, for who I am and not the stories I tell. So I began to see a therapist who, embraced my thoughts. She told me, instead of fightin them. Channel them into a train of thought. So I did.  


 This was a huge turn in my life simply because I seen my mental health increasing greatly. I knew I was a liar by nature. And why would I lie about myself. If I could lie about something else. Someone else. A story, made by me. I took my urges and brought them to paper. Now, I am 2 full stories in. 300pages each. I kept myself focused on a story, constantly thinking up a huge lie. A fantasy to me is the ultimate lie. And one I can touch and add to everytime I feel the need. And nobody can complain, nor will it hurt anybody. As it is a story created straight from my imagination, to entertain. Not to deceive.

 This has been the greatest acheivement in my life. Changing how I think for the better. And allowing me to do something I love and enjoy. Even if it's just for my eyes, and to keep my from hurting anyone else. It is working for me. And maybe some day, I can polish the stories. And try to get them published. I took my flaw, and turned it into something great. Because I had to. Thank you for anyone who has read this. I hope anyone else who is struggling, can maybe take my idea to their own hands.

49,"Hello, my depressive episodes have gotten so  bad to the point where I've skipped probably around 2\-3 days \(on  average\) of school a week roughly since the end of April. My parents are  thoroughly frustrated with me, and I can understand that, but they  think I am making being depressed up. They think it's all a cop out so I  can skip school \(why would I want to miss school and miss out on life  wtf that's irrational\). I am not functional. I do not go out anymore,  all I do is eat,sleep and browse the internet. I feel empty and numb \(no  way else to describe it\) I am not making this up and I am really angry  that my Mother and Father would think such things.

Due  to my depressive episodes, I stay up all night or until really shitty  hours \(like 4\-5AM\) because my sleep pattern is really messed up because I  usually sleep 16 hours or more a day or 5 hours or less a day \(there's  no in between\). I do not go on the internet during these times because  my parents shut off the router most nights after midnight. Long story  short, last night was one of those nights where I stayed up until 4\-5AM  ish. I was out cold and did not wake up this morning until NDad comes  home at 9AM to get me up.

He was  violently screaming, shouting. He didn't hit me this time because I  threatened to call the police flat out if he put a finger on me. So he  resorted to vandalizing MY property \(note; stuff I bought with my OWN  MONEY\). After he chased me out of bed, he grabbed my phone \(which I pay  for and bought myself because emom smashed the old one\) and smashed it  right on my bedroom floor right before my eyes. Then, he took a bunch of  my moving bags \(filled with my clothes, things I was going to put into  storage yadda yadda, before I moved out\) and threw them in the back of  his car to donate to value village.  At this point I was just crying.  So, I went downstairs to call eMom on the landline about what had  happened. Conversation was cut short because Ndad grabbed the landline  out of my hands and started talking to eMom about calling the police and  sending me to psychiatric ward.

After  conversation, him and eMom agreed that I would be sent away to some sort  of inpatient unit for depression, even though they think I am faking it  to take advantage of everyone \(which I am not by no means\). This means  that my plans to move out are officially canceled. Can't do anything  about it. Anyways, after NDad and eMom's conversation. NDad started  violently screaming at me again. He told me how much I was fucking the  family up, I was selfish for doing this, I wasn't normal \(I mean he is  right, depression is kind of selfish and not normal if you think about  it\). Then, he told me something that really struck me. He told me he  hated me sincerely and that I was mentally ill. I kid you fucking not.  He said "" I am not going to sugar coat this and say I hate your behavior  when in reality I hate YOU, YOU as a person \_\_\_\_\_, YOU!"". I suppose I  am the problem then. Maybe I am just externalizing and blaming  everything on my parents.

There is  something wrong with me, I don't know why I am so depressed. I am so  messed up. I am sorry mom and dad :\( I am sorry omg. I am so sorry. I  don't want to be sent away I don't want to no :\( NO: \(\(\(\(

I  am so fucking lost and I am about to be admitted to a psychiatric ward  after my parents come home from work. I don't know what to do. I can't  run away and my dad donated a lot of my clothes and he smashed my phone.  I am so done.",29May2018,4,
50,"My parents \(mainly my dad, though\) are rather critical of the fact that I suffer with ill\-mental health. 

Of April, I decided to withdraw myself from college \(sixth\-form, not what would be considered uni in the US\) because it was absolutely shredding me due to my depression and anxiety. Depression makes it hard to sleep so I am almost always tired \- couple that with the high intensity homework, I think you can get where I'm coming from. My anxiety made it hard to want to go anyway, I always questioned and doubted myself, it was a constant battle to convince myself to go to college, as you can imagine. I needed to defer this year. I'm glad I did because if I didn't, I'd be dead by now. 

My dad has absolutely slaughtered me \(verbally\) because of this, so much so that he has actually threatened to ""take away"" basic necessities like certain meals \(mainly dinner\). What's worse is that he suffers with depression himself so I expect a little bit of understanding, but he says, ""you've got nothing to be depressed about!"" or ""If you had my childhood, then you'd have an excuse to be depressed!"" But how I feel, and what I have experienced, is personal to me, therefore he has **no right** to say any of that. It's almost like he's the only one in the house who's allowed to be depressed; the rest of us are expected to suck our problems up. 

But anyway, I did say that I would go back to college next year and restart my studies. Until today, I had been on the waiting list for counselling, but I have finally received my start date. My dad then proceeds to say: ""So you're going back to college next year?"" to which, I reply, ""If the counselling helps, yes, because then I'll be able to cope,"" he then says, ""It has help, that's why they offer it, even if you don't think it does, and you're going back no matter what."" But clearly, this is a distorted view of counselling; not everyone benefits from it. After all, it is the most basic help there is.. if the problems are more complex, other interventions may be needed. Moreover, it's a completely warped understanding of mental health \- just because you've tried one means of help doesn't mean you're cured, you're still going to suffer immensely if it's proved to be little or no help.

How can I help them view mental health differently so that they understand the struggles I do go through? Because if I keep getting these distorted views and beliefs about my illnesses from my parents, it's gonna send me over the edge. I honestly can't cope.",29May2018,1,

54,Hi all. I don't have any major mental issues to address with therapist \(aside from ADHD\). Is it weird to see a therapist to just talk? Or do I need to go in with something specific to address. I have never been to therapy so it's new to me. Thanks,29May2018,1,
55,"For context, I don’t seem to enjoy anything anyone else does anymore,like going for walks or going to the cinema, going for a meal with friends or family, cooking for other people or for myself, gardening, going to a town and just walking around, going to gym, watching boxsets, reading. People find so much pleasure  in activities like this, but I’m just apathetic to it all I genuinely don’t derive any happiness from anything. 

The issue is I’m not sure I ever have so I can’t go back to that place where I did, the only thing for certain I can get feelings from is music and apart from the odd gig and festival and jamming sesh it’s a solitary existence and a lot of the stuff I listen to can be dark anyway like the smiths and joy division for example. 

For that reason I’m starting to think I’m probably very mentally unwell, but I don’t just want to be medicated to be happy again because surely that can only last so long and i know cbt is known to help with stuff like this but I’m just skeptical about it all. ",29May2018,2,
56,"Hello! I am concerned about a woman who I should not be concerned about at all. But I have been through depression and anxiety and I have too much empathy so I feel like I should do something. This post has two parts and might be a bit long, but please bare with me. The first part gives a little context to the situation and the second part gives a little information as to why I'm concerned about her.

Long story short, my husband had an affair a couple of months ago with this other woman. Since the affair, we have both decided to start our relationship from scratch and we are going to counseling. However, he got this other woman pregnant and he was prepared to take responsibility to support or care for the child or an abortion. In the end, they both decided an abortion would be the best decision in this situation \(I also made sure that my husband completely understood and respected her decision and did not pressure her into this decision\). He would have been supportive of the child if he was the father and I would not let him not be in that child's life \(I have PCOS so conceiving has been difficult and we want to start a family\). I helped him get through that drama of her not going through with a surgical abortion and then getting a pill for the abortion. After taking the pill and going to the follow up, she told my husband it did not work but it is most likely she will miscarry as she is bleeding on and off. Even though my husband went to the follow up with her, we do not have any confirmation of anything because she did not let him go in the exam room with her \(which is fine as it is her right\). So as of now, she is still pregnant and we do not know if she has taken any action to make a follow up appointment like she was supposed to do \(which should do the surgical abortion\) or if she is just waiting to miscarry. We have been hearing less and less from her since she took the pill but I know my husband wants to make sure she is okay.

A little bit about me before I explain the things I'm worried about. I'm a grad student and I do qualitative research where I look at how people use language to understand their experiences. So sometimes I can be a bit over analytical outside of my research, but I have been talking with my individual counselor about how to stop overthinking... but I am also passionate about helping people and so now I am worried about this other woman for a few reasons. One being that during the affair, I'm pretty sure she thought my husband was going to be with her and so she is reasonably upset about him staying with me and with the pregnancy hormones I'm sure that intensifies everything. But she says manipulative things and has not taken any ownership in the pregnancy \(always blaming him for everything, but I consider it bad decisions on both ends as they are both adults and make their own moral judgments\). Second, I miscarried a baby at 13 weeks pregnant two years ago and that heavily effected my marriage, so I know she's having a hard time with aborting. Third, she has a son who is in preschool and is still in her toxic relationship with the father of her son \(they are not married\). I worry about how her relationship affects her child. I think their relationship is toxic because I always felt some tension when we visited before the affair and the father is kind of controlling and seems a bit chauvinistic. 

So that's basically the whole story. As someone who went through depression and anxiety and a miscarriage, I feel like I empathize a lot with her. I know I should not and the only reason I have not reached out to her is because my husband does not want me to get involved with her and the drama that would come with that. But throughout this abortion process I was afraid she might be suicidal \(I asked my husband if she seemed that way but he's not really aware of signs\) and that she didn't have anyone to talk to about the abortion as she said she stopped talking with her best friend back in her hometown. And last night, she texted my husband claiming she drank too much alcohol \(still supposedly pregnant\) and asking why about everything. So now I am more concerned and I do not know what to do or if it is appropriate to do anything because I feel like she has not done anything to help herself.

I appreciate any advice or ideas! Also, if there needs some clarity, I'm happy to try to elaborate.",29May2018,1,
57,"My sister is older than me, but it never felt that way. I had to sacrifice so much of my life for her. Giving up my scholarship to go to a local school just to watch over her, spending my allowance on her because she doesn't want to work, missing classes and failing exams because she threatens to kill herself if leave her alone. 

I am tired. I am constantly afraid when she ignores my messages or doesn't pick up the phone, I left work and classes several times to go home and see if she has killed herself or not. It's gotten to the point where a part of me wants her to die just so this constant dread of losing her would go away, so that I can grieve and move on. I feel horrible to think like that, I love her to death but I cry myself to sleep because of how tired I am. I'm only 22 and my life has always been about her. I hide knives and razors, and take them out of their hiding place to chop a fucking salad for myself. I can't go out anymore. I drag her to the emergency room and they do little to no help, I pay for her therapy and tell her to take her pills and nothing is ever enough. **I am tired.**

I don't know how to deal with this anymore. This is affecting my social and academic life, now its all about her and not once did she stop and think of me. I don't know what to do anymore. Part of me wants this all over with. I feel like there will be a plot twist where I will kill myself instead just to make it all stop.",29May2018,0,

I mean I can get happy,excited,sad,annoyed,angry but most of the time I just feel neutral, like I dont feel anything I cant really explain this but I just exist and watch my surroundings and stuff. And what bothers me the most is that I really dont care about what others tell me. For example I dont care what happened at work with my mom (unless something bad) or I dont care when someone tells me a story. I just say ""wow yeah thats good"" and sometimes ask questions so they don't think that Im a dickhead but I really dont give a shit and just wait for them to stop talking. Whats wrong with me?

64,"I'm 22f. I don't have mental health issues but I live with my older sibling who does and it progressively gets worse. My sibling is on the spectrum of autism along with diagnosed OCD and depression and it has been living hell for me and the rest of my family. I feel hopelessly trapped in this situation. I'm basically not allowed to live my life because it causes breakdowns for my sibling. Aka things like driving, having a boyfriend, celebrating my successes (because my sibling gets upset and has breakdowns). I don't really have anyone to go to talk about these things to. My parents neglect me because they put all their efforts into my sibling. My boyfriend hears me out, but he doesn't fully relate or understand the situation and I don't have close friends that relate either. Of course, I'm also not supposed to talk about it much to people to protect my family and my sibling etc. 

My sibling is suicidal and violent and has been for a long time. Yesterday, for what I can only hope is the peak of it all,  we called 911 on them for they were a danger to themselves and my family. They're in the psychiatric treatment right now and being evaluated as I type. I can only hope this is the start to end and that they will get better and finally find treatment that is effective because nothing has long-term worked in the passed 10 years.

As for me I'm so tired of it all. I'm expected to be the genius child and go above and beyond, but also I'm not allowed to be proud of my success. I have to moderate everything I do at home because I could potentially be the cause of another breakdown. I wasn't allowed to get my drivers licence for the longest time because that would upset my sibling. As soon as I got my license my driving was limited because their ocd would trigger. I have 4.0 gpa at my university I can't mention it because my sibling will breakdown because they dropped out. I'm graduating next year I don't think I'll even be allowed to celebrate that. I can't touch certain things, I can't be around certain things because somehow the particles will get in my eyes and kill me. I've been in a loving relationship with my boyfriend for four years and I've been threatened to end it because my sibling gets jealous because they've never been in a relationship. My sibling threatens to kill themselves over not being in a relationship and yesterday's incident started because they saw a coworker hug someone of the opposite sex. 

I fear my sibling and I want to move out with my boyfriend. My boyfriend welcomes me and is waiting for me to get away, but I don't think I'm financially ready. I don't want to burden him and make him pay all the rent or 90% because I don't make enough money with my part-time minimum wage job. I want to wait until I graduate and get a real job, but I'm so stressed out with my situation at home. I'm terrified that moving out would even make my sibling jealous and have a breakdown. I can't do this to my parents either.
I feel so trapped and I want to cry.",29May2018,1,

68,"Sorry for the vague title. Hope this is the right place to post this.

I am at a point in my life right now where I am really struggling and don’t know what to do. I have suffered from OCD/Depression for years now, and lately I feel completely miserable, overwhelmed, and hopless. I feel as if my situation is impossible to come back from, and I am destined to feel this way forever. 

I dropped out of high school when I was 17 years old and have not gotten my GED. I currently just finished a college semester (GED/associates degree program) of ONE class, while struggling to even accomplish that. I have only ever held a job for a month at most, and I currently live with my parents not doing anything except existing on a day to day basis. 

I quit absolutely everything. I feel such strong shame and guilt for being so pathetic, yet it isn’t enough to motivate and drive me to channel my frustrations in a productive way to improve my life. Instead I sit at home feeling sorry for myself and habitually avoid everything that causes me even slight discomfort or anxiety. I am impulsive, indecisive, irritable, and have no motivation to do anything. I constantly blow off friends, and rarely leave my house. I find absolutely no joy in anything besides eating and drinking beer. 

The only thing I truly do that could be considered a positive habit is working out, but that becomes an obsession along with regulating my food consumption. I have been borderline anorexic at points, and an absolute binge eater at other points when I am feeling completely depressed. I obsess about my body image because I do not want to be “fat” on top of all of my other ailments, shortcomings. I go through periods of obsessive “fitness” and starvation, and then fall into periods of absolute depressive laziness like I am currently in. 

I have a very loving and supportive family, but my brother and my mother both suffer from mental illness. My Mother has OCD, and my brother is depressed. Both are medicated, I am not. I have an aversion to medication as part of the OCD, and I fear taking anything that might alter my thinking or cognitive function.

I have been in and out of therapy since I was 15 but, big surprise, I quit therapy every time too. It feel so confused because it’s like there is a part of me that actively wants to not be the way that I am, yet any chance I get to improve my quality of life I quickly sabotage. Often times my obsessions and compulsions from OCD make it hard to tackle my depressive qualities. I can’t take medicine, and I over analyze/assess every specialist I meet with and convince myself they aren’t the right fit for me. Also, I can’t go out into the world a lot of the times because I am too damn anxious. I always find it is much easier to completely avoid taking even the first step to helping myself than it is to face the discomfort that will inevitably comes along with it. I want to be better, but don’t want to do any of the work. 

I have never thought of suicide as the fear of death has always been one of my main OCD triggers, but I am at a point where I have no desire to be alive anymore if that makes any sense? I do not want to be dead, but just the simple act of being alive is daunting and tedious to me. I cannot derive joy from anything anymore, and am becoming increasingly more isolated and wanting to be alone.

I’m not entirely sure what the point of this post is, maybe a cry for help, or maybe just venting hoping to give myself a bit of hope that someone out there has been this low and has come out on the other side. All I know is that if a fire does not somehow get lit under my ass soon things will probably get much worse for me. I’m sorry if this has been overly dramatic and obnoxious, I just needed to get this out into the open and I feel this sub is a judgement free zone. If anyone out there has taken the time and can make sense of this sloppy tirade, I hope you can offer any sort of advice, I would greatly appreciate it! I will elaborate on anything if need be. This was incredibly embarrassing for me to type, and even more humiliating to post, but I am glad put this into writing despite the fact it is messy and maybe a bit incomplete.

71,"Hey everyone! This may be long so I apologize in advance, but I'm looking for advice as far as what to do, if anything, to help a friend that's been isolating herself recently. I figured this might be a good place to ask, but if there's somewhere better to do so please let me know!

Without getting into too much detail, my very best friend has a pretty shitty home life that recently took a turn for the worse, and as a result she's cut herself off from pretty much our whole friend group (stopped talking to most of them, removed herself from groupchats, blocked a lot of people on snapchat) starting in like November. I reached out to her multiple times when it first happened, and she would respond every so often, but now my messages get left on opened / read and I haven't heard from her months. We talked about everything when I came home for winter break (I go to college seven hours away) and she explained the recent developments in her situation to me, but since I left she's been extremely low contact. I think she's messaged me maybe once since then, but I know she's active on social media and stuff because she voted on an Instagram poll I made last night, so it's not like she lost her phone or something. She's aware of the fact that she has been isolating herself from everyone and feels terrible about it, and I'm in NO WAY blaming her for her behavior or upset with her or anything as I realize people cope with things differently, but I'm extremely worried about her and was wondering if there's anything I can do to help her. So far, I've just been trying to message her and ask her how she's doing, tell her how much I love and appreciate her, etc., but I don't know if that's helping at all as she doesn't respond to any of my messages. I also don't want to be selfish and stick my nose where it doesn't belong, but like I said, she's my best friend and I consider her like my platonic soulmate, so I'm worried and want to make sure she's ok, especially knowing that her mental health in general is already not super great (we actually both struggled with depression and other things together our freshman year, which is how we became close friends). 

So what do you guys think? Is there anything else I could be doing, or would I just be acting out of line? Thanks in advance!

72,"When i was 20 (25 now)i was living in alberta in apt by myself. Had a full time job amd everything. Anyway started getting depressed isolated and started gettimg paranoid. Angre fits trow shit around depressed hole works. Got into a argument with a native dude. Woke up the next to find a toy gun at my door.

Next thing I know i am fully convinced the entire native community comming for me. All of them walk to work and every native i see i thing are staring at me. Fowwling me to work. (I was working at fucking tim horton. Most likey their were just going to get their morning coffe) That had escalated to the hole city. Within a week and half i had quit my job. Left the town and when back home. Fully convince that i have just save my life.

The last month and a half have to be the darkest i ever expriend. Compair to when i frist got here in January. Where out of no where my stresst level drop to basically no stresst. And all of a suddent everything was possitive and i felt like i can do and felt like their was hope for me for the time in a long times. That didnt last. 

I know what next now. Im pretty well waiting for it now at this point. Yeah this not the frist time it happend. But this the wrost one yet. So right now im falling deeper into depression. Become more loney and isolate. Starting to get more strong and frequite rage fits. Next step useally unless thing somehow change for better. Are the delusion. Im not looking forward to them.

 But their comming i can tell cause im already starting to questiom people motive around me and shit. That useally how it start. Then beford i know im running around the city. Everyone stairing at me. The government out to get me. And this or that group of people or eveing everybody want to kill me, scam me, fuck me over whatever it might be. Last time i was convincd my empolyer was undercutting my income tax on my check to screw me out my ei...... that was almost a year ago.

Now you might find it funny that i realized these are delusion and that i know their comming. Truthfully i dont really know. But i know they are. Just from past exprience. And to top it off i only recent figire out that it delusions. Just talking to someone told them a story and that what they called it.

Only like a few months ago I thing about that story. And realized just how crazy that it sounded. I found a toy gun at my door. So that mean the hole town me dead? My empolyer paying me 20 dollar under the table cause im doing a extra 2.5 hour a week. That mean he gonna do a full on tax scam???  And realized that i have similure storys too. Not a extream as those two i mention vut still.

And now here i am depressed isolated. Rage fit are become more frequents mood swing are getting more violent. I posted yestherday about how ill fell depressed. And now im posting about this.  Scared is no longer the word. Im terrified cause i dont what it gonna be this time. If it dose happend. Maybe it wont. But i thing it better i assumed it will for once.

74,"Across the past few years I feel like my life has been characterised by short, intense periods of ‘knowing’ myself, where I feel comfortable in my identity, happy with who I am, alive, full of creative energy, like anything is possible and like the future is mine for the taking. I love these periods – they’re very special to me – but it would be wrong to say that I am ‘happy', because generally my mood is pretty volatile during these times. I cry, I laugh, I see the beauty in everything. Art and film and music are interesting to me again and I rediscover my passion for being creative, and generally just feel like I can do anything. But at the same time I’m also anxious, sad, neurotic and all over the place, taking lots of drugs and sleeping around and stuff.   
  
Even though feeling like this is tough to handle, I love it, or at least I think I do, because I just feel so much. Across the past few weeks I’ve hurt myself a little bit (I got drunk and started punching myself in the face… pretty silly I know), been very anxious (to the point where it’s affected work performance and sexual performance), come close to quitting my job and just generally felt really restless and all over the place. But even though sometimes I have these moments of clarity where I feel like I’m scared – like I’m playing with fire by indulging in instability and volatility and it could all end terribly – it seems preferable to feeling depressed. I want to keep this momentum going, if you know what I mean?  
  
The last occasion I felt like this, I ended up falling in love. I ended up in a relationship which lasted for three years, but I was trying to sabotage it (subconsciously I think) as soon as I stopped feeling like how I've detailed, because I was unhappy I no longer felt all of these things described above. Everything was stable and normal and, even though I loved my girlfriend, part of me felt dampened, like a flame had gone out. I did some pretty shitty things throughout our relationship – things that didn’t just hurt her, but also damaged my friendships with other people – and it’s weird to think that it wasn’t because of whether they changed, but because I couldn’t feel *alive* with them, and that to feel like that I needed to sabotage the relationship.   
  
I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Whether I have a mental illness, whether I’m just a piece of shit, whether I’m making it all up as some sort of excuse for the way I behave or something else. I know it’s not the done thing to diagnose people on here, but any similar experiences would be helpful, or pointing me in the right direction, or offering any advice you might think pertinent. I’d really appreciate it.

I literally already bought a replacement for this lost item. Even though I know that this item does not really have any major impact on my life, for some reason I am not able to get over the fact that this item is missing and that I will not be able to find it.  Since then, I have been feeling like my thoughts have been moving in ""circles"".  

My thoughts have basically been as follows:

""where is it""

""not in bag""

""not in bedroom""

""not in couch""

""you are stupid""

I feel like I'm almost a robot repeating these same thoughts in my brain over and over again, and I become angrier and more frustrated each time.

While I have these thoughts, I will go to each of those areas \(bag, bedroom, couch\), and then proceed to tear up these areas trying to find this item even though I know it's not there.  After searching these spots a few times over, I am left both very sad and angry because I messed up these areas for no reason, and I still haven't found the item I'm searching for.  I have been hitting myself on the arms and legs because of this as a means of ""punishing myself"", and throwing other objects in rage of not being able to find this item.

I am still able to function normally at school or work \(with the thought of the lost item still in the back of my mind\), but when I return home, essentially all hell breaks loose and I fall into this cyclical/destructive thought pattern again.

Like I said, I already bought a replacement for this item, but I feel as if my anger is more with myself and my stupidity.
