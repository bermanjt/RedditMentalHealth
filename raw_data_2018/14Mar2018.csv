Anybody have any hospital pro-tips? I.e. thoughts on how to survive, get through it, actually benefit even when it’s the same damn groups over and over?

On a related note, I’ve decided to send myself a care package via Amazon but can’t think of what to include other than fuzzy socks and snacks... anybody got any bright ideas?

2,"I am 18 years old and I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for a few years after years of emotional/social isolation, bullying, family issues etc

Right now I actually started feeling guilty about it because I always make a big deal out of stuff. I overthink everything, if I read something that irritates I feel upset for hours or days and I think about it constantly etc

I also developed a crush for a guy I met online (read the other threads I posted if you want more info) and I feel kinda 'sad' about it because I know I have no chances with him and he considers me a friend only atm (he clearly said he doesn't want a relationship).

I feel like I am overanalyzing things and being overly sensitive at everything.

In poor words I think I am a crybaby and everything read 'women are more emotional than guys' I can't help but think I am a pathetical vagina owner ruled by hormones.

Sexism and misogyny piss me off a lot and everytime I read something that contains stereotypical bs I get mad.

For example I was searching for books on a booksite and I randomly found one called 'Why men want sex and women need love'. 

I opened the link out of curiosity and I realised it was full of sexist ideals about how men only want sex and women are soo emotional and want a relationship at all costs because it is 'defined by biology' (evolutionary psychology, actually).

Some people said it was crap but the majority gave it 3-5 stars. What the heck? It was mostly pseudo science with generalisation of all kind.

It made me feel stupid for wanting a close relationship with a guy instead of casual sex because apparently it is defined by biology. 
How cool, we are ruled by our monkey brain then. 

I know it is bullshit because it is just generalisation and the authors are pretty old so they still believe in old fashioned stuff but it still pissed me off.

Sorry, it was just a random vent btw",14Mar2018,2,
3,"Forgive my awful discription but I am not good at typing. 

I am a young adult male around 21 years old [from NI]. I am happy most of the time and like anyone experience intermittent stress. I have a form of autism amongst other learning difficulties, but they haven't hindered me too much. But heres my issue. 


I have irrational violent thoughts, at the smallest thing, i could be walking down the street, and someone brushes my shoulder, or drives to fast, and i have these ""fantasies"" or just thoughts, of brutally harming them, either killing them or maiming them, it makes my heart race and i tend to zone out from my surroundings normally leaving my partner confused. 

Recently it has been happening with some people i know, not ones i am friends with, but people who I either live with or socialise with sometimes. It happens with things like people being lazy, or killing the internet, or just generally being annoying. I imagine graphic things. 

An example is this (possibly NSFW) - Someone i know, not being a clean and coperative person, always complaining about how hard their life is etc (it isn't great but they milk their situation for attention) I had a thought whilst eating breakfast of driving a 8"" kitchen knife through their face and pushing it in whilst blood squrited everywhere, then just repeatedly stamping on them. 

What worries me more is it doesn't bother me. If anything these visions spur me on as opposed to scar me. 

I wouldn't ever hurt anyone in that mallicious way. But i know this is all connected to some form of rage or anger. I don't know if this is something or nothing or if anyone can help or reccommend actions? 

Thanks 

TL;DR  - I sometimes get aggressive violent thoughts of killing and hurting people for the tiniest thing. Some form of rage disorder?  ",14Mar2018,1,

8,"I've been dealing with mental illness for at least the last 8 years. It's gotten worse and worse despite my attempts at therapy. (I've now taken steps to get more intensive outpatient treatment, so hopefully my initial assessment goes well). 

Something I've really had trouble dealing with is my emotions. I feel like I have no control over them, especially when it comes to their intensity. When I feel something I REALLY feel it no matter the context. For example, one of my brothers may make a passing comment about me being bossy, and I feel so intensely angry I have to bite my lip and walk away to avoid screaming in his face or hitting him. Also minor inconveniences (such as traffic, an unexpected errand, or spilling something on my shirt) ruin my entire day and often make me want to cry or become violent out of frustration. 

I also have no idea how to express these strong emotions or deal with them appropriately. I usually do some form of self harm (no breaking of skin or leaving scars), or get extremely suicidal because I feel like I don't want to deal with how I feel or wake up the next day and have to feel so intensely all over again. I've tried taking up art (something I like to do!), playing video games, hiking, reading, etc., but they all only distract me for a bit and don't do anything to actually help me feel any better.

Because my emotions are so intense and unproportional to what's going on around me, I have trouble figuring out what's ""real"" and what's not. If I get into an argument with someone, I won't know if my angry or sadness or whatever is to be trusted and how I should proceed to act. I don't want to ignore how I feel because I can't make it go away, but what if it's not something I should really be feeling? This makes me want to isolate myself from everyone even more because I don't want to end up confused in this way.

I've had a lot of issues with my relationships because of my emotions. I always try explaining and apologizing (even though I always end up feeling short changed because I'm ignoring how I really feel), but it tends to do more harm than good sometimes because again I don't really know what happened to make me cause some kind of conflict. Because I've lost so many people to this, I feel extremely sad and suicidal and like I'm unlovable and immature because I have the emotional control of a small child. A lot of people tell me I need to take a ""chill pill"" or ""reel it in,"" but I really have no idea how to and it seems like nobody is accepting of my intense emotions.

I am an underinflated balloon. My shape changes temporarily as I am squeezed but I eventually return to my original state. Extended, repetitive squeezing may cause my surface to wrinkle. As I am underinflated, I am resistant to popping when confronted with a sharp object unless it strikes me with notable velocity. However, the more I am being squeezed and my internal pressure builds, the easier it is for sharp objects to pierce me.

Before anybody goes and worries too much about me, “a sharp object” would refer to a particularly major negative life event, “popping” would refer to having one’s resilience and ability (short term) to manage stressors breached - not any sort of permanent damage or outburst. ",14Mar2018,1,

She's a very nice girl, I loved her and there really wasn't any reason for our breakup. I did it because I felt like it. The thing is that I enjoyed breaking up with her.

I know it is bad and I am now stopping myself from getting into any relationship because I dont want to do it again, even though I like to think about doing it. Is there something wrong with me?

It's sometimes can grasp it before it gets out of hand, realizing what's happening and trying to ground myself. Sometimes it just happens and I snap out of it suddenly, like at a traffic light I'll stop seeing myself at the light but from my perspective. It can be frustrating.

Keeping in mind I live in a country that ranks quite highly on the power difference and respect criterias of workplace environment. And all my juniors were there.

I had just had a spate of bad relationship attempts. 4 in just 6 months. Including one who connected with me so much that in just 1 month of knowing her I was already thinking of marrying her. She strung me along for 2 months. Then said ""I don't even care about talking to you"".

I have had little friends in my uni. Lots of ""friends"", yes, but no actual friends. Only have less than half a dozen of those. Was driving with 2 of those to a engagement of a friend. They started discussing boys. Both are feminists. They were laughing about having 4 guys on the string at once. Neither raised a single protest at what basically amounts to two-timing and cheating. Both would've screamed bloody murder if a guy had been stringing along multiple girls.

I got more and more infuriated and furious and upset with both of them until I was seething. Drove them to the engagement without a word. When we got there. I began crashing.

Walked out of the house and started crashing and crashed hard and fast. Desperately tried to call a couple of people. See if anyone would listen. No one picked my call. Messaged my therapist. She said its not an emergency.

I finally accepted defeat. I let myself crash. Called both my friends. In absolute silence without a word, let them pick their stuff from my car. Drove away from them. I don't know if they realized how I was feeling. My closest friend didn't say anything. The other one just asked ""Are you leaving"". I brought myself to say a ""Yes.""

Left. Drove at a mere 25mph in the slow lane for miles. Heaving sighs and deep breaths all the time.

Got home. Crashed completely. Started disassociating. Talked to the only friend that would listen. She said she can't, she's going through stuff too. Tried talking to another friend. She said she can't do it, that it's unfair to dump this on her, and she ignored my messages.

Message arrived from one of the friends I'd left behind. It asked ""Did you get home just fine?"". I told her to fuck off. Then a few minutes later sent a message saying I'm sorry you deserve better but I can't do this anymore. No reply came back.

And then. For the next few hours. I alternatively cried. Laughed. Disassociated. Sat in silence. Seethed in fury and anger and resentment. 

Saw the friend who'd texted change her profile information. Immediately became worried. Sent her a few messages. Told her I'm sorry, that she shouldn't worry, that she can be fine. She ignored all my messages.

Texted other friends. Everyone's ignoring my messages.

Guys. I don't know what to do. I did everything I could not to let this happen. But the choice was becoming utterly utterly invalidating every single emotion and thought I was feeling and thinking. Versus letting myself express myself so destructively.

And now I'm sitting here at work. Alone. Humiliated. Grief-stricken. Alone. With no one to call or talk to.

30,"Tomorrow it will be two years since my uncle took his own life, and although it's something I think about a lot, it's of course on my mind a great deal this week.
I'm having trouble finding closure with it, and to be honest I don't think I ever will, but I thought writing a letter might help me to vent and hopefully could help others that feel the same grief. 

(I went over and took out any of my families names, which is why it probably sounds a bit formal when I mention them)

Uncle,

I've spent a lot of time just looking at my keyboard, because where do you begin when trying to talk to a dead man. 
I went to your house the other week to see your wife and son for the afternoon. Your son decided to repeat the school year because his attendance is so bad, but he seems to be doing a little better which is good, probably because he's avoiding them dickhead bullies. Your other son's doing better as well, finally moved out of his first house and is focusing a lot on uni. It's frustrating because I know if you were still here, you would've have helped them out instantly, you just had a way of doing that. Although if you were still here they probably wouldn't be having these problems.

When I found out you killed yourself, I spent so long trying to be understanding of your decision. You're a smart man, probably the smartest I know, and you spent so long planning for it, so it was clearly what you felt was right. I tried to tell myself that was OK. 
But as the months went on, I started to hate you. Our family was already grieving, and already struggling- and you added to that. Granny is broken, your sons no longer have a father, and your wife now has to raise them alone. You left my mum and all your other siblings. You left us all, and that's not fair, because we don't leave each other. That's never been how this family has worked. You ruined our family fake Christmas at your house, which I loved better than actual Christmas day. In fact you ruined every family get together. When my cousin- your niece- died, it broke our hearts because she couldn't be with us at these events anymore. When you died, it broke our hearts because you chose not to be with us. 

I know these feelings are harsh, and unjust, because I understand what mental illness can do at the best of times, nevermind the worst. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel hate or anger. Maybe it would be a little less if I got to say goodbye.
On the lead up to my 21st birthday, I thought maybe, I'd get a card, or a letter from my Godfather. Of course a stupid thought, but I had hoped I might get some closure. I didn't. None of your godchildren did, so why should I be different. I really really hoped you would though. You know how much I adore you.

I don't really believe in an afterlife, or that you're 'with us' in some way. But sometimes I like to hope you are. I still feel anger, mostly because I wish I could've helped, I think we all feel that. You know how involved we like to be in every aspect of eachothers lives lol, especially granny. I want you to know though, I still think you're a fantastic person, and I still love every memory of you, particularly your snobbish rants and bad dress sense. I'm doing my best to look out for your sons, doing my best to look out for everyone to be honest, just like you did a lot. It's very exhausting, and I don't think I'll ever feel like I'm doing enough for them- but hopefully I am.

Do me a favour, if by some chance you actually are 'with us', please look out for my brother, he's really struggling at the moment and I feel absolutely useless. 

And on that note, I'll leave this here. I miss you.

34,"Just to preface, I am actively returning to therapy but I really need to inquire if anyone else dealt with a similar issue or may have some advice. Also, it is good to vent, but sadly this will be long.

When I was a younger lad within the ages of 18 to 25, I had an extremely short temper &amp; it usually occured with significant others, specifically significant others who didn't work &amp; appeared to expect me to be the provider of the situation, while at the same time not even doing anything at home. I, as well as they, were very fortunate that my anger never lead to physical abuse (but i am sure mental certainly happened), but it came so close many times. I know there was a lot of things I was angry about that I didn't realize at the time like feeling trapped in both relationships &amp; location, felt like i was going no where, etc. Finally at the age of 25 i decided that unless i changed my situation then everything would remain the same. So I packed up, moved to a location with much more opportunities, and spread my wings. It worked well. Got my own place, got into a new career, got into a good relationship, things were doing well. Life happened, relocations occured, relationships ended &amp; began, but for the most part, the anger that I felt before my move seemed dormant, perhaps eliminated. I was in control of my own life no matter where I went. The events in my life were of my own making, good or bad. And I was fine with that.

Eventually I came across my tribe, a group of people (about 9 to 11) living and working together to build a foundation for themselves to thrive individually &amp; and as a group. I loved everything they stood for, everything they did for eachother. And by their good graces they allowed me in and made me family. For the 1st time in my life a great weight was lifted off of my shoulders. No more did I have to fear that if I lost my job I could become homeless, I had a support system to help me get back on my feet. I paid my share to maintain the household &amp; from there I was able to research various interests of mine. For all intents &amp; purposes, I was home, safe, and secure for the 1st time since I was a child with my parents.

After a time we found out that the house we were living in was falling apart faster than we could repair it, and moving was an inevitability. Sadly, we could not find a place that would fit all of us in the timeframe we had, and a few of us had to split. I along w/ my now fiance volunteered to get a place of our own. We all keep contact &amp; i visit one weekend a month as well as have another tribe-peep come to my place who happens to be another partner (I am poly.) And sure, things were rough initially on my end, but we pulled through very handily. We were even able to thrive ourselves a bit. The two of us working together made the machine run smooth, and I was still happy. We added one more person to my apartment &amp; everything was still great. And then came time for us to look for a larger place, and this is where it went downhill for me.

In the situation of just my fiance and I, our financial agreement was I ensured our bills got paid &amp; outside of allowances, she would allocate funds for additional debt payoffs, and things we wanted to save for. A fantastic system for the both of us, espectially for her because she is low income &amp; giving her the power of where money goes after necessities gives her tons of confidence, and her decisions were sound at all times. Our 3rd pays us a solid 3rd of expences that are for the apartment, food, and gas money (we share 2 cars.) But what is happening is that during the process of finding a place, moving, and settling, it became very clear that I was the final say in anything. I did not want this at all, but nothing would get done w/o it. The two were relying on me, and that is fair for the context because these two had little experiencce with the whole afair. But a revelation occured that reinvoked the same flavor of anger &amp; temper from before I moved, and the revelation is that either or both of the others in our situation could lose their job and we'd surviive, but if I lost my job then it would be catastrophic. Once again, I am in a position of great responsibility that in truth solely relies on my ability to continue generating that income. And the result of that realization is that now I am becoming very irrational in anything that doesn't go my way or whenever I am confronted about something that I did in the apartment that is not to their liking, or even just a thing that respects the others in the home, the urge to just flip that person with two middile fingers and claim ""Oh just fucking deal with it, if it weren't for me you wouldn't be living as comfortable as you are in the first place."" is sickening to me. And then I become even more angry because this sickening sense of entitlement because of income and all the decisions i make is completely uncharacteristic of me...... but then i realized it is totally characteristic of me, just that I have been so far away from being the head of a household that it just never flared up again. My ego has finally woke up and is rearing its ugly face at everyone I love. It makes me believe that moving away all those years ago wasn't moving from a toxic situation, it was running away from my problems, problems I didn't understand. I think I understand them now, and now is the time for help. Thank you for reading.",14Mar2018,1,

Why is it so hard to just *find* a psychiatrist near me who takes my insurance?!?! This is *ridiculous*!

One of the providers I called realized this and told me she would have to call them to tell them to take her off that network on their site!

40,"hi everyone, 20/f/US/college student here w/ bpd and I feel like my life is spiraling out of control. it's funny b/c moving out at 18 promised a lot of stability and for a while I was doing good on my own, but I always fall into self-sabotaging loops; I set goals for myself, fail to meet them in spite of myself and because a disgusting part of me revels in my failures, depress myself as a result of feeling like a failure to myself, etc. as my mental health declined as well, I noticed certain behaviors worsening or appearing such as the following, I'm basically just putting this out there because I am plain and simple scared of and scared for myself. It also doesn't help that I'm extremely insecure in my future and have so little faith in myself/my abilities and capabilities.

- I started dissociating a LOT more. the sensations got worse and started cropping up outside of exclusively my episodes as they previously were, just at random times where my reaction to something was so hyperemotional I had no other way of coping other than launching myself out of myself (if that makes sense). I feel so detached and alienated from my body most times and experience a numbness that feels intensely physical I live in an almost permanent sensation of numbness/tingliness; my extremities feel ice cold, my thoughts and everything disperse themselves in such a way that I feel like my existence is scattered all around the spaces I occupy. I've had experiences where I've looked in the mirror and felt like the individual I was seeing wasn't myself; the sensation that I am not me. And the feeling always lurking behind all of this is always just emptiness, like my body stops at my torso and then dips into a big hole; I'd even describe it at times as though my insides were sinking.

- I'm generally a sympathetic person if not empathetic, or so I perceive myself to be (maybe it's fake? sometimes I just feel empty and generally uncaring, maybe I've led myself to believe otherwise over a long time), but lately I've felt a disturbing lack of care/apathy for others and even myself. I just don't particularly care for anything or anyone and this is extremely unlike my character in my view; before when I was high-functioning I was a lot more of a forced extrovert, I cultivated good relationships with my friends; now I've grown apart from most of them or intentionally isolated myself one way or another. I probably don't get enough human reaction; maybe that's why I feel so much worse.

- I cannot stop sabotaging my own goals unless I plan out my day on a schedule basis and forcefully sit down and study or complete errands/work in segments with breaks in between. When everything is fine, I create situations for myself OUT OF THIN AIR and make things a living hell for myself. This has always more or less been an issue with me since early social life (middle school onward) but now it's almost out of control to the point where I can't really trust myself to accomplish things.

and most of all, it has put massive strain on my relationship. I actually may have just gotten broken up with, I'm not even sure. I don't want to assume my partner is nt; he is a child of divorce and I definitely see/understand why he has issues arising from that, including a lot of anger. seeing me decline has taken a large toll on him to the point where he regularly sends me to my parents' place just so he can feel less miserable (it's a mutual decision, I'm extremely unstable to the point where even I can recognize I can't always be a person worth being around). I want to get better for him, I don't want to give up on the relationship unless he decides he's done. but I have no idea where to start; he feels hurt by a lot of my behaviors and shitty residual defense mechanisms and I myself know they're shitty too; I do things like impulsively accuse (borne of my constant fear of him leaving me), lie about minor things that give me anxiety about telling him, impulsively make ""everything/nothing"" statements before reflecting and considering whether or not I actually mean it. I really have been a nightmare partner and I want to make things good if I can for both of us.

overall, these are my concerns and prevalent issues in my life, I feel like a chicken running around without a head; I'm at my wit's end, I started """"problem-solving"""" aka taking things out on myself through SH even though I know it's dangerous and reckless, I just have such a lack of care for myself most times that sometimes I can't even complete daily functions that other people do with ease. also, therapy isn't currently something I can afford or even look into unfortunately. all I really have are people or the void of the internet to vent to. so here you are, void of the internet. I just really needed to get this out of my head and somewhere, whether or not it gets any replies.",14Mar2018,1,

43,"If you have been following any of my previous posts you will know I have had a hell of a month with mental illness rearing up for some reason. 

Well, like the title says I smoked weed and it snapped me out of my depression and whatever else the hell was going on. I havent smoked weed in about 5 years so at my wifes urging I tried a couple puffs on her electronic vapor pen. I'm at day 3 of taking 2-6 puffs a day and I feel like the weed just swept all that depression and anxiety and stress and whatever right out of my head. I can physically feel my whole body relaxing. 

Idk you are the same as me but everytime I have an episode (lasting a week to this time a month and half) afterwards I feel like such a fucking fool. I feel like I let people down and mostly just embarassment at how I behaved. 

Well I have to give it up to this weed it literally is like a miracle cure. Wayyyyy better than all the various benzos and narcotics my dr's have prescribed me. Plus no horrendous withdrawal symptoms like friggin all psych meds have. 

Anyways I feel much better. I am up and doing chores and working around the house and property. I do feel a little guilty for smoking weed but it's legal here so what the hell it literally snapped me out of the deepest funk I've been in for a long time.",14Mar2018,2,

My mom was addicted to 42 (not an exaggeration) prescription medications. She took her life five years ago when I was 16 years old.

My grandma took her life 10 years ago - she was also addicted to prescription medications.

Mental illness runs in the family in many forms, and it’s odd to think that if I reached that point, there’d be 3 generations of suicide in my family.

49,"When in the car, I tend to see things more frequently/vividly. I don't know exactly why this is. Could it just be because  I was already anxious, and then being behind the wheel puts me in a hyperaware mode? 

Twice I've seen pedestrians in the middle of the road where there were none. These two instances were very far apart, so I didn't think much of them and had no other issues.  Today, I saw a car at an intersection where there was no one. Almost slammed on the brakes, which is not good as there were people behind me. 

I'm just worried about getting into a crash or something because of it. I've never been diagnosed with anything that would account for seeing things, so I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else, if you've discovered the cause, and if so, if there's anything you've been able to do to remedy it.

I'm not sure if it's actually withdrawal or just generally being really unhealthy and dehydrated lately (getting up at like 3pm and pretty much just eating before going back to bed for a few hours more), but it feels very similar to Zoloft withdrawals.

Life has gotten to a point where it seems all my good days are in the past. Partying in high school, I met the love of my life and we were together five years, going to concerts, hopping bars, hooking up with chicks, playing in a band and just even making new friends. But now its all falling in on its self. I lost the majority of my friends when I was forced to move states, making new ones hasnt gone well. I dont see much of a future for myself or anything to look forward too and I stopped making music. I cant hook up with chicks cause the love of my life left me and every girl I touch reminds me of her... Its currently 2:27 PM and im chugging beers just for the purpose of getting drunk. If the best days of my life are behind me, why should I keep going forward....? I just want her back. Shes all I ever wanted and I fucked it up. I dont wanna hurt myself cause I cant have her. No thats not it. I wanna hurt myself because I hate myself. I hurt the one person I shouldn't ever hurt and everything I touch dies. Its all my fault and I cant live with it. Im the bad guy.

I put on these personas, masks, whatever you want to call them, and I wear them to suit my needs, all the while hiding my intentions.  I've played many roles: the victim, the cute innocent boy, the cute innocent girl, the aloof cool guy, the teacher/scientist, the rational one, the comedian, so many (even now I know what I'm doing..just another mask)...I've noticed I do it sometimes or a lot, I don't know.  I wouldn't say always, though I may not be aware of it all the time.  I went to this mystic healer person yesterday, and I noticed that's exactly what I was doing when I first when in there...I think I was playing cute innocent little girl introvert... then I eventually went into the extrovert mode at a few points....I really didn't agree with some of the things he was saying.

I'm drowning in this. I want to be honest, but it seems I just can't help myself sometimes.

61,"Hey all, 
As many relate I could go on and on about how I feel. I am going to do my best to keep this short.

From what I know, I have a depression that runs in episodes. I am 16 and am experiencing my third episode of which I am 6 months deep in. This third episode is by far the most intense and I have found myself most close to suicide here. It was triggered by an intense family argumentave period with drama. This depression was also enhanced by ecstasy abuse. 

Currently doing much better! Trying to get better, stopped drugs besides weed from time to time, eating and going to the gym. I bounce back between lows and normals as my therapist said. 

But i am confused. I have realized that even when I get better, I am more disconncted from the intense motives and thoughts of suicide I get at my lows, but I still feel like I have no sense of self preservation. Like I have no care if I live or die. Like if I was given the option to end it and have no one remember even at my best now, I would pick to end it. 

This situation of ending it all and no one remembering me is a situation I replay alot in my head as well for some reason. 

Will this go away as I work on my depression? Or is this just me as a person? 

Thank you",14Mar2018,2,

64,"I suffer from major depressive disorder, anxiety/panic and I was diagnosed with ADD as a kid, but was only on Ritalin for 2-3 years.  

I found some way to cope and I think I started taking a slide in the wrong direction in 2013 or 2014, where I ended up more depressed and felt like I couldn't focus as much.

In 2016, I left my employer, who I had been with for the previous 13 years to go work for a former boss.  I eventually was fired literally a year later in 2017 for ""performance.""  I had started the ball rolling with my PCP to get some of my issues addressed but I didn't get them all addressed in time, apparently.

I eventually had a breakdown this past December, because I got a job in August and was starting down a similar path of poor performance because of lack of focus and just generally being depressed/angry about where I was.

Long story short, I ended up checking myself into a local psych ER because I felt like I needed some serious help (i.e. PCP was limited help, and I just started seeing a therapist but weekly or bi weekly appointments weren't enough at the time).  I ended up going to a partial hospitalization program for 2 weeks which did me well - I'm not psychotic or anything and wasn't really a danger to anyone but needed more than weekly appointments with a therapist.  It ended up being a positive experience and I felt like a whole new person when I left.

I ended up getting an awesome job at the local community college and started last week.  When I left the other job, one lady said that she was sad to see me go because she saw a change in me and my work for the better.

But, something has been nagging me recently.  It seems like I feel a bit guilty that I let former colleagues down because I fell into some bad habits and then I felt like whatever issues I had going on in my head at the time compounded them.  I feel like I need to apologize or something and that I am getting treatment and its seems like I am on the right path for now.  I am not trying to make excuses or get hired back because where I am now is more in line with my career goals.  In other words, there was more at play than people might think and that it was nothing personal and I can understand why I got fired and eventually used that to get help I needed.

65,"I have been seeing a therapist for the last 6 months now. I have a lot of difficulty opening up and talking about difficult subjects. Even though I am trying my best, therapy hasn't helped me at all. I avoid talking about things and start crying at the slightest uncomfortable subject. I hate the feeling of crying when there are people nearby. It makes me feel weak and vunerable.

Now last session my therapist basically told me that she thinks this  therapy isn't helping me and she wants to refer me to group therapy. I am very doubtful and scared of this. If I can't cry/open up to one person, I certainly can't do that to 10 people at once. I feel like apperantly I am way worse than I thought and therefore I get transferred to some heavy extreme 2 times a week group therapy. It makes me feel so sad and anxious.

66,"It feels like a cognitive death of some kind. Like my brain does not want to live and thrive. Honestly, like my brain gets so fed up, that it shuts off repeatedly. Every time I try, I find myself tired over and over again. Like going backwards... thinking is now making me increasingly tired... I seem to be getting more and more lazy as time goes by... It's been getting worse every day for months now. It's like every day is worse and worse...I have a very hard time believing that this is how I'm being affected, but it is what it is! Like instead of thriving, my brain is shriveling up and going backwards...That's the best way I can describe it. (can someone help with this Cognitive Death??) Even to just write this post I am extremely exhausted. And I keep phanting and wanting to go lie down in bed... My friends in my age range are active and productive, and get so much done in a day. Same thing with the people on Reddit, or on other Boards... and I keep seeing that people are posting, being productive, etc. But for me I will read one sentence on the computer and I'm exhausted... Like actually start going out of breath. Like actually out of breath and my brain refuses to cooperate. Just so tired I want to close my eyes and rest. So, not so much a physical tiredness, but tired to BE, tired to actually THINK and be myself! (When I was on Vyvance, this was at its worst!! I'd get so Fatigued I could barely BE or think anymore. Thankfully I got switched to Adderall,  and it's less pronounced, but definitely still there...) This also happens if I try accessing Memories (of the day or otherwise), I immediately go out of breath, like that's too much information for me to handle. I eat and sleep fairly healthy, so that that shouldnt matter too much?? I don't think eating not very well should affect your actual COGNITIVE health like this. Unless it's chronic malnutrition... But what could this cognitive fatigue be?? What could this possibly be, to be tired of talking, thinking, remembering, processing? I got blood work done with my Dr. and everything came back fine. thyroid, magnesium, b12, and everything. All came back fine, what else could I run a test for, to check for this Cognitive Fatigue? but day to day, I am extremely fatigued, and have very low motivation as well (unless I'm on my Adderall...) but even then, I get so tired so easily. And also even just writing this post has got me extremely exhausted...Also my memory has been very very bad as well, and I don't really pay attention to anything in society when I'm outside...Like it's so weird and not normal at all to be this anemic and weak... Like I just want to know if it's normal for the human brain to start getting fatigued like this, like, do I need to run some Detox or something to get it started up again, literally every sentence I read/write gets me exhausted, why is my brain shriveling up like this, going backwards?? It's like that drive to live is gone...I need to know what condition this is, when the brain refuses to work and be itself, and it would rather just lay in bed all day...(because even to just finish one sentence in talking is impossible. I am so cognitively tired.)

I am just getting really fatigued of doing stuff, regular human stuff. Like, the brain is getting lazier and lazier... I also do HATE talking now. Talking on the phone is exhausting to me, talking to my Friends is very exhausting.. I literally can't talk for more than a few seconds without getting exhausted and I have to go lie down in bed. Just really really big fatigue for everything and right away... What is wrong with me???

It definitely shouldn't be normal to be going backwards in your Cognition. So what other tests could I run, heart/liver? What do I tell my GP? (btw this has been going on like this for as long as I can remember. At work as well, I can barely get through my shift. I get so exshausted...and I feel like I'm gonna die and I need to lie down, and then I'm exhausted for a few days afterward...or I am having trouble finishing a sentence when talking to someone...)

P.S I am also on 112mg of Effexor, and consider myself a fairly delicate individual. Could this be a side effect of Effexor, that's also harming the memory at the same time, and causing fatigue from how the anti-depressant acts? But what do I do, I am far too delicate to handle a taper. What do I do to combat it if it's the Anti-Depressant causing this??? Because it very well could be. It's a combination of things that the Anti-Depressant is acting on, that's bringing on lethargy and fatigue by making me happy?? Or what else?",14Mar2018,7,

70,"Hello all,
No idea if I am going to keep this post on here or not, I just need to vent and possibly get some outside perspective (and perhaps validation) on what I am going through. 

I am a 27 year old female. Not sure if it matters but it could. Anyways:

3 years ago, I began taking SSRIs to help stabilize my moods. Most of my anxiety and depression cycles were triggered by attachment insecurities. I also went through a fairly emotionally abusive relationship, and needed extra help after coming out of that. I took Zoloft, and it worked great for a long time. I hated that I gained 30 lbs and lost my sex drive, however. Overall though, I would say the Zoloft was definitely helpful. I went back to school and got my masters in counseling, and started dating again and met my (now) fiancé! I'm not sure I ever would have been secure and anxiety-free enough to date in a healthy way if not for the help of medication. Fast forward to now: 7 months after gradually coming off the Zoloft. A brutal and dark winter in the Midwest. Wedding planning. The first few months after grad school. Boredom. Depression. Living in a new place with my fiancé.

This is the first winter without my meds. For a while working out and using the SAD light were really helping, but now they really aren't. I'm starting to think that more is going on than just some seasonal depression. I had thought all of my attachment anxieties were behind me, but recently they have been coming back. I've noticed that my fiancé and I are not in the honeymoon phase anymore, and it has really been bothering me. We generally have very good communication, and I know I could talk to him about this, but recently I have felt like he and I have not been connecting emotionally as much as I would like. I am not sure what is going on, and I am afraid he will not be honest with me. I have not liked the moods I have been in, and I am worried that they have really been wearing him out. I don't know if he is willing to admit this if it's true, or maybe I am just paranoid. I don't know how to make it better, or how to re-spark things. I keep thinking ""you should be blissfully happy, you're planning a wedding"". The truth is that I am grieving a number of losses all at once, and it's hard to be happy wedding planning when all of your money goes to it, and you've no money to date each other. I'm worried that maybe our connection was not all that strong in the first place, and that's the thing that has me in knots. 

I'd love to go to therapy to process all of this, but unfortunately I just don't have the funding. Any insight is helpful!",14Mar2018,1,
