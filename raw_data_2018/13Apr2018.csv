1,"Basically as it sounds, i get stressed out analyzing  my behaviors and  the paranoia comes in  as  far as other people talking about me and stuff. Either im laying in bed defeated or stressed to much to accomplish anything. Doesn't help ive been going to therapy and started meds etc either. Because my family is aware of it and judgmental of my behavior.  The bottom line is i feel i will never progress living here but cant support myself. So how can i handle this ? Just ignore it all and work on my stuff on my pc ..just pretend im ok? its scary to do that ..",13Apr2018,1
2,"Pretty much to give the lowdown on this section of my problems, I basically share my brain with someone who I've dubbed ""Devin"", he can speak to me through thought and sometimes externally but that sound ethereal and hard to understand and rather scary imo. Basically recently, I've""had conversations with"" people that I can not even fathom having, it doesn't feel like normal forgetfulness as usually with that I remember images from that conversation that indicates I at least interacted with them. Devin has been getting stronger lately, the frequency we have conversations and how often he shows me self harming myself in my head. I have an appointment with my doctor soon enough but I just felt like ranting on here. Essentially I'm rather paranoid that Devin might become the dominant force in my brain or at the least manifest himself in my day to day life. If that were to happen I won't have anyone left in my life who will care about me, he is trying to insinuate to me right now that he is the real me and that I am the defect in my brain, I don't know what to believe",13Apr2018,1
3,"Hi, I've had OCD my whole life though I only found out about 2 years ago. 

I'm at a good place right now, job I love and happy. Sometimes I feel chest pains (heart burn I believe) when I think about things that are on my mind that I want to resolve.

I've been thinking lately of myself in high school and how obsessed I was with getting perfect grades. It was really unhealthy and occupied my every moment basically for four years. I've had other obsessions that I've stressed about since then. 

I've mentally taxed myself so much which shows in my reduced energy.

High anxiety, a couple near fainting occasions, etc.

Is this all in my head or have I caused damage to myself and if so what can I do to reverse it.

I'm happy with where I am and I'm glad for my hard work but I feel like I might have laid the foundation for severe problems down the road.

Thank you for listening. Any advice please? ",13Apr2018,1
4,"I am graduating from college in two months and have started my job search but my biggest hinderance is I was out of work for 2 years because of my mental health issues (bipolar/schizoaffective) and in that time I was hospitalized for a psychotic episode. 

While I wouldn’t go into details would it be inappropriate to explain my gap in employment honestly by saying something like: 

“I struggled with some mental health issues that prevented me from working but I have worked with doctors and counsellors for the past three years overcoming the obstacles I faced and was able to work part time and attend school full time as I am now in a healthy mental state” ?

Or would it be more appropriate to say something along the lines of:

“I experienced some medical issues that prevented me from working over that time but at this time I am back in good health” 

I’m torn about this because I am basically incapable of lying and feel the latter response is somewhat dishonest. ",13Apr2018,2

7,"Imagine a world, a world in which everyone can communicate with each other brain to brain on another plain.  Where our true intentions are revealed and any and every problem is argued about for hours. A place where every human reaction in the physical world matches to the metaphysical somehow. (Possibly connections I've made) You have had every conversation possibly imagined with the people you call your friends. You cannot think of anything new to say to this person in the physical world, you are too worn out and do not want to repeat previous conversations. You hear voices predicting the future which are sometimes correct and others not. Sometimes to the extent where it possibly could not be a coincidence but as a factual man I disregard. They try to convince you this is real, this is happening. Everybody communicates with each other in another realm. This place is scary, dark, and hurtful. Tears you to the core, finds anything it can to get at you. To ruin your day. Then proceed to lift you back up; mental abuse in a way. You are a tormented soul walking in what seems two realms. They love you, they hate you, they make you fear them, try and take your body. All's you want is silence, it's no where to be found. You want peace, there is no peace here. 

This is me. This is my experience with schizophrenia thus far. I want to kill my demons but they decieve me. They know what to say, when to say it, and how to say it to manipulate me into their realm. I would love to believe in it but there isn't a way. My dad and mom think I'm a psychopath, my roommates are poisoning me, my coworkers are mentally abusing me, my own self is destroying my very existing; they say. But I'm too strong to firmly believe in there bullshit. They will get to me, but I will NEVER take action. Never. I've dedicated my life to eraticating such behavior. No more I said, after withdrawing myself from society. After hating the people I loved. After destroying my ego, life, and body. I'm getting better. And I will; will succeed. I'm like you, just broken. I may have soul crushing social anxiety, I may look away the second we make eye contact, I may sit there twitching because I dont know what to do with my limbs, I may bite my cheeks and other compulsive things. But I promise I'm good, as they say I'm not. As they say they are tired of my bullshit and to delete this immediately otherwise they will be forced to take action. Fuck it. Here you go Reddit.

8,"So for the past 5 years or so, my friend has been trying to coop with noise that is bothersome to her, but not that much to others (myself included)

As for the noise, it's only the one she would hear from her appartment that bothers her. Every-time she hears one of her neighbours walk loud, drop something or move the chair too often, she would get angry, slam on the wall, etc. She tried talking to her neighbours but it always comes back to the same. Or, she would hear it but can't tell where it is coming from.

In those past 5 years she's moved at least 6-7 times. And now she's thinking of finding something else again because it's gotten too noisy for her.

I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better for her to seek help to coop with the noise. I told her that but she just keeps waving it away. So, is there anyone else who feels the same way as her? How do or did you deal with it? ",13Apr2018,2
9,"This happened one morning many months ago. I'm not entirely sure if it was a dream or if I was awake. Onto the story.

I woke up in my bed in the middle of the night, everything normal, pitch black. However, slowly everything starter to get brighter and there was a distant high-pitch screaming sound. It continued to get more intense until all I could see was blindingly bright whiteness and ear-peircing high pitch demonic screaching. Like, these things were more intense than your senses can naturally read anyway. It felt brighter than staring into the sun and louder than the loudest thing I can imagine. I don't think I moved at all and I don't know if that's because I couldn't or was too scared to.

Can anyone explain what the hell happened to me that night?

It sounds like sleep paralysis *and* a panic attack at the same time, neither of which I am diagnosed with or have notable experience with.",13Apr2018,3
10,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit for this problem but it's the closest I could think of, if you can think of a MORE appropriate subredit please share.

My profession is video game programming, which is a very tasking excise of your brain. Some times I burn myself out but one of my biggest issues is procrastination. I will go to sleep determined to get a certain component working in my game, I wake up and do my morning routines and then open up my IDE (programming stuff) and quickly think of a quick thing to search online, that quick thing turns into 40 minutes of distractions. After this time I start writing code and I realize that I need music for ambiance, this always back fires because it either alters my mood or makes me day dreams of all the epic scenes in the games I want to make that match with the music. The work just piles up and the day goes on until I realize its dark out and nothing go down. And then when it comes time to just stop because my brain is too exhausted to perform optimally I start working hard and just get a migraine from it being too late. The process has become a almost daily routine and on top of stress from private life, my brain fog from my fabromyalgia and the many many distractions the Internet offers to procrastinators it makes it very hard to all deal with. By the end of the day I want to relax and unwind but the guilt of that lost work day triggers my anxiety issues and ruins my free time enjoyment. I take pride in being strong willed, being strong willed is something I have to be to get through some of the health problems I have. So to be so weak willed as to allow myself to be distracted from what I love to do is very depressing.

Does anyone have any advice on how to improve this in any metric?",13Apr2018,3

12,"As someone who suffers from a few mental health problems, I've only ever been on medication and never actually went to therapy to fix these things. I think I would like to do that first, before stepping into the real world: a job, grad school, etc. 

But I feel like this is just an excuse to delay doing those things! Like I'm trying to make a life plan and then live it, but I'm just basically delaying the living part. But I know that if I don't take care of my health, then everything is going to fall apart and be hard to handle. ",13Apr2018,3
13,"I know it sounds so stupid, but I'm being serious.

Lately I've realized that whenever the L word is directed/implied towards me, I feel...uncomfortable, confused, ""cold in the stomach"", and anxious. I react to it as if it were the most ugly, disgusting, dehumanizing word someone could use against another and it concerns me...a lot.

I like to think I'm pretty self aware and try to understand my thought process and feelings, etc., so the only possible cause to this behavior, that I can think of - is my most recent break up. (I'd also like to add that this was my first relationship - ever.) We met when I was 17 in high school and dated for a little over nine years, he fell out of love with me and it's been about two and a half months since I was dumped. 
I went through one of the worst depressive cycles I ever experienced, but am doing a lot better....I suppose.
When I think back, I know I was a very open person, passionately and shamelessly wore my heart on my sleeve, but I've definitely built very high walls since the break up. Grown very guarded, emotionally distant and ""independent"" as well. It makes me a little sad, but it's my understanding that I am probably still in the healing process? Cause it doesn't hurt as bad as it use to, but then again, nothing really hurts anymore; I feel numb. Seems as though I've been living as a ghost these last couple of months. 
On a positive note: whatever it is I'm going through, its enabled me to grow stronger mentally...at least that's what I've come to believe. For example, I don't complain anymore. And anytime I feel negative or highly emotional towards a person or situation, I'm quick to reason with myself and calm down which is HUGE for someone who's lived with bad anxiety. But, yeah....

I don't know what I'm talking about. I feel like I'm rambling and am all over the place. So I'll just end it by saying that I fear I may have developed a warped view of love. I mean, it makes sense considering the factors above, doesn't it?

I'd really like some insight, opinions, criticism, and perspective on this matter. Thank you so much in advance.

15,"A girl I went to high school with has been diagnosed as bipolar by 4 separate psychiatrists, but she is not satisfied with this diagnosis—she thinks she has borderline personality disorder, therefore wants to be diagnosed as such (which is why she’s seen 4 separate doctors). 
I have personally been diagnosed with BPD, and she knows this, and in the past she has asked me what I told my psychiatrist to receive this diagnosis. I interpreted this as her asking for the answers to help her reach her golden diagnosis. I found this extremely troubling and offensive, as I was quite upset when I was initially given this diagnosis. She is obviously mentally ill, but I sort of feel inclined to trust the opinions of 4 separate psychiatrists that she does not have BPD.

17,I’m just wondering if this is something wrong with me or just some personal issues. I can’t seem to have feeling about anything at all. From things like relationships to deaths I can’t seem to care less. I’ve had a few girlfriends in the past year or two and however I have some feeling for them and I to an extent enjoy their company I wouldn’t care in the slightest if anything happened to them. There’s also been a few deaths in my family like my great grandparents and my dog and through all of those I didn’t shed a single tear or feel any sadness at all. I’ve also been lousy with my schoolwork lately I know the information just I can’t seem to make myself do anything.

19,"It started when I was 8, I'm a male. I was hanging out with one of my friend's brother, we were friends but not great friends because of our age difference, he was 14, we'll call him John. Anyway, we rode our bikes around town and ended up going into this abandoned building. To be clear, nothing was ever forced, physically. I can't specifically remember the exact conversation or how it started but we eventually both were naked and were performing oral sex on each other. I was really young and confused, I just went on with it. Honestly, I really didn't like it. He asked me to go down on him a couple of times and every time I did it I gagged, so it was mostly him going down on me. John told me that this was just growing up, it was part of puberty. I believed him and I really wanted to grow up so we did it a lot. John also introduced me to porn, and we'd watch it together, a lot. Does this count as being molested?

20,"I am not -- and never have been -- a racist, sexist, homophobe or the like, hence I'm ideologically left-leaning. I just utterly and completely despise Islam and Muslims. Please differentiate race and religion here. 

I live in multicultural Malaysia but there's been a painfully obvious creeping Islamization in the local zeitgeist. I'm talking about the 'death to apostates and homosexuals' and  'sharia will rule Malaysia' kind. All of which is ideologically tangent to my beliefs.

I'm a relatively peaceful ex-muslim although I've received death threats and was shunned by my extended family. I can never own dogs. I can't stay at a hotel with my GF or the Moral Police will arrest us. I can't be seen in pubs or locals will report me to the police. I can't learn evolution from books because it's either banned or heavily censored here. Wearing shorts in some states can result in a fine. I can't watch TV without a mandatory 'islamic moral lesson'. I can't learn history in college without the mandatory 'west lies about islam' or 'islam is solution for every western problem under the sky'. Me being an atheist resulted in me and my friends receiving death threats.

This barely scratches the surface. In short, I have become supremely bitter and bigoted towards anybody and anything resembling islam. My blood boils when I look at hijabi women now. I fucking hate every muslim I see and at one point I tore pieces of the Quran and threw it in a small-college mosque just to piss them off. I plaster pictures of darwinian evolution on the segments of the quran where it tells the Adam and Eve myth. I talked down to hijabi women looking at a proto-human exhibition in a museum because I can definitely surely say they won't believe a sentence of what they're seeing.

In my small business i won't hire muslims because they take their sweet ass time for prayer break especially when customers come. I outsource some work to non-muslim chinese and indians because the local muslims will get too emotional or biased, but more often incompetent. It is a very popular stigma here that the Malay Muslim majority is lazy and incompetent.

Local movies at the cinema will almost always end with a verse of the Quran as a disclaimer to not do X. I will intentionally laugh out loud to make it an obvious point that I enjoyed the movie but fucking hate Islam. 

It's to a point where I can see the irrationality in bringing in Muslims by the hordes to european countries that get so much flak from far right groups. In regards to Muslims, I am now as far right as Hitler. 

I truly truly hate Islam and Muslims to the bone. I wish to change that, but given my environmental circumstances I can't find it rational to be more tolerant of the intolerant. Can anyone help?

24,"I feel far less depressed and angry currently.  My thinking is far more rational than usually.  I feel like I'm denying my feelings less too.  Everything just seems better.

All because of one realization.  I don't feel shame.  I feel embarrassment.  I think the difference being that shame is done to you while embarrassment is done to yourself.  I'm stubborn because I'm embarrassed to have to change, not because people would shame me for changing.  I'm angry because I'm embarrassed I'm not reaching some standard I want to reach, and not that people are shaming me for not reaching that standard.

I looked up embarrassment and it's basically when reality isn't matching the image you want to project, and I'm chronically embarrassed because I have extremely unrealistic standards for that image.  

It was bad for me because everything in my head has to be perfect, and I have OCD, so that's impossible to happen when I'm having intrusive thoughts.  I felt like I had to be perfectly good, strong, and smart or I would have to hate myself and agonize over how I'm not meeting those standards.

25,"Hey reddit,

I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, but for some reason I procrastinate so much. Whenever I sit down to do work, this anxious, nervous feeling comes over me and I cannot bring myself to do the work. While procrastinating, that scary feeling goes away and then I feel no worry about my work, even if the deadline is the next day. I just calmly think “Meh, I can easily do it later.” Then, I start getting all panicky and start doing my work at like 3 am because I spent the entire day procrastinating, and while working I get the anxious feeling again and start crying uncontrollably. I begin to shake and mutter things under my breath to reassure myself. I’ve even had to lie about being sick so I wouldn’t have to go to school and have more time to make up the work! 

Each time, I promise to myself that I will never procrastinate again, because of the stress it causes me and all the school days I miss, but then I forget the feeling the next day and continue the cycle. Why do I do this? Am I mentally unstable? Also, along with the procrastinating, I get this weird mood swings where I hate myself for procrastinating and ruining my life that I turn suicidal and hopeless, like it’s just better if I don’t have to do anything anymore that will cause me this stress if I’m dead. What’s wrong with me? Am I going insane?

I’m thinking that maybe it’s because of my grades. I do really well in school, so maybe I just don’t feel pressured to study/work? But then it just hurts me in the end.

Today I’m missing another day of school because I procrastinated. This year, I’ve had more absences than I’ve had in all my other years combined. I’m really scared of this weird cycle of my “arrogant, confident” highs and “depressed, panicked” lows. I can’t afford to miss any more school. Even more importantly, my happiness and mental health is on a spiral. I can’t control how I feel or act anymore. Even if I WANT to study, I zone off and refuse to. I feel like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; I am a chill, unbothered person while procrastinating but a freaked out, sobbing mess while trying to complete my assignment!

Sorry if I sound dumb or like a complaining teen, but I genuinely feel sick and scared because of my procrastinating habits. Advice?

Thanks. ",13Apr2018,21

33,"I’ve had my first panic attack about 4 months ago when dad tried to kill me with a knife after finding out I had a lover. My panic attack is rather unusual, not like anything I’ve heard. I can breathe and I can think however I lose all my senses - almost as though I’m actually dying and fading away. I couldn’t see, heard people as though I was in a bubble and didn’t understand anything and couldn’t feel anything at all either. I couldn’t move to defend myself because I thought that if I moved an inch I was going to die. All my thoughts were religion related and all of them telling me that I’ll die and go to hell and if I didn’t, I’ll spend the rest of my life in this state of semi-madness. I felt detached from my body, as though I wasn’t there and felt nothing at all. I wasn’t even scared I was just numb all over hoping I’d die quickly before the ability to feel returned. I literally felt something break in me even after everything was over. And I was right, things were never the same again. I got over the trauma although I still get nightmares, note that I never had nightmares before in my life, quite frequently and on a regular basis. Not necessarily of the incident, but just nightmares in general. I also lost ability to be scared of things I need that should scare me. I lost my anxiety completely, even the stage fright that chased me endlessly. However, I’m now scared of Dad’s anger (I’m not scared of being near him. I don’t really hate him. I know, shocking) and people with masks that cover their entire face. I’m also scared of people talking in deep voices or shrill ones on purpose. I’ve never had that before and I’m not sure why I have this now. I feel like I’ve lost ability to care too. I genuinely don’t give a shit about anything even though I know that I’m not depressed at all. I don’t think twice about anything which literally makes me forget them no matter how important from how mundane they seem to me. I also get the feeling of detachment that I felt in my panic attack quite often. Especially after I take a nap, or get surprised even in a pleasant way or when I’m being intimidated. It also frequently happens from nothing, but when it does, nothing feels real and I feel like I’m not in my body and I take way longer to comprehend why others are saying or that they’re talking to me. I also have difficulty expressing feelings on my face due to lack of feelings in me. It’s as though I forgot how someone should act when they’re happy or surprised. I can’t even be properly with my lover because of this lack of feelings that I get so suddenly , however I mastered how to mimic love when the feeling arises because I still love him even though I can’t feel. I feel like I wouldn’t even care if he left me though. I genuinely feel like I’m made to be alone now because of all of this. It doesn’t make me sad, it brings me comfort. I often feel like running away from everyone. I feel like dying not from depression, but because I’m bored of the lack of feeling. I often do things to do dangerous and risky things to make me feel something. I feel like I’ll never be able to be the same person I was again.

One of my earliest memories of this was seeing a time-lapse video of a fox corpse decaying in biology class. Insects and maggots ate away at it's innards until it looked like it exploded in a mess of bugs. I cracked up while almost all the other kids refused to watch.

I laugh at r/watchpeopledie and browse it for entertainment. I love morbid humour, especially about super taboo subjects like rape and school shootings. Dramatic, violent scenes in movies are ridiculous to me. In Platoon when the sargent holds the little crying vietnamese girl at gunpoint, i laughed, in Full Metal Jacket when the Drill Sargent got shot by the crazy dude I laughed, I laughed at the 'sponge is dry' electrocution in Green Mile, and many other examples

I also am unable to form lasting relationships, although i don't really feel the desire to socialize it has impacted me in everyday life.

My bf asked me how I was feeling today and I just kinda word vomited all over the tiny rental car we are in at the moment. 

I cried. Like Kim Kardashian Ugly Cry. I just had to let it out. I have so much thoughts and emotions built up he wasn't prepared for the flood gates of the question. 

I am embarrassed and then I go to the bathroom because I'm early for work and there is blood with my urine. Well, guess I'm not pregnant this month. Really don't want to be pregnant right now (bipolar, financial, physical health, and relationship is rocky most days)  but I'm also disappointed every time I get mine. It's a weird emotional purgatory of feelings. 
If I didn't have dreams of being pregnant I probably wouldn't feel so weird. I have vivid dreams often that I am pregnant or already had a child. My bf is weirded out by this. 

I know it's Friday the 13th but it's taking everything in me to just go to work today. Today was not a great start but I know it can get better if I allow it. I'm just feeling emotionally stuck.

Suicide is not an option for me but it's getting tempting to just not suffer any more. I will NOT do it. I just know why people give up. It's an easy out.

47,"Yesterday I woke up for work feeling like I can’t even breathe. So I started to freak out of course. My chest hurt, I felt like crying for no reason. I got to work and immediately asked to go home because I knew we had enough people to cover the shift. So I told them that I would come in later because I knew they needed people later. So I went home and went straight to sleep, I woke feeling better. Went to work. Everything is fine. 

Today, I got up and I felt fine. I picked up a coworker and we went to work. Work was find for about an hour and I started to feel really angry for no reason. Like there was nothing to feel angry about. I’m angry with myself just thinking about it. So I went into another room and started to have another attack. I’m going through it right now. I have a coworker that usually helps me through this type of thing but he has no way of understanding of what I’m going through and I’ve always had trouble opening up to people because I just hate to feel weak. And I honestly just get more aggravated when he tries to help. 

I don’t know how to help myself because I have no idea what’s causing these panic attacks. I feel so weak and ashamed for feeling this way, I fucking hate it.   

I feel like I should seek professional help but I honestly just have no time for anything. I’ve been in therapy before to help me cope with my past but it never helped and probably made things far worse than they were before. I’m scared to tell my parents because they will travel 1,000 miles just to try to help me. And their “help” is never helpful because older people simply do not understand that type of shit. No one does unless they’re going through it as well.

- incredibly unorganised, keeping on top of everyday stuff is hard, 
- when having conversations i associate things that people dont associate together and so the change in topic often leaves people a little confused
- prone to waves of depression 
- overthinker, worrier, anxious. 
- people percieve me as a complete people-person but although im very aware, can feel the mood of the room and know how to make people feel better, i am perpetually socially anxious, find socializing exhausting. need a lot of time alone to recharge. 
- had an eating disorder. think it left me with no sense of myself
- feel like i dont know who i am
- cant remember any names of anyone who is famous or of movies or songs ever. 
- often feel disconnected from others 
- often described paradoxically as oblivious, conscientious, creative, impulsive, deep thinker 
- hate phones (texting/calling = no aha) 
- incredibly messy, somehow always last minute, struggle to be succinct when writing but also incredibly high standards for myself..
- I'm always commented on for being the overly-enthusiastic, childlike, funny one in my group of friends but I don't see myself that way...although it is real in that that is how I am with them but when i am alone , that version of me feels more like a performance.  really connect to the term ""chameleon""

53,"Topic: Depression/Unusual Therapies

I don't know whether to shout it from the rooftops that I'm getting TMS for my depression or to hide in shame.... But I decided shout it out, because a) fuck stigma, and b) so few people even know what it is. It stands for ""transcranial magnetic stimulation,"" and it's a therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Really, really treatment-resistant, we're talking tried and failed 4+ antidepressants.

So, TMS involves a psychiatrist mapping out your brain and then basically s/he puts a magnet thing on your head to zap the part of your brain that deals with mood. That's the best way I can explain it. It's totally noninvasive. And it's the wave of the future, and has virtually no side effects and you can drive to/from treatment on your own. It's in the same category as ECT (electroconculsive AKA electroshock therapy), but waaaayyy less scary and intensive. Also it has a high success rate, of approx 84% who go into full remission and one-third of patients go off their pills, and one-third reduce dosages and the rest stay on pills.

My first session is Tuesday afternoon, and I'll be getting 36 sessions over the course of 8 weeks.

58,"I think this entire subreddit knows me now, after obsessively posting about the same issue again and again but it's just eating me alive. Also, it seems pretty insignificant to some, but to me, it really feels unbearable.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, I've had bouts of depression my whole life. When I'm really depressed and anxious, I usually try to find something to focus on and I obsess over that thing because it distracts me from my toxic thoughts. Also, my obsession is the only thing that's keeping me alive, and as soon as I lose that intense passion, I'm shattered, because I've lost my distraction and I'm left alone with my pain and intrusive, horrible thoughts.

&amp;nbsp;

One year ago I discovered a band that clicked with me. It clicked with me so well that they became my entire life. I thought I was over my obsession with bands, because I'm not a teenager anymore, but I was wrong. I swear I spent several weeks just listening to this band, reading books about them, watching documentaries, watching backstage footage, watching interviews, etc. After being exposed to them for so long, I eventually lost interest in the band and burned out on their music, and for some reason, this made me suicidal because I no longer had something to focus my attention on, and I was back to my depressive state, even worse than before.

I tried to find something that sounds as good as this band, and makes me feel just as much but I couldn't find anything, so every few weeks I'll be going back to them in order to check if the burnout is gone or still there. After a few months, the burnout fades but as soon as I become interested and go back, I become an obsessive asshole again and I burn out on them once more. Then the cycle repeats.

&amp;nbsp;

I have no idea what this is but it's draining me emotionally because, when I develop an obsession, I feel like my life depends on that thing, be it as stupid as a TV show, band or video game. I have no idea whether other people have experienced this but I would love some insight. How do I break free from these obsessions and stop depending on them in order to ""cure"" my mental illness?",13Apr2018,16

It's with work as well, the long term full time job thing freaks me out.  With school, I didn't really want to go.  The only thing I've been able to commit to lately is playing the guitar and getting lessons, though even that I have to force myself to stick with it to a degree.  It seems I always come up with an excuse to back out or not act.

With respect to relationships, I'm only interested in open relationships.  I develop feelings for people, but there's a part of me that doesn't want to date.  Otherwise, I'm only interested in FWB or hook ups.  I know most people aren't into that stuff, so if I do actually decided to ""date"" someone, I feel like I'm going to be hiding the fact that I don't want to be chained to them, and I don't want to be in a committed relationship.

The funny thing is, this was never a problem for me before.  If I felt something for someone and they reciprocated I'd just jump right in, no doubts or anything in my mind, and I would be ""dating"" them, the exclusivity and commitment was just assumed after some physical intimacy and affection.

I don't know why I feel this way now. I don't think I'll ever be able to settle for a monogamous relationships.  I have no problem with open relationships or things like that, but the problem is most people want commitment, and I don't want to give that to them (at least not anymore). ",13Apr2018,1

Today my mother asked me in a kind voice if I want to see a psychologist. I have never hated her this much. I loathe them. Changing behavior suddenly won’t make me love them more. It just fills me with rage.
Maybe I’m just a sociopath, maybe it’s my fault for real. But I can’t stand them at all. I don’t want them to touch me and I don’t want to talk to them.
If I went to see a psychologist, they would get to know everything and I don’t want them in my life. They already know too much, and I don’t want anybody to know anything about me. Especially not them.
Maybe I’m a sociopath.
But I’d rather die than exposing myself this much.
I’d rather let depression consume me.
I am frightened, actually. I can’t talk to a psychologist. I want to erase my “family” from my life because I seem to hate everything and everyone. But I truly don’t want them in my life. Maybe I am not right. But I can’t stand their presence. I don’t want to try to build a bond when we have never shared one. I have always repressed myself. But maybe it’s not just because of them, but also because I am a sociopath. Still, I don’t want them in my life and we have nothing in common.
I’d like to kill myself. The sole idea of letting them into my life makes me go crazy. I don’t want to talk to them. I don’t want them to talk to me.
I wish I could easily kill myself.
I am too weak for this. I can’t go through all of this when I am still with my “family”. I don’t want to share even more with them. It makes me want to kill myself.
_They_ make me want to kill myself.
I want to do things on my own. I want to run away from anybody too. I can’t stand people. I can’t open up to them. I an terrified all the time. I don’t know how can I live like this. I wish I was normal. I think I used to be normal once, though. But maybe I was pretending.
I have been going through a depressive episode. Now that it ended I can tell I was truly depressed. I ruined myself. I cut myself. And all.
But now I am not depressed anymore. At least, I feel better. I decided not to self-harm, even if sometimes I feel like it, and I feel more energetic, even if I am still tired and sad. I have constant headache. And I also struggle making easy decisions such as: “Which book should I read today?”, “Which of the activities I planned should I do first?”, so that I end up doing nothing. I am also more productive, even if I am told it’s not enough. The truth is that anytime I bump into one of my relatives who live with me, I feel so enraged that I lose any kind of motivation and I just feel like crashing my head to the wall. I wish they could just ignore me. I wish I could just live on my own. I hate them. I loathe them.
Why do I still want to die, if I am not depressed anymore? (At least that’s what I think)

I have some other problems such as a just discovered gender dysphoria, loneliness and the fact that I am terrified of opening up to people. I just can’t let anyone in. I am frightened. What’s this? Am I a sociopath? Could it be social fobia or something?

I’ll go to a psychologist just if my relatives will be out of it.",13Apr2018,2
70,"Lately, I have seen many mentally ill people complaining about their family or close relatives' ignorance towards mental illness. I've read posts that terrified me, from people who said that they had to quit cold turkey because their doctor wouldn't prescribe them Adderall because ""it's basically meth"" or the parents wouldn't provide for their children's treatment because they think one can just ""snap out of it"" or just magically feel better instantly.

&amp;nbsp;

All I have to say is: you don't want to go through this. You don't ever want to know what it's like to battle with yourself everyday. You don't want to know what it feels like to watch everyone happilly live their lives while you're drowning in your own toxic emotions. You look completely normal on the outside, but no one knows that you're dying on the inside. It's absolute hell. And it's not just the emotional pain. We get physical pain with our mental illness too, you know? Headaches, stomach pain, acid reflux, back pain, anxiety-induced muscle tension, nausea, dizziness, these are all common experiences for those who have mental illness. And no, we're not just ""sad"" and pessimistic all the time. Even when we have moments of genuine happiness, the pain stays with us, and our brains are constantly trying to kill us. You can't just use the word 'sad' for describing us.  You know what a more accurate term would be? **PAIN.**

&amp;nbsp;

We go to school or work even though we feel overwhelmed. People with anxiety feel like they're constantly dying. People with depression feel like they're aleady dead inside. People with OCD can't silence their irrational painful thoughts. People with a personality disorder can't stop the self-loathing. Those with ADHD can't find joy in anything for too long and can't commit to anything. Bipolar people constanly think of ending it all because their bipolar depression won't come to an end.
These are all real representations of people suffering from mental illness. Yet, we drag ourselves to work, we provide for our family, we study and most importantly, we have a heart. We are the most empathetic people, because we know what it's like to suffer and we don't want anyone to go through that kind of pain. Yet, what do we get in return? Shaming, accusations, guilt and ignorance. All these from the people who are supposed to be our emotional pillars and help us when we're in need. No, going for a walk will not cure my depression. Trying to just ""brush it off"" will not cure my OCD. There's a clear difference between having a bad temporary mood and having a chronic, uncontrollable illness. Your brain allows you to feel a certain way, but whenever you feel like assuming that we're better off without meds, just remember:  our brains are broken. Our brains have developed unhealthy coping mecanisms. We are physically unable to feel differently since our neurotransmitters aren't working properly anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

No one would ever want to be stuck in this place, so whenever you want to tell someone with mental illness to just snap out of it, think twice. It hurts. It hurts us, because it takes our guilt (which is already too much) and multiplies it, making us feel even worse. We don't want to be like this. 

Please, understand that not everyone can cope with just therapy. Some people do, but some don't. Everyone is different, and telling someone to just stop taking their pills is harmful and very discouraging. No one wants to take dozens of pills every day, but it's not like we have a choice. Believe us, we constantly feel like there's something physically wrong with our brain. It feels like brain damage. That doesn just go away by itself. So, before getting your kid off Adderall, think how much you're hurting him both physically and emotionally.

&amp;nbsp;

All we want is to be normal. Loved. Suported. And we'll return the love twice as much. Please don't take from us the only thing that helps us function. Please don't make fun of us, don't shame us and don't act like we could just simply NOT be like this. Because if we could, we wouldn't be stuck in this state of mind. So please, be patient, be kind, and you'll se how, one day, we'll blossom.

&amp;nbsp;

**With love,**

71,"I've been seeing this therapist since the summer of 2016. I initially went because my dad had just died and the grieving process was taking a toll on my mental health. She really helped me through all of that, and I feel like working with her was a big part of why I made it through as well as I did. Since then our sessions have become sort of...routine I guess? I find that she asks the same typical types of questions over and over and doesn't seem to put much effort into the conversations, and also doesn't seem to be fully listening a lot of times. I can tell when she's tuned me out and is in her head, and I can tell when she clues back in and it's usually if I've mentioned something ""juicy"" or ""gossipy"" sounding. 

I don't have a huge problem with her personally, and we get along fine enough, it just feels like I could be getting a lot more out of therapy than what I'm getting with her. But the issue here is that I'm a VERY anxious person, and the idea of telling her the real reasons I want a different therapist is terrifying to me. But I don't want to just up and leave with no explanation either because I don't think that's fair.

Relative is now in psych hospital for a few days after suicide attempt. Staff will not talk to me due to HIPAA (?). I can offer her zero resources of any kind, other than logistical support and advocacy from many states away. 

Relative will be in denial about: homeless, penniless, unable to recover, can't work, no resources, unwelcome by all family. Will probably attempt to return to empty apartment. 

Relative will probably reject idea of any state aid programs (halfway houses, group homes, shelters, disability). (Sorry-- I'm not familiar with proper terminology)

Some of these drugs aren’t even FDA cleared for adolescents and can permanently fuck up your kid since adolescence is one of the most important stages of brain development. Most doctors there don’t have a PhD in psychiatry but are somehow qualified to treat your kid when they have a PhD in another field. The doctors also switch off with other doctors every 6 months and go into another part of the hospital. So, they are not even committed to staying with the kids there. Avoid getting your kid sent here at all costs and remember that your kid has a right to refuse any medication. These medications are not only harmful to them but also cost extreme amounts of money and yes the insurance may cover it but the cost will skyrocket for you . Then when your kid becomes an adult it will screw them over.  The staff were complaining everyday about being underpaid and would usually bring a negative attitude to work. Whereas the doctors are probably are extremely overpaid since it cost something like 5000 dollars a week or more for your kid to be there to be treated as lesser human beings. Try finding an alternative to this place if you are given any other options and absolutely do everything in your power to not let them take your kid if they have a disability. The staff are not understanding at all instead of using calming techniques they hold them down and shout at them when the disabled kid doesn’t understand what they did wrong. They will punish the kids who don’t know any better but when another kid is being destructive/disruptive but has a normal functioning level the staff will let them go around screaming, yelling, and even breaking things and not make any attempt to stop it other than say “go to your room” “you aren’t going outside” Some of the kids there are not even kids. They are 18 year olds who got to choose to go to the kids psychiatric ward instead of the adults. Real safe right putting 18 year old men in the same place with 13 year old girls. Not only are they 18 but some are court ordered to be there and were given the option to either go to juvenile detention or the psychiatric ward for a crime they committed . Obviously they will choose the physc ward. So , they have criminals with your kid. Like I said try to avoid getting your kid sent here and if they do get them out as quick as possible.",13Apr2018,5
81,"I like my imaginary friends more than my actual friends sometimes.  I haven't talked to my wuss manly man friend in a month and Danny's in India right now. I tried calling a girl I kind of know who I think doesn't want to talk anymore...I'm pretty sure she was looking for a fling, and I didn't feel it so...she was strange anyway...I wouldn't mind talking to her since I've got no one else to call though.

I have no one to call, or talk to right now, so it's always nice to believe I'm more important than I actually am.  ",13Apr2018,1
