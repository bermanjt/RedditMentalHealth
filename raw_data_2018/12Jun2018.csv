1,"Sooooooo just wanting to vent, I've been in a circular mind f#*k with my husband who has seemingly somehow what I like to call ""hit his head"" over night ..... It took me forever to get this man to get some mental help, when he finally went they put him on rittilan for ADD and resperdone for 'anger' he seemed to slowly but surely started becoming emotionally healthy, then one day said he didn't want to be on medication his whole life.... he now takes it when he feels like it and has emotionally and physically and sexually flat lined....
 He has started to live in a state of blame and chronic denial, he has some how managed to say my feelings are nagging and bitching. I even talked to him about the small things in life that are really important to me, but he will say I'm bitching about them or reminding him too much of the things I want or need so he gets ""tired of hearing it"" and won't provide it, he's slowly physically started to have bad hygene and become stuck and fixated on FB and netflix... He has forgotten big things like picking up his son.... His emotional disconnect seems out of this world, even when I reached out for support and to vent and talk he tried telling me I was ""talking shit"" about him.... He recently went to his annual training and before he left he started telling me we need to split ways that I nag too much, but really over done all the women and man chores around the house, all I've ever asked him to do was get custody of his son, or look up healthy relationship advice.. or attend counseling. The days I don't care about his no remorse, or lack of conscience and i generally do what he wants we get along.... Other then that we will argue, I hate thinking about walking away from my marriage, or being sold a man who has horrible personality traits that he covered up...until marriage. I keep thinking the anti psycotic could have triggered him to have some kind of psycotic episode since he takes it when he wants... He generally tells me when he does listen to me, that he ""doesn't believe he is that bad"" which to me screams denial..... I've stuck it out for a very very long year of devaluing myself by staying with him and explaining why I'm worth certain things ... But he always seems to think I claim to be ""perfect"" which is out of this world far from anything I project in any matter... Medicine? Personality? Ugh I'm exhausted this isn't even .05%  should I have already ran?

2,"I feel good tonight. Not manic or anything, just okay. My mental health is \- for the moment \- kind of stable I suppose. No crying or sadness or anything crazy.

Yet... I am sitting here watching music videos on YouTube and the casual, flitting thought just came to me ""I should find a blade and slice my arm with it""  


This is what I wish more people would GET about mental illness. One does not have to be wishing they would die, or sad, or in a particularly bad moment of life to want to self harm or do bad things to themselves.

I feel good tonight. I really do. I am texting some friends, having some laughs with them. I've watched some comedy shows and been outright wheezing at how funny, enjoying some music etc etc.  


But that one flitting moment among that peace came ""cut yourself, go on, do it""

3,"So my uncle is about 50 years old, and his situation is getting out of hand. His family is treating him like shit and wants to get rid of him.

**BACKGROUND: He was a rebel as a child, no one could control him. He did have a car accident as a teenager and abused drugs**

He‚Äôs been mentally unstable for almost all his life. I don‚Äôt know what he has exactly, but I‚Äôll explain it and maybe some of you may be able to.

When he‚Äôs on his meds, he‚Äôs literally the sweetest, kindest, funniest man ever. He wouldn‚Äôt hurt a fly, and sings all the time. But sometimes, he would start talking about weird things. Like about how he wants to create a shuttle, and how he‚Äôs actually a king, sometimes he acts like he‚Äôs part of the mafia and he actually dresses like them. Sometimes he gets a bit abusive with his family, and gets angry out of nowhere.

He even went to a super famous building in my country and asked them to evacuate claiming he owns the building, and he doesn‚Äôt want tenants anymore. It was so believable that everyone was begging him to give them at least a few months to move. Until they found out he‚Äôs not the actual owner.

Anyways, so the last thing that happened was that his family claimed that he tried to kill his wife using a gun, although when the cops came they didn‚Äôt find a gun. So they put him in a mental hospital.

The doctor called a few days ago asking us to come pick him up, and that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with him! He says that he‚Äôs literally the best patient there and he‚Äôs friends with everyone.

I feel like my family and his family don‚Äôt know how to deal with his situation because its very unexpected. Any advice?

4,"Two years ago, my mom started to forget her words. Over time, she started to make mistakes at work and was eventually fired due to forgetting things. Fast forward to 2018, and she is a shell of her former self. She rarely wears makeup or combs her hair. She doesn‚Äôt care what she wears, doesn‚Äôt remember her kid‚Äôs birthdays, or even knows what day it is. We had her tested and she was diagnosed with pseudo dementia.

Has anyone ever had a family member diagnosed with pseudo dementia? How were they treated? Did they return to their normal self? ",12Jun2018,2
5,"My dad is the smartest sweetest dad a person could have. He‚Äôs never treated us badly and though he‚Äôs had his struggles he‚Äôs always been present ( mom and him have been split up since I was 1, I am 31)... 

My dad takes medication  his manic depression /and bipolar ... 

For the most part , I know how to handle my dad . If he‚Äôs too intense I stick to text , however I try to call him a lot because I know how much he loves us .. he‚Äôs never been a bad person or bad dad . It‚Äôs just hard when you see other people with their perfect seeming families and dads who have these high level jobs and can just  help with whatever ( buying a car , paying tuition and rent , etc) my dads been unemployed since I was 14 and on disability ...  I don‚Äôt resent him because I‚Äôve worked very hard for what I have but at times I get sad For him ... 

Anyways my dad is going to go visit some family and they are a little judgemental plus he hasn‚Äôt flown in years and he is flying from Cali to South America . I saw him yesterday and he lost it . The stress and feeling like he isn‚Äôt good enough and being judged just took a toll on him. He broke down and cried in front of me and apologized for being such a ‚Äúloser‚Äù and told me to always know my brother and I are the best things that ever happened to him and he‚Äôs so proud of us . It broke my heart .. i has some depression earlier this year and anxiety and I felt my dads pain. I used to think people with depression could help themselves but that shit is no joke .... I felt my dads pain . My dad doesn‚Äôt have much in this world besides me and my brother 

Just had to share since in front of him and most people I have a poker face / ice queen persona.. really inside I‚Äôm super sensitive and full of emotions üòî",12Jun2018,1
6,"I‚Äôm here hoping some one can help me. To start off, I‚Äôd like to believe in myself more. Make some goals. Set my priorities with work, school, and relationships.
But, I‚Äôve got problems. A bunch of them. I‚Äôve been hospitalize eight times in the past three years and have never been closer to the brink of suicide.
I‚Äôm a 22 year old male. I have communication issues. I don‚Äôt let people get to know me, but rather try reflect what positivity that‚Äôs shown to me back to others. There may be something wrong with my personality. I try to give the love I receive back to the world, but I‚Äôm not exactly equipped for that. I was raised kinda old school with a genuine fear of my father‚Äôs belt. I‚Äôve  gotten beat many times but I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call it child abuse. The real abuse was the ongoing neglect from my mother. She got sick with MS when I was young, and I couldn‚Äôt have felt any more apathy towards the situation. I mean she was awfully sick. She was bedridden for years in probably extreme amounts of pain. Me being a very morbid nine year old, said plenty of goodbyes to a woman I hardly knew. A couple years later she went into remission. Strange to say out loud, but It was a bit awkward for me. 
I‚Äôve been depressed for as long as I can remember. I don‚Äôt have any history of mental illness in my family (although my mom could seriously use some Klonopin). I‚Äôm first generation American and have duel ethnicity. No history of domestic violence between parents. No drug or alcohol abuse within my family. 
I dropped out of college and live with my parents currently. I can‚Äôt function anymore nor cope with the stress of getting a degree. I‚Äôve changed my major five times to spark little to no interest in anything I study, albeit my grades are virtually second to none. 
It seems like my father is the only family member I have who tries to understand me, but he doesn‚Äôt get that my life has sucked for a long time. Maybe I‚Äôm posting this in the wrong thread, but I‚Äôve always been a strong believer of this; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two types of people in this world. Those who‚Äôs best years are behind them, and those who are ahead of them.‚Äù I‚Äôm the latter. 
Oh and did I mention. I‚Äôm paranoid as hell. Or maybe I‚Äôm not. Hard to tell what‚Äôs real anymore.
 I don‚Äôt know how to manage my redundant thought patterns as to an array of negative social implications. My mindset gets in the way of a more positive outlook of what could be. Such as things I might look forward to. This negative thinking is amplified by my intrusive thoughts retaining to a lack of self confidence tangled with disassociation. I‚Äôm not sure if you can relate, but I‚Äôve spent my whole life around people whose social niches just seemed so different than mine.  Maybe I just found the wrong crowd. 
I went through months of DBT, CBT, and group counseling, but all it did was compound what little envy I had for my peers into a conspicuous shame that I now wear.
The people I‚Äôve reached out to refuse to understand that my inability to make important decisions when it matters most has been a mind tearing reocurrent dismantling theme of disaster in my life. It does nothing but augment a life of  isolation and anger. Just when I start to feel competent and in tune with reality, something shitty happens. I can‚Äôt cope and have learned to use cryptic and minimal dialogue due to an aberration of what leadership potential I‚Äôve always envisioned for myself. 
I try to act like nothing bothers me and, truth be told, it‚Äôs not a very good game plan. If we‚Äôre taking into consideration the social implications that disturb me the most and the ever-prominent obstacles that stand in the way of a more communal, appreciative, and carefree lifestyle, it can become clear that my problems are on the complicated side of things. 
I don‚Äôt know, maybe I just need to get laid. 
As far as what keeps me going is the feedback I‚Äôve gotten from my support group (which I no longer have). 
I do though continue to have severe depression.
I feel like I‚Äôve heard it all. Small talk bores me. And usually nothing anyone says sparks my interest.
I also suffer with agoraphobia, severe social anxiety, PTSD, and possibly a psychotic illness such as bipolar or schizoaffective disorder, although I‚Äôve never reported nor experienced any such symptoms associated with either two illnesses except for paranoia. But, I live in New Jersey and some of my ruminating thoughts of ill will proposed by others are dignified. Or rather should be. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong here. I‚Äôm nuts, but I‚Äôm also kind of smart, so medicating me should be criminal. IMO
I may not be God‚Äôs gift to the world, but I think I owe it to my myself to get my shit together. 
I‚Äôve tried the pharmaceutical approach, but to me it‚Äôs been a mudslide of problems. Time after time I‚Äôve  wished for the best, and unfortunately the best may be out of reach. After multiple seemingly life threatening allergic reactions to medications i‚Äôm still seeking help.  Between hospitals, a dozen psychiatrists, and a ton of meds, I‚Äôm left broken, counter intuitive at times, and can be a little slow when it comes to mindfulness, but deep down i know that I‚Äôm pretty damn confident. I just can‚Äôt show it. And me being the antisocial person whose tired of cliches; I just want to say this. I wouldn‚Äôt wish these feelings of emptiness on my worst enemy. 
This lifestyle i have is awful. I‚Äôve been told to ‚Äúaim for progress not perfection‚Äù but it just seems to me that this journey of healing has be nothing but counter intuitive.
The medications psychiatrists like to prescribe to me are extremely powerful, and I mean that with a mildly cynical connotation. I value my intelligence, my vitality, and my ability to express myself, but antipsychotics strip me of those things.  I‚Äôve gotten every side effect in the book and pained through it all for up to a year now, even dropping down to my hands and knees, gasping for air, at times. I wanted to take a breath, but it just felt like no air was coming in or out of my lungs. I was suffocating in my hospital room and still, I took those meds for ongoing weeks out of sheer desperation to be, I guess for lack of a better word, normal.
I tapered off my antipsychotics with the help of my general physician and pray it‚Äôs for the best. Going forward, I can only do so much on my own but I‚Äôm looking for the help that I need. 
Truth be told, I feel like I‚Äôve fought my demons and won. It‚Äôs other people‚Äôs demons that kinda worry me.
Who can relate?

7,"I have never been the most mentally sound (maybe a little manic depressive?) but I am productive and creative and loved. Well, I was.

I had a son ten months ago. My birth experience was extremely traumatic, I feel panicked when I think about it, I can almost start to feel the pain again.
When I gave birth to my son i had no medication, no epidural. I had labored through the night during hurricane Irma and there were tornados destroying homes near us. The wind sounded like a monster. by the time the hospital came off ‚Äúlock down‚Äù I was 8cm and had to push. 
I won‚Äôt go into the detail of my sons birth but the pain became so intense that I tried to die. I tried to shut my body down, I closed my eyes as I lay there sweating and naked, surrounded by people, bleeding. Earth shaking pain. I felt so weak that I tried to die so I could stop it. I don‚Äôt even know how to explain what i mean by ‚Äútried to die‚Äù 

And here is where it gets strange: 
I think I did. I stopped writhing and everything went black for a while, The next thing I can remember the nurse speaking to me so angrily. Telling me I had no choice. But ever since my son was born things have been so bad. Again, I will do my best to spare details but close friends and family have all half joked about us being cursed. I cannot gain weight, my husband and I hate each other, my relationship with my parents is shit, Im not as good of a mother as I need to be. I would not let someone watch my children who was as depressed as I am so why am I allowing myself? My mental health is deteriorating. Tonight I felt almost afraid of my son while I was thinking about how I think I may have died. I was thinking about the curse or what I may have encountered if I died or maybe I didn‚Äôt die but something happened and I tapped into something and I brought it back or I maybe accidentally exposed my baby to something because I was too weak. 

I can‚Äôt stop crying now that I read what I wrote. I really believe it but I know how it sounds. I just want to be medicated so I can fit in with society and not believe these things and raise my suburban white children like a good suburban wife-Mom. 

I don‚Äôt know why I wrote this. 
Thank you for reading it.

Brother has autism and is very low functioning.

I have depression anxiety and OCD. My psychiatrist suspects I may also have some autism, but I haven't had the desire to get officially diagnosed.

I'm legit scared to have kids. I don't want then growing up to be depressed and not want to live. If they grow up with mild autism like I possibly did, life would be bearable.

10,"Hi, 18yr old(f) speaking. The summer before my sophomore year  I found out what BPD(boardline personality disorder). When I started researching about it I felt so relieved, cause  I thought I finally knew what was wrong with me. I know it‚Äôs best to get an actual doctor/psychiatrist note, but I felt so strongly connected to the symptoms. I even took a lot of online BPD tests and came up very boardline. I saw this a stepping stone to an actual accurate diagnosis.
When I told my doctor she pretty much said those are very inaccurate and that was too young to be considered boardline. I ended telling some of the adults in my life like a well trusted teacher, my therapist, school consoler; they all said it may just be the combination of my anxiety and depression plus my developing brain. 
I‚Äôm currently 18 and have been researching into it again as of late. I still relate to a lot of the symptoms to the point where I don‚Äôt think it is a coincidence.",12Jun2018,1
11,"I understand this isn't a formal diagnosis and I'll probably talk to someone professional soon but just wondering what reddit thinks. I feel like I have some anxieties etc. that aren't normal haha.  

Here are some examples:
 If I go through a light that's turned yellow (regardless of if it turned yellow recently) I have to literally watch the light while I go under it or I get extremely anxious that I might have run a red light even if I know I probably didn't.  Whenever I go out, if I get drunk at all, the next day I'll be so concerned that I acted inappropriately (even though I'm a very appropriate person) that I can't do anything else until I've confirmed multiple times that I was fine.  I also have a lot of anxiety about somehow hurting people's feelings or being a bad friend or person. If there's anything that I might have done that was wrong (even from over 6 years ago) if I start to think about it I can't stop for hours.  I also stress about having not done things that I know I've done (such as setting alarms or submitting assignments.)  I'll frequently check multiple times if I've set my alarm and that the volumes on etc. every night.

12,I just feel like I'm such a waste of space. I just never feel like I'm good enough and that I'd be doing the world a favor if I killed myself. I don't really have any close friends. When I do get friends they end up leaving me so I don't know why I even try. I'm so sick of hating myself. I'm sick of fighting my own thoughts and emotions. I'm tired from having to be strong when everything inside is falling apart. I honestly just wanna give up. Everything inside of me is screaming but on the outside Everything seems just fine.

14,"I dont know when it started but I get these really irrational fears and such. Example would be that I, at some point, was paranoid that my brother would kill me. If he's walking behind me, I'd think he's going to choke me or if I hear any metal clanking coming from him, I would think he's searching for a knife and is out to stab me... 

I have a great relationship with my brother with the typical arguments from time to time, so I don't know where this is coming from. (I get these same ideas about my mother as well)

Another example is my irrational fear of fires (which i believe was actually triggered by something) but if I smell anything like smoke my first thought is that there's an emergency fire or something like that and I'll get really panicky until I figure out where the smell is coming from.

15,"My parents have shown time and time again to believe all forms of mental illness are just a person victimizing themself, and this is particularly true in my case since I happen to be LGBT and they therefore believe everything I do is for attention. I've been self harming for years (mental health issues started around the same time a form of sexual abuse started when I was 7, self harm started at 14. I'm currently 17, 18 in October), I've attempted suicide a handful of times, needing medical help twice but I lied to my parents about what caused the issues and they still believe it's an accident, and I have no idea what's wrong with me but it feels like my mind is eating itself.

Sidenote about the self harm: my parents definitely know about it to some degree, but refuse to address it or think of it as self harm. They don't like to think about me having mental health issues because it makes them feel like failures, and also because I had cancer and have written confessions from my mother that after that she is too afraid to ""lose"" 9-year-old me that she distanced herself, perhaps became neglectful (previously she was near abusive), and that she refuses to think of me as anything different from who I was when I was 9.

I need help, I have spoken with a friend who deals with similar things and she fully believes I need help, has gone so far as to offer driving me to therapy and recommended a therapist, and when I told her I was suicidal she said she'd take me to the hospital if my parents didn't step up. I don't want to let her down and I don't want to get so bad I try again. I'm afraid to tell my parents but I'm more afraid of showing them the only way they're really going to lose me is by letting me keep getting worse until I inevitably kill myself.

So, please, how do I do this? I need help, my grades have dropped, my arm and legs are littered with scars, I've deeply considered running away and attempted suicide multiple times, how on earth do I convince my parents it's serious without scaring them? How do I bring it up? How do I actually get them to accept everything without turning a blind eye?

20,"At some point years back, I had too much shit to do with too many fires to put out and I just kind of shut down for a year while drinking myself under the table most days. I'm finally back on top of things for a year, then a lot of things are on fire at once in rapid succession (abnormally so ... arguably more than last time I shut down)... and I'm just kind of quitting caring about anything and want to crawl back under a rock again.

I really, really need to re\-rail a ton of things, all at once in short order. Really buckle down and pull my worth. But the more this becomes urgent, the less I care and the stronger my urge is to just take out my savings and move, or just drop everything. I stand to lose a lot of potential reward if I do such a thing. But at this point I'd pay money to just walk away from everything.

At this point I've just kind of been chilling while just short of just avoiding phonecalls from my boss/family/friends/etc. I still go to my first job every day, just nearly ready to ditch my second. But my 1st job can't provide a ladder or career or resume material, and my 2nd job can't provide benefits or enough hours\*pay to live on, and everything family related has gone more tits up than it's ever been, and there seems to be a funeral every two fucking weeks for months, and literally (\*literally\*) every member of my immediate family has a health or financial crisis or both that requires my help, and there's multiple lawsuits I'm tangentially affected by ongoing, and my coworkers have slowly become scornful fucks while management keeps punishing us until moral improves, and I'm trying to quit all drug use, and I'm trying to rebuild my hobbies, and I'm trying to rebuild my social life, and I'm trying to improve myself in most aspects, and I've been having DPDR episodes and been suffering from some kind of generalized anxiety and panic and depression complication for months while finding out that I've been wrong to ignore all the people over my life who have told me I have a developmental disorder (Spoiler: Turns out I do, and getting through University was the peak of what I'll ever manage) and what this means for me, and I really miss my old career\-relevant job that was lost due to someone else blowing it up so badly it derailed the lives of me and four other people and their own entire family and flushed a years worth of my work down the drain so hard I can't even put it on my resume (...there isn't even a reference to call anymore... and some of the people involved in this are angry at me for what someone else did...) when I'm right out of University while entry\-level job requirements are inflating exponentially faster than I can get relevant experience and I can't afford to work an unpaid internship while still laden with tens of thousands of dollars in student debt. Meanwhile: Ongoing politics, the about\-to\-nosedive economy which hasn't seemed to really recover from the last crash, and the rapidly darkening future in which I live out of my car and keep a loaded gun as my retirement plan.

I can't stop thinking about what I should have said differently, what I should have let go, and I'm obsessed with being right and at the same time trying to be the ""bigger"" person who can let others have the last word. Even about very subjective things like whether a movie is good or not, I feel like there needs to be one answer that everyone agrees on. I know that's not possible, but i can't stop fixating on being right. It's exhausting to always be thinking in such black and white, analytical terms. And especially fixing on being right or better makes me feel like such a jerk. Basically my head is like everyone must agree with me or they are wrong. And then I'll analyze what they probably think of me and how I came off to them. Then I end up mad at myself and replaying any ""mistake"" I made in how I acted, like not being sensitive to someone's feelings or actually listening to their side, or egging on ridiculous arguments in the first place. Overall I'm just constantly evaluating arguments or disagreements and getting angry over nothing.",12Jun2018,3
24,"So me and my therapist (and my GP and eventually my gyno) are trying to figure out how much of an impact my hormonal imbalance has on my mental health, and realistically I know its impacting it and I do get horrific PMS (enough to qualify as PMDD) but I have mental health issues even when I'm not PMSing. I only get a natural period about 3-4 times randomly a year so its not like I'm PMSing after PMSing constantly. I just came off birth control which I found just totally numbed me and now that I'm off, I'm getting tons of mood swings that only last a few minutes to a few hours which happened before birth control too.

I'm NOT asking for medical advice, but my therapist kinda seems hesitant to continue seeing me because of this, she didn't even try to make a next appointment the last time I saw her last week when the week before that I was nearly hospitalized for suicidal ideation (and I'm NOT experiencing the same symptoms that I go through when I PMS, that's a constant horribly depressed mood and my moods the last month or so are ranging from suicidal to ""I love everything"" within a matter of days and no as far as I'm aware I'm not hitting the full symptoms of mania or hypomania, so its most likely not bipolar). 

I am planning on getting my hormones checked soon but does anyone have any experience with this? I do have a hormonal imbalance/adrenal gland issue I was born with that's been confirmed by blood tests when I was 16 (and suspected PCOS, but never confirmed but I haven't had anything checked recently so I don't know if anything has changed). So how much of an influence would a hormonal imbalance have on mental health? Can this all be explained by hormones? ",12Jun2018,1
25,"Hi everyone. I just wanted to share some things that I‚Äôm proud of today. I currently have a dx of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and mild OCD, and even with the meds and therapy I‚Äôm getting I sometimes find getting through the day very very difficult. But today was a good mental health day for whatever reason.
Today I did not hurt myself in any way. My intrusive thoughts and compulsions decided to chill out for once. I didn‚Äôt take any naps. Other than going to work, which I have to do even on the really bad days, I ate three reasonably healthy meals that I prepared myself, worked out, scheduled appointments over the phone, showered, took care of my skin, and even flossed.

It might seem silly, but it‚Äôs small victories like these ones that give me hope for a normal, happy life in my future. Do you guys experience this?

26,"Hey everyone, mods if for some reason this breaks any rules feel free to remove. 

Long post incoming first part is backstory 

I'm needing some advice regarding my ex I suppose girlfriend. Roughly three weeks ago she broke up with me out of the blue after roughly three weeks of dating. Now the issue is that we are also co workers and she went to our HR and filed a complaint about me regarding an incident that never actually happened, saying that I not only pointed my handgun at her but shot her as well and she supposedly has a mark on her chest to ""prove"" it. Now, I have my carry ammunition and snapcaps which are cartridges that have a casing and a plastic bullet which means they don't fire out of the gun. So it's actually impossible for me to have ""shot"" her. She does suffer from depression, her brother suffers from bipolar and I think her mother suffers from something as well and after hearing things from other coworkers she truly believe this happened. So I did some research and I'm wondering if she is having a persecutory delusion stemming from something and I suppose I just want to know if I'm on the wrong track here. I guess I'm just looking for answers here, I love this girl and planned to propose to her after we graduate next year. I don't even know how I could possibly help her if my thinking is correct since while I was cleared of the accusation at work we are not supposed to have any contact. I'm confused and worried that she does have something and that she'll continue to get worse without any treatment. I apologize for the long and rambling post but I'm searching for answers and advice for a situation that doesn't make any sense.

Do they also force drugs on people in jail/prison?

Yes, prisons are full of psychiatrists dealing drugs for the giant corporations, by force.

Of course many are ordered by a court, but that doesn't mean there was any actual evidence of a crime.

35,"I've lurked reddit a bit, but I've just found this sub and wanted to post.

Recently, I narrowly missed attempting suicide. Since then I have had therapy and spoken somewhat openly with my other half. My big problem though is there are some truths I have not been able to say, and I have said what I think I am expected to say. I like my therapist, he is very supportive, and I haven't sensed any judgement from him. But I still hear myself saying some of the old lies, and its easy, because I say what people expect me to say, and I am totally honest about everything else.

I hate my life and I am entirely going through the motions of what people expect of me and have the fewest people possible to be unhappy at me, including with my family. Materially I've got it better than most. Steady professional job, we own a house/car, and money isn't tight, so it is easy to put a gloss over it. I find myself spewing out the same platitudes week in week out. 

However that same steady professional job i find incredibly stressful. It is ultimately 100&amp;#37; responsible for me wanting to commit suicide, but I feel I can't leave it because I have obligations and responsibilities to my life that I hate. I have spoken to people about hating my job, but not the rest of my life. 

I fear if I tell people what I actually think about my life, they'll say ""well that's life, very few people enjoy their job, you just have to suck it up"" because I know a lot of people have it worse. But if this is a good life then I might as well kill myself, because I hate living it, and better to let someone else have my resources/opportunities. This is exactly what was going through my mind.

44,"Some background to what happened prior.

My brother, for the past 3 years approximately, has displayed some very alarming and erratic behaviour. Things at times have become violent, or have been more of the delusional nature.  For example, I remember my brother once posted a photo on Instagram of him smiling, with trees in the background of the photo he posted. A day later, a girl he found attractive posted a headshot (LinkedIn style headshot type photo) of her on Facebook with trees in the background. He saw this and thought that the attractive girl was in love with him and was trying to translate that through her photo. 

From events like this, I obviously knew something was very wrong. He has gotten violent on many occasions, and I have had to call the police on my own brother about 5 times now, as I was scared someone in my family was going to get hurt when he was getting out of control. Once, he pulled a knife on my father, and threatened to hurt him if my dad didn't give him money. 

One day, he had a complete psychotic breakdown that was probably the scariest day of my life. He was arrested, and then was admitted into a psych ward, and stayed there for around 2-3 months. After years of doctors sending us away and saying everything was fine and normal, he was finally diagnosed with a disorder in the schizophrenia family. Basically, his sickness made him imagine that people or society altogether were plotting for or against him. He would genuinely believe the things his mind told him (think almost conspiracy theories that someone genuinely believed, based on the most random details he experienced through his day to day, like the photo of the girl with trees in the background). He has been getting monthly shots of meds since that day, and his real self has come back. He has been very kind and sweet and has returned to the sensitive self that he once was. He has not gotten violent or aggressive for around a year and a half now. 

Everything had seemed to return to normal; however, recently, he has not been getting out of bed for days at a time. Whenever I asked him if he was okay, he would simply tell me to go away and not to worry about it. My parents are very panicky people and are somewhat traumatized from his past, and have been freaking out because of this. I knew something was up, and that it was bigger than depression alone.

Today, he texted me and told me to keep it private between him and I that he is addicted to cocaine, and does not know how to get off of it. He said that when he lies in bed, he is lucid dreaming, and he is trying to get his mind off Coke, which is on his mind constantly. He said Coke started recreationally for him after he graduated last year, but has turned into a problem. He has had issues holding jobs for years now, and this is probably part of it. He said he would like to get off of coke but do it recreationally when the time is right for that type of thing, such as a party. 

My brother has had the project of rebuilding a car for the last 5 years now. Basically, he was very ambitious and decided to fully replace the motor of his VW with a bigger and better one. This project has cost him tens of thousands of dollars, and unfortunately has failed. The car won't start, and the vehicle sits vacant in the front of our house. from time to time he will try to fix it, but I think he has given up. He said that every time he thinks of the car, he gets upset and feels like a failure, and does a line of Coke to deal with the pain. This car has been a source of conflict for a long time in my family, as it is quite the eyesore (imagine a completely deconstructed car sitting vacant in front of a townhouse in a carport). My parents are egging him on to deconstruct it and sell the parts for money, but they are not aware of his addiction and I cannot tell them, as they will get angry and possibly kick him out. 

I am very worried that he will spiral and go back to his old ways of being aggressive and quite delusional if his addiction continues. I don't know much about drugs, but I am very scared because of his sickness and the past. Since he has confided in me, he is trusting that I don't tell my parents. As I mentioned, my mom and dad are very triggered people and would instantly get angry and panic if they knew about this, only making things worse. My mom is the type to get explosively angry and yell when she's scared, and my dad gets very stressed and sad. I want to do what's best for my brother and support him, but I am not sure of what to do in this situation. I would ideally like him to get help and get off of Coke altogether, but I don't know what steps to take. 

I would appreciate any sort of advice or support from any of you who have experienced something like this, or have knowledge about addiction that I do not have. I appreciate you guys for reading my post, and will be open to any type of feedback regarding what steps I need to take with my brother to send him in the right direction. ",12Jun2018,10

I‚Äôve been doing a lot of thinking, and self evaluating here recently, mainly because I‚Äôve come to the realization with how I cope with my problems are not the healthiest way to handle situations that I meet. 

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with a few different illnesses throughout the years, Bipolar depression, Major depression, PTSD, and severe anxiety to name a few. 
I have stopped taking medication to treat these for over a year now, I‚Äôve been put on a few different ones that didn‚Äôt seem to help me, or made situations worse.

49,"I'll add a tldr at the end. Also sorry for possible formatting issues, on mobile.

Yesterday, I (23/whatever) woke up with the sensation of my brain falling out of the back of my head. My partner (29/M) was there when I woke up and presumably tried to tell me I was okay. He told me to feel for myself and I still felt like it was happening. He then reached to feel for himself and I recoiled or something? (Sorry I am very fuzzy and am relying on his memory for most of this)

I then got up to shower and my cat was sitting on the counter yelling for sink water. I was very distressed and saw shadows fleeing the edges of my vision. Then my cat's meows turned into another language? Like i was hearing something else with the meows and got some bad images in my head. The a.c. then came on and I didn't recognize it and covered my ears. Apparently this is when I started making a lot of noise and my partner started knocking and calling for me. I just heard a lot of what I can only think of as audio-mush and intermittent short screams.

I went out the other side of the bathrooms (they're connected with shower in between) and was standing in the master/partner's bedroom. He came in thinking I was trying to avoid him and I startled and huddled into the corner of the bed and the nightstand. He sat in front of me and tried talking to me. This part is the most unclear so I'll do it as separate points.

-I insisted that I was awake and not tired or sleepy in any way. Which would be true, I don't feel sleepy after waking up and am very clearheaded within a minute of being awake

-i insisted that he was trying to steal my brain and kept the back of my head covered with my hand

-i told him about the cat talking to me

-He suggested I shower to ""clear my head"" and I was extremely suspicious. The cat looked at me as if to say ""don't trust him""

After a while of all this happening, I started playing with the cat and felt fine. He helped me up and I went to shower, completely normal. He asked me about it after I got ready to go out and I didn't really remember anything. I asked this morning so I could take notes and it didn't feel familiar? I had a hard time concentrating on remembering details and got a bit of a headache.

This isn't the first time something like this has happened and I don't know what to do. I'm in therapy but don't feel it's helping, I have lots of other mental health issues too. Any advice at all or suggestions on what to tell my therapist next time I see him would be great.

50,"I would really appreciate some advice from people who have experienced anxiety disorders, either personally or as a caregiver/partner. 

I believe that my partner is suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I would like to encourage him to get help, beginning with a proper diagnosis. I don‚Äôt want to be pushy about it or add to his anxiety by making him feel like there is something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with him. Having fought depression for much of my life, I understand how counterproductive it is to be made to feel like something is wrong with you. 

I have broached the subject a number of times, but I don‚Äôt push it. I try to just leave it as ‚ÄúI think that getting some professional guidance could really benefit you and your ability to manage and cope with stress‚Äù. I have mentioned that I suspect GAD. He does recognize that his stress and anxiety are often overwhelming and he doesn‚Äôt seem to be completely closed off to the idea that it is beyond what would be considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, but for whatever reason, he seems to feel like he should be able to manage on his own and I don‚Äôt know how to break through that resistance. 

Again, as someone who has spent my life fighting to keep my own head above water, so to speak, I have first hand experience with the sense of relief that comes along with getting the right help, and the regret of not doing it sooner. I feel like he is needlessly suffering and I want it to stop. He deserves better. I know that going to a counselor or a doctor isn‚Äôt going to magically cure his anxiety, but I truly believe that he would benefit from CBT and possibly medication and that his quality of life could improve significantly.

These past 2 weeks have been ridiculous.ill start with the good: I was diagnosed with pretty severe depression a couple months ago, I started to feel suicidal so my therapist, doctor, and myself agreed for me to stop taking hormonal birth control. So far, I am feeling better. 

About a week ago, my fianc√© had a grand mal seizure in his sleep. I woke up and found him convulsing and choking on his saliva. I don‚Äôt remember much else, but I remember trying as hard as I could to get him on his side and talking to 911. By the time the paramedics came he had stopped seizing but was going in and out of consciousness. Thinking back and remembering holding his body as it went limp was terrifying. The more I think about it the more I want to cry. He‚Äôs ok now, undergoing tests and seeing a neurologist. 

Since then I have had trouble sleeping, I wake up every hour to check if he is ok. I find myself spacing out at work and having ‚Äúflashbacks‚Äù of his seizure and I feel an overwhelming feeling of anxiety. Then I start to feel extremely guilty because I feel like it is my fault.

When I start to lose it at work, I begin shaking, breathing hard, I'm sensitive to light and sound, and I feel an overwhelming urge to run away. It makes me feel so terrible.

I'm not lazy. I worked at one job for 8 years and another for 3 years. I know I'm capable. The panicked urge to flee doesn't just come from being stressed out. I have tremendously low self-esteem, and every time a job doesn't work out, it gets worse. Not to mention, I feel constantly humiliated all the time, like I'm the most pathetic, hilariously awful person who ever lived. It's so difficult, feeling like this, knowing that I keep disappointing and infuriating the people in my life.

I live with my girlfriend. She has bad anxiety too, but she has still been able to work every day, to support us. I am both incredibly grateful to her and ashamed that I can't seem to be able to work. I just started my newest job, and the first day was so terrible that I don't know what I'm going to do. 

I've been on disability, I've been to therapy, I've tried medication, I've worked with the Department of Rehabilitation. I keep trying, but it just seems to get harder and harder. I don't...know what to do.",12Jun2018,3
58,"I often feel sad, worthless, unhappy etc. Fairly often contemplating suicide. Sounds a lot like depression. I know, because I have been a sufferer in the past. I do however also feel happy at times. Genuine happiness. Mostly when I‚Äôm spending time with my boyfriend, but can also occur while I am singing (a hobby of mine), though mixed with  anxiety when performing in front of people.

At school I am unhappy at most times. I do not have proper friends at school, so I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to. That causes a lot of loneliness, anxiety, as well as fatigue from normal school stress.

To the point. I will be feeling fine, even happy sometimes and then something tiny happens and I will be very down, wanting to die for the rest of the day. A recent example was when me and my boyfriend were at a public swimmingpool. I (as a bisexual) told him ‚Äùlook how beautiful / hot that girl is‚Äù and he agreed. I then asked ‚Äùwould you prefer if I looked like that?‚Äù and he said ‚Äùkinda... yes‚Äù. (Please no comments saying that my boyfriend is a bad bf etc).

Despite being such a small thing, that I brought up, I was sad for more than a day afterwards. I didn‚Äôt want to have sex later that day, and I started crying when we went to sleep etc.
Things like this happen all the time. Some bring me further down than others (this was a worse case), but I almost always react strongly.

Sorry for rant, but I wonder what this could be. Am I just sensitively overreacting?",12Jun2018,1

60,"I'm 22, Male.

I dread every day I go to work, and I believe that it is because I have some deep\-seated fear of failure. I think that I am afraid of that failure because I don't have faith in my abilities on the job, and I know that if I lose it, I'm going to fall further into debt, can't get a place to live, can't get a vehicle, and then I'm either going to end up homeless on the streets of Memphis, or stuck in my childhood/teenhood home where there's hardly any job prospects, hardly anyone my age that I can relate to and have fun experiences with, and I'm just going to continue to be anxious, bored, and lonely.

Lately, I have kind of been trying to have a mentality of embracing chaos. Chaos is usually a scary thing in life, but family chaos is the true chaos I fear. Now when it comes to the chaos of having an unstable life, it's like I can see some beauty in it, and somehow, that thought helps me not be afraid of messing up at my job because if I lose it, so what? That means I can then go someplace else and be free, and it's not like I didn't try my best, I just wasn't good enough and could not adapt. I kind of dislike my job anyways, and the whole idea of doing nothing my whole life but working one job scares me. 

It's not the worst job I could have, but I'm not particularly good at it, though I'm getting better. I just don't believe it makes good use of my true talents, which I've been told is writing, researching, gathering information, giving speeches, typing, singing, and other soft skills. I want to have hard skills too, though. Maybe I just don't need a hard trade job since carpentry or welding as a hobby and carpentry and welding as jobs are two very different things, experience\-wise. I need a job where I am good at it, when it is to provide to society. And leave the hard skills for hobbyist pursuits, which I can't afford or find a place to do them at where I live.

I want to and plan to go back to Colorado. Either for work, or just to travel. That's the only place I've been to and done outdoors work where my sheltered\-ass ever felt at home. It's like there's more people there with different outlooks on life than in my small mid\-south towns. While working there, I was already having to live out of a hostel, and yet I wasn't afraid of the experience because it was like, even after my seasonal job there ended, or if I couldn't afford to stay in a hostel, I could just camp out, and there was hardly any crime in the towns I was staying in during the time. If a crime happened, everyone would know about it and who did it.

Somehow the idea of saving up money to get my own vehicle or a bicycle and travelling to Colorado to work or just for the sake of travelling, going to see new  sounds like the only thing that will make me really content with life. And it's not like I plan to get hooked on drugs and alcohol. I would make sure to take good care of my body, and volunteer wherever I go, too. And do some story writing while travelling.

Right now it feels like I barely have time to type this because I live with my dad and my little sister, and I have to devote plenty of time to both of them during the day because I work from 3:00 PM to midnight, and when I get back, I'm exhausted and they're asleep.

TLDR first;
Masters thesis is not enjoyable and gives me panic attacks when I think about it. I have a good job in the field I studied for and am happy with it. Would quitting and moving on be worse for my mental health or would fighting though the anxiety be better?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Let me start with saying that I have been trying to convince myself for the last couple years that quitting my thesis is the right choice for me, but haven‚Äôt been able to. I‚Äôm looking for advice and if anyone has been in a similar situation.

So I am in a blended bachelors/masters engineering program, with the option to get my bachelors and forego the masters at anytime now. I went into the program because when the time of the end of my bachelors classes was coming up, I was not getting any interviews for jobs and thought the masters would help. I have completed all the classes for both as of 2012 and all within 5 years. The only thing standing in my way is my masters thesis, but I think I was exhausted burned out from school at this point. 

I accepted a job offer my last semester contingent on me getting my masters. I got to a point in my thesis that I realized I needed to enlist the help of an electrical engineering student or teach myself a full new engineering discipline.  On top of that, my support structure of friends was suddenly gone after graduation. I started to panic that I wouldn‚Äôt finish my thesis and that fed into depression and inactivity. I would try to go and do some work on my thesis, but it would feel like I was battering at a wall with my fists.

I ended up having the job offer rescinded because I wasn‚Äôt able to finish my thesis which added to my anxiety and depression. I took a break from working on my thesis after that, and was then diagnosed with anxiety. I stayed in the town my college was located because leaving would feel too much like failure, and ended up gaining a lot of weight. During this time my dad was very supportive (he‚Äôs kind of a tough love guy but would always say he understood what I was going through with anxiety) but my mom made it clear she didn‚Äôt understand why I was having trouble, offering advice like ‚Äújust go to church‚Äù and ‚Äúpraying helps‚Äù. I had stopped believing in Christianity a few years before and I think she knew, so the advice felt flat and not really genuine. I could be wrong on that. I love with my mom and am not mad about this, but at the time it kind of really hurt. 

I ended up getting a job, and met a girl who is now my fianc√© about 6 months after I took a break. Then about a year and a half after taking the break, I interviewed and took a great job offer at a place right in my field of study. Since then, we have 2 dogs, we‚Äôve been able to buy a house, I‚Äôve lost weight, we are engaged and I am happy. 

Sorry for the long story, but needed to explain what got me here. 

My degrees are still in limbo though and every time I think about going back and working on my thesis it‚Äôs like hitting a brick wall with a panic attack. I can go to my college and in a couple days opt out of the masters and take my bachelors degree, but I‚Äôm scared this is admitting failure and I‚Äôm not sure if that would be worse or trying to fight through the anxiety and work on it. I have seen the benefit in the masters classes I have taken, which have directly helped me to become a top performer at my work. Career wise a masters would help, but I think I could always go back and get a masters later (maybe not one with a thesis requirement though) and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth the stress and anxiety. 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking for this subreddit would be if anyone could offer advice or insight into what decision would work better for my mental health. Kind of general but anything is helpful. ",12Jun2018,1
64," Previously, my counselor had recommended me to try out SG Enable to find a job. She printed a piece of paper containing information about SG Enable. I went to SG Enable and found out that I needed a medical report from my psychiatrist before SG Enable could accept me. 

  
  Today, I was here to talk to my psychiatrist about this issue, who was from the Adult Neurodevelopmental Service (ANDS) department of Institute of Mental Health (IMH) Singapore. 

  
  I went to IMH with my mother. I couldn't be independent yet. This was because I didn't have a job yet, and I felt inferior about it. I didn't want people to know that I needed financial help from my mother to pay for my consultation with the psychiatrist. One day, I hoped I would no longer need my mother's financial aid to pay for my consultation with the psychiatrist ‚Äî I hope I could work and use my own savings to help pay for my consultation with the psychiatrist and my future expenses. 

  
  I had successfully tried to shut down my earphones temporarily in IMH ‚Äî I didn't need the continuous loud noise generated by my earphones to feel safe. This was a good sign, as I was no longer that afraid of strangers :) I still needed my dark glasses though to hide my eyes from strangers ‚Äî I needed my dark glasses so that when I peeped at the strangers to see if they were scrutinizing me, they would not notice it. Most of the time, strangers didn't even look at me, so I felt safe wearing my dark glasses when I was outside whereby there would be strangers around. 

  
  I was waiting for my consultation with my psychiatrist. When it was time, I went in to the doctor's consultation room and the psychiatrist politely asked my mother to go out instead of staying together with me during the consultation. 

  
  I was able to see the psychiatrist alone. I was better in communicating with people now. I no longer needed my mother around to remind me about the important things I must tell to my psychiatrist. I could do it myself. That was a good sign :) 

  
  I asked him whether he could wrote a medical report stating that I was fit to go to SG Enable to find a job. This psychiatrist was not the one in charge of my case. It was another psychiatrist who was in charge of my case. I was seeing this psychiatrist instead of my usual psychiatrist because my case manager from IMH knew that I needed an earlier appointment with a psychiatrist. My psychiatrist\-in\-charge could only see me a month from now. Currently, this psychiatrist was able to see me at an earlier date (which was today), but my psychiatrist\-in\-charge was not able to do that. 

  
  After the consultation, I drove my mother home. I was going for cat therapy later. I would be going to a peer's house for cat therapy ‚Äî a peer was someone who had mental illnesses like me joining the same support group organized by my mentor. 

  
  I took off my dark glasses and earphones. Previously, another psychiatrist told me it was not appropriate to wear dark glasses and earphones when I was going to talk to a person. I remembered that advice. 

  
  After taking off my dark glasses and earphones, my fear of people came again. Luckily, only a few people had come for the cat therapy. 

  
  Everything was going well. I could control my thoughts, emotions and my behavior. That was a good sign :) I was not defensive/aggressive during cat therapy. 

  
  I drove to Orchard Road in Singapore after the cat therapy. This was my favorite thing to do whenever I was free. 

  
  I drove home afterwards and took a bath. I needed to eat late night supper before I could sleep. It was my routine. If I did not do this, I would not be able to sleep at all ‚Äî I would have developed some psychological problems if I did not eat late night supper. I still needed my mother to help me take the supper from the delivery man. I didn't want people to know that I needed my mother's financial help. One day, I hoped I would be able to work and I could have the money to pay for my supper, consultation with my psychiatrist in IMH and my own future expenses. 

  
  I would like to say thank you to everyone who had read my blog post. I hoped sincerely that you all would have a nice day ahead. Good bye :) ",12Jun2018,48
65,"About a month and a half ago, my girlfriend dumped me. She had been going through a hard time, her parents separated and her grandfather passed away after a long fight with Alzheimer's. She told me she needed to be alone for some time but that she would come back to me after some time. A month earlier she had been telling me how I was her soulmate and how she believed we would grow old together. Her family as well as mine thought the same thing. When she dumped me she told me we would still be best friends because she didn't want to lose her best friend. So i agreed. We kept talking. But she was distant. She clearly stopped liking it when I spoke to her. So i told her we should stop talking completely. She agreed. I then found out that she had started sleeping around and smoking pot. All things which she once told me she was against. I can't go a day without thinking of her. I wake up multiple times at night having nightmares about her.

68,"Hi all,
I've never really been to a psychiatrist or mental health professional, save a few particularly low points around college exams. Below are some things I experience on a regular basis, and I'm wondering if most of Reddit shares the experiences, or if this is atypical and I could significantly improve my situation.

First background about me: ex smoker, very active, practice yoga and meditation, college grad with a relatively well paying, mostly satosfying, and secure job. I used to experiment with a range of drugs (no meth etc) in my youth but now I just smoke a lot when I'm not working. My job can be very stressful but it can also be very relaxed and sometimes I read a book for 11 hours of a shift. Have a gf of 4.5 years and we get along great, and I feel like we've been through the worst parts of our relationship already. Musical artistic person, skateboarding is a big hobby, and otherwise I feel quite accomplished in life. Black belt karate, CPR trained, etc, basically I feel like i know how to always move forward in life.
My gf is extremely supportive and understanding and we have open discussions regarding our mental health.

Some regular occurrences in my life (any medical sounding jargon is undiagnosed ):

- ""insomnia"", going through 1-3 month cycles where it typically takes me 1-4 hours laying in bed before I sleep. Occasionally unable to sleep even after being awake for 24+ hours, a technique I use to try to reset my rhythm. Then for a while I'll sleep 'fine', I.e. 5-7 hours usually waking a couple times. This goes back to young childhood as well.

- waking myself up from sleep by thinking too hard during dreams/""blank sleep"". Thoughts can vary from work to life to whatever.

- bad habits sneaking into my life. Sometimes after a week or two I notice I have been grinding my teeth during the day almost constantly, very often 'drumming' speed metal with my molars. (**NSFW SPOILER**) Sometimes I get into a habit of jerking off like 5 times a day for a week straight until I can't perform for.my.gf and realize I've got to stop. I'm always drumming and tapping on things. I feel like I've often got 3+ trains of thought going at once l, sometimes I have difficulty controlling which takes precedence. Usually after I catch my bad habits and realize there is some underlying cause of acute sfresa5

- rarely, get a random panic attack where it's difficult to breathe, I get so claustrophobic I immediately strip naked (hasn't occurred in public yet..), takes me maybe 5 mins to recover.

- rare chest tightness lately. I'm a young adult male and I practice cardio more often than I would say 75% of people and I train seriously because I love to eat (90% really healthy). This usually is a dull ache lasting 5-15 minutes, occasionally a sharper pain accompanies. Sometimes it occurs a few days in a row, sometimes 5 minutes in 2 months. In the process of making a physician app't.

- serial binge hedonist. I often struggle with a mentality of ""as much as I can as fast as I can"", when it comes to pleasures such as sex, eating, drugs and alcohol. Lately have been trying, with success, to curb this behaviour.

I'm just not sure if this is all something most people deal with, if this is something I can significantly improve on my own, or if I should really get some outside help.


JUDGE ME REDDIT but mostly please share how any of these experiences relate/don't relate to you.

Thanks dudes ( dudes is all inclusive in my vocab).

I feel lifeless, on a different wave length then everyone else. I'm consumed by shame in everything that I say or do. Like its strange. That's why I always keep to myself.

I have had dealings with my own mental health issues in the past, nothing diagnosed, but looking back I was very unhealthy. Lots of physical self harm, lots of drink and lots of drugs, as often and as much as I could. I never thought I would find someone who loved me for me but here we are, and they make me so happy.

I started to notice things were heading downhill just before christmas. For whatever reason I just started to get really scared of my commute home from work. I normally get the train home and its no problem at all, but I started to find more and more excuses to just jump in a cab instead, even though I knew coulnd't afford it and I ended up in debt becuase of it. One time, when I was actually on the train I just zoned out and missed my stop, ended up getting off 3 stops after mine. I eventually just jumped on a train going back in the right direction but I did it again and got off at the stop after the one I usually go to. This is no big deal, the stop I got off at was not even 10 minutes walk from my house, but I couldn't do it. I've walked that route thousands of times in the past but in the dark I just couldn't do it. I had to jump in a cab for the two minute ride back to where I live.

Recently its been getting harder and harder to even get to work, never mind actually leaving. I feel the urge every day now just to call in sick or even quit full stop.

This brings me to my partner. I only ever feel truly at ease when we are together and when we're not I just fall apart. I can't get out of bed, I can't eat, I can't do anything. I'm like a lovesick teenager and I feel pathetic. I have actually cried myslef to sleep before when they were away seeing family. When we are apart I feel like I need to know where they are and what they are doing at all times and it takes everything I have to fight this urge because I don't want to smother them and end up pushing them away.

I constantly rely on them for validation, any decision I make I feel I have to run by them first, I need to be around them and be told I am loved. If it weren't for them I would not be doing as well as I am at work and to be honest I probably wouldn't be here at all. They are the only thing I actually care about. I know this sounds awful, but it is none of their doing, I can't tell them any of this though becuase it just sounds like ""if you leave me I'll kill myself"" and that just screams crazy and nobody wants that.

I'm just so scared at the moment becuase I can feel myself getting worse. I keep getting these ""unwanted thoughts"", it's like someone is constantly whispering in my ear exaclty what I don't want to hear or think about whenever they happen. I used to have them pretty much 24/7 and now they are happening more and more often and I hate it. I can't switch off. It worries me becuase I don't want to feel how I did before ever again but I can't stop it, no matter how happy I should be.

It seems there is always background noise being made by my mind. The house will be completely silent with no one home but in my head I'll hear things.

81,"I've recently noticed that my mental state is quite fragile. I've began to develop constant hate towards other people, mostly racial or sexuality, sometimes towards normal people. When I was a child, I used to imagine horrible acts of unjustified cruelty towards mostly small animals. It sometimes returns, and I'm worried that it could turn into something worse than just thought. What should I do? ",12Jun2018,1
82,"People often describe depression as lack of motivation, energy and a general feeling of sadness and hopelessness. While these are all valid symptoms and I've been experiencing them for a long time, there is one thing that bothers me the most, but I don't know whether it's linked to depression or it's just my personality.

I don't like anything anymore. I'm not interested in any hobbies anymore. I used to love music, now I couldn't care less about my favorite bands and artists. I used to love games, now I rarely play anything anymore. I used to love drawing, now I dislike it. It feels like every single interest has been plagued and I can't find anything interesting anymore. It literally feels like everything is the same boring and bland and nothing is special or interesting anymore. To put it simply: it feels like that ""spark"" I used to feel towards my favorite things has been extinguished.

Anyone else?",12Jun2018,30
83,So I'm a 19M who just graduated last year. Some background about me. I never had any real friends through most of Middle School and all of High School. I have diagnosed ADD and Mild Social Anxiety plus severe acne. I'm on Adderal for the ADD and I've been on Accutane for the Acne twice but I still break out badly.  After graduating I spent 6 months isolated at home and didn't do much besides play video games and watch TV/movies. I then got a temp job in retail (which I hated) and worked for around 3 months. Now I am back to being unemployed and I hate the idea of working a crappy job again but I also have no interest in any courses offered at College or Uni. My parents are forcing me to apply for post-secondary by September or I'll have to get another dead-end job I hate. What should I do? ,12Jun2018,2
84,"I've come to realise that I'm someone who gets attached easily and feels strong emotions when it comes to relationships. I am male &amp; 17, I have tried researching but most of what I found talked about attachment in girls. I've looked into the attachment theory, and I feel like anxious/ambivalent attachment may apply to me. My dad was not around when I was young, and even since then there has been times when I have lost close friends, although I do have friendships now. I would say I have a form of social anxiety, I am not uncomfortable talking to people but find it hard to discuss feelings sometimes.

I just want to know what steps I should take for this to get better and am seeking help.",12Jun2018,1
85,"First and foremost: I‚Äôm a very ugly girl. Not overweight or anything just very ugly in the face. Been bullied my whole life over my appearance. I also have no close friends. I can‚Äôt connect to people, they think I‚Äôm weird and useless. I dropped out of college as well.

Considering how useless I am and how shitty my life is I don‚Äôt get what the point of existing is anymore? Nothing goes right and everything is just shit",12Jun2018,7
86,"I believe my mother may have some kind of boarder line personality disorder or she‚Äôs manic depressive possibly. I‚Äôm not a clinician, I‚Äôm assuming a few things based on my experiences with some friends who have children who battle with these issues. 

I apologize for the length. I‚Äôm a bit overwhelmed at the moment, so please bare with me. I‚Äôm 37 (M) and Mom is 60. For context, I‚Äôll give a few details of mom‚Äôs life for then I‚Äôll briefly explain what‚Äôs recently happened.

Mom is the youngest of 5 children. Her parents were in their late 40‚Äôs when she was born. Mom was molested by her brother when she was 11 years old. She didn‚Äôt speak of it until she was in her 50‚Äôs. Mom‚Äôs first marriage (to my biological father) was very abusive. Lots of physical violence. Mom remarried 32 years ago and remains married to a man I admire and call Dad. Mom had a drug and alcohol problem prior to remarrying, but managed a measure of sobriety from the mid eighties through the late nineties, before she got addicted to pain medication after a series of surgeries on her knee. She got sober again in 2009 and remains sober using a 12 step program. We have very recently had some inter family drama centered around her relationship with my wife. Mom has had problems with my brothers wife in the past, and they very rarely speak. 

Until Friday of last week, my mom watched my children after school. Notably, she charges us $50 a week to drive .6 miles to the school, pick them up and watch them for 90 min until my wife picks them up.  That is the friction point.  My wife has been complaining for months and months that Mom has been speaking down to her, implying that she is a bad mother and bullying her. I chalked it up to a simple small family rivalry, but in retrospect it was much more. Last Wed I called my mom out on a shitty text she sent my wife, and she asked if that‚Äôs why my wife has been being disrespectful to her.  I explained that if my wife was distant, it was because she felt bullied, and that sent my mother into a rage. She started naming all the times my wife was disrespectful to her and claiming that she would never hurt my wife‚Äôs feelings or make her feel like a bad mom. She demanded that my wife call her on the phone and describe how and why she felt the way she does. I offered for the 4 of us (mom, dad, wife, myself) and talk everything out, and Mom refused b/c she didn‚Äôt want to get ‚Äúganged up on‚Äù.  She tried to use the fact that she provides cheap daycare for us as leverage to make my wife explain herself and apologize.  She absolutely believes that she is the one that is in the right and my wife and I are in the wrong. She says ‚Äúwhat did I do to deserve...‚Äù insert whatever. She my brother and do not care what happens to her. She‚Äôs now telling my father that she wants him to leave her or she will move out on her own. We say one thing, and she hears something totally different. 

She has been exhibiting this type of behavior on and off for the last 15 years, at least. I don‚Äôt hear about episode, because my father deals with them privately, but at least once a year I have to go through her screaming at me telling me that I‚Äôm a bad son. She needs help to manage these swings and my dad is just hanging on like a man in a row boat caught in a storm. I don‚Äôt know how to get her to hear that she needs help. How do I get her to see what impact she‚Äôs having on the rest of the family. She‚Äôs smart and manipulative and she knows that we can‚Äôt force her to do anything. I‚Äôm open to any and all advice. I‚Äôm worried that if she continues to spiral down that she may harm herself. 

What do I do next...",12Jun2018,2
87,Ive been going through a rough break up after 3 years of being together.  I got into the magic the gathering card game while in the relationship. Co workers got me into it and then I transferred to a different city which is my home town. I tried going to a card shop and playing with new people after buying all these new cards and I left. I felt like an outsider doing something that makes me happy. I thought that doing this would get my mind off of my girlfriend dumping me but I just left and have been crying in the parking lot since. Nothing feels right in the world. I feel paralyzed and empty. I feel hopeless and afraid.,12Jun2018,1
88,For the most part I‚Äôm ok. I‚Äôm naturally an empath so people tend to dump all of their problems on me. I welcome it most days but then I have days like today where I don‚Äôt want to be that person because I feel mentally drained. I dont have anybody that I can talk to and it really gets me down. The people that offer to ‚Äúbe there‚Äù for me just don‚Äôt seem sincere I don‚Äôt want to go for counseling or anything like that. Just looking for ideas to overcome it. Any help is appreciated. ,12Jun2018,2
89,"Due to work and stuff I had going on, I started missing on my daily dose until actually running out of pills and not going to get another prescription. I was prescribed with Escitalopram, I haven't noticed any negative side effects of abruptly stopping them. Should I just not take them ever again or consult a doctor and have them prescribed again?

90,"Hey guys, I don't really know what to do or what I'm here for but it feels like as good a place as any to ask for help.

For the last couple years I've been battling a losing battle with depression, anxiety, and minor reality disassociation. It lead me to become a really self destructive person and just an overall destructive person which ruined a lot of my relationships with friends and family. A couple months ago I got sick of being the bad guy and feeling like this so I picked myself up and changed my outlook on life and started seeing a counselor. But it seemed to be too little too late because this was right after I had graduated high school and my huge group of friends shrunk to about 2 people. Around this time I had gotten a new full time job in media which was great and I fell in love with it.. but two weeks after I got the job my parents had a really messy divorce which has torn the last part of stability to shreds. Now I feel weaker than ever.  I feel like I'm a chore to everybody in my life and the people I'm trying to rebuild my relationship with want nothing to do with me. I've lost all my confidence and motivation to fix myself. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to get out of posting this here but I guess I just wanted to hear other peoples take..",12Jun2018,5

92,"So this might sound very funny, but Saturday night (It's Tuesday as I'm typing this) I learned about Sylvia Likens and I felt sick to my stomach. It affected me so bad It's made my behavior change drastically. To be honest, my life in general has no influence on what's been happening to me recently so I won't type about my life. It made me realize how shitty I am to complain about my life, people suffer far worse than me being mad about having my phone taken away. My life is kinda normal except my mom is kinda a bitch but she doesn't physically abuse me. Then I realized how I shouldn't be sad, because I didn't experience it. Yesterday I attempted to steal my friends sister in law's phone, because I miss having my phone. She found it in my bag and it looked like her phone accidentally fell in my bag because the phone was sitting on a chair. I felt so guilty after but I don't want to tell her because it's not a big deal. Later that night I looked in the mirror and wanted to cry and rip my skin off. Today my dad's cat went under my bed (I have a trundle bed and my rooms small and I have blankets and other junk under and its heavy and next to my wall and I was hungry and wanted to just eat so I screamed at the cat to get out and nudged her with the guitar under my bed until she got out. I've never acted this awful and I feel so guilty and it's all because I'm weak and couldn't handle hearing about Slyvia's torture. I understand if none of you want to reply to this because I'm annoying and an awful person lol",12Jun2018,6
