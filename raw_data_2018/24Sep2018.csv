0,"This past year has been odd for me. I lost my mum to cancer at the end of 2017, and I began my first year of Uni at the start of this year. These are obviously two really big changes and big things to deal with.

This year also has been really unexpected in many ways. My university experience hasn't really lived up to my expectations and for the first time in my life I've really struggled with the emotional roller coaster of mental health, and grief too. 

I haven't really felt like myself at multiple points this year. Right now I feel this way too. I feel so inexplicably sad for some reason. When I hang out with friends I just feel so distant, and my smiles or laughs don't really feel genuine. I kind of just want to curl up and do nothing and sleep.

I had a really fun day out at a festival two days ago, but on the bus ride home I just felt so so sad for no reason.  Sometimes I think everything would be okay if my mum was still here, so I don't know if all these feelings are part of grieving too. I don't really know.

I'm very busy at the moment too, balancing two jobs, uni and various other commitments so I may be stressed from all this too. I feel like I just need a break, and some time to just recharge. I feel like I have no energy and I just don't know why I've got this cloud of sadness hovering over me.",24Sep2018,2

3,"I tried playing guitar the other day. I haven't played much in the last 10 years since I was diagnosed as being mentally ill. I don't think I enjoy it. I don't know why I practiced so much at the time. I think it may have just been hypomania. 

I don't think I've ever really enjoyed anything. I get bored of hobbies pretty quickly. All I do is watch anime and read manga. It must by my ADHD (yeah, I've got more than one condition) because I don't even have the patience for anime; I prefer to read manga because I can flip through the pages faster.

What's the point of even living, if I don't enjoy anything? I may as well just stay in my room and never leave. Nothing will ever get better. I'll never be happy of or fulfilled, so what is the point? ",24Sep2018,12
4,"I'm seeing a therapist on Tuesday and I have to fill out some paperwork, part of it says to put a check next to your current concerns. I checked Academic problems, Careee indecision, adjusting to a new environment, feeling sad and depressed, sexuality, and other (RTS). 


I feel like that's way too many problems, like the therapist is going to look at it and say ""Damn, this is going to be tough"" lol

5,"I'm a (female) freshman in college diagnosed with major depression, generalized and social anxiety, and ADHD. Been through the ringer, treatment wise - 5 years of CBT, 3 months of exposure therapy, and hospitalized once as well.  **I also take medication and** **I am attending group therapy through my school's counseling center**.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on campus for a little over a month. I appear pretty high functioning on the outside (I'm going to class, grades are fine at the moment), but my illnesses often make it so much harder for me to do basic things and it sucks, especially because I don't make friends easily and my support system back home were mainly the people keeping me in check. Now I have to be entirely responsible for myself, and it's just. So. Hard. I understand it's a part of growing up, but still. I feel so isolated and alone and I don't want to ask for help and seem like a burden.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, today I had one of those days where depression makes every little thing hard. I got out of bed at 1pm, ate nothing but a small snack, and didn't even leave my dorm. I want to change my major but I'm too scared to even start the process because my social anxiety tells me I'll be bothering people and I'll draw attention to myself, etc. Just things like that.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I make this easier to deal with, outside of going to counseling and taking my meds? Who can I go to when I have basically no one on campus who understands?",24Sep2018,2
6,"Back in October of last year, I went to thanksgiving dinner at a friend of my dad's house which was 30 minutes away. I did not want to go because I had already felt anxiety before but the only reason I went was to make my dad happy. I do this a lot. I do things to make others happy and disregard my feelings. Now, when I was there I had a full blown panic attack that triggered a memory from when I was first diagnosed with panic disorder (age 12) where I was at a family gathering and panicking but my mother was yelling at me to calm down and stop worrying. She kept me trapped there around all those people. I remember going to the hospital a few times that year due to these panic attacks. And I went to the hospital again in October of last year for the panic attacks because I thought I was dying and seeing the hospital again reminded me of the times I went as a kid. I remember wanting to jump out of my skin. I forgot about this but when the recent panic attack last year happened all those feelings came rushing back. I felt trapped. I felt I couldn't ask for a ride home because my dad would yell at me like my mom did when in reality he wouldn't. He would have drove me home if I asked. After that I had a nervous breakdown and it felt like all these panic attacks and feelings that I had as a kid came back and I was reliving it all. I developed full blown agoraphobia (I only had it panic related) and my anxiety is a everyday thing now. Last night we had a whole bunch of people over for my dad's birthday. I hid in my room. I felt what I felt on Thanksgiving again and it didn't help that some of the people from thanksgiving were here again. I started panicking like I was trapped (I was in my own house) and I was dry heaving (which I did as a kid when my anxiety got bad) and everything around me felt like it did that night. It felt like somebody had transported me back to that day and I was reliving it all over again. It literally felt like a PTSD episode. I can't sleep without waking up in a panic, I can't eat. It feels like i'm reliving it again and I can't feel like that. Is there something called panic related PTSD? Is that a thing? I literally don't know how to put this into words and this was the best I could do. I would really appreciate some insight as i'm so confused. And anxious as hell. Thanks.",24Sep2018,2
7,"I have a mental health condition that requires an aggressive treatment plan (weekly individual therapy plus weekly group therapy and medications).  I have insurance through my job but the copays are still too costly for me to keep up.  If I went as often as my doctor wants me to (which I don’t because of money) I would be spending almost half of my income on copays for therapy.

I am not eligible for Medicaid.  I looked at my county’s Department of Health and Human Services and they offer a couple of crisis counseling sessions at no charge, but beyond that they have no help.  I have a 4 year university in my city and I looked to see if they had any type of programs with students that are training to be therapists, but they didn’t have anything for mental health therapists.

I volunteered at my daughters Girl Scouts, completed a camping training online, volunteered to be co-leader if the other person doesn’t work out - which she probably won’t, she’s moving and she has yet to come to a meeting this school year. Something I had decided a few weeks ago I wasn’t going to do because I don’t usually have the energy. I’ve had more energy than usual. I worked on my quilt software on my laptop that I rarely get out. I didn’t worry as much. Twice, I got so wound up about something at work that I overreacted and got carried away and was rude to other people without realizing it. The second time, it was a good friend who apparently isn’t speaking to me now. In a way, it reminded me of things that had happened before I started taking medication, just less severe (those ended with yelling, crying, and anxiety).  ... so my question is, was this just a non-depressive week?

11,"I often can spend hours and hours trying to leave the house. But I just can't stand people looking at me and judging how I look. I experience extreme rage and humiliation. I feel like everyone is looking at me. 

I look about 20 years older than I am. Which would be fine if I was that age. I don't know how to dress. Should I dress my age or the age that I look. I don't want to look old dressed up as a young person. 

Also not only that, I just find my facial features don't fit on my face properly they don't seem to go together. And I look fairly ambiguous as to what my gender is. Sometimes I can see myself as kind of normal (ish). But I still feel people looking at me on those days. So it's not me just being paranoid, or maybe it is...

Some days I can override it. But other days it brings suicidal thoughts very much so to forefront. 

I just feel like I'm not meant to be a part of this society. I feel happy in nature. Genuinely. Being around normal people makes me want to die. ",24Sep2018,3
12,"Hello all,

Just wanna firstly say thanks to everyone who posts here. It’s nice to see other sharing their stories and struggles so openly. There’s always been a stigma surrounding mental health, so kudos to breaking down those barriers.

Anyways, I’m just wanting a safe place to come rant about some of my recent struggles with my mental health, and get some insight and feedback from others who can relate. 

I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Just for some background info, I was sexually abused as a child growing up, and was raised in an environment with drug addicted parents, so there’s where a lot of my PTSD stems from now.

Cue to now..I’ve been seeing a therapist for the past year, and on medication for the last year or so as well. I’ve been taking citalipram 10mg. It was wonderful for a while..really seemed to help stabilize my moods, keep the anxiety at bay, and ease the depression.

A couple months after I started the meds, my older sister passed away suddenly and tragically. I had to move home to be with family, and was the main one responsible for putting her memorial service together. Due to the high stress of all that, I increased my citalipram to 20mg. I stayed at this dose for 1.5 months, but had to go back down to 10mg, as the effects of upping the dosage were very all over the place for me. 

Over the past year, I’ve upped the dose to 20mg again twice when I was feeling overwhelmed with life and grief, but the same reaction happens each time; the first few weeks feel great, and then BAM! I’m hit with anxiety unlike anything I’ve had before, I get extremely bipolar to the point of going off on my boyfriend and coworkers; creating fights that just aren’t needed at all basically. I become this awful version of myself. 

I just decreased my dose back to 10mg again, and vow to never up my dose on citalipram ever again. However, I do feel it’s best for me to be on medication still. The problem lies in finding the right one for me. Citalipram is the first and only one I’ve ever tried, and had great success for a while on the 10mg, but obviously that’s not working anymore, and anything higher is too much.

All this to say, I have an appointment with my doctor soon on changing meds. I’m very cautious when it comes to meds, and not just taking anything a doc prescribes. I like to do my research, and know as much about something as I possibly can. Do any of you have suggestions for medication? I’m definitely not taking Prozac nor Zoloft. I know that for certain.

13,"So, this started when I was 5 (I think), I used to wake up, and if I focused on and object for too long, it would slowly move and slowly get faster. My parents would freak out, walking in on me crying. I tried to explain it to them every time, but they just thought it was a nightmare.

I don’t get these anymore, but now I’m scared/get anxious over absolute silence or anything that can me considered loud. I also get scared/ get anxious if something starts off slow/fast and slowly gets faster/slower. I also get this with noises too. For example, if someone is playing hide and go seek and counts each number louder than the last, I get really anxious and scared. 

I’m currently in 6 grade and have trouble opening up so, it’s hard for me to tell others though, it really is a problem for me.

Does anyone else struggle with this problem? Is this a mental illness or anything similar? I don’t think anyone I know has this and it doesn’t run in my family. Is there any way I can like help myself calm down in a situation similar to what iv’e mentioned? I haven’t found a way so far.",24Sep2018,2
14,"Over the last few years I've developed this kind of weird 'tick.' i'll be driving, or cooking, or doing anything really. and a thought will cross my mind. Sometimes the thought it just a 'what if' scenario, but more often than not it's a memory of some random small event in my life or phrase someone's said. 

When it happens, I feel my muscles twitch and I spasm a bit. More often than not it's accompanied by my utterance of ""Fuck off/you/it"" or something similar. Example: I was driving home last night and I remembered a joke my friend made about my student loans. I thought nothing of it at the time but when it crossed my mind I spasmed and went ""fuck you, fuck!"" but I wasn't actually bothered by it. Is this tourettes or something?

16,"I had this ‘dream’ years ago and im still trying to understand what really happened. Its really hard for me to describe what happened. 

At that point of time, I was trying to prevent myself from harming myself. Ive never cut or anything because I don’t have the courage to see blood coming out in real life. I was preventing myself from having bruises on my knuckles and head. I was trying to tame my mind and get it to calm down before I harm myself. Around that time, I think i had some problems but I didn’t harm myself. One night, I was getting ready to sleep. I was drifting off but I wasn’t sleeping yet. Then this image of myself sitting on the toilet floor with my knees to my chest and there was a knife on my right hand. I saw myself from the back and then the view got closer and then I was inside myself. That was when I saw the knife. Then with the knife, I sliced my calf, from the knee ALL THE WAY DOWN to my feet. There was blood but it wasn’t too much. This scene, the one where I cut my leg repeated three times. I can feel myself physically in the real world, I was panicking like mad, telling my head to just stop it, stop harming myself and snap out of whatever my head was projected, telling my head to stop thinking about all that. I REMEMBER CLEARLY telling myself that. My heart was literally racing. I forced myself out of that dream and woke up with my heart still racing. I had to convince myself it wasn’t real. It was a few seconds but it felt so real. I saw myself. It feels like im doing it to myself. 

Can someone help me to understand what happened that day? Was it my sub-conscious trying to curb its cravings by doing it in a dream instead of real life? I didn’t even feel like self-harming for months before that dream.   Or was I trying to teach myself a lesson and giving myself a sort of trauma? I don’t know if I conjure up that vision or dream because I can actually tell myself to stop. I never ever had a dream where I harmed myself or anywhere near that real. ",24Sep2018,2

""For some, this seeming normality continues until a particular stressor or life event precipitates a sudden and debilitating breakdown""

"" nights are chaotic and disturbed. Some people are so traumatised and have had so little appropriate treatment that they are long-term, ‘revolving-door’ patients""

oh shit...

"" they may be conscious of themselves acting and talking in a manner different to normal. ""

this happens to me a lot

"" may just have a sense of losing time or incoherence about who they are and what they have been doing. ""

22,"I'm fat, unathletic, and know nothing. My friends are all natural athletes and look great, both the guys and the girls. Especially my best friend. He never works out and has a similar lifestyle to mine (albeit he does eat a bit healthier) and yet he literally has a 6 pack. I am so jealous of that because I hate exercise (I don't get that euphoric feeling you're supposed to get no matter what I do) and have zero strength while he is very strong already. If he were to work out he would be huge in no time while I can't lift the bar. 

And then on the other side I feel so stupid and unaccomplished compared to him. He speaks 2 languages, plays 5 instruments, was school president in high school and is now set up to be university president in the next year or so, is an eagle scout, and knows everything. Every time I get excited and try to share stuff with him he already knows all about it and has known for years. Doesn't help that he has a photographic memory and literally remembers everything. He knows every subject from math to history to science to politics to the most obscure things you could think of. On top of that he is so wholesome and humble. You would think being that perfect would make someone a douchebag but no, he has no hangups and will talk to anyone and is super, super social. He worked in a factory and feeds the homeless every week after church. He literally has no flaws. I sometimes tell him this and he tries to console me by telling me to focus on what I'm good at and saying that there are people better than him in hyper-specific things. But the thing is that the things that are my specialties, the things I am best at, he is still better than me at them. It drives me crazy. 

Don't get me wrong, I love the guy. But sometimes it kills me a little inside because I can't stop comparing myself to him. As good as I am at something he will always be better.

I’m not just forgetful but I also get depressed really often, especially in the wintertime. This makes it really hard for me to do normal things like brush my teeth or take my meds. If I even remember about it, I probably won’t even have the motivation to do it.

If I just needed a habit tracker this would be easy, but I need an app that will motivate me every step. (Do you know FitBit? Their app sometimes praises you for logging sleep in for a few days in a row and that motivates me to remember to log, I want an app that does the same thing with all my habits) I need an app to not only remind me to take care of myself but also is kind enough to me that I won’t ignore it :)

my parents (my mom more specifically) won't let me transfer to a school unless its got ""good learning disability support""

RPI: same

32,"As much as I do not want to type up my entire life story here in order to get the answers I need I think I will have to.
{Just inserting here that I am 19 and female as I forgot to mention}

First I must say, I am done with doctors in regards to my mental illness. None of the doctors I have had have ever agreed on anything and I have had many, many different diagnoses. 

I started showing issues around the end of kindergarten to the start of grade 1. I was diagnosed around the time I was in the first grade with ADD and not long after diagnosed with ADHD. I was then put on medication. Things went on a downward spiral from there.
I was bullied by everyone at my first school from grade 1 to grade 3. I did have one friend however although we lost touch when I moved.

There were many less serious in comparison issues in those years. The more concerning issues happened after the move.

We moved to a new house across town when I was 9. I was just starting grade five. I will summarize what happened there quickly as I do not wish for this to take too long before I get to the point. Basically I had no friends, because I was and still do have great difficulty socializing with others. The only student who paid attention to me was a boy who both physically and verbally bullied me. The teachers did nothing because I was at the time a compulsive liar. I also started becoming increasingly violent. The worst it came to was me throwing a chair at the principle.
I only spent a year at that school because of my violent outbursts before being expelled. I spent a month at the  psych ward of a lovely and very well run children's hospital.
While I was there I was diagnosed with Childhood Bipolar Disorder.
I am sure that up to this point I had my medication tinkered with and changed many times. Since I was young I do not remember the specifics of that.

I then spent some time after that at some type of rehabilitation school for troubled kids. It was a bad experiance over all and I was phased out having failed their program. The most notable thing about that time is that that is when my homicidal thoughts really started coming to a head.

I forgot to say earlier in regards to homicidal thoughts that I first started having them when I was nine. That was when I first had a really good understanding of what it meant to kill somebody. I became obsessed with trying to figure out the perfect way to do it. As a nine year old I would pull my chair as close to the tv as I could and watch gruesome forensics shows that showed real mutilated corpses. And I felt nothing. It frightened me a bit at first. That something like that may happen to me someday. But the thought of it happened to somebody else meant nothing to me. I simply could not empathize with them. And when I realized a picture could not hurt me I would just sit and stare. I was not grossed out or repulsed. Just fascinated.

There was a second stay at the children's hospital after phasing out of the rehabilitation program. I was diagnosed as being somewhere on the autism spectrum. That was later on specified as being Asperger's.

When I was twelve my parents sent me to live somewhere else because I became too much for them to handle. They were and still are wonderful people who treat me well and did there best. None of this is their fault.

It upset me at first but I was glad I did because I had been planning on killing them and my brothers. Also on that note while I was at my second school I snuck a serrated knife with me planning to kill a few specific people that were on the bus. I forget why I did not end up using it.

Not much notable happened in highschool. I was living with a different family while visiting mine on the weekends. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder.

I do not wish to speak of the new family I lived with as the situation became very abusive and toxic over time. I just got out of there and it is all to fresh. They drove me to the point of trying to light myself on fire along with there house. I have ample reason to blame this on them. The situation was so fucked up and it makes me cry just typing this. I am not the type to joke about suicide nor threaten it to try to manipulate people. I told the person I was living with that the way they were treating me made me hate myself and made me want to die. They used to tell me that I would be a complete failure in life, that I would always be fat, never be able to live on my own, drive or get a job. They said I would never be a real artist even though I already was. They treated me like complete scum nonstop and it only got worse as time progressed. At the start things were okay there. I do not know why it changed. 
I used to have thoughts about tying them up and torturing them until the were crying and apologizing for the pain they caused me. I thouhght that perhaps if I could show them pain they would understand the terrible way they made me feel since words did not work.

I am 19 now. Since last October I have had five stays in three different hospital psych wards. I am living on my own now in an apartment and am receiving money to help me live.

I am currently diagnosed with Autism, Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and an Anxiety Disorder.

I think I am broken, perhaps a sociopath.

I have never been able to feel sympathy or empathy towards people. I can somewhat empathize with young kids but I still find it harder to do so than I can with animals. Animals are the only living beings that I truly love and can empathize with. I can't empathize with kids because I know they will grow up to be adults and I will most likely hate them.

I am a kind person who has learned to not hurt others but I do not consider myself to be a good person. You can present yourself as being kind and nice without being good.

I have a very difficult time caring about the needs of people other than myself. I don't know why it just is. I can do terrible things without feeling remorse. I do however feel paranoia about what the consequences may be if I am caught so I have learned not to do stuff like that. I have never been one to steal.
As a young child I had sadistic tendencies that I recognize now that my parents did not realize.

I spend most of my time hidden in my apartment. I am far from being an introvert. If I am in public I have no problem interacting with others if I think doing so is of benefit to me. I have no close friends in real life. This fact does not bother me  nor does it make me feel lonely. I feel no desire to have friends or be in a relationship. If I wanted to I could I just don't. I am close with my parents and brothers and if I am socializing or outside of my house when it is not necessary I am usually with them. I simply do not like being social. 

What is troubling me the most is my complete lack of a conscience. Having no remorse sympathy or regret. I tried religion. That did not help me develop a conscience. I know right from wrong and I abide by the law. I just feel like there is something wrong with me because I do not feel some very vital things that others do. People around me have died in my life and I have always felt nothing for them. I was depressed for weeks when my dog died however.

I am going to end this here as this is already too long. Do any of you know what is wrong with me?

I am willing to answer any and all questions that are asked.",24Sep2018,2
33,"I live with my mental health issues on my sleeve. Over the course of the last couple years, I’ve had a few rough patches that tested my marriage. My husband has been really supportive of me, but he has his own mental health obstacles, and has a much less positive experience with resources than I have had (which, mind you, hasn’t been that great either, but I’m utilizing the resources at my disposal).

He’s also been struggling, but in the background. He doesn’t tell me as openly or as readily that he is faltering. He has been as low lately as he was immediately following the end of his previous relationship. 

I’m scared for him. I’m scared that I can’t do anything for him.

Our mental health resources are so inadequate. He had very negative experiences as a young adult, which color his receptiveness to therapy and talking about prescriptions. 

How do you find the strength to be strong for someone else as well as for yourself when you’re both falling apart?

34,"I am watching myself slowly become more and more depressed. I’ve started sleeping 12 hours a day or more, withdrawing from activities and hobbies I’ve loved, and noticing that I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable leaving my house unless absolutely necessary. I’ve been self medicating, which I know is making it worse, but I can’t seem to stop myself because I continue to justify these behaviors as ways to make myself feel better.

I don’t want to lump my notions of depression on how I was raised, as admittedly being someone who deals with depression, my views on depression are ass ignorant. All the time, I try to tell myself about how people have it worse than I do around the world. In all honesty, the components of my life really aren’t bad. I have a loving fiancée, an amazing four year old boy, a halfway decent job, and I just recently bought a brand new car for the first time in my life.

I know I am not the things I own, work for, or whatever. I’m constantly beating myself up over the fact that my life could be a lot worse, and that I shouldn’t feel the way I do, because other people have been cut substantially worse cards than I have. I know that’s ignorant, and seems that I am writing off my own feelings as just being sad.

My motivation to do anything is at an all time low. I’ve just withdrawn from college because I cannot convince myself to do work, or see the benefit of so doing for the bigger picture.

I was on SSRI therapy for a year in addition to talk therapy, which helped a lot. I have every intention of returning to talk therapy, but I am apprehensive about using SSRI’s again after going through withdrawals after having to discontinue them due to a lack of insurance.

I find myself more and more just wanting to be “normal” and able to deal with my feelings. I’ve basically deemed ever achieving this status as impossible, which adds to this deep feeling of hopelessness.

Like any human, I find comfort in being able to relate to other humans. Does anyone out there have any advice as to how give myself the proverbial shot in the arm? I would really appreciate the feedback and insight of someone who has been in a similar situation. I know I should talk to my therapist about this, but she isn’t around this late at night, and I haven’t seen her in quite a few months.

I really appreciate your help, and any of you out there who indulged me enough to read this for not thinking I’m just being a pussy who can’t deal with the fact that being sad is a part of life

Thank you.",24Sep2018,3

From time to time especially after caffeine consumption or when I’m overtired I get this horrible feeling where my body and mind feel like I’m shrinking in a giant room or cave in an extremely vulnerable state. It’s almost like I can feel a loss of pressure around my body as an out-of-body experience begins and a rollercoaster that I’m on has started to descend. Can anyone please help explain this as there are nights it keeps me up for hours on end where as when I was younger it would go away once I stood up or blinked.

39,"So i'm a mid 20's guy working in a high stress 80 hours a week industry, and in the past few years i've had this thing happen where i've started to lose track of if conversations happened, or worse thinking conversations happened that just flat out did not.  I've woken up at times not sure if I was still asleep and had that continue for hours on end, and my coworkers have told me I have some off mannerism's on a regular basis.  On paper, i've though all this was just super normal people things you laugh off and say ""people are weird, am i right?"" But things have been getting sort of progressively worse accompanied by pretty severe bouts of manic depression.  Where i'll walk away for a coffee break and break down in tears and not exactly know why.  I thought it was just stress, but my other coworkers i've talked about this with have suggested maybe it's not.  I tend to get the worse assignments at work, and always chocked it up to, ""Oh i've got it worse than everyone,"" but i'm starting to wonder if that's true or if I'm just having something underlying fired up by what others are dealing with in health ways.... And there's a two way firestorm of depression on one side of the family, and Alzheimer's and Schizophrenia on another side....  So I'm unsure if there's something wrong or if this is just part of a high stress world as a mid 20's, and if I sought medical help, where should I start?  I made a big life move a couple years ago so I don't really have a general practitioner like I used to, so should I find one to consult, or just go straight to a psychologist?

40,"I decided to try BetterHelp after hitting an exceptionally awful low. I discussed it with my husband beforehand and he agreed I should do it. The first night I was talking to my therapist and my husband asked what we talked about. I told him and he said “Have you tried to figure out how to leave the house?” I told him no because that wasn’t my immediate issue - I was really depressed and having dissociative episodes. His response was “then why even do therapy?” I immediately unsubscribed from BetterHelp, but they let you use the entire month because you’ve already paid for it. 

My therapist and I talk throughout the entire day. He told me he wanted to start working on a particular issue. I typed up a pretty long and emotional response. It was basically explaining how many times I’ve reached out for help and been ignored or failed by the system. I said I understand why people choose suicide and how ironic it is that people always say “if only they’d reached out for help.” I have. For years. I’ve been on waiting list after waiting list to see a psychiatrist. Still haven’t seen one. Tried to go to a mental hospital only to have my husband tell me we can’t afford it. I could go on, but it’s a lengthy and uninteresting series of events. Anyway, I had this entire message typed and when I hit send I got a pop up telling me that I couldn’t send the message because my month was up. I’d have to pay $200 to send it and resubscribe. I literally couldn’t tell my therapist that I’m sick of trying to get help and being turned away. 

I had to laugh. It was just too perfect. The timing was so horribly incredible. I swear I should start a blog about the shit I deal with. 

I can’t leave my house alone. I haven’t been able to hold a job...ever. I had to drop out of college, even though I was labeled “gifted” since 1st grade. I’ve been hearing voices and dissociating for years. I see things that aren’t there. I bring no money to my marriage and deal with crushing guilt and feelings of worthlessness because of it. One failed suicide attempt. The list goes on. I just want help. I feel like I’m trapped. ",24Sep2018,2

43,"Hey guys. 23 year old male here. I seem to exhibit signs of many personality disorders but have never been formally diagnosed. I want to list some of my habits that I find to be unhealthy and damaging so that you guys can give some feedback. 

I spend an irrational amount of time thinking about rearranging furniture in my apartment, often moving the chairs and tables around and then observing how it looks from every angle. This impulse strikes at random, some weeks I won't think about it at all others I will obsess on it daily. To me this seems to be a bit of an OCD trait? Sometimes I will even drive to stores and search online for furniture that would look better in my apartment, I try to suppress these thoughts as they take up a lot of time and are not productive. 

My obsessive traits go beyond that though, I tend to get obsessive when I have feelings for a girl. I will over analyze text messages, stalk social media, and lay awake at night over analyzing conversations and interactions. 

On that same note, I have horrible sleep problems, often times I stay up into the AM even when I work in the morning. When I lay awake I will often look at porn and masturbate. Sometimes I will message prostitutes or get on sex forums and message girls. I never go through with any of these sexual acts though, just fantasize. I feel my actual sex life is impacted negatively from these habits. I've only had 1 night stands, and I fail to perform in bed during these occasions. 

These sexual routines before bed I normally do because otherwise I will just lay awake and have my mind wander for hours. Usually anxious thoughts. 

I have a pretty bad nail biting habit, finger nails and toe nails. Sometimes I even bite my finger nails in social settings where it could be seen as off putting. This nail biting habit to me seems to be a bit of an oral fixation, a similar issue I have is scrolling mindlessly through my phone. I will pick up my phone and scroll through social media or text messages without even paying attention to what is on the screen. 

I also have irrational anger issues. I am good at concealing these bouts of anger from friends but I often punch the wall until my knuckles are sore. I've broke several cell phones from throwing and slamming them. I've broke mirrors, dented bathroom stalls, damaged paper towel dispensers, etc. I always have a tendency to be slightly destructive with my anger, breaking something subdues it slightly. 

I have frequent thoughts of suicide (no intention of acting on it, mostly how it would effect others and interactions at my funeral), in a similar vein I have frequent thoughts of uprooting my life and running off to a new city. New York and LA are the 2 I think of most often. These thoughts of running away impulsively also effect my work, in previous jobs I have walked out in the middle of a shift, and most recently I quit a job last week without having a new job lined up. This was a reckless and financially irresponsible decision. 

I have a very hard time concentrating, I was tested for ADD and ADHD when I was very young and the doctors say I didn't have it, but I have always had a hard time studying, reading, or doing the same activity for long periods of time. I feel my attention issues greatly effected my performance in school. 

Do any of these habits go together and show signs of any known disorders? I'm sure there is plenty I've forgotten to list but these habits are debilitating and negatively effect my life and I want help. Thanks guys!",24Sep2018,3

45,"I don't know how to talk about this or what to say so I guess I'll start with the diagnosis. What we know I have is a form of autism, aspergers, and something called Organic Brain Syndrome which has been recently renamed to Neruocoginitive Disorder. I'm sure I have much more but who knows. My biggest problem being memory.  


So I think it's maybe started 3 years ago when I moved to my home town. It's a small town outside of a couple larger ones. The largest, capital city, is where I plan to return to later within a year but for now I'm here. Back at the large town I moved from, I ate healthier and was active. I could ride my bicycle 100 miles in a single day. There was a bike group I attended which did causal rides and later at night, we'd split off and do long fast rides. Now though, I can barely ride across this 3 mile town. At 6'5"" I'm 150lbs normally. I am skinny and I can't take care of myself on the best of days. My cats are the healthiest things in this apartment. I never could sleep, I never eat, and things are just bad.  
About 3 months ago, things just plummeted. I help out at the teen center and while it's keeping me busy, I think I'm over doing it. I don't remember the last time I slept normally but after helping there I've been angrier. Hitting my elbow on something forces me into a fit of rage that leads to me slamming my hand into a wall, if only to force the pain to stop me. I don't eat anything. Half of it is because I never took care of myself so my teeth are in pain whenever they have pressure applied (those are scheduled to be removed and replaced with dentures). But the main reason is I just don't care to or have the energy to. I sit at home and watch the internet for hours. I feel myself growing tired and unfeeling.   


Even writing this post, while my head is filled with things that I want to say, I just can't anymore. I have no clue what the point to writing this is so I will most likely stop in a moment. I just feel as if I'm decaying. That if I took a nap on the grass I'd never wake up. But that could never happen because it feels as if my skull is filled with three brains and the only thing that'd relieve the pressure is if it all just came flying out of my head. ",24Sep2018,2
46,"I've found lately that I've been very jealous of other people's social lives. Lately I've noticed this especially with my boyfriend. We've been together almost a year now and he's 3 years older than me. 
I used to be considered the social one in the relationship. During the summer I'd be out with friends constantly. But now that schools started I barely see anyone. My semester is starting late so I've had a good month with everyone being too busy to hang out. I see him a lot less too for the same reason. 
But he still gets to see his friends all the time. Their a tight group and play dnd religiously. I join them on Fridays but he plays dnd 4 times a week, so that's 3 without me.
This includes Saturday's, which I've hinted strongly at wanting to join. And I get it he needs some time with his friends but he's with them all the time! Some Saturdays he'll go out with a different friend, he tell me he doesn't drink when they hang out. 
But he just told me today that when he doesn't hang out with this friend Saturdays he's been going out for happy hour with his dnd friend. 
Saturdays already stressed me out because I always felt the need to be around people when I knew he was being social. But now that I know he's out drinking too it's gonna be mega stressful, especially since I know I won't be invited along. 
His coworkers are all big partiers. He's assured me he doesn't party anymore but I always worry one day that his coworkers will convince him to go out. 
I've always had issues with extreme lonliness. I was on Better Help for a long time but myself and my counsellor decided I was okie now. I'd be so embarrassed going back since I told my friends how proud of myself I was for being okay now. But I'm not.
I want to be strong, and I am handling this better now than I would have even like 2 months ago. 
I think I need to talk to him about it, to have him confirm that I'm overthinking it. But it's something I need to talk to him about in person and that's going to be a while. 
Not to mention, and I say this with love, but he's not the best at talking about stuff like this. He always tries to change the subject before I can fully vent.

47,"I'm currently in my second year of law school in the US.  I've got so much shit to do.  I'm taking a full-time class load, working 15 hours/week at my clerkship, working as an editor on a journal (~15 hours/week commitment), and heavily involved in student government (5-15 hours/week commitment).  I'm exhausted all the time.  But then I go to bed and can't sleep because I'm too stressed.  On top of this, I was diagnosed last year with a genetic disorder that causes me significant, daily pain (which will only get worse as I age) and prevents me from doing anything physical without severe pain.

In the last two months, I've felt myself slipping.  I started thinking about hurting myself.  It's all I could think about for a couple weeks.  I fantasized about it.

But I feel like I'm cursed to always have bad luck. I think i legitimately am, like its the only explanation. It always seems like nothing goes my way or when something does something crappy always happens after or it lasts a short period of time. 

I feel so lonely because I have almost no one. My mom's not the type to talk about this stuff, I  can't see a therapist and, honestly, I don't really have any close friends so I have no peers that close to talk to about this stuff and I don't want to seem like some whiney loser or bother and annoy them.

And whenever I'm stressed or angry or sad I have this really bad habit of picking my skin. I tried so hard to stop it but lately it started up again.  I've been picking my lips until they feel rugged and they bleed and have sores. Like it feels bad but it feels satisfying?

And just can't take all the stress with medical issues and not having any friends to talk to on top of others things I have to deal with as a young adult. The past year to cope with being lonely I've been impulse buying. The things I buy make me feel happy and excited for a short period of time. But then it kinda fades away and then I buy another thing, then another thing. I bought 100+ dolls in a year. I've spent almost  $1000 on things that I rarely use that I just wanted to make me feel excited about something.

And to feel motivated to do work sometimes or to feel relaxed I take pain medication. I actually do need this medication for pain but I've been sneaking some from where my mother put them and I take them when I feel stressed about life or work. I just can't feel relaxed or care free. It just makes me feel relaxed, and motivated and creative and ready to do work.

I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe I truly have bad luck maybe I've been making bad choices.

52,"Hello everyone, idk where else to ask. Please if you have any experience with this, share it, if you're willing to.

Let me introduce myself - I suffer from BPD and OCD. I'm very anxious and constantly have dp/dr. I have been taking sertraline for years and lamotrigine for months. They do help. I have a good psychiatrist and attend therapy.
My brain is extremely quick to make seemingly random associations and I do tend to see things IRL that are not entirely there because if it. For example I see a glance of a paper bag in the bushes and for a split second I think it's a cat. A simple shadow or tree can turn into a dangerous person for a second before I look again. Sometimes it's enough for me to react - for example: there's a leaf on the ground and I think it's a slug (I think they're super cute) and I'm midway me literally saying out loud ""awwww"" when I realize it's a leaf.

Today I woke up very early because of one event which has multiple parts. I took my meds and I realized I don't have enough time to get ready so I decided to skip the first part of the event and went back to sleep. Set my alarm for about 1hr later. I think during this nap I had the first hallucination. In the dream I walked out of my old apartment and there she was - one very famous actress I'd rather not name. The dream was very vivid, almost lucid-like, I KNEW she's not real. Like she doesn't belong to the reality of my dream but is put there by my sick mind to mock me and taunt me. I yelled at her, she started mimicking me, I threw stuff at her, she did too at myself. I kept thinking that if neighbours see me or hear me they'll know I'm insane because I know what I'm seeing is not there. 

Then I woke up, I think. I don't know when the dream occurred because what I do is that I snooze my alarms a ton and then fall asleep immediately. Anyway I postponed my alarm again. And it continued. I felt better in the second dream and I was still in my old apartment. I told to myself ""hah she's definitely not there anymore, I'm feeling much less stressed and more stable"" I peeked at the staircase where she came from last time and I felt a huge relief because she wasn't there but A SECOND later she showed up like 'wassup I'm not gone"". I got angry again. I cornered her and started poking her stomach, I was SURE my hand is gonna go through as if she was a ghost. I was convinced I'm just seeing things, but she felt extremely real. You guessed it, my hands didn't go through. She probably felt MORE real than my derealized daily life. I thought to myself that I'm fucked. That if someone sees me they'll know how insane I am. And then I finally woke up. I'm not sure if I knew the dream was a dream but as I've said it was extremely vivid.

I tried googling things and I found out about hallucinations that occur on the edge of waking up and falling asleep. During morning I woke up and then fell asleep at least 7 times. But I don't know if this is the case.

I'm scared I'm developing schizophrenia. Please help. Of course I will talk to my psychiatrist about it but my appointment is in weeks, I'll ask my therapist too this week but I'm scared as fuck and I feel like I need answers now.

I want to do this and get better but I find getting the motivation to do so is really draining me. ",24Sep2018,3
55,"For example I finally put some black tape over my webcam because I get it in my head that somebody could be watching and the fear of it persisted so I covered it. I get the feeling people are staring at my on the bus or when I'm walking. Like I hate walking down a road when the cars are facing me because I'm aware people are probably looking at me as they pass. I hate sitting in front of someone on the bus (or them sitting behind) and if they do then I don't like to turn my phone on in fear they're looking over my shoulder at it. Or I have my headphones on incredibly low because I don't want people to hear my music. Even in my house I don't watch anything on my own unless I have earphones in, like if I'm in my room watching a tv show on my laptop, I can't just watch it without earphones, I don't like people hearing what I'm watching even though it's just a normal show, it's like I'm embarrassed for no reason whatsoever.

They're just small things I know, and I should add I have Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia/Anxiety and Clinical Depression. Is it part of that? It's getting me frustrated because I want to be, or feel, normal. ",24Sep2018,2

I'll start missing people again and start reconnecting. I'll feel more sad, more happy. Defeated and inspired. After winter is over there is always a day when the air gets heavy again.

So basically
I’ve had suicidal thoughts for a while, maybe 5 of years or so, they’re becoming more frequent recently. I’ve not planned suicide but have thought a lot about not minding dying before. Most of the time the thoughts just pop up without warning e.g I’d be about to shave and the thought of running the razor across my wrist comes to mind, quite a graphic thought and wondering if my family would hear from the other room, thoughts of filling my back pack with weights and lying at the bottom of the pool. I’ll zone out mid conversation and not hear what whoever I’m talking to just said because I’m thinking about it then I’ll just nod and guess what they just said. There’s a slight urge to act on them but I won’t do it. Sometime I sit and think about doing it for a good few minutes. ",24Sep2018,15
61,"It's not a secret anymore to my peers and family, I'm transforming into someone else. I've become increasingly anxious over the past couple of months, and at this point it's unbearable. The violent, disgusting intrusive thoughts that harass me constantly came first, now I am plagued with a feeling of utter hopelessness. These days I think about suicide a lot, it's helped me accept death, or more so realise the kindness of death.

But in an ironic contrast to my obsession with death, there is a life I want to live. At least a vague feeling of one. I imagine myself wandering, just wandering wherever I choose to go. I imagine the cool air, the sort of rejuvenating breeze one could expect to feel as the sun sets. I'm not thinking about deadlines or credit scores, in this world I just am. 

It's a delusion, though, it's a pipe-dream. I have to toughen up, and get over it.  I've got to pass high school, I've got to get a job, I've got to make money and succeed. I have to live in the system, but I can't. I'm losing hope and I don't know what to do anymore.

Any responses (your own experiences, advice, etc) are cordially welcomed, I just needed to get this feeling off my chest. Perhaps I'm too self-absorbed, but I just needed to put this out there.

63,"TL;DR at the bottom.

I’m a sixteen year old male in the US, 6’ 4”, currently a junior in high school. I have problems talking with other teenagers, I don’t really have any friends, and most of the time I think most other teens either hate me or think I’m retarded. I’m not struggling academically (I got straight A’s in pre calculus and a few AP classes last year), but when dealing with teens I’m completely clueless. I also feel intimidated by groups of male teens, and I’m not sure if I dislike them out of fear or jealousy. I talk to a counselor infrequently, and he helps me deal with my depression and suicidal thoughts, but he doesn’t help with my social issues.

The weird thing is, I feel more confident when talking with adults. I run a D&amp;D group through Meetup, and the sessions usually include several adults. I don’t feel uncomfortable talking to them, but I still think they don’t like how I run the game. Several have left, mostly without communication or with a bullshit excuse. 

My mother is eclectic, alcoholic, overweight, and always seems to be working on some project. A few months ago she tore up the flooring of the entire first floor, and made me help even when I explicitly said I wanted no part of it. She always seems to need help with something, usually lifting something heavy or reaching something high. She sometimes calls me “mr. muscles” (usually in front of her friends or family), which I hate. She seems really proud of my academic ability, and when I show her my writing she says it’s really good, but I can’t shake the feeling that she just says it to make me feel better.

I grew up in Maryland, and tended to be one of the few shite people in school. I never got along with other students, and I’m not sure if it was because of my own terrible social skills or something else. I developed some fairly racist attitudes, and mostly kept them to myself. When mom dragged dad and I to whitewashed Oregon for a new job of hers, I found I still disliked my peers, especially the more popular ones. In my lower moments I’ve thought about school shootings or suicide bombings, but never really acted on those thoughts. I’ve also thought about killing myself publicly, like throwing myself over a railing with a noose tied around my neck. I always feel apathetic towards other teens, and mostly think of them as a bunch of pompous, condescending, narcissistic assholes. I’m probably just projecting, though.

TL;DR I feel socially retarded when dealing with other teenagers, and I think I deserve to die.",24Sep2018,2
64,"Keeping this short. I suffer chronic pain and illness daily since a sudden onset 2 years ago, it's only getting worse. Still trying desperately for a diagnosis. Have already had a very difficult life from a young age age, I'm 29 now. No friends or people I can relate or talk to. Everyone around me seems so happy with their 'normal' lives and 'normal' problems. I use to be one of the kindest people you could meet, always putting others first. It did me no good and I have nothing to show for it. If anything now I feel comtempt towards humanity. I largely overcame my mental health issues years ago and do love and treat myself well. Being physically ill has really put my mental health in to perspective. At the end of the day, what is the point of living a life full of suffering? Talking long-term here due to circumstances out of my control. I'm here to find other adults who are suffering similarly and who have thought about suicide objectively for a long time.

I'm not usually one to freak out or panic or whatever. But lately I've realized every emotion I'm feeling, I feel it to the max. If I get excited or happy, I'm basically about to explode. If I see something a little sad, I sob. And when I'm in a bad mood, yeesh. 

Well I don't know what happened this morning. I just lost it. I woke up around 7 ish, it was way too bright in my room. So i grabbed a thick blanket, folded it over my door, and climbed back into bed. While trying to fall asleep I start thinking about mildly shitty things going on in my life.idk, just things that bother me, or have made me mad recently.
   Well i just lost it. I don't know why but I started realizing I was making myself upset and I just got angry. So, so angry. I felt like screaming, I felt like I was going to explode in a crazy fit. I couldn't even control myself. I started biting my pillow, trying to release that pressure. Then I just started punching myself in the face, all over. It hurt but I don't know. I eventually stopped, I still have pressure in my chest, definitely not as much. I did feel a lot better after smoking weed. But I don't want to talk to anyone, I definitely don't want to message the BF or just anyone. I already have huge bumps all over my head and face, I hope none of them bruise or show, I haven't gotten up yet to see. 

 this happened over an hour ago, I'm just able to start regularly breathing again, I don't feel as pressure-y typing this so I guess that's what I wanted. I just feel like I'm a mess right now. I'm sorta shocked I hit myself so much.

66,"I used to get the ""Sunday blues"" when I was younger, before all of my mental health issues went full-blown. I guess I became so numb, self medicated, and dead inside that I never really cared what day it was, or what I had to do the next day. The weekend was just another two days of apathy like any other.

My wife was actually off all weekend (retail hours), and we finally started putting our house back together after a month of nightmarish renovation complete with a main sewer line collapse in the middle of that, which entailed no water usage for weeks, destroying our front yard, taking a chainsaw to our new front porch, and a huge unexpected expense. It was the most stressful month ever. We finally got some normalcy back this weekend, and could see the fruits of out labors. Plus fall actually set in, which is our jam.

At first the sadness felt uncomfortable and I tried to push it away. I wanted another day to just enjoy the house that we've been working so hard on. I didn't want to be away from my wife. But then I realized I was feeling *something*, even if it wasn't a good emotion, and fully embraced it.

I was excited to be sad.

Usually, this happens when I’m sitting in the car on my way somewhere or waiting for something, so pretty much when I’m not busy with anything. 
I’ll begin to feel as if all I am is a pair of eyes seeing, but not interacting nor feeling anything. It feels as if what I’m doing has been coordinated and laid out for me to do, and often, it just happens without me thinking about it. Like let’s say I need to pick up something. I’ll see myself do it but I won’t really feel it and have thought myself to pick it up. 
Think of it like you’re playing a story line in a game, in first person, where the character wakes, looks at both his arms, and does what he does.. this is how I feel. It’s as if I’m a robot.

I am a gamer/streamer and usually provide general life advice  to my viewers being I'm an old school gamer.

So I've determined he doesn't qualify as an immediate threat but I consider it to be more of an emergency than just suicide thoughts because he's cutting. 

I have sent him resources and asked him questions to keep his mind occupied. He said the resources don't work and he's already getting professional help along with attempting to call the hotlines to no luck. Instagram support articles state to do everything I'm doing currently. 

The problem is that I can't alert authorities in his area because I know nothing about his identity other than he's 14. 

Is there any way I can contact some sort of law enforcement that can contact Instagram to help locate him and get him checked on? So far I've just gotten links back to information I've already provided.

85,"Hey all,

I have been dealing with anxiety, depression, and obsessive thoughts. A little bit of background, my dad's side of the family has a history of depression and my symptoms only really surfaced within the last year because of a horrible relationship I went through.

One of my obsessive that plagues me is if I am capable of love and concern. In the past I have certainly shown these things. When my grandfather passed away in 2005, I was incredibly sad, yet when my other grandfather died just this last christmas, I was not as affected that much, at least not a severely when I lost my other one. Another instance I remember is when my best friend was rejected from the college he wanted to go to. He was so upset that I immediately went over to comfort him. Another example was that I have shown concern over my parents weight and want them to slim down for their own health.

But lately, I don't know if I am capable of genuinely love, or if I am just possessive and lonely instead of loving. I mainly introverted, and I like to have time to myself, but I sometimes look to be with my family because I feel guilty that I am not spending enough time with them. To clarify, I love my family and we have spent quality time together every now and then, I am simply talking about day to day interaction that I force. I also have these doubts about how I would react if I found out if anyone I care about died, would I be sad, would I be accepting, or would I be apathetic? The introverted aspect of it all is concerning to me because I don't know if I value my close friends and family because they are awesome people and we came together naturally or because I value the fact that we are ""friends"". I also had this inner fight concerning my ex, whether I truly loved her or I was just lustful/lonely/desperate (she was my first serious relationship) and happy with the idea of finally being in a relationship. I also tried to help her when she going through stuff, but again I don't know if that was me genuinely caring for HER or just some stupid valiance/protection/paladin fantasy.

I also find myself worrying if I relate to the incel/neckbeard/niceguy community because they all seem so desperate/bitter and I don't want to become those callous assholes but I can't help but find myself relating to some of the emotions they are going through.

I have also found that when I have talked to others on here, I don't know if I am genuinely trying to help them or I am just trying to show off/give unsolicited advise, because it feels like all of these motivations at the same time. The karma system does not work because I find myself anxiously checking if the people I have talked to have replied to me and given me feedback/validation (like when I try to text people, this was cranked up to 11 concerning my ex so there may be some correlation)

I think I've always gotten sad to some degree, and felt some general amounts of anger and being upset and irritable. but this is an entirely new level. I've been crying non stop for the past few days, hard. sobbing. I self harmed. I wrote a suicide note for the first time. I even made a plan of how I'd do it, so now the last step is just doing it. there have been times where I've lost myself, only for a mere few seconds, but I still lost consciousness and control in my mind. im genuinely terrified that if that happens during one of these episodes, I'll actually go through with my plan. when I'm not on my period, I'm still depressed. I definitely still struggle with my mental health on a daily basis. but this is just something else entirely. I'm not in control of myself. every little problem that comes up is just another reason I should kill myself. 

I'm hoping this isn't supposed to be just a normal part of pms. there are certainly times where I'll get like this without pms, but the thing with this is that it's so regular and happens every month that I know it's at least partly due to the hormones or something.

Made.me.gwt.a.storage unit when there was plenty of space. 
- makes me stay on couch when there are two empty bedrooms, one being my former bedroom.
- I am allowed one tote 2x3 ish in the house for clothes etc. 
- she has went through my things several times, looking for trouble. Has taken from me and lied about it. 
- I never used to cry but she makes me 2 to 3 times a day.


 It's not as easy as just get out. If I just were to leave she would cut me out, my father died of lung cancer at 54 and hated her at the end, he just didnt want to die alone, this haunts me. He had a pretty successful welding business with a few employees,  that I used to work for at 19, when he passed my mom did not trust me and most of it was stolen, or is still sitting God  knows where in crates around the warehouse space he used to rent, owned by another business that hires shady thieves and pilferers,  the rest even a 2005 f350 that's been rotting out front she never dealt with or sold when he passed on 2007. She will not talk about it or share any info. Even at 19 my dad shared everything with me, and would have been mortified of me knew this was the case.
So TV his is turning into a backstory. After his death, a lot if not all of my friends did not know how to talk to me, I had graduated high school in June, and he passed in Sept. So while they enjoyed going out in life and s idk me of the best years I had the worst. Note when my dad was diagnosed with cancer at the same time my mom had a collapsed lung. She was angry he got the attention coming out of that because we all knew he was going to pass, soon. So the day he died he was brought home from hospice. My mom hept saying to family (my dads sister) I cant do this. So I had to inject the green sludge into his feeding pump thing in his stomach give meds l, etc. He died the day he came home. My brother, being eleven, ran away upstairs as he was on his last breaths, I felt it was the right thing to do to bring him down saying  "" this will be a moment hell regret the rest of his life if he isnt by his side when he passes"". I watched a person actually die that day. 
As the nurse was flying his meds I was so angry I took a bottle of his vicodin cause basically f the world at that point. That started an opiate addiction to numbnthe pain. As I said earlier no good friends I had would be by my side. They were more worried about partying and life afternhigh.school than for a debbie downer whose dad just died. My younger brothers friends parents made them support him ( I'll get back to him later) so just from.19 to 21 I was on opiates, first the vicodin, then the only person I knew who would act.like a friend , his Male was dustin, showed me oxycontin, when I couldn't afford that he showed me heroin, which I used a total.of less than THREE MONTHS. at that point th we re was a situation.... I had gotten a pizza delivery job. It was a shift until 4am. The guy i.got the.dope from was kinda weird, like he he as d some disease or something. One night I picked some dope up from him at like midnight. He also have me a.hypodermic needle to use.... I used it then  noticed something that made me freak out, as if he had used the needle and given it to me. This dealers body structure and rx's came off like he had HIV. With the protruding gut and skinny face ( other things just too many to label). So I started freaking out, you have no idea the fear that went through me, like I was just given a life sentance. It bothered me so much I caved and told my mother who at that time helped me find a rehab so I could get tested and get clean. 
     Coming out I stayed clean, however was put on a drug called SUBOXONE. I was on that for four years, for less then 5 months of 5 days a week drug use. And at 16mg(alot) the doc was using me for money, bit it worked I staYed clean, continued to work for a time and cut off my.only friend Dustin. 
     Eventually I lose the job and become a hermit. Living at my moms from 21ish through 26 I had a routine revolving around suboxone and video games, no job no social contacts. ( in all those years I think I went out with friends like 4 or 5 times) so no social skills you learn during these years. It was at 26 feeling super.lonely I made a dating profile online and met a.girl I'll name K for anon purposes.
     K was much younger than me, 19, attractive, lived an hour away and had just moved here from Tennessee she was a trouble maker and her dad couldn't handle her so he sent her to her mom here in mich. She was the only one who'd talk to me, after all I had little expierience to pull from socially. She got me to get a job ( as a mover) and to finally.kick the suboxone. She didnt say anything I just needed money l, you do to have a gf lol and suboxone made me anti social. I did it and I was proud. Moving put me into the best shape of my life and I thought I was so cool for having a gf after 5 sexless lonely years. 
     Eventually I decided to get out my moms and move to where she lived, I could transfer over there and get out of the shit town this is. By this point she had gotten me into drinking, and I started drinking regularly. Having no social.skills I felt alcohol made me fun. Things went well for a while till one night we were both super drunk, found out she was talking to some other dude we argued, and remember this - HER STEPFATHER WAS A LT. FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. So she called the police saying I was scaring her, slamming door, yelling etc.. not hitting or hurting her. I called my brother before and begged him to pick me up and get me out of here but he wouldn't. I knew this was where confronting her would lead. So I went to jail for ""domestic assault"" I sent time in  jail for the first time ever and when I got out I knew this would ruin my background, I was forced to go back to my hometown and scared, very scared. My first attempt outside in life since my dad passed.
    Like most dumb kids we got back together, kind of. I was back in my.home town and she had no car. There were nights she'd get mad ( I think she was seeing someone else at this time) and say the most hurtful hate filled mean things to me knowing I was stuck at home and couldn't do anything. This led to me.taking out anger and yelling at my mom and brother, being a jerk and causing unnecessary drama.  So understandably one evening they called the police because I had drank a little and I was going to jump in my car and drive to the see her in her Hometown and I think they were afraid for my life. I had less than a gram of weed I had been holding on to for a year or so and put it in my pocket and headed towards my vehicle, my mom called the police and before you know it they had me against my car checking my pockets, found the weed,  So they sent me to jail for possession and this whole time I was waiting for sentencing on the domestic in her Hometown so they took me to jail in hour away in her Hometown.
     I could write pages in itself on that period I developed a kidney stone where they took me to the regular hospital in my Orange jumpsuit I remember a child crying looking at me and all they would give me is ibprofin,  Then I remember some guy owing me a drink Kool aid for a card game and didn't pay and when you're in jail you have to look like a man so I remember calling them into my cell and yelling at him and saying I was going to fight him mind you I'm a skinny a £150 white kid and he was a pretty well built black guy I just got lucky cuss he back down and gave me my Kool aid but it was scary when you're in a place like that that's your only option and he could have kicked my teeth out. I learned a lot in there I will say although I do remember my mom would never pick up the phone my brother would never take a phone call anyone whose number I remembered in there would never answer the phone I felt so alone and I believe it was a traumatizing experience. 
    But after about a month I got out and was brought back to my Hometown at this point I was so angry because my mom had called the police which got me in trouble for weed which I had point 27 g of. I remember arguing and eventually they told me to leave the house something a middle upper class white kid like me did not know I was so scared. I found it a childhood friend who let me stay for A-day or 2 but I was so scared I did not know what was going to happen with the court stuff where my life was going I had no money and I had never been turned away by my family like that. You can say I was priviledged are whatever but it was just how I was raised we weren't rich are anything but family always helped our stood by. 
     So I think it was the 3rd day after getting out of jail and to days of no sleep because I was so freaked out staying at my childhood friends place where he lived with his mom and stepdad they had a bottle of lu nesta out, At this point I said screw the world and I remember taking 2 of them and as some of you may know for some people a causes you to sleep walk. 
      I remember nothing of the incident my friend was at work I remember taking Billy nasta hoping to just sleep the day away but apparently I woke up I went to The Home Depot and stole random things like single gloves and like screws and stupid stuff for no reason. I guess somehow I found the way back to his house driving and walked into the neighbor's house an accident it was there I was trying to make a sandwich and make note I remember none of this this is all after reading the police report.. So it was at this point a man walked downstairs and asked what I was doing there Where I said I got dropped off by a party bus and was waiting for a phone call from my dead grandmother everything I said me docents and actually I was scared and went in hid in the bathroom according to documents. You only thing I remember is walking out of the house and being tackled extremely hard by a police officer 3 times my size it was then I was interrogated for multiple hours which I can't recall. When I woke up in jail I remember asking why I was there and being told I was being charged with a 20 year felony 1st degree home invasionScared the living krapp out of me. Note that nothing was stolen like I said I was trying to make a sandwich I guessAnd there was no break in I guess the door was unlocked and I walked straight in the house looked exactly like my friend's house right next to it. I had to spend 2 months in jail waiting to hear what would happen$5000 was paid furniture tourney who did absolutely nothing in fact I remember him saying he didn't want to do all the paperwork of a loo nesta defense so instead I was eventually lowered to breaking in entering in the 3rd degree and put on a new program called R it was some kind of mental health probation I think the lawyer had said I had a mental breakdown and didn't include the drug. Note that no one ever made an attempt to talk to the neighbors I had known this kid in his family since the 3rd grade all they would have to do is go next door and probably say they were sorry and they knew me I was a good person who wouldn't do that in this would have all been dropped. But now I cannot enter Canada the UK Australia New Zealand Japan and several other countries because of thus. 
     This is important because because of this and a domestic I cannot get a job at several places I can't even volunteer even though these were misdemeanors. But I remember getting out of jail and trying to call my family for a pick up are a ride and they had not picked up the phone a single time I was in jail for 2 months scared lifeless which I think really screwed me up. I ended up walking 9 miles every gas station I stopped at wouldn't let me borrow a phone nobody would. It's started raining at about the 5th mile which I felt was like a movie where you hit rock bottom. Eventually I get to a grocery store where a worker lets me use the company phone I get ahold of my mother and out of guilt she lets me check in to one of the worst hotels motels there were in this city note that it is now shut down and actually is a place for homeless people. Eventually I got back in touch with KWho had me pick her up and bring her back to the shady motel I was at and was my only friend sadlyShe stuck it out with me while I tried to get my old moving job back and tried to find an apartmentSomething I would not have been able to do if she did not bring her laptop. I got my moving job back in I remember working and going back to that very very badd motel. There was even a situation where K would stay there while I worked and she found bed bugs over everything they moved us to another room but did nothing for the bed bugs it was disgusting. The courts didn't care they just said it you'd go back to jail if you didn't have an actual a dress they could stop that even though I was on probation for misdemeanors the 3rd degree breaking and entering is a 90 day misdemeanor I was charged with the weed which is a one year misdemeanor but through a deal they dropped the we'd charge but not the breaking and entering which makes no sense.
     With a little help from my mom and saving money I have mentioned I got an apartment in the hood I had been paying $250 a week for the worst motel ever. Things went OK fro while life got better through my moving job I got a lot of good furnitureI passed all my drops for probation didn't screw up. There was however one badd situation which I will have to go into depth later that will screw me that screwed me up because K decided that because I put my phone number on my Facebook she was going to move back home and used craigslist to get a random ride from orandum stranger which I tried to stop for fear of her safety. 
     Fast forward about a year in while I was working K had met a couple around my age who were heroin addicts and had gotten hurt into heroin without me knowing.
     One night she was going to go out and I could tell that she had been changing and I forget exactly how but I found out she was using heroin and having used it myself I knew how about it could be and she knew the stop so we got in an argument and I remember seeing her slamming doors which knocked over a picture frame on the wall shattering the glass which I picked up. I put the glass by the trash can and we continued to argue I stood in front of the door saying she was not going to go meet up with her friends to get high and what I can remember she came at me screaming and yelling and I thought she just pounded my chest but she had taken a piece of the glass and stabbed me right between the cavity in my ribs. I left my shirt up and blood begins shooting out like a water fountain oddly enough I remember my 1st thought was to go lay down in the kitchen cause I didn't want to get blood all over the carpet. I didn't have my phone on me and she would not call the police so I sat there bleeding thinking I was going to die eventually with the little I could speak she said if I told them I stabbed myself she would call the police. She did and they came and looking at their faces they knew that there might be a good chance I might not make it to the hospital2 of the police officers were women and they saw a right through things and talk me into admitting that she did stab me I was sent to the hospital and she was charged with great bodily harm less than murder.
     For a moment after getting out of the hospital she called me in wanted to get back together to which I said screw that. While in the hospital my family never showed up except for when the police had the phone the when it happened at 1st and told her that she should come if she wants to see  her son one last time. I was alone for about 8 days they wouldn't pick up the phone or talk to me but eventually did pick me up when I had to go back. I was dropped off back home unfortunately the dog which was her dog had licked up all my blood no one had said the animals or anything. 
     I want even include the long paragraph about the dog getting sick and pooping everywhere and destroying the carpet and the fact I had to get it care because k's mom wanted me to just put it down but I would not do that. But I could not afford to take it to the vet. 
Fast forward to her court hearing she had pled guilty and I showed up for the sentencing at sentencing I approached the judge and my argument was that I have scars on my chest from the lap rose copy of them sucking blood out of my body cavity and from the stint I now have forever in my heart. She did not wanna hear it and said that she shouldn't get any jail time that would not help her. When she approached the judge to be sentenced the 1st thing the judge asked was that if she felt beautiful. This made my family and the friends from my moving job who had supported me after being stabbed almost go into tears she was given a few years probation with that being dropped off her record upon completing probation. 
     My tie add that when she lived with me in my apartment she received 2 domestics against me one for beating me and punching me till my ear was bleeding and a grocery store parking lot where an on looker called the police but I did what I thought was right and didn't want someone to suffer like I had and just didn't show up so she was in charged which she could have done to me. So I have to misdemeanors on my record that have prevented me from so many jobs just about anything that requires a background check. And her offense gets dropped off her record upon completing probation. 
Again fast forward a friend I met at work was moving into a house which I was fortunate enough to be able to move in with him and those were some good in between years I met some new girls unfortunately I was never able to totally connect with any of themIn on several in occasion would just stop talking to them completely for no reason. 
     Moving forward eventually I lost the moving job I had to go back to after my heart surgery because it was the only job I could get and it to pay for things. I did receive unemployment for a. In the rent miso cheap at the house I was able to stay there for a while but eventually because the house was for sale someone bought it and I had to move out where my only option was to move in with an old friend whose family was a bunch of hoarders which was a nightmare in itself she had a dog and in her closet she would let the dog poop and there would be mounds of poop for months you and clean up which made the entire upstairs sleeping area smell so badd and she would not clean it no matter what.  And did a number of other things which included screaming yelling breaking things which scared the living h*** out of me because I now have P TSD or whatever you wanna call it I'm afraid of yelling and loud sounds and anger. 
      But her actions got us kicked out of there where I found another place however this place I was lied to and the man leasing a room and there was a child sex offender 2 counts of raping a child under the age of 13 which he was renting a few rooms and the other renters and I found out and became scared of him and not to mention he actually wasn't even supposed to be renting out rooms there it was in his house he was to rent so I had nowhere to go and end of the back at home. 
     To wrap it up and this was the main point I was getting at but I'll make it brief is I've been stuck here since then being put down every day feeling badd for myself, I'm having the energy I'll get screen that for a piece of cardboard missing or a :) on a tree or like I said I'm no longer allowed to use metal spoons around here because she thinks my mom things I stole them I don't know why but she thinks very little of me these days she thinks I'm a thief a liar a low life scum bag and I've not done much to show her that I am one and I know I am not 1. She makes me feel horrible for not having a job but I have applied so many places and been denied because of my record. I do nothing ever sadly she is the only contact or human contact I have for weeks on end every weekend I don't go out or do anything it's just help my mom and then she tells me that I don't help or do anything saying I'm lazy she's basically beating up myself Steen I could do more to help but maybe somebody will get the picture that I'm broken inside I feel alone and because of this it sucks the energy out of meAnd being broke makes you feel completely different than when you have money in your account for a safety blanket you know and losing all my possessions are most of them not to mention the fact I'm back at home somewhere I don't want to be and have no idea what to do with my life I'm so lost like I said I've thought about suicide I just hold on to a glimmer of hope my brother ended up going to Ohio state and doing great he didn't invite me to his graduation even they hold what happened to me with the jail stuff against me and won't forgive me I have caught them saying badd things about me they don't include me with any family talks so I feel alienated. And what my mom does can only be labeled emotional abuse.

I dont know how to get out. If you read this thank you so much, I could make it a book I left.so much out but I want out so bad I want to be a good son, even though I've just been brainwashed to believe I'm a pos. When I was a  Louver they put me in charge of senior citizen moves because I was the nicest the most patient understanding and approachable person they had.

I hate my city. The worst in the US for healthcare. They teach it here but its trying to wash the dirty smelly 45 year old rag used for everything from the ass to the countertop alongside the slightly newer but needs cleaning rags.  
The surrounding healthcare professionals are littered with these folks, like 44 out of every 50. Its sickening inside, down where the guts are.
Ps autistic
I've applied for help at the local center for this issue, my issue. But the insurance company denied me so that happened. My therapist has been helping for almost two years. I have been evaluated by three people with more intelligence than will fit in a paper cup, so that has to count for something if they all came up with the same preliminary diagnosis. Aspergers. Yay me!
So no help there. All the while I have to work with my crappy back, which has hurt since a car accident 18 years ago that killed my mother. Of course I've had X-rays and an MRI, I Finally convinced her to do another MRI after three years. Nothing more than milk scoliosis and a bulging disk. Expect the pain, all the pain. The results don't show enough to warrant more than just basic medication, Norco 5, 3x a day. 
Did I mention Im a live in caregiver for my old enough father who's a vet and cant do much more than complain. I can barely work 6-9 hours a week with my back, and I'm a merchandiser. 
I can't leave no one wants me, I'm broken and I can't leave. I want to go-to a country that give a fuck about their citizens. I what to live somewhere where I can grow and feel proud to be there. Natural selection should have taken me along time ago. I was born here by accident. I was born by accident. I can't compete with normal people and I don't have any friends. No one to go painting with. I went once and apparently it's really good, but I think it's bullshit because I haven't done anything right ever. Cannabis is the only thing that helps. Otherwise the world feels like one big ennui blanket.

94,"A little background first.  I am 46m, married with 2 kids.  Son is 7 years old, daughter is 3 and a half.

I was previously married, but got divorced.   No kids from prior marriage.  I am a relatively successful professional.

I was diagnosed as having rapid cycling bipolar disorder in the year 2000.  I have tried most meds, and am currently taking 75 mg of Effexor, which mostly manages my moods.

After my divorce and 10 years of talk therapy, I decided to get remarried.  I have always been honest with my spouse about my diagnosis. She suffers from a similar set of symptoms but was diagnosed mostly with an anxiety/OCD disorder. She is also currently medicated with Effexor.

Our son always exhibited weird behavioral issues, but we were hoping he was within normal bounds. Unfortunately, suffers greatly already from a variety of serious mental health/behavioral issues.

He currently has an IEP at school, and on some days, we have considered having him schooled in a residential treatment facility.

Now, our daughter is starting to exhibit  seriously disturbing behaviors.  She is riddled with anxiety.

I feel so terrible about having passed our bad genes on, and sentenced our kids to suffer their entire lives. I sometimes wish that I hadn’t remarried and had kids. :(",24Sep2018,11

After playing it back I realized that I felt a wave of self-hatred and regret when I had to explain my mental illnesses. I know that this isn't okay and that it isn't normal.

So fast forward to now, went to get a Urine sample last month, nothing came back. I was fine. After the results, I felt simply fine, and had to pee no more. Now, it’s now, and I’m starting to feel the same symptoms again, but worse.  Frequent urination, pain in rectum, some pain after I pee, and maybe sometimes back pain.

97,"Hey folks--

I'm hoping to get some insight and shared experiences from you all here. I'm on the fence about seeing a professional about my situation. It would be a money sink, so I want to get some perspective first.

I'm a graduate student. This is my 6th year in a row, but last spring I noticed a fundamental change in my attitude. I was a go-getter, overachiever for a lot of graduate school. I worked really damn hard and enjoyed what I was doing, but I always felt like I was drowning because of how much was on my plate. Well, I finished up my course work last fall and was supposed to be working on my project proposal, grants, managing my advisor's lab, and studying for my qualifying exams. It was a relatively low-workload semester. I thought I'd be able to study really well for my quals and have a nicely polished proposal by the end of the spring.

Instead, I couldn't make myself do anything. I spent so much time online. I would tell myself that I needed to read or spend the afternoon doing research and I would get there and just not do it. I felt physical resistance in my body to switching over to my work. I could also focus for maybe 15 minutes before I felt something like an ""itch"" to get back on social media. I've tracked my time and I often spend as little as 3 hours each day actually working and upwards of 7 surfing. I've checked out r/nosurf and now suspect that an Internet addiction might play a role in this. 

I feel incredibly low energy and apathetic about everything I've spent the last-half decade working for. My qualifying exams are now this week and I've done a half-assed job studying. I don't care that much. If I fail, they will dimiss me from the program...but I just can't make myself care enough to study. It feels like an insurmountable effort.  I just want to not have to do anything. This is the antithesis of who I was until a couple years ago.

Any one else with similar experiences or insight? Is this just standard burn out that could go away with some time off? (Like that will ever happen.) Or is this maybe some sort of depression and addiction combo that has made me into an apathetic sloth-creature? Is it something I could try to resolve without seeing someone?",24Sep2018,3
98,"I began college a year ago, so far it has been good for me, stressful but rewarding. But at one point last January I had myself so worried about grades, relationships, my job, finance, etc. that I gave myself a full blown panic attack. It was a very scary experience for me, since I had only ever had one or two close calls before in the past. Also, at the time, there was very little reason for me to be worried, money and grades were fine. After that happened, and recovered, I mentally told myself that I can't let anything like that happen again. And thankfully nothing like that did happen for a good while. 

Then in May I was let go from my part-time job, for being ""too shy"", as told by my employer, which was a huge blow to my self-esteem and confidence. In spite of this I had managed to persevere and quickly find a new job, which I'm happier in now. Even though I had this setback, everything for me since January has been great. 

However, even though I am very happy with how my life is right now, probably the best it's ever been so far, I have had this feeling of anxiety that has been growing since early this year, and I don't understand why. I constantly become convinced that something very bad is going to happen. For example, I had one time become so anxious and 100% convinced that my boyfriend wanted to break up with me, even though he has never given me or shown any reason that he wanted to. When I came to my senses after that episode, it seemed so ridiculous, considering that we are very close. Another time, I was very sure that I was going to get fired from my (current) job, and I had thought that my manager wanted to speak with me and give me this news. After my shift at work ended, I went to my manager and asked her ""did you want to speak to me?"". She was very confused, said no, and actually praised me for my work that particular day. I was overthinking so much that I had thought my manager wanted to speak to me in her office and fire me, which wasn't the case at all. 

They're just two examples of what I have been experiencing lately. And so far I've managed to contain it so I can get on with my life, but for the past week it has been at its worst. I was close to a panic attack yesterday. I have developed a compulsion of constantly checking my phone in case something's wrong. And the latest one is extreme mood swings. Just today I went from being very angry (which is not in my nature at all), crying and then being happy and laughing again in the space of about an hour. 

I'm very sure that I have an anxiety disorder of some sort, no doubt. And it is reaching the point where it is going to interfere with my day-to-day life if something doesn't change, and I don't know what steps I should take now. For context, I also lost my father when I was fifteen where he died suddenly, and experienced my mother being critically sick in hospital less than a month later. I think this my have some contribution to what is happening to me right now. 

With my current situation, accessing a psychiatrist is do-able, but would be very costly for me, and I consider it only a last resort. Is there any other options I could consider before seeking professional help?",24Sep2018,4
99,"Hi, people of Reddit. So disclaimer: I'm posting this here just for the sake of putting it out into the universe and because I see a lot of people come and post similar stuff on this website. I know, I know. I should maybe (probably) consult a professional about my mental health, but I figured I'd throw it out there. I’m going to be completely, painfully, and openly honest with how I’m feeling and if anyone has any idea as to what the hell is going on with me or if there is in fact no problem with me whatsoever, I'd greatly appreciate y'all sharing your opinions.

A little background information: I’m an 18 year old female. Just finished freshman year university this past April, but I didn’t like my program that much, so I decided to take this year off to work and travel (which is what I'm doing currently). My life has changed so drastically in the past year and a half after graduating high school, leaving friends and family, and going to university. I have mild generalized anxiety. Only child brought up in a fairly wealthy household. I’m an INFJ, if that helps in any shape or form.

So for the past while (6-8 months maybe? It started halfway through my first year at university) I've been having a lot of really unusual things going on inside my head and it's kind of freaking me out. I don't know if it's severe enough to call it derealization. I was under a severe amount of stress in university during my first year (as is every other science student in a rigorous program is), and I feel like that combined with not liking my major and being the anxious perfectionist overachiever that I am might have like… set off something in my head?

Lately, I feel like I’m thinking way too much for my own good and living inside this bubble in my own head. I constantly want to be alone and am a lot of the time, but then I’m a mix of unhappy and apathetic when I am by myself and start thinking way too much and overanalyzing everything and everyone around me. I’m the world’s biggest empath and have this super bad habit of living vicariously through my friends and through people on social media. I have trouble making that disconnect lately from what I’ve actually experienced and what I’m experiencing via social media or a story from a friend. Experiences that I have through other people lately sometimes seem… more real than my own? It’s really strange. I feel like I’ve lived an entire life, but in reality, I’m still so young.

Probably one of the scariest things is is that I feel like I can’t really see things, if that makes any sense? Like I’ll be somewhere outside and I’ll be looking at a forest and I see it, but it doesn’t seem like it’s actually, physically there. I feel like I’m in a simulation sometimes. Like everything is just a virtual reality or a projection. I don’t have any hallucinations, but I just feel this eerie level of disconnection with other people and with the outside world. It’s like I’ve lost a connection to my senses or something and am too in my head to actually live in my body. I feel like I’ve lost that feeling I used to have as a child of being present in the moment and uninhibited.

Another thing is that time goes by terrifyingly quickly and before I know it, entire days and weeks are flying by before my eyes. Days have started to blur together and everything feels monotonous. I feel like nothing is new or novel anymore and because of this, I’ve stopped trying new things. I feel like I’ve felt every feeling that I’m ever going to feel and know everything there is to know and that everything I do from here on out is pointless and that life is kind of pointless in general (do you see why I’m freaked out?). Like I went to New York City this summer for a dance gig which has been one of my childhood dreams ever since I can remember… and I was in the midst of my trip and just kind of felt unfazed, disconnected, and undeserving of the opportunity the whole time. And I felt guilty for feeling indifferent. And then I went on a road trip across the U.S. and felt the same way. I feel inhibited and like I’m unable to be fully present in a moment.

Intrusive thoughts are another thing. I get these thoughts of like “how are people so happy?” and “everyone is so naive.” I’m a really quick learner, but sometimes I think other people are so annoying and stupid. Especially extroverts. I psychoanalyze everyone and constantly wonder why people are the way they are. I think really deeply. Sometimes I feel like my thoughts are too deeply for my own good. I get these obsessive thoughts that there’s nothing left to look forward to in my life, that my time has already passed, that I’ve passed my prime, and that I’ll never be as happy as I used to be. I get obsessed with thoughts of my parents dying, working in jobs I hate for my entire life, never getting childhood back, being unhappy, never finding someone who loves me, never being happy in my body, never reaching my goals, never making a difference in the world. See why my brain is freaking me out?

None of this ever used to happen to me. I used to be so excited about life and lately I just feel really… apathetic. I’ll have these moments of extreme high and extreme low moods that range from feeling literally euphoric to suicidal. I’ve become extremely self-conscious and absolutely hate my appearance. I’ve gained weight and went from moderately muscular with like 15% body fat to muscular with 22-23% body fat. I’ve ate a well-rounded diet for my entire life and been vegetarian for 2 years. I went from being a competitive dancer working out like 4-6 hours a night to going to the gym 4-5 days a week, but eating the same as I always have. My insecurities literally inhibit me from being myself anymore, wearing what I want to wear, and doing things that I used to think were so much fun (going to the beach, hooking up with guys, even wearing shorts).

Most of my friends live far away, so I only get to really spend quality time with good friends maybe once every couple months. I work a lot and am by myself a good majority of the time when travelling (could isolation have anything to do with all this?). I feel like I don’t know how to have fun anymore. Whenever I’m with people, I feel like I’m literally in a different dimension. I don’t know. It’s really strange and hard to explain.

I'm just wondering like... is this normal? Is there something wrong with me? Is it from stress? Do I just need to get out of my head? Am I completely fine? It’s frustrating because I know that I have such an incredible life. I really do. I’m so fortunate, but I feel like I’m being fucked sideways, upside down, and diagonally by my brain.",24Sep2018,2

107,"Hey all, 

I've been seeing a new therapist the past month who has asked me to take a 'test' called the post traumatic stress index (PTSI). I did his copy and then searched online to find out if its likely that I have PTSD based on that test. I know the Internet can't diagnose me but I was curious about it and I won't see him for almost a week. So has anyone taken this test and later been diagnosed or if anyone with a diagnosis would be so kind as to take it and help me see if I should be expecting this outcome. 

For reference, I scored in the red in Trauma Blocking (15), Trauma Splitting (14), Trauma Shame (14), Trauma Reactions (11), Trauma Bonds (9), Trauma Pleasure (7), Trauma Abstinence (7), and in the yellow in Trauma Repetition (4). 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Does scoring almost entirely in the red of the PTSI mean I likely have PTSD?",24Sep2018,4
108,"Hi,

Has anyone ever experienced multiple bad situations that impacted your life negatively in a short ammount of time? My last year has been extremely difficult for me. I had depression before but, for the most part I dealt with them. This year however has been pivotal for me.

Late last fall I got into serious financial problems. I had started a very small woodworking and remodelling company. For the first month or two it gained momentum and I thought I had something good going. A police officer, of all people defaulted on his payments which made me unable to pay my truck payments but most importantly I couldn't even pay the money I owed my friend and employee at the time. After this my confidence just collapsed, from 100 to 0 in a matter of days.

Not a month later my truck got repossesed. Yet another hard pill to swallow. I tried to rebound after that but I just couldn't shake the feelings of shame and Guilt...

After a little while my relationship with my mother was getting verbally abusive (from both sides) so a friend and her family let me move in the appartment upstairs where they rented out to her older son free of charge until I got myself back on my feet and could contribute money. The first weeks were great, i was actually cleaning my room again which I dont care about when Im really depressed. I had friends around me all the time which really helped me regain my sense of humour.. Life was okay. 

Eventually my mood would swing drastically and I started slipping again. Confidence dropped to an all-time low. Probably the first time I seriously considered suicide. I had given myself a few months to try and push through. I started lashing out at my mother, yelling at her on the phone for being no help blah blah.. One day I lost it on my friend over a can of goddamn bugspray, fuck me right? Well that ridiculous argument turned into me being on (probation) with them, which obviously I was living for free so its completely validated... Eventually I got so disgusted with his behaviour around my friend's younger son. Not going to get into details about what those were, because they don't matter anymore. One day my friend drops me off so I could go fishing. We agreed she may or may not be available to pick me back up and I knew this. It started pooring about an hour later and I mean (pooooooring).. My friend couldnt pick me back up so I walked home drenched, uncomfortable and furious. Even though we did agree about the rides beforehand, I lost it at her when I got home and basically incinuated she was a drunk since she had a few beers. To be fair both their drinking was becoming concerning and I did feel bad for her younger son.

Anyhow I lashed out, and was understandingly kicked out. I lost close friends because of this. I was a shit person.. To be short, While I was at my worse, I made things worse than they were. I feel so guilty and remorseful it actually fucking hurts. Like physically. I have no confidence left at all. I cant get going, Im in this shitstorm of regret and depression and to be honest, it does feel insurmountable right now. Ive tried to apologize to them but they have all cut me off of their lives by now.. Not one answer, not even a sign. I never knew how difficult it would be to move on. I feel so fucking bad about everything, and its only getting worse.. Why is this? Why can't I accept and move on. How do I forgive myself for messing up, so that I can start focusing on my future. 

Its been months since all those things happened and they are on my mind every single minute of everyday. I can't even look at myself in the mirror anymore I think so little of myself. I hate who I am right now and I need tips on how to manage this. I've come to a point where I barely get off my ass. Feels like I'm trapped.

Any tips are very welcomed guys. Thank you.",24Sep2018,3
109,"For the last month or 2 I’ve been scared someone is trying to poison me. I know logically that people wouldn’t have a reason to, but I’m just so scared. I can’t drink out of my water bottle after leaving it unattended, eating in restaurants is possible but terrifying, hell even eating food in general gets terrifying when it gets bad. Sometimes even just being in a public place it’s like what if someone is using some type of gas to poison me.

To add on to this my depression and my hypochondria is back full force. The world just feels dull and black and white, and i still love my friends and talk to them a lot but a lot of times i just feel...empty. And about my hypochondria, it’s very typical, like something is slightly wrong and I’m scared I’m dying of X disease.

I’m wondering could this be some type of schizophrenia? I don’t feel like I’m insane, and the paranoia feels reasonable and not entirely delusional, like I there’s this little nugget at the back of my brain saying it’s crazy but even as I type this out I’m becoming more convinced.

I want to get help but I don’t want to. I’m 17 in the US and on my parents insurance so I need to talk to my mom to start seeing someone. I’m scared to talk to my mom though, because she’s very stressed right now and I don’t want to put this on her even though I know she would help in a heartbeat.

110,"It's quite a long time now, about 15 years, that I am suffering in irregular intervals from a strange illness that has not yet been well diagnosed. Officially, I am labeled ""bipolar 2"", but I even doubt that ""depression"" is the right term to describe the syndrome I am suffering from.

Its main symptoms are:

* lack of drive
* strong restriction in the ability to grasp complex things and to learn new things
* anhedonia
* physically, droning in the back of the head, ""brain fog"" (might not be the right term)

It occurs in different intensities and on different occasions, without any obvious trigger. It can last for unpredictable periods, between 5 days and several months. It is not related to the usual triggers for depression, like low confidence, failures, pondering, it rather feels like a physical condition. I could describe it as a calcified brain.

This illness has made big parts of my life a mess, even to the extent that I had a suicide attempt once, but that is a few years ago now. When it vanishes, I like to forget about it, but it always comes back relentlessly.


What makes it really tough is, that, so far, I did not find any medication that alleviated my misery. What I tried:

* Lithium (I take it for 6 years now without any noticeable effect)
* SSRI (any kind available, they all had no effect besides anorgasmia)
* Mirtazapine (no effect)
* Tianeptine (no effect, but worsens everything when it wears off).
* Ritaline and Modafinil (very nice for 2 hours but then worsens everything dramatically when it wears off)
* Lamotrigine (no effect, suspected of rather worsening)
* Moclobemide (worsens everything dramatically)

Obviously, drug intolerance comes on top.

Besides that, I tried to self-medicate myself with nootropics and supplements:

* Tumeric
* Lion's Mane
* Rhodiola
* Fish oil
* Gingko Biloba
* Bacopa Moniera
* ALCAR
* Uridine
* Vinpocetine

I get a small energy boost from ALCAR, while Uridine and Vinpocetine make me tired instantly. I take the other supplements on a regular base, and, while I am sure they are rather beneficial, up to now nothing stopped my illness from haunting me again.

What I would really like to try, is:
* Cerebrolysine, but I will not get an prescription for it in Germany
* NSI-189 (looks like I have to order it from the internet anyways).

as anybody else here, I guess, I want to share my situation with you guys, before I head out to some therapist or else. I don't know how to wrap this up, just know that it cannot go on like this somehow. I don't know if something is wrong with me or if I am just imagining things because I cannot think outside the box. Since I am a kid (from 6 years on) I have dealt with depression. Not diagnosed, but I wouldn't know how else to call it. And I know depression. Runs in the family (also treating depression with alcohol). Also, when introduced to new situations (e.g. going to school) I got major stomach aches. So bad, my mum had to take me to the hospital. Also as a toddler/kid I reacted very bad to change and had a strong bond with objects. I cried my eyes out fot weeks when we got a new garage door and when my sister lost her glove. I still remember that though I wasn't even in Kindergarden. When I was about 10-13, I couldn't be alone. When I was with friends I was happy, but as soon as they left, I was hit with loneliness and just this downfeeling. I also would reduce eating to a minimum. Fast forward to today (age 23) I am studying Biology and I feel my mental state is getting worse because of the stress. Again, if I am with friends I am the happy funny one, making them feel happy. And I am feeling happy. But 90% of the time as soon as I am alone- downfeeling, feeling alone, panic hits me, the feeling of not getting my studies done (you should be doing that now, studying this,...), failing in general, which ends with me sobbing on the floor, getting nothing done, feeling as a dissapointment and seeing no point in anything I do. Sometimes I cannot even go outside because I cannot handle being seen by people, I cannot go into blindly into new situations (needed half a year till I dared to print something at my university, took me one year to eat there 'cause I didn't know how to order the food there). And recently my mum told me, that I as a baby had an epileptic seisure and when they ran a MRT following that, the doc found out that the left half of my brain is abnormal (I think smaller). No follow ups on that.
I already am embarrassed for this wall of text. There are people (as my closest friends) who went through stuff way worse. But maybe someone experienced something similar? I looked at some psychotherapists near me, but don't know if it's worth it. Or let's say, if my problems are worth it.

120,"HELLOOOOOOO Fellow Redditors! I just wanted to say I am having a pretty decent day for once.   


If you don't know me, I just was diagnosed with Pyromania not too long ago, and I seem to oscillate between kinda sorta accepting it (and I feel like EVERYONE who sees me can see my secret) and outright denial. It has been a hard couple of weeks for me, and a very hard few months since this all started coming out.  


However, today, I am happier and I have found lots of joy from being outside in the sunshine. It is cloudy now and supposed to rain through tomorrow so I was extra grateful that this morning was sunny and cool. I saw the flowers at the local supermarket (mums this time of year) and I saw all the Halloween stuff out. I even have seen some Christmas stuff being put out at the local Wal-Mart! I got all excited for the upcoming holidays because our daughter will be coming in from college in Nov. and then Dec. :)   


Our 8 year old brought home library books (anyone remember the FROGGGYYYY! series of stories?) and I actually read one with him. It was most pleasant and brought back memories of our reading them to our eldest when she was a child. I even took pictures of each page and sent them over Messenger so she could read them. :D Those were her favie stories and she said it brought back fond memories of being a kid. She is 4 hours away from home but it was nice to connect with her again like when she was younger.   


I am rambling now, and I feel so unfocused and all over the darn place mentally today. I haven't even had many urges (to set fires) because my mind can't focus on one thing for very long today. It is just one of those days, I guess. I don't get so ""up"" very often (and it is weird because I just started my period and I am exhausted physically because of it--Sorry if TMI) but today was just fantastic. I hope this makes someone here smile. I try not to talk too much about myself (only if relevant to a post I am answering) but I just wanted to share my happy with the world! :)  


Have a great night, Reddit. I will be around if you want to chat. Got a long evening in front of me, but for once, I think I will be able to relax. Anxiety is at ZIPPO right now, Depression is nil, and the fire-setting behaviors/urges are quiet. :)

124,"So I guess background, the current tale, and then the question is the right format to go with here.

I was twelve when I had my first hallucination, fourteen when I first started therapy and baby's first extremely serious depression,  twenty one when I finally got the right diagnosis.  High school was in and out of the hospital in a revolving door thanks to a wrong diagnosis and the wrong meds that made me much, much worse.  By twenty five, I started speaking out on mental health advocacy issues.  So we're not talking that I'm uneducated on these sorts of issues. 

Last November, a friend of mine was hit by a drunk driver while crossing the street.  Concussion (TBI), broken clavicle, and severely sprained knee.  The bones have healed.  The concussion is healing slowly, but getting there.  The mind.... yeah.... not so much.

Prior to the accident she had pre existing issues with anxiety and depression and was/is on prozac.  Several years ago, there was a suicide attempt, for which she never received therapy or treatment.

The accident happened and her symptoms sky rocketed.  To the point where I have been regularly bringing up my concerns about her mental health.  She has ""attempted"" therapy.  By that I mean that there have been three appointments, all of which she walked in the door livid and refused to listen.

Last Wednesday, she messaged me at ten pm in the middle of a diabetic crisis.  She was saying that she would go to the emergency room in the morning.  I kept asking her if she had told her family, who she lives with, and she refused.  So I told her I would be there in fifteen minutes.  Got dressed, got in the car, and got her to urgent care.

There, during assessment,  she not only admitted to suicidal thoughts, but to having a plan.  There was no legal option but to place a hold on her.

And I was relieved.  Because I knew she was going to be safe there. 

For three days, she refused to speak to either me or her family.  She finally called back a bit ago.  The anger and denial is still raging.  

She's convinced that she can make demands of the staff and the hospital.  She's attempting to refuse treatment.  

""You got me to agree to this?"" ""No.  You flat out told the doctor you have a plan to kill yourself.  They had no other legal options but to hold you.""  She admitted that there is a court order on her being there.  And she is still attempting to refuse treatment and demand AMA release.  

""I was fine until November.""  Despite a previous psych med.  Despite a previous suicide attempt.  Despite a pre existing psychiatric history.

This one's really hard.  She's my friend.  What's more, I've been there.  I know she needs help.  I know she needs treatment.  I know that by her denial, she's getting worse.  I've seen it day by day and told her that.

And she's still fighting the idea that there's a problem.

So, when did you get that it was serious?  What did it take for you to take your mental health seriously?  

For me, it was the hospital.  I fight like hell to stay stable so that I never have to be in four point restraints again.  I don't know what it's going to be for her.  And I don't know what else to do except continually confront her denials.",24Sep2018,2
125,"Hi reddit,

More of a lurker than a poster, my life changed this year when I started having severe anxiety issues. Extreme work stress caused me to frequently panic, feel faint, disoriented, and disassociate from reality. Over the course of the last 7 months I've had severe ups and downs, and ended up being diagnosed with Severe Anxiety Disorder. 

I still have issues nowadays, but reddit has helped calm me down more than anything, and I'm much better off than at the peak of my health struggles. Not just helping me with coping, but I've read many stories from people that used to struggle with the disorder but have overcome it. That's been the single greatest thing, because when you're having an attack in the middle of the day, the biggest fear is that this is how the rest of my life is going to be.

However, there was an askreddit thread awhile back, I don't even remember what the original prompt was, but it was full of people who once had crippling anxiety and have since gotten better, and that's been the most uplifting thing, finding people to relate to and getting help has been the hardest part of this process, so I want to say thanks.",24Sep2018,3
