1,"Hi everyone. I have depression and one of the symptoms I experience is that I play video games compulsively. If I try to stop myself from playing video games, I get an aching sensation in my arms. It's fine if I'm doing something physical or I'm with other people but when I'm on my own I almost always need to play video games or else I get this very unpleasant sensation.

Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this and does anyone have any advice on overcoming this?",07Aug2018,1
2,"For the last few months, I’ve been doing some horrifically morbid thinking, and now I can’t seem to stop the trains of thought as they come. Mostly they’re thoughts on getting old, seeing the people around me age and die, and how time seems to be passing so quickly and I am completely unable to stop it. Another thought that absolutely terrifies me to my core is the thought that one day I will not exist, and that day could be any day at all. At first it was a thought that would keep me up for a half hour at night, but now the thoughts come during the day, sometimes without a trigger. I feel guilty when I don’t spend time with my family or friends, and I can’t stop thinking about the worst happening if I go away somewhere. The thoughts are now stopping me from going out, and I constantly worry about getting the worst phone call. I know it’s inevitable, I know it’s going to happen, and I’ve tried telling myself it’s no use to worry over it because I’m just wasting my time instead of just living, but that does not seem to be helping.

Part of me thinks this is just due to a lot of social isolation I’ve had recently- I’ve moved back home for the summer until uni starts again, and I’ve lost touch with all the friends I had in high school, most of who moved away to their unis anyway. I think it’s just my idle brain developing a bad habit, but I think somethings not right with my head. Has anyone had this kind of thinking before? Is there a name for it? And does anyone have any tips for just shutting my brain off so I can just live without these thoughts all the time? I have counselling set up already but it’s not until the end of the month and I feel like I’m already driving myself insane, I’m desperate for some peace in the meantime. 

Tldr- I have constant morbid thoughts about myself and my loved ones, anyone know how to switch em off before I go crazy?",07Aug2018,3
3,"My daughter is 8 years old,  rough start to her life,  her bio-mom was incredibly neglectful and suffered from mental health issues she refused to get help for.  My husband is military and due to massive amounts of time away from home he didn't see the neglect until she was 4. At that time he made changes,  bio-mom was out of the picture, but damage had been done.  My daughter has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and strong traits of conduct disorder. She is exceptionally manipulative,  violent,  stubborn, lacking empathy or regret,  and doesn't want to change.  She wants the world to accommodate her anger.  
She just spent a week in the children's psych unit for assault and prior homicidal threats. She treats all caregivers who ask any effort from her in this way after an exceptionally long honeymoon period (up to 2 months). While at the unit they spoke to her and us and explained that dad and I have been doing everything right but if she won't put in the work there is little they can do besides meds which help the hallucinations but not the anger and violence.  Then they spoke about residential care. My question is,  has anyone placed a child with similar problems in residential care, or has anyone experienced residential care themselves? Was it helpful/ harmful? We want to do our best to help her but if she's not willing to change any of her behaviors as of right now and she's creating an unsafe environment,  do we have any other options?

8,"Hey, so this is my first post on reddit ever. Going to be pretty vague on personal details here for now.

TL;DR I do too many things but feel like it's beneficial, also I can't talk to a therapist to fix it

A little background: I'm a college student who does a lot of things. Full time science major, have a part time job, but I also run 2 nonprofits, which are in a field that requires a lot of ""extra work"" as far as research, training, volunteer hours, and experience. I'm currently volunteering at 2 other nonprofits to help build skills for my main nonprofit, as we'd like to do expand into a few different fields and these fields require a LOT of intensive training. Combined for these 4 organizations I run and/or volunteer for, I add another 22-26 hours a week, and I'm about to add another 4-6 hours/week with one of the groups because I've been given an awesome opportunity.

Needless so say I'm pretty stressed out. But, the weird thing is that I can completely handle this (and more during most weeks) as long as I'm in a certain mood/state/personality? More and more lately I feel like I have separate personas--one is a person, who does things she wants to do and thinks about herself, and the other is basically a robot that just completes tasks and keeps moving. As long as nothing disrupts the ""robot,"" I can do *a lot*, like work the entire day and get barely any sleep, for weeks or occasionally months. But certain triggers, such as visiting with family or certain friends, makes the ""person"" come out again, and then I feel all the stress and am unstable for the next few weeks as I get depressed and have worse issues with anxiety and social anxiety.

Now, the logical response to this is ""that's not sustainable, you're dissociating yourself and eventually you'll break."" I know that, believe me. But I think if I can hold out on this schedule for the next few years or so, it will be so beneficial to everything I'm doing. I think it will be worth it, as I am so passionate about the nonprofit field I work in that I can force myself to do basically anything for it. I would die for it. I would honestly rather see the goals my nonprofit holds be completed and blossom than for me to live a life for myself. 

I guess I just don't see my own worth as important when compared to everything else? Which could definitely be a problem because it could make me less effective for the work, but a small part of me hopes that I can come back from this lifestyle when the organization ""succeeds"" and I'm ""content."" Honestly though I'm not sure I'll ever be content with anything though, I'll just always want another step. When I saw family for a few days, one of them asked what I did for fun. I was legitimately stunned and did not have an answer, except that ""my work is fun."" The thing is though, ""the person"" has things she does for fun, but I haven't indulged on those for a few months now because they gravely distract me from everything else.

I tried to talk to one of the university's therapists about this last semester and only made it through 2 sessions. I like to appear professional, mature, responsible, etc., especially because I've had to constantly prove myself in my field because of my age, and I just couldn't let the therapist into what I was actually thinking. The thought of it freaks me out a lot.

Any insight on if therapy is worth it for this, or how to get around not wanting to admit things to a therapist? The person inside of me just wants to be happy and content, but the robot just wants to get things done and this attitude seems like the best way to do it. Sorry for the long post, I'm still not quite sure what I'm going through and I don't even know if I really want to change.",07Aug2018,2

10,"For the past months, I've been feeling like a total wreck. My anxiety and depression would emerge and subside with nearly no balance. Sometimes I'd self medicate with caffeine, and other times just a good cry and validation would help.

My general anxiety disorder and bouts of depression have been with me since the end of middle school, and very recently it seems like they've come back full force. I weened off Lexapro with the permission of my then psychiatrist almost a year back now, which I am now realizing within the past 4 months or so has been a mistake. So just a month ago I've gone back on, new psychiatrist. I can feel my mood getting better by the day, and I've been able to pinpoint the stressors in my life, these stressors being

-Im attached to my best friend and am struggling to know if they like me or not
-Im afriaid my mental stability and attachments will get in the way of my studies
-I feel like I'm an uninteresting person and a failure for not doing enough to better myself
-I am scared of being alone
-I wasn't eating enough for fear of gaining weight back since I lost an immense amount of weight since last year (which I'm proud of!)

Now I've slowly been working on all of these, and the reintroduction of meds has helped, but I keep falling back into old habits. Anxiety builds when I haven't talked or interacted with my friends after awhile. I feel like if I don't interact with them every day they'll slowly drift away (this mainly has to do with my best friend) But Im slowly learning how to be comfortable being alone, without feeling lonely.

Over the past weeks I've been working really hard to be a more emotionally strong  person, learn how to distract myself, and just be present in the moment. I've been trying to disconnect from my phone, and try to knock into my silly brain that my friends are still there if I don't talk to them or interact with them over Facebook. I even went to the mall to buy myself some new clothes, which made me feel very free, and I was proud of myself. Im trying to get into reading books, just to help distract me and give me more options on things to do. I've just been trying to do things I'm not used to, to better myself.

But then I texted one of my friends asking if they wanted to go hiking, and they said yes. Then I realized my therapist appointment fell on the same day and I texted them saying we wouldn't have enough time to hole, but we could still hang out.

No response, and it's only been an hour but I honestly just broke down. I feel so fragile, that no matter how much I try I still get affected by these tiny things. I'm still very anxious about my best friend situation, and keep thinking she'll think I hate her if I don't talk to her for a day, and what if she feels the same way, what if she doesn't?  What if all my friends just slowly drift away and I'll  be alone? These thoughts the hiking friend situation just made me break down, and I just feel so weak and undeserving. I'm trying my best but I keep getting attacked by my own brain. I'm my own worst enemy. And what really gets me is I dealt with the same kind of situations in high school.

I thought I progressed since then, I thought I gained the strength to get through this, my emotions are telling me I haven't, and I just feel pretty hopeless right now.

 I've talked to my therapist about this, MANY TIMES, but I was wondering if anyone has any kind of advice for these situations.

tldr; I'm attached to my best friend, not talking to people scares me, my emotions feel unstable, and I feel like I'll never get my shit together.

Anyway, earlier I was talking to someone and I managed to spiral through about 10 different topics in the space of maybe 10-15 minutes and I was thinking about it and I realised I almost always do that. Like there are very few topics that don't make me go off on a tangent completely sub consciously. I find it really difficult to stay on topic and if I manage to then I'm not actually engaging in the conversation because all the tangents are going off in my head even though I haven't said them.

21,"Hey. I’m not healthy. I don’t know why but maybe I can get some insight from here.

I’m confused with myself and have been for 4 years. while writing this you’ll be able to notice with how I word things, so please bare with me.
I’m a guy, 19 years old and am wondering if this is a self-induced or a physical mental illness. Objective perspective while explaining, noting physical issues that may apply. *not based on self-diagnosed or researched  symptoms 

I have issues being in touch with my direct reality and am often in a hazy cluster of thoughts. I don’t have a personality and speak roughly 10 words a day which is extremely hard for me to conjure up, for my speech is flustered, disorganized and must have to repeat my mumbles ever word. I notice that I’m half-focused on the people around me and am viewing the world from what I expect their perspective is - I assume this is the haze and am able to temporarily lose the haze thinking back on how I used to be the center of my world, but always returns to the haze within minutes. 

I can catch myself in irrational thoughts directed to my interactions with everything, for examples; following any “passion” is silly and I’m truly an idiot, saying “I’d like to disappear because I’m an idiot.” When I notice that I’m doing this, I physically feel an alter in my perception and rationally think about what I was just doing to myself. When I see someone with a weird and incorrect to social standard, I’ll adopt it ex. My eyelid never drooped until I saw someone with such. My presumed diagnosis: anxiety? 

Now, there was no stroke or seizure that I recall on the onset of my confusions, but I have physical issues that need addressed. Left ankle constantly pops while walking, my left lip smiles more than my right in an awkward way, my left eyelid often droops and especially after consuming marijuana, I can’t get myself to eat more than 1.5 meals a day resulting being underweight, i think I’m still in puberty because my genitals are not developed to my age(or maybe so) and my nipples are gynecomastic (swelled), I grew up with massive migraines but stopped 6 years ago but occasional get them, i have acne, large nose, long face, oven enlarged veins, trouble focusing my eyes, forget to breath, extreme exhaustion daily and sleep more than I should, I’m pretty tall, my hands are nearly always shaky. ",07Aug2018,1
22,"I'm sure plenty here know the feeling or have had the same experience. Whether it's filing paperwork or taking orders and cooking burgers, I get to a point where I entirely freeze up and it feels like I'm going to stroke out or my hair is going to fall out or something. It feels like someone is reaching in and ***grabbing the butterflies in my chest***. It progresses to the point of crisis and it has led to me legitimately running away across country *twice*  I cannot emphasize enough how solid of a brick wall this is for me, that I can't just 'buck up and push through it' or 'get over it'.  


I didn't even know until today that I have severe anxiety, or panic attacks. I thought it was just simple, unmanageable ADHD and there was nothing that I could do. I was officially diagnosed with the ADHD from a very early age and put through the whole cycle of meds and treatments for years, from multitudes of psychiatrists and therapists, with nothing helping, but actually quite the opposite. Finally the best results were achieved after going *off* all treatments and meds at the age of around 13 or 14, though 'best results' is still an immovable inability to function, just without reactions to medications added on top of it.  


I thought it was normal for people to be constantly disappointed in me, I thought they were right and I was just some societal nuisance. I thought it was normal to be 'fixed' and that the reason the process wasn't working was because of something I did wrong. I deserved to be able to not hold down a job or function in large social situations, because, according to others, that's what I was doing to myself. To most of the people in my life, it's beyond reason to think that some others may not be able to live up to simple, practical expectations that average people do without thinking every day. And any help for people with these kinds of problems is either trial and error medication and other treatments, or someone telling them ""Just deal with it""  


I'm at a loss of where to find actual, legitimate help for any of this, support hotlines and training programs don't even touch at the problem and end with the same results every time, regardless of how many people share their mentality of ""If it's not working you're the problem"" or ""get over it, push through it"". Those can be contributors to the problem, and just perpetuate it  


Are there actually any resources that aren't cover-ups for the problems or endless cycles of trial and error?..",07Aug2018,10

I think, because I was raised in a military family, I was always able to blame the Army for moving away, but for the first time, this was my own decision. I had several breakdowns on the drive over, and at one point, I called my mom to tell her I just wanted to turn around and come home (mind you, this was a 30-hour drive).

27,"Success in treating people with narcissistic personality disorder is challenging. There are no treatments for Narcissistic Personality Disorder that have been systematically or empirically investigated (Caligor, Levy, &amp; Yeomans, 2015).  Cluster B personalities in particular have a strong sense of entitlement and defensiveness. These conditions make any type of therapy difficult (Caligor et al. 2015). There is also a wide spectrum of high functioning people with narcissistic personality disorder, as well as low functioning people. NPD clients are somewhere on the narcissism spectrum.

There has been success in treating Narcissistic Personality Disorder with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  The focus of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy would be to overcome destructive beliefs while looking for new strategies.  Other employable strategies would include listening, problem solving and information giving(“Narcissistic personality disorder, or narcissism is a pattern of feeling very self-important, needing admiration from others, and having little feeling for others,” 2013)

Along with therapy there are instances where medication is also helpful. Normally a person who is being treated for NPD may be treated with an SSRI to diminish symptoms of depression, and anxiety. This is often done during periods of extreme stress or distress (“Narcissistic personality disorder, or narcissism is a pattern of feeling very self-important, needing admiration from others, and having little feeling for others.”). Symptom reduction would be the reason medication would be utilized with NPD clients.

Group therapy is also an option for NPD. This gives them a chance to problem solve with others, and work on one-on-one relationships (Darton,2013). This could also include social problem-solving therapy. The aim of this therapy would be to build confidence and reduce impulsive behaviors. This is done by teaching the patients to stop and think about your behavior (Darton,2013).

Although there is limited  success in treating Narcissistic Personality Disorder, there are effective therapies. This is also an area that needs more exploration in the future.

Just the simplest things give me a pounding heart or sweaty palms, for example: grabbing a snack from the pantry, tying the laces on my shoes because i cant pull them on, buying a different sort of clothing style than i usually wear (heck, any sort of self expression really!) cleaning my glasses in public, excusing myself to use the restroom, or using my phone in public.

Over that time  period I feel like I have slowly become less and less human. My girlfriend says that talking to me is like taking to a brick wall. I can't think quickly or critically anymore. I can't focus and I can't remember anything short term. I can't commit anything to long term memory. most of the time when I am talking to someone I trip over my words and often can't find the words I am looking for. I also take a long time to think of a response. I'm not feeling particularly anxious while this is happening. I find myself getting frustrated because talking to people is difficult because I can barely complete a thought, anything requiring the slightest bit of strategy completely escapes me, and I can barely read anything, even if I enjoy it, because I trail off after a few words. I am constantly exhausted to the point where I can't stay awake during the day. I have been through blood test after blood test checking for everything from anemia to hyper or hypo thyroidism. No deficiencies. No issues. Testosterone levels are fine also. I work a full time job in IT that suffers at times because I have hard time learning new things. I am only 26 and am normally pretty active and try to eat well. I tend to feel worse with higher doses of medication. I have also taken just about everything there is to take over the last 12 years.

Anyway, I'm really good at picking up on social cues and understanding a persons weaknesses really early on. I am usually able to get someone to do whatever I want (within reason of course) just by implanting ideas into their head. Basically, I have a thought but I put on the role of someone who is very shy and anxious to make the other person think they have an advantage over me since I seem so *fragile*. So I have an idea and I don't wanna be upfront about it because I don't wanna ruin the illusion so I slowly implement the idea into the persons head through conversation and eventually they initiate the idea making them seem in control but the whole time I'm just like 😏😏. 

Also, I don't know how to empathize at all. I only have a general idea of what it is so after I analyze my social cues I just kinda copy and paste what I know the person wants to hear with a little bit of pulling of strings here and there to get a certain outcome from a situation. 

I don't know when this started, but I always do it whether I'm aware of it or not. I'm really good at manipulating my mom and my friends. I don't see why it's bad, I also don't have any form of boundaries at all, but I understand that other people have this wall of comfort that they hide behind so my little anxious act really comes in handy to help people feel more comfortable with me. I don't know what this means or how to even bring this up to other people or even if I should but I thought that I would share this as most people I know seem completely oblivious to my actions and I didn't know if it was an issue that I should have someone look in to.

34,"Hello. A brief about me, I'm 28 and married to the most wonderful girl on the planet. Unfortunately due to a very tough childhood and upbringing she has been diagnosed with several mental disorders: OCD, BPD, PTSD, to name a few. Every month or two she has very extreme episodes, and after three years of knowing each other I'm still trying very hard to learn how to manage these situations as best as possible. 

The nature of the situation is always that it feels that I can do no right. I'm either being overbearing and providing no space, or I don't care and am fine with her feeling the way she is if I give too much space. Often, these situations will last all night, until at least 5am. 

I'm here not asking for support. I'm in therapy myself. In three years of knowing this wonderful person I have learned a lot about myself and have learned to be strong in these situations. I'm looking for any helpful tips or advice that any of you may have who have been through depressive and/or manic episodes or have helped somebody with them. What is the best way to diffuse the situation? What is the best way to slow things down?  I love my wife very much and am greatly pained to see her in these types situations. Thank you all.

37,This is the 5th time in my life I’ve been been put on hold from a suicide prevention hotline. Let alone the times the receiver was rude. I’m lucky that I have other outlets but some people don’t. And being put on hold during a suicide hotline call makes the cake. This happened to me two years ago and I ended up in the hospital. I wished things would’ve changed with their services and I was wrong. These rejections drive these negative feelings and it’s very disappointing they haven’t found an alternative ,07Aug2018,6
38,"I don't know how to start this because I feel like I have too many problems. 

I'm currently at my childhood home not sleeping because I'm spending the next two days with my dad. We found out his liver is failing and he needs a transplant. This is the second time he's had issues and didn't stop drinking the first time. I know alcoholism is a disease but I don't understand why you would kill yourself by drinking. 

Up until my parents divorce he was a really good dad. My theory is because he had a sparring partner. Then he met my current stepmom and they are fire and fire. They we're really awful to my sister. My stepmom yelled at her for sitting on their spot on the couch which turns into a screaming match and then she left and my dad tried to run her off the road to get her to stop. We've confronted him about this but he denies it. Anything we say he's done wrong, he denies and reflects how we're bad kids and don't love him. It's been a really long battle. She and my other brother have stopped communicating with him. And my older brother and I decided we can accept him as he is and have a surface relationship because we just need that. 

Now sitting here, reading askreddit I don't know why I feel like I need help. Coming home has the anxiety of my dad and it also has the pressure to see everyone and there's a lot of family/friends to see. I always feel like I'm letting people down which is why I stopped making plans because I just never know what's going to happen. But I was reading the thread that asked ""how do you know if someone doesn't love you anymore?"". Everyone was saying if they stop contacting you and making an effort. My sister told me that one of my friends from college is upset with me and she said you don't contact them you don't care. I don't feel like that's true. I feel the tension of something  and I'm scare to confront them. I love them very much. 

I know all my stuff is connected. I moved far away to run from all of my family and friend issues. I know I should go to alanon and therapy but the thought makes me want to throw up. I don't know why I'm so scared. I know it will help. 

I'm sorry this is so long. Part of me just wanted to scream this into the ether. ",07Aug2018,5
39,"My mother has been suffering from mental illness for most of my life; ever since I was around 10. Shes had a few diagnoses in the past. First Bipolar, then Schizoaffective disorder, and then Schizophrenia with depression.

This recent ""episode"" has been reoccurring for the past 6 years. I left to dorm in college, and within the first month my mom relapsed, no doubt that me leaving along with a number of other stressors contributed to her relapse. Dealing with this has been much more difficult than during the years going through public school, at least with that there was a pattern of relapsing every 2 years, getting hospitalized, and then coming back improved. These past 6 years have had little change. It seems like I only send her to the hospital to get a breath for a moment, not for her to get better.

The emotional pain that I feel is like being dragged on concrete.

I love my mom, and growing up, I was pretty much a momma's boy, and I was her only child, so the bond we had was strong and I really enjoyed the positive times we've had. Now unfortunately the relationship is strained, mainly on the impact it has on my ability to succeed so that in the future after my education, I can create a better life for both of us.

Now to the reason of my post. My mom has disability income, which pays the rent and bills, but she needs way more help than I can give her, and both of our well-beings are deteriorating as time goes on.  If I had the option to leave, i have zero confidence in her ability to take care of herself, she won't go outside to get anything, food or otherwise. In the past she has taken long aimless walks (one time she walked for 20 hours without her phone and I had no idea where she was) so I also have that to consider. The option that I'm considering is to use her income to pay for assisted living, or a nursing home. The problem is that I don't know where I will live. My nearby family members can't take me in for their reasons. I could ask friends, or other people I know, but them taking me in isn't guaranteed. Then there still is the issue of how I'd get around, paying for living there, food etc. I just don't know.

Right now, mentally, I feel ok, I'm not in a panic. But this seems like the best option for her. I really don't know how long the current situation will keep up and when that collapses there are going to be two people that can't take care of themselves or hold jobs from mental illness.",07Aug2018,7

So he took me out in the hallway in the room across which was like a teacher's lounge. He talked to me about his personal experience with depression for 1 hr and it was odd because he was a teacher that a lot of people didn't like and it really meant a lot to me that he took the time to talk to me. He put class on hold. At the end of my junior year I got committed to a mental health institution and my teachers kept my grades the way they were and I didn't have to take my final exams.

54,"I’m a 17F living in the United States and I’m worried about going back to school.
A little backstory first:
I had to leave school back in January due to very severe mental health issues including but not limited to anxiety, psychosis, depression and other disorders. Before then, school was very hard for me, I would have a couple panic attacks a day and spend most of my time crying in the nurse’s office. There would also be people in the walls telling me to do bad things and hurting me when I refused to do said things. It was a shit show in all honesty. My grades suffered, which caused more anxiety. So after a two month medical leave of absence, I then moved to a charter school, which the same problems occurred mentally, but I didn’t really have to worry about the school bit. It was still too much, so I left the school and went into treatment. I’ve since been much better, but it’s time now to go back to public school to finish out the rest of high school.
I’m extremely worried about what might happen when I go back. Whether I’ll start having bad panic attacks again or the people in the walls will come back and the like. I’m needing some support and advice and I’m pretty sure this is the right sub for it, correct me if I’m wrong. Sorry for the weird wording and phrasing",07Aug2018,2

We went through a bit of a rough patch several months ago and honestly neither of us really know why or what happened. I think it's because I went through a bit of a depression for a few months which made the relationship worse, which then made my mood worse. It was a bad cycle... But I was on birth control and so I decided to go off because I suspected that that was why I felt so depressed.

So I've been off the pill for I think 7 or 8 months now. I've been fine the whole time. However, for the past week or so I've been feeling really down for some reason. At first I thought it was because of my period, but then it came and went and I'm still experiencing mood swings. One minute I'm crying, the next I realize it doesn't even matter and I'm over it. I'm scared that something is wrong with me... I don't know if it's a mental illness or if I'm just overthinking the whole thing and psyching myself out.

First, I'd like to know if what I'm experiencing is something normal to experience as a teenager or if it's something else.

61,"I'm a 13 year old person and almost every student my age and up in my school have mental problems. Depression and anxiety, generally. All of their struggles are ignored, including mine. Our parents dismiss it as puberty, deny it's existence and all things in between. Thankfully I have a very open-minded sister, but not everyone has someone like that. I try to be as empathetic towards people like me, but there are asshole-ish depressed people out there too, who don't think anyone outside of them even matters. I tried.    Whatever happens to them next isn't my fault.   
Before I inevitably realized that it wasn't the best course of action, I used to vent to my mom about such things. This asshole-ish depressed person used to be a pretend-friend of mine (i felt bad for him and most people despise him to this day) and he ended up finding out I was just pretending to get along with him. We actually used to be friends, but he ended up developing strange behavior, especially towards the ""generic white girls"" of our class. Calling them weird things and making very deep hitting insults. He used to tell me how he wants to die. Of course, I asked him if he ever went to a therapist. He said no snd that he thinks they're useless, because they just talk to you. I told him that's not all there is to it and that he should take his mental health seriously. Now, where was I? So he ended up finding out through some accidentally included texts in a screenshot that I didn't like him all that much (looking back, it might not have been accidental, since the friend that sent it to him really hated that I hung out with him). He seemed angry and then sad and it made me forget why I didn't like him (long story short: he mistreated me a lot and thought of me as nothing but an object/test subject to act weird to). So I told my mom how bad I felt about betraying him. I told her that he had no other friends and I was worried. She said some actual good things like I should apologise, but I just lost my shit when she said that he probably isn't depresed and I'm not his only friend. Two things he literally told me. Since I was already in the middle of an anxiety attack, I ended up slamming my door and just crying there for an hour or two. When I went out she said she was very disappointed in me for slamming a door and I tried to say that she offended me with what she said, but the word I used (in hungarian) doesn't have a very clear definition so I think I ended up offending her, I tried to apologize, but she said that I'm a cynical ungreateful child and she really messed up something when she was trying to raise me.   
So, having enough, I went to jump down the local bridge. I was pretty much at my breaking point the whole month and had enough. I wasn't able to do it. Too many people and it was still day outside. I ended up calling a friend and we talked and all that.  
Me and my mom ended up even again, but I don't think she changed her opinion about me. To her, I'm still a broken dysfunctional child.  
My father on the other hand, seems to wish that I'd depend more on him, but the amount of weird fetish-seeming things he does to people makes me not very comfortable with that. As for my sister, I just can't look at things the way she does. I know used to be able to from an old diary entry I found, where I was still someone who wanted to live even if my mind was breaking into a million pieces while I tried. I can't seem to go back to that person anymore. I don't even eat, really. I feel sick after eating even a small snack. Every second thought I have is just ""I want to die I want to die I want to die I want to die..."" . I'm approaching the endgame. I don't mind anymore. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain. I see myself becoming the type of adult I hate already. Indifferent about the world and earthly matters, chasing an ideal life I will never have. Lining up convenient excuses to get away from things I had thought I wanted. I hate this world and how it works. I hate how I'm growing indifferent about it. I hate that I'm powerless. I hate that there are small things I like that keep me holding on.

Opinion on specific points are very much welcome too, e.g. on the comparison between people with mental health issues vs sexual harassment victims. 

A bit of context: we live in a conservative, third-world Catholic country where mental health issues are taboo and stigmatized. A Mental Health Act was only passed into law less than 2 months ago, and in a population of 100 million, there are presently only 700 psychiatrists and a thousand psychiatric nurses (dear lord, I wish I was joking), mental illness is not covered by HMOs: these are indicative of how mental illness is generally perceived in my country.

D:

There has been an influx of posts about depression on my feed. A lot people are claiming to be depressed and a lot of them are pointing that happiness or feeling happy will solve their depression. I don't know if they really understand what depression is or they just don't know the right words to describe how they feel and what they need. But happiness is not always the solution for depression, it rarely is.

I'm not an expert, but most of this people claiming to be depressed are actually sad or grieving than depressed. While grieving and depression can be similar in a lot of ways they are still different. Grief is a normal reaction to loss or an extreme life altering event. But grief can also lead to depression. If you think you're really depressed, please seek professional help. We now have the Mental Health Act which makes these services more available to everyone.

I won't hold posting about how you feel on Facebook against you, especially if you're really feeling shitty and that's the only way you can really connect with other people right now. I believe that communicating even with Facebook status is still better than no communication at all. I don't subscribe to what a lot of people saying that personal problems requires personal solution and other similar point of view. Though I agree that this is not the ideal way of doing things, but reaching out on Facebook is still better than keeping it all in and waiting for all those pent up emotion get you someday. I am actually thankful that people can communicate faster because of social media. What I'm against is how a lot of people I know are spreading misconceptions about depression, you are spreading false information.

It is not bad to be depressed, but it is different when you claim you are depressed because you passed some online depression checklist/quiz, you are exhibiting same symptoms you see on Social Media posts/memes. If you think you're depressed, educated yourself about it. 

It is not some status symbol or fad that you have to belong in. It is a high time because people are more aware about mental health, that we have the Mental Health Act, but you're tainting what it is all about by what you are doing. Depression is not something you use to get more attention. I cannot be more assertive here.

M:

And you know for a fact that those people saying they're depressed are not really depressed because? You know they're just looking for attention and using the label as a status symbol, how? I'd like to be enlightened.

D:

I never claimed that I know those things. I said that if they really think that they are they should seek help and educate themselves about it.

M:

""A lot people are claiming to be depressed""

""most of this people claiming to be depressed are actually sad or grieving than depressed. ""

""a lot of people I know are spreading misconceptions about depression""

""It is not some status symbol or fad that you have to belong in.""

Dude, your whole post essentially reads: most of you people who are claiming to be depressed actually aren't, go educate your ignorant selves. It's disingenuous and a cop-out to claim that you weren't really ""sure"" about the premise your whole post is built upon. Why this proselytizing post then, if you didn't make an assumption?

I'm sure there are those misguided souls who aren't really depressed. But I couldn't for the life of me in good conscience assume people are lying about their mental state or are uneducated just because what they say doesn't fit my idea of how depression is supposed to look like. There are more productive ways of addressing the gap in the public's mental health awareness than invalidating other people's experiences, experiences we as outside observers have no way (no right even) to evaluate and judge.

D:

This is what I said: ""A lot people are claiming to be depressed and a lot of them are pointing that happiness or feeling happy will solve their depression.""

That is not an assumption that they are not really depressed, I am just saying that happiness is rarely the solution for depression.

""I'm not an expert, but most of this people claiming to be depressed are actually sad or grieving than depressed.""

That is not saying that they are depressed. I am saying that the two have very similar symptoms and very often confused with one another that is why seeking professional help is important. 

""It is not some status symbol or fad that you have to belong in.""

As you've said, there are some misguided souls. Other people are getting misinformed about depression because some people claiming to be are misrepresenting it.

I didn't claim that I am not sure what I'm posting about. This post is not a claim that people are lying about depression nor I think that they are lying. I am saying that people shouldn't use depression to gain attention. I am saying that people should not rely on online quizzes, blogs, Facebook posts to diagnose themselves as most of these things because depression is not always diagnosed by some checklist you see online. Yes, it can inform a person about it but it shouldn't stop there. People should seek professional help and educate themselves about it. Because having the wrong diagnosis is very dangerous, not only to oneself but also to others. This is more dangerous when you do this to get attention and people actually believe that you are one. It may seem harmless for some but I've met a lot of people who have the wrong idea of what depression just because they have this one friend who claims to be depressed or with other mental disorder.

I am not invalidating anyone's experience. People need to know the difference between depression and grief or sadness. And one way to know is by seeking professional help. You can't just throw around depression like that. It's a serious thing, and if we want people to really accept it as an illness then we should not use it lightly.

M:

I get your point that people in general need to be more aware, more educated. There is a difference between clinical depression and just being a little sad. Nobody can argue that. You know where I stand in this. Let's set that aside. My issue really is the process how you got to those assumptions: you say you see people post about being depressed. My original question stands, how do you know those aren't valid, anyway? 

When you say people are ""claiming to be depressed"", that is already a value judgement on the truthfulness of their words; it matter less what comes after. And you repeat this type of questioning throughout your post. 

Just imagine saying ""people claiming to be sexually harassed..."" about people posting about being sexually harassed and see how that goes down. If this is something I need to explain to you, then I don't see hope for a proper discourse. 

On invalidation. In my eyes, and by any reasonable interpretation of this post, yes you are invalidating. Just because you don't intend to, doesn't mean you aren't. You saw posts that were questionable to you, you cast aspersions on them, and that triggered this post right? 

You can at least admit that you made assumptions. Sure you're not claiming you are absolutely sure, but the fact that this post exists means you cast judgement on them. You doubted them and their stories. That would be the intellectually honest thing to do. I wouldn't even argue about that; I just wanted to understand your thought process from my original question. What exasperates me is the kind of rationalizing you're doing by dancing around your own words.

D:

No, I don't want people to know the difference between clinical depression and being a little sad. I think that's one of the reason why people can't differentiate depression and sadness. Because we differentiate it to ""being a little sad"". It's not just about magnitude. People should understand that sadness and grief can feel a lot like depression. You can feel suicidal when you are grieving but still you are not depressed. When we call it ""being a little sad"", then you give a sense of exclusivity to depression. That if you don't reach a certain depth, then it's not depression. It feels somewhat condescending to compare it like that. 

The argument about claiming sexual harassment, I believe, is an unfair comparison. I can also say that it's the same as a person claiming other things. There's no other way to describe the people I am referring to as they are really claiming to be depressed. And let's face it, there are also people claiming to be sexually harassed, when in fact they weren't. The responsible thing to do is to confirm the truthfulness of the claim, just believing them outright is reckless and can ruin other lives. This is not invalidation, this is wanting to prove a something before doing any other further action.

Saying they are claiming is not the same as saying it did not happen or that is not the case. I didn't say that unless you are diagnosed, you are not depressed. What I said is that it's bad to claim you have depression just because you passed some online quiz. I didn't say that they are not depressed. I said that you need to seek help and be educated about it if they really feel they are.

Your original question was about me knowing for a fact that they are not really depressed and that they are just doing it to seek attention. I didn't generalize that they are doing it to seek attention. What I said that don't do it to get attention. I also didn't claim that I know for a fact that they are not depressed. That's why I used the word claim. Yes, it questions the truthfulness of their statement but it's not the same as saying that they are not true. I have my reasons to doubt them, but that doesn't equate to saying that they are lying.

I am not casting judgment on anyone. I am not invalidating anyone. People need to know the difference. People also need to know that what they are doing is reckless and potentially dangerous.

M:

""And let's face it, there are also people claiming to be sexually harassed, when in fact they weren't. The responsible thing to do is to confirm the truthfulness of the claim, just believing them outright is reckless and can ruin other lives.""

""Yes, it questions the truthfulness of their statement but it's not the same as saying that they are not true.""

I think this is the essence of the argument. It shows the gist of your thought process, which is so much clearer to me now. I won't even refute the disingenuous way you twisted the meaning of my words and retcon your original statements. I won't even address the tone-deafness of you saying people should go get seek professional help and how the Mental Health Act makes those ""services more available to everyone"".

You're not casting judgement, but you're also saying people are doing something reckless and potentially dangerous? 

You're not saying they're lying, just questioning if their statement is true? 

Whether your behavior invalidates other people or not is not for you to decide. Whether you intend something or not does not make the effect of your actions on others any less real. I am telling you something important.

A comparison as to how sexual harassment victims are invalidated and doubted is so on point in showing why your post was iffy. If only there were people with more energy than I do who can point out to you why those two statements above are hugely problematic in light of your original post. Feminists and mental health advocates, anyone? Such a shame because we're actually on the same side (yes to more awareness and education!), but I think I have to throw in the towel for this one.

D:

I'm not twisting the definition of your words. If you believe that what I'm doing is invalidating other people then we'll just have to agree to disagree on that. I am merely explaining my words here.

Validating something that isn't true is one of the worst forms of invalidation. Not only to the who who's not telling the truth but also to the one affected by the statement. Honestly, no matter how many feminist who will disagree with me on that, that value will not change. I will never label a person a sexual offender, just because someone claimed it. It's a person's reputation on the line, it's a person's life. It's unfortunate that these kind of things happen and I believe that people who did something wrong should be made responsible, but it's more unfortunate if we make a person suffer for a false accusation. I think people should stop trying to see questioning a claim as an antagonization.

I don't know why saying people with depression need professional help is something bad. I doesn't mean that you won't help a person in need unless they seek professional help. I'm saying that seeking professional help will help them understand what's wrong compared to reading it on Facebook. And a lot of people need that education.

No, I was not giving judgment to anyone. I am reminding people that it is reckless and dangerous to do what was discussed. I am not judging anyone, I am asking them to stop.

M:

Uggh. Last post to address the strawman. The comparison with sexual harassment is about doubting the victim's story, period, not making false accusations.

If your impulse towards someone opening up about their mental health issues or someone telling you they were sexually assaulted is to question if they're possibly lying, then looks like you have way bigger issues than simply wanting to educate the public. 

Seeking professional help is good. Always. I said your way is tone deaf bec: ""let them eat cake"". Shaking my damn head, I'm the bigger fool for engaging here. I fully regret this hopeless exchange.

D:

You're twisting what I'm saying. You're working on the assumption that the first thing I will do is doubt them or assume that they are lying. Checking the veracity of their claim can be about asking about the details. Asking things like what happened, how it happened. Or for the case of depression, ask them what they are feeling. Let me remind you that my original post is not about what I think to every case of people opening up, or depression posts on Facebook. I am talking about people spreading misconceptions because they are not that well-informed about the topic, depressed or not.

As I've already said, saying that claiming depression and claiming sexual harassment is an unfair comparison. It's hard to equate the two. Especially with how people react with each issue. The comparison with sexual harassment is not just about doubting the victim's story, because from the very beginning it is in the discourse that there are people falsely claiming they are depressed. And again, stop assuming that I am assuming that they are lying. They have to present proof or evidence to support their claim, but that doesn't mean that I think they are lying unless proven otherwise. We cannot just say that the suspect is guilty without any evidence to support the claim. This is regardless of the truthfulness of the accusation. If you think I somehow distorted your argument, I didn't. The two are uneven and cannot be classified as the same.

From claiming that I am invalidating people to assuming that I am assuming people are lying to assuming I don't care about people just because I used the word claim. I think that's excessive political correctness. Anyway, if you think you're a fool for engaging then I can't really do anything about that. I don't engage in arguments, debates, and discourse to change the mind of the other person. There's always something to learn, even for the audience. So thank you for the discussion, it's obvious that we have different views. Let's just agree to disagree.",07Aug2018,1

67,"Okay so I’ll give a small amount of context before I go into it. Last week during most of the weekend I smoked weed and it’s still a fairly new thing for me. The last time I did it something strange happened the next day. During a time I expected to be sober I had some weird occurrences where I’d forget that I walked into a room (due to a lack of paying attention I’m assuming). Not even just that but just simple things like I’d be laying on a couch and be like “I should get up to get a drink” and once I get up I’d realize like 2 seconds later I’ve been standing up and haven’t even noticed myself going from laying down to standing up. 

I thought it’d go away assuming it was leftover effects of the weed but its been 2 days now and its still happening and I’m worried.

Getting into trouble into school my grandfather starting saying there must be something wrong with me. Eveing when as far as getting a cop to sit down whit me. And explaining to me what a criminal record is. And that what im going to end up with.

Why im scared once I get attached I wont be alble to detach myself. My last realonship was 3 months long. Tolk me 3 years too fully get over it. I have no trust for people what so ever. Eveing friends useally just used me. As when I do make friend ill do just about anything for a friend. And people take advantage of that. Cant sit in one apot for more then 6 month always moving from place to place. I get heavly depressed and end up on drugs. Last year I evening when as far as tying to od on meth. Didn’t work….. And family but into every aspect of my life that im tying to get them to but out but they wont fuck off. My nother friend yold her few weeks ago she need to but beford I cut her out. Her anwserd was that they raised me in a way so that no matter what I always need them. Then turn around and tell me I need to get my shit together cause they wont always be here. That pretty contradicting. People said I need to learn to give emotinal support. How do you do that? What dose that eveing mean. I don’t know. All I know is im alone im gonna die alone and im always gonna be homeless and instable. Because I was rasied in a unstable home to be unstable.

Im thing more and more about suiside. I whise I could cut myself but then that will leace mark for other to see. And I don’t want people to see those and ask me question I don’t want to anwserd.  So indead I do speed. Cause speed fix my socail anxity and trow me into a manic phases. But then you come down and your eveing nore depressed then ever. A few weel ago the phycritrst at my local hospital said it seem like I might have a underlined persinality disorder. But I havent heard from them againg im still waiting for a fowwled up appoiments. Idk maybe he fucking lyed. 

Im just so fed up of this life. Wrost part is their a lot of stuff missing from this story. Like the 2 suiside attempts I seen when I was a teen. How when me ans my ex broke up she said she never had felling for me. And only got with me cause she felt bad. And sex felt like she was being rape……….
Or how in the last 6 years ive spend at least 4 homeless in some way or form. Or how ive been in the phycward 5 times in my aldult life to be told im making up bipolar systom and need to stop pretending. It just fell like it never gonna stop. And when dose get better. It get better for it to fall apart fastenr then it came together just so I can find myself in evening worst spot. I fell like their only one way out and that my family and everybody around be better off without me.  Actually I know this my grandfather remind me this everyday. Eveing give me suggestion on how to go about killing myself…….

And im not suffering from stress either. Rarely had it.

72,"A little bit of background before I explain what’s been going on:
- I graduated high school a couple months ago, and I will be attending college next month. 
- I have been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety for five years (I have been over all consistent in taking my medication this summer)

I have been experiencing sudden bouts of depression and anxiety since the last couple weeks of high school, around late May, characterized by sudden anxiety attacks, crying, and hopelessness. I first realized I was pushing my friends away just a few weeks ago in the middle of July. This is something that has genuinely never happened before in my life. 

Friends, and people in general, have always played a very important role in my life, and even in the hardest, darkest times of my life, I’ve always known I could rely on my friends to be there for me, and I would be there for them. I would undoubtedly isolate myself, but I’ve never been one to shut my friends out. Although I would often think about it, it was never something I could actually do, as I have always “cared too much” to leave anyone behind, even if I just wanted to be alone. I’ve always been a feeling person. I love with all that I am, but for some reason, in the middle of July, it feels as though that changed. 

In general my emotions have been hard to predict and process nowadays, as they seem to be more sporadic than ever. 
Generally speaking, I always say I’m fine because for the most part, I’m calm and a productive member of society.
But the bouts have been getting more frequent and intense. It’s scary because lately I feel as though I am two people. I feel that way because the “fine” version of me disassociates with the anxious, depressed version of me, which I think is new for me, although nowadays I really don’t know. I write to cope, and there are entries in my journal, as well as random pages of paper, where I have written during the moments I completely spiral out of control, saying very depressing things I remember writing, but don’t remember actually feeling. 

I have a small group of friends, and each of them I care so much for. I worry that what’s going on with me is affecting my friendships. I’ve done my best to communicate that I’m going through something, and they have always understood, as each of them to some extent, can relate. And that’s the thing- all my friends are going through something. Everyone is going through something. I don’t feel like whatever I’m going through should be an excuse to not feel like picking up the phone and not being there for someone I care about. I feel so selfish. I have a friend who also struggles with mental health, even more so because of his environment at home. I want to be there for him when he’s struggling, and I always have been, but recently I just don’t feel like it, and I feel like a horrible friend because of that. I feel like he has it so much worse than me, yet he would drop everything for any of his friends, no matter how bad of a place he is in. Lately, I don’t feel like I’m doing the same for him, and I worry he takes it personally. 

Also, I have recently made a new friend who will be attending the same college as me who I actually connect with really well. She lives in a different state, but when she was here for orientation, we met up since I live half an hour from our school. I opened up to her a lot when we met, and she did the same. It went so well. I couldn’t believe how well it went. But FaceTiming her the next night, I felt like I was building a wall. I could see how much she liked talking to me, and she even said it. I like talking to her to, in fact, but the more she cares about me, the more bricks I add to the wall. 

In all my experience with mental illness, I have never experienced this, and it seems to be getting worse. Not only am I shutting out people who have always been close to me, I am shutting out people I could be close with.

75,"I will try to limit details in case my SO by chance comes across this post. 

My SO, I will call him Bob, and I have been dating for a long time now. Ever since we have known each other he has been a really nice guy and always comes across as a great and happy guy, even to this day. Bob's best friend died about 7 years ago at the age of 21. The death was sudden and a complete accident. Ever since then I believe Bob has never viewed life the same way, understandably. Bob's compassion for those who die is non existent and he has a hard time showing any empathy towards people who mourn the death of a loved one, especially if they were older when they passed away. Because I know Bob is like this, I try to avoid conversations with Bob where I am voicing my compassion towards people who have passed around me, since he will just dismiss my feelings and make me feel bad for feeling sad that someone older than 25 died. 

After about two years of dating Bob, I noticed him saying things under his breathe such as ""I wish I were dead"" or ""I could just die"". The first time I heard him say something like that I asked him why he would say that and he would respond by saying ""I don't know, I just feel that way"". He would tell me that he would never hurt himself or try to kill himself because he knows it would hurt too many people including myself, but he just doesn't understand what the point of living is, since his parents were ultimately the ones who chose to bring him into this world. Listening to the love of my life say this hurts so much, especially the first time we talked about it. I cried and felt a sharp pain in my stomach and my heart knowing this about him. 

Fast forward to now (about a year and a half later), and a friend/co worker (we will call him Tony) of mine asks me yesterday if Bob is okay, because Bob told Tony he is depressed last week. Tony is not someone Bob would normally say anything personal to, so I asked Bob if he told Tony he was depressed, and Bob said yes. I asked Bob why he would tell Tony that because now Tony is very concerned and is asking me a ton of personal questions at work and Bob said he told Tony because that is how he was feeling. I thought Bob might have brought it up because he has been eager to quit his job that he lost all passion for and since we all work in the same facility maybe it was convenient to bring it up to Tony. But Bob told me last night that it isn't just work that he is depressed about but that he is always depressed and it is nothing new. He then brought up his feelings about living and how he does not understand the point of living and that he is okay to die but would never kill himself. Normally I would be very emotional but because I have heard him say these things before I was able to control my emotions and just listen. He continued with saying he has done everything he has wanted to do with his life and just does not understand why he needs to be alive any longer since he has already done everything he wanted to do. I asked him what it was that he wanted to do that he has already fulfilled and it was ""seeing the world"". Then he ended the conversation by saying ""I don't like talking about this, is it okay if we drop it on one? three, two, one."", and just like that the conversation ended and he returned back to normal, while I'm sitting there with tears filling my eyes, and a huge pain in my chest, head, and stomach.

I am here to seek advice or words of wisdom. Is there any way to change someone who has this perspective on life? I am a very empathetic person with a passion for life. My empathy towards people is so strong that I can feel people's pain and understand where they are coming from by putting myself in their shoes, which is a quality I actually despise about myself because most times I can feel people's feelings as if they were my own (Bob knows this about me). Bob and I have a very loving and caring relationship other than these few moments in our relationship where his darkness is expressed. I want to help him but he is so stubborn and would never seek professional help. I should restate that Bob is NOT suicidal but rather does not care about living - he is living to keep other people happy, he also doesn't ever do things on purpose that would risk him dying.

 **Tolerance**:  Spending an increasing amount of time on the site, coming to a stage where they need it in order to obtain satisfaction or on the other extreme, it is having a detrimental effect on them as a person and their life.

 **Withdrawal symptoms**:  Common signs are anxiety, distress and the need to talk about Facebook and what might have been posted on their wall in their absence.

 **Reduction of normal social/recreational activities**: Reduced time spent catching up with friends, playing a sport or whatever it is they used to enjoy doing, to simply spend time on Facebook.

 **Virtual dates:**  Instead of going to the movies or out to dinner, they tell their partner to be online at a certain time. 

 **Fake friends**:  If 8 out of 10 people shown on their Facebook page are complete strangers, it is undeniable: they have a serious case of Facebook addiction

 **Complete addiction**: Symptoms include a pet having a Facebook page and any notification,  wall posts, messages, or friend requests that they receive give them a high, one which can be compared to that gambling addicts get from slots or poker.

Is this just a result of people with addictive personalities or has Facebook controlled our mentality when it comes to social media? ",07Aug2018,1
78,"I have borderline personality disorder and I am finally trying to commit to bettering my life. Dialectical behavior therapy has been suggested to me as the only way I can improve my quality of life, but it doesn’t seem like enough. It’s such a meticulous type of therapy and I just don’t have the motivation to do it. I’m currently trying medication (again) and I’ve just reached my full dosage. It doesn’t seem to be very effective. 

I’m not sure how much longer I can suffer like this. 

Thanks in advance. ",07Aug2018,2
79,"TL;DR 
I am going to be going to treatment for my bipolar disorder and eating disorder. I will be required to come off of Klonopin, after being prescribed and taking it for 5 years. The treatment facility is equipped for this (and I’ve wanted to try to get off of it for a while) but I am extremely nervous about it. Have you had success coming off in a treatment facility? I’m very anxious about this one aspect of the program. 

This will be a bit long. I apologize. 

I am going to treatment to get help with my BiPolar Disorder and Eating Disorder. 4 years ago I went to one center for just my ED. They were not equipped to handle dual diagnoses and although it helped for a while, I’ve completely fallen back into all of it. I’ve had manic and depressive episodes for years and I have quit jobs, not worked for years, etc because of it all. During all of this I have been on Lamictal and Klonopin for 5 or 6 years. Obviously other meds have been thrown in there as trials, etc. Xanax was something I took with the Klonopin, for years. I was able to stop my Xanax use with almost no issues (obviously because they upped the Klonopin). I am going to a facility that treats dual diagnoses. They have one big rule...no controlled substances. So they will help me detox from the Klonopin. I’ve tried twice to do it on my own and it’s was complete h*ll. I’ve never experienced anything like it. It scared me so much that I ran back to using Klonopin. My doctors have never wanted me off of it. Recently my pdoc said she wants me to do the work. To really face all of my problems head on and to see what life is like without the assistance of medication (or a lot of medication). She thinks I am too medicine focused and I’m not doing enough to gain skills to deal with all of this. 
As a side effect, I developed an ED, 8 years ago. I abuse laxatives (up to 36 pills in a day), restrict my food, have food phobia, binge, and the kicker...exercise anywhere from 8-12 hours a day (depending on when I have a job or not). I am completely off the rails. As a side note I am not ripped or super skinny (at the moment). I just walk, walk, walk, hike, and run...nonstop. I don’t know how I am still alive and neither does the treatment facility I am going to. 

Long story short, I am scared to death that I will leave the treatment center when I come off the Klonopin. In the past when I have come off of it...I am scared of everything and everyone, even people I know. I can’t swallow, food extra scares me, showering scares me, existing scares me. 
So I want to know if any of you have experienced coming off a Benzo under the care of professionals and what should I be prepared for. This is the biggest reason (besides weight gain) that I feel like I will totally back out. At which point my mom said she will not accept my not getting help and my pdoc says she will continue to give me the meds I have now, but will NOT work to get me to any place other than where I am at now (which isn’t a good place).

85,Recently my dad and his wife started again to have more and more discussions and fights about either me or her son and these fight end with me being threatened and being insulted until I believe everything she says about me and my father getting beaten up after a couple of days he goes to her crawling on his knees begging her to not leave him. Now for about two years everyday when I was for example in school I would often stay longer there just to not be alone with her and her son as i‘ve always been super scared as I can handle physical stuff better then all those „mind games“ she playes and always talks me down about everything and praises her son to the sky about everything no matter how bad he was at it or whatever and it’s gotten to a point that when i‘m alone with her and her son on the weekends or any other day but mostly the weekends as my father works a lot in order for us to stay over water I am to scared to leave my own room and live in the constant fear of her coming in any moment to scream at me for what a disgrace I am and that i am worth nothing...

86,"Recently I have had a growing concern towards my friend mental health. One of the main problems that I notice is that he ALWAYS lies. No matter what he is talking about, 95% of the time he is telling a lie. This has not only been observed by myself, but along with eight or nine other friends that are apart of our friend group. Now, he has always been known to lie somewhat, and we use to have conflicts sometimes over it, because I would be the one friend to call him out on it, but this past year it has turned from little white lies, to lying about every aspect of his life. He recently failed out of school for the second time, and will say how that is not the case and he just wants to transfer because his school is not funding his research and shutting down there GeoChem Program(His Major is GeoChemistry). While he says this, I currently work with his dad who had already told me about his past semester and the reason he isn't going back to his school.  On top of that, one of my friends contacted his former school to see if the changes to his program were true, but they in fact were not. When I asked him, and reassure him that he will not be judged if he tells me the truth, he just denies it and continues to further tell his story. This lying has gotten to the point where it is hard for me to want to hangout with him anymore, as just watching him makeup these stories scares me. It's almost as if I am not looking at the person anymore, the person I have know for about half my life. On top of this I am pretty sure he suffers from depression, along with being an extremely insecure person. Along with all of this I am pretty sure he was suicidal at one point a few months back when he was away at school this past semester. I want to talk to his parents to make sure he gets help, primarily because he wants to go away again for school(He was previously 8 hours from home at former school), but I am not sure if this is the smartest decision. As his friend I am really concerned for him and could use help.",07Aug2018,1
87,"Hello. I would like to talk about something that's been bothering me for too long. 


Voices. The stupid and annoying voices. Can't they just shut up? 

I was arriving home while walking the dog, and then... ""do it"". They told me to try to hurt someone again. My head even started to hurt. It's been 2-3 months since I heard voices this intensely. They always tell me to kill people either kill/hurt myself. I try my best to ignore them, and I seem to accomplish it 95% of the times. I've taken my medications. It's true that my dose now is too low. I think that might be the guilty guy here. I had a psychosis episode like 2 days ago. Can't it stop already ?",07Aug2018,1
88,"I'm certain I check off all the symptoms of it, but my brain is telling me he'll suggest I'm actually a pedophile and report me. I know that's a symptom of POCD, but it's a major hurdle.

Besides that, the history of why I developed POCD is embarrassing as hell. I know I was just a stupid kid, but still. My twin started sexually experimenting with me when I was 4, and I'm pretty sure it was because of sexual abuse she experienced. Then at 6 or 7 my cousin and I kissed, and she wanted to show everyone, which got us in trouble.

Then the most regrettable and anxiety inducing incident was when I was 15-16. Woke up early, read Reddit in bed, and something I read provoked the question of how porn sites handled illegal searches. So not even realizing how stupid it was, went to a porn site and searched the most obvious term. Was greeted with a big warning about how my IP and search term were forwarded to INTERPOL. That left me anxious for months.

Then 7 months ago at the age of 22, I had a massive panic attack, worrying that my sister's fiance was a pedo for some reason. They met when she was 14-15 and he was 20-21, but are happily married now. The day after that massive panic attack I developed what I think is POCD, and experienced panic for a good while afterwards. Cried daily for a few weeks.

Nowadays it's not so bad, but still there, and before I start treatment for my PTSD that developed 2-3years ago, I want to let my therapist know about the POCD. I feel stupid for not telling him already. ",07Aug2018,1
89,"Been lurking for a while but kinda need to post. Please excuse the ramble - there’s a lot to go through.

So I’m a CPTSD/anxiety/panic disorder/depressive (at this point who knows) and a recovering alcoholic. Currently drinking, but I’ll get to that. Long story short, last November I finally admitted to my Nmum that I was sexually abused in her house as a kid. Her response was “not by me you weren’t”. No shock, or care or worry.. What I didn’t tell her was that it was by my brother. She knows I was physically abused (basically punched, kicked, scratched, bitten) daily by my sister and was severely bullied at school.

The next day I had a nervous breakdown, developed a pretty serious stammer and have had trouble speaking in public since. I actually used to do stand up so pretty ironic. Been no contact with any of them since November. I’m freelance so I lost my job and have been in debt since I took time off to recover. 

I see a therapist (had a session this evening) and have been working on getting my self esteem back up. It’s a super gradual process but I feel like we’ve been making progress.

Cut to this evening, after I took a day off work (which costs money as I’m freelance) I went and drank alone after my therapy session and am kinda spiralling. Went home to my girlfriend, who is great, and totally accepts all my bullshit. I told her how I felt and started to cry - I’m not usually in touch with my emotions, but I was really sobbing - but then I said I wanted to call my family and tell them what they’d done to me. She said that was a bad idea. I told her I really needed another drink. She said that was a bad idea. Then she started to cry. So I stopped being in touch with my emotions and went back to feeling nothing. 

So I left and now I’m drinking alone in a nearby pub trying to feel something. And I won’t do it at home because if I go there I’m terrified we’ll argue and I’ll just be passing on the chaos and abuse that was my home life growing up. This is a massive ramble I know, but I need to communicate it because I can’t reach out to any of my friends and if I don’t tell someone, I’ll hurt myself.

I don’t know how anyone could respond to this but I know I need to post it because I’ve never communicated any of this to anyone. Thanks for reading I guess. ",07Aug2018,2
90,"Long story short: I don’t see much of a reason to live anymore. I’m 22 years old, stuck at home (more on that later), and unemployed. It’s not the worst predicament I could be stuck in, but it’s an unhealthy, monotonous lot nonetheless.

As a college student, I’m unable to really secure a steady source of income. Sure, work study is a thing, but the school postings haven’t posted any job listings so far (despite the fact that classes start in two weeks). I currently freelance and while that occasionally pays, most people expect me to write for them for free. At this point, I’m not in the mindset to do things out of the kindness of my heart — I need money.

As for my home situation, it’s getting increasingly difficult to stay at home without wanting to hurt myself. My dad, imo, is a manipulative and cheap person, and often tries to rear his head into my life even though I need the space of to figure out mine. He also has a notoriously sexist mindset and is a bully who likes to pick fights with either my mom or my sisters. His toxic behavior just makes me uncomfortable, and I don’t like being around him for too long. My mother, on the other hand, has a shopping addiction and is overall an unreliable person when it comes to money so she’s almost always broke.

I currently share a room with my sister, and I hate it. She’s a controlling and domineering person, so she’s essentially claimed most of the room as her own while I only have a bed, a quarter of the closet, and a dresser. I don’t even have my own safe space away from the rest of the family. 

Now. you’re probably wondering why haven’t I even bothered applying in a field such as retail or the food industry. I’ve sent in multiple resumes and have never received a call back. I’ve even forced my way out of my comfort zone i order to get a job. (I only had one job in retail/food in the past and it was traumatizing). 

So yeah, that’s where I’m currently at. I barest have any clothes and maybe a couple cents to my name, but that’s about it. I’ve considered asking friends for money for food (since we seem to never have any at home and no one likes to cook), but I couldn’t impose like that. Apparently I’m already enough of a  burden to my folks that I feel more inclined to give up then keep pushing it like everyone says. ",07Aug2018,1
91,"I work in a niche industry where a lot of us suffer from mental illness. Our team is very open and understanding about mental health, and we're all quite transparent about when we're suffering and how we can help each other. We've recently had someone moving more into the core of our team and I'm really fearful she is making me intolerant to mental illness. Any time she is challenged whatsoever she refuses to hear criticism or even accept praise because of her anxiety. She claims panic attacks and hives any time she is working solo, but as a team we \_never\_ see symptoms like this. We also find her exaggerating other things in her life like coming from a low class family even though her parents pay this young adult woman's rent, buy her nice gadgets, and work in good paying jobs. She rarely helps others out and is not understanding in the slightest about other people's struggles. If she does volunteer to help, she immediately acts like we victimized her. I'm so lost and confused because I am so angry with her, but at the same time I \_want\_ to believe she is being honest. How can I not? Isn't it so wrong to even think someone may be using it anxiety as an excuse? 

It's so hard, and I'm at a point where I am unwilling to admit my own struggles because I don't want to seem like her. I just don't know what to do anymore! Any time I offer her help or advice she ignores my advice and takes advantage of my help to the point I feel used by her. I am becoming so callous and I hate it. I work on a small team so avoiding her completely isn't an option, and even if it was, it's not the sort of environment I would want to work in. Any advice is highly appreciated!",07Aug2018,2

In a month I will probably go to the hospital and before that I have to pass exams that I know nothing about and also I have no job so my gf will lose the apartment and the dream about having a stable home with her will go away. She has narcolepsy so she can't work really. I feel trapped and it can sometimes bring forth very bad thoughts, of self harm and such. I'm looking for any hope because I lost it all.",07Aug2018,4
93,"Well, okay... This could go two ways, either I try to be as short and concrete as possible or we will end up with a giant wall of text, regardless, English is not my naitive language and my computer does not have a spell check installed for english written words so there might be some errors here and there. 

Well where to begin, I'm 23 and find myself all dired up in my face after calling in sick from work today and crying, just crying. I feel horrible right now and it is probably a mix of stop taking illeagly purchased Xanax's and just a point in my life where I really feel misplaced, like nothing is where it should be and I don't know where to begin to unravel my mess.

I've had strong problems with anxiety as far back as I can remember, I've had feelings of depersonalization since at least the age of 5 because I remember one time very vividly, which in and of itself is sad because I don't remember much about my life at all really, everything is just a blur. I've talked with scool counselors since the age of 10. I realize now that I can't tell you my life story because it would take too long, what is important is that I have been diagnosed with bipolar II, GAD, depression and panic disorder but never really been offerd any proper help, none of my medications have worked so I've self medicated with benzos and while they do work, it just isn't sustainable for someone like me. I feel very guilty and I feel as if I've begun a very dark period of my life or if I am within one. I've been on a list for CBT and to talk to a psychologist for a year and a half right now. I got into what is my countrys equivalent of college and am in the process of finding a new home in one of the biggest cities here but I don't know, I can't even conform to my everyday routines without derailing every so often it seems. 

I sometimes wish to die. I've never really been suicidal though but the thought of death comforts me probably more than it should and right now I feel so guilty, to my family, my friends, all the people I could have been a better person to in the past. In fact, the only thing that brings me any comfort in life is my dog, I had an amazing dog who passed away in late 2013 but my family got a new one last year and she is the only thing that really feel pure and real in my life right now, everything else is fabricated or overlaced with guilt. I live alone in a small apartment but it is just a short drive to my mom lives where my dog also lives and I try to see her everyday and take her for walks, the reason she doesn't live with me is because I went to school in another city for 2 years and was not allowed to bring her with me and she couldn't be alone all day so she stayed with my mom but if I move now she will have to stay behind...",07Aug2018,1

96,"My brother has been showing very clear symptoms of schizophrenia for 3 years though I have only become aware of this since this past February. Visual and auditory hallucinations, paranoia, anosognosia were the apparent ones. He had been homeless for almost that same amount of time — couch surfing in the homes of family members, shelters, and finally an abandoned house. 

I spent months trying to convince him to come live with me so we can get help for his mental and physical health and one night when he finally agreed turns out it was only because he wanted to borrow money to fly to LA to pursue his delusions. He came to my home with 5 flee ridden cats in tow. He lasted a whole week at my place before becoming unreasonable about how many cats he should keep (we asked him to keep 2 of 5 since 7 total cats were running around my 1 bedroom apt at the time), threatened homelessness again if I put up any of the cats, and became agitated with me because I wouldn’t agree to his delusional plan. 

I finally had to call the police to take him to the hospital’s mental health crisis center which made him upset with me and the only reason he was compliant with going was because our cousin convinced him to. He’s there now and because he hasn’t been a clear and immediate danger to himself or others all of his treatment has to be voluntary and because of his anosognosia he’s being noncompliant with medication. I’m hoping our cousin can convince him some more to stay and accept medication. 

All this has been a serious strain on my life and my relationship with my partner who is constantly furious that I want to keep trying to help him despite his resistance. My partner has begrudgingly watched me help him this whole week and participated in some efforts and they are constantly talking down about my brother and saying with no small amount of hatred in their voice that they don’t care if he accepts treatment or not. I know it’s coming from a place of concern seeing their girlfriend’s efforts be shit on time and again but I understand that his behavior has been symptoms of his disorder and not a conscious malicious attempt to hurt me. My brother has always been a sexist and treated me like I am the baby sister who doesn’t know anything and I think that is one of the main reasons I can’t break through to him. I’ve always been smarter than him and he constantly acknowledges that but the disorder makes him one track minded and absolutely certain in his delusions.

I have bipolar type II and I’ve mostly gotten a handle on my symptoms but this whole situation may trigger a depressive episode and I’m getting severe stomach cramps from stress. I just wanted to vent and get some support for what I’ve been through because it has been one of the most difficult things I have encountered in my short life and it’s far from over. The people I care most about are being assholes to me literally just trying to be a good person and help where no one else in my family has tried to help and I am stressed, in pain, depressed, and confused.",07Aug2018,5

98,"Every Tuesday and Wednesday, my roommate ""L"" will join my mom and I for dinner because he has those nights off from work. I'm going to mention two of the most notable dinners with his odd behavior

1. Had our other roommate join us n this was the first the we all had dinner together. dinner was probly around 45 min-1 hr. So the thing will L is that he will grab a full plate, eat it all, then get himself another helping, the problem is he does not stop until everything is gone from the table. My Mom used to be a gourmet chef so I know her food is always incredible but she makes A LOT of food. (This may be some different sort of a binge problem, but from what I've gathered online, it seems a little different.) What's even more rude is that he will continue eating even after people have left the table. After everyone being done for awhile, you're not gonna wanna keep on waiting. An hour after dinner I had to go into the backyard to do something and I'm able to see him inside n HE'S STILL EATING. been 2 hrs now. The image of him being hunch over him plate alone, with most of the lights out n just two candle was weird to me.
2. Another dinner the first serving he has was enough to serve 3 ppl. And again, everything cleared. We had this BIG bowl of rice at the table. After I finished n was tired of waiting, I went to start cleaning up. There still had been a lot of rice left that had been in the kitchen but I wanted to clean the pot. So I went outside where L was still eating n my mom was just hanging out at the table. Poured the pot of rice into that big bowl I mentioned earlier. there had been about 1.5 servings left in the bowl but the rice in the pot filled the bowl up to the top again. I should've known better to not do this bc Lo and behold, it later had been finished off with nothing left thanks to give.
3. He also will pass out still sitting at the table from drinking too much alcohol. not always the but it happens.
4. However, what's odd to me though that for the rest of the week he eats like a normal person n will just have a glass of wine before bedtime. He's a pretty skinny guy too. He doesn't do a binge n purge kind of thing, but it's like the rest of the days during the week he has self-control or something. he will only feed like a damn locust when he is with us n make the dinner. I also find it incredibly rude too. so can someone explain the psychology of this please? my mom and I literally can't wrap our heads around it it's so odd.",07Aug2018,3

I told my friend I was “liberal” (I’m actually more deft then that) and he started making fun of me. In fact 7/8 people at the table I was at laughed. I hate everyone. I’m sorry I had to bring politics into this but it is important to your understanding of my situation. I want to be a theoretical physicist. It doesn’t pay much, but I know I would love the job, but my dad isn’t that optemistic. (In fact he’s never optimistic about anything) I have to nod my head to everything he says or he will get angry at me and call me a “dirty liberal.” I should just end it all. What’s even the point. Who would even care? Yeah let’s see. CALL ME A FUCKING DIRTY LIBERAL WHEN YOU SEE THE NOOSE AROUND MY NEAK. THEN YOU WILL REGRET WHAT YOU DID. pls help. I’m begging you. ",07Aug2018,6
100,"The residential treatment facility my family wants me to go to (and I want to go to) costs 37,000 dollars which...is ridiculous and not affordable. They won't take our insurance because we're one state over even though our insurance offered an exception claim; it was denied by the facility. The financial aid they offered was only 3,500 dollars. If anyone has experience with this, was there any planning your family did to manage the expense? ",07Aug2018,1
