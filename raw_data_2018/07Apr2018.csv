0,"I'm constantly tired. Not in a falling asleep way but just so tired I can't focus and don't want to move/talk/think. I take adderall which doesn't help and a bunch of other supplements for it that definitely help some but it's still an issue. All my blood tests came back great, I workout daily, sleep 8 hours a night and eat healthy. I had a sleep study done and that came back with good results as well. The only thing that does help is energy drinks but I don't want to rely on them so I use them only when I am feeling overly tired and need to get something done. The only time I naturally feel awake and alert is when I'm working out and my blood is pumping but that energy passes when I'm done. It gets worse and better randomly but is almost always there. I've tried several depression medications and have only gotten bad side effects with zero positive effects. When it gets really bad I don't even want to have sex.

I wouldn't say I'm happy but this feeling is definitely not sadness. It's more just overwhelming fatigue with brain fog. I can't for the life of me figure out if this is depression or if I should be pushing to keep trying to find if something is physically wrong with me. I feel like I've tried everything and am losing hope.

If I had energy my life would actually be enjoyable.

Also worth noting is I got sober from a heavy opiate/benzo/everything addiction a couple years ago. It's hard to say if I experienced these symptoms before as I was high 24/7. I do remember opiates having a peridoxal effect and making me more awake though.

1,"So about 2 year ago, after AP testing, i was bed ridden for about 2 weeks due to mass amounts of dizziness feeling that the world was spinning around me, and derealization. The disorders have only gone down slightly 2 weeks after the testing and i have been left with the aftermath ever since. I have been to many doctors since then anywhere from a physical to the ENT with brain scans inbetween. I have also been to acupuncture as well.  After all this testing my physiatrist and therapist have narrowed it down to me having an anxiety disorder. I have been trying many different medications with meditations and it seems to me that this will not be over anytime soon. As i am in my senior year of HS I have missed many days of school and have to go to a local community college instead of Chapman college. I am writing this here to ask if anyone has dealt with an anxiety related disorder or something similar because lately i have become hopeless and really depressed. I am not sure if this is ever going to go away and the medications I am trying dont seem to be helping it. 


Btw sorry for the impropper typing talking about my anxiety brings on its symptoms aka dizziness and it is really hard to focus and thank you to anyone who responds!",07Apr2018,12,
2,"I have been having trouble in my relationship where when I'm making a lot of different mistakes. 

We sit together and work out what helps and how I can get better, but when I reach the situations that apply or encounter the same problem, I not only forget what to do, but I simply don't think of it at all. 

I hate this feeling of knowing what helps and doing nothing about it. I don't understand why I do this. 

One example is that my girlfriend struggles to get in the mood for sex. She is getting counselling to help with this, but after talking about it I know that what I need to do to help is to talk about sex as this does help her get in the mood. However whenever I get in the mood, I will do anything but that and I don't understand why. I know it's what she needs but I never think to do it. 

It's nothing like a lack of care. I've never been diagnosed with anything but the feeling of not doing what I know I need to is driving me insane. Does anyone have advice on how I can deal with this better. I have been to counselling and have failed to identify how I can improve.

Tl;dr: I have trouble remembering what I need to do when I encounter a problem despite knowing what I need to do. ",07Apr2018,3,
3,i’ve felt really depressed for about 2 years. i talked to my friends a couple times about how i was feeling and my friend sent the cops to my house because he said he was worried i was going to kill myself. i feel like i can’t talk to anyone. things have only gotten worse since that incident. i moved out and my mom lashed out on me and made me feel unwelcome back. i barely talk to most of my family anymore. my boyfriend broke up with me. my friends ignore me. i feel like i don’t have anything to live for. i started therapy this week and don’t have another appointment for 2 weeks- not that it’s helped much so far anyway.,07Apr2018,4,

5,"This is a cross post from depression but I realized it makes way more sense here. Some of my comments seem off because of that.

I don’t know, I just want to try putting this in writing and see how that goes.

I was neglected as a kid, from birth to 13 I remember weeks of being left alone. No one cared(s) about my wellbeing. My mom provided “stuff”, the bare bones basic shit to survive, that was it. I think she did it because society demanded it of her. My mom wouldn’t have me if she could do life over, she even told me she wished I would kill myself. My dad’s not in the picture, he was too busy doing coke throughout my life to care about anything else. By the time I was 13 it was official and I was completely abandoned without regard. I would leave home for days, show up and no one would even mention that I was gone. By this time I was high off my ass or drunk days at a time. I think I was high nearly every day until I had a mental breakdown at 24 when I stopped drinking and doing drugs.

This has left an impact. I’m sure you can do the math. There are massive parts of a normal human psyche that I’m missing. The big one is that I don’t relate to any other human beings, at all. I have to fight sociopathic tendencies. But I empathize just fine. Sounds like a contradiction but it’s not. I’ve gone through life literally hurting everyone who puts any emotional investment in me. I act out my life as a sociopath because I don’t know how else to act and then fully realize the emotional trauma I caused. I have wrecked lives of good people in inexcusable ways.

I don’t know why I’m writing this, especially in this subreddit. There isn’t really a better one. I don’t feel depressed much. I know life is passing me by and I’ll die one day having not accomplished a great deal but that’s fine. I don’t have ambition or goals. I know I hurt people all the time and I remember every instance but I don’t really get sad at that. I guess all of that is too overwhelming to process so I leave it be, locked away somewhere in my brain, I guess. It’s ok if I suffer too, I’m not overly concerned by pain and mental anguish. My well-being is pretty irrelevant and easily ignored.

I decided I’m going to see a therapist, kind of for fun, I’m waiting to see their reaction when I detail this shit to them. Still on the waiting list. Not sure how much I’ll reveal or lie about, I think that depends on them.

I’ll wrap this up, I’m not sad, I’m not happy, I’m not depressed all the time but I’m certainly not normal and there isn’t time to course correct. I’m 36. It’s a done deal, I live in a grey world and that’s that.

Last thought, just came to me. I present as a pretty upbeat person, I smile and joke a lot. I think if I was raised by loving people I would have been one of those super upbeat people full of energy and the spark of life. I wonder much wasted human potential there is like that?

EDIT* It's not clear but I had a mental breakdown BECAUSE I stopped drinking and getting high. I didn't quit doing that because of the breakdown. I had this wonderful epiphany that I could lead a normal life if I was sober...",07Apr2018,12,
6,"I know I need help. But for the life of me I can't afford the sessions. I want to get help so bad.
The second thing that I wish was different, was being able to talk to someone more than one a month. The few times I've tried going, the next session is a month later. I feel that I need to talk to someone more consistently then once a month. What do I do?",07Apr2018,1,
7,"I recently have had to get a list of diagnosis required for me to get on temporary Disability so I can go to school part time and get back on my feet. So without my surprise I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Clinical Depression, and PTSD (that was a little bit of a shocker)

Then I go on and see ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" which I am completely just thrown off about. I know about the disorder and just looked at my therapist and say ""What makes you think I have BPD?"" She said in her opinion I show pretty much classic symptoms. I said whoa wait a minute, pump the brakes. I do NOT have BPD. I said I know you are the professional here but I don't agree with that and I don't want that on public file that I am supposably ""BPD"". She didn't really know what to say at the point, it was the end of the session and she said feel free to talk to me about it next week and I said Okay sounds great!

Completely thrown off by this point... I don't agree with her at all. I've been to multiple counselors, I've been in a psychiatric unit for my Anxiety Disorders in the past, none of them said anything about BPD. 

Another thing.. I know all about this disorder I had a friend in highschool with this illness and I know what it implies.. I completely understand her point of view though, I definitely do share SOME vague symptoms but to pin it down to BPD.. just...no...


-I don't have any explosive anger moments

-I am not 'extremely' sensitive.

-Never self-harmed before

-Never had a problem with self-image

-Do not have an inflated self esteem/narcissism (I'm actually quite shy but not too shy lol)

-Do not have abandonment issues (no one in my life ever left me lol..)





The symptoms I do have:

Destructive behavior (from alcoholism. Currently in recovery)

Dissociation (from PTSD)

Feelings of emptiness (From PTSD)


If anyone who has BPD I would definitely like to hear your input on this.

And to make it clear, I do not have a problem with people who are diagnosed with this disorder. I have a problem with ME being misdiagnosed with a disorder I clearly don't have.

What should I make of this situation exactly?

9,"This will be long; bare with me. 
I don’t know where to begin. 
I keep fucking up my relationship. I’ve been with someone [26M] for a little over 2 years, and we live together. Out of all the relationships I’ve had, this is the only relationship that was ever good for me and that I was happy with. The only point of my life where I can take a deep breath, and say “I love my life” with a smile. 
But why do happy people do the things I do? Why do people in love make these mistakes?
I’m sitting in a park after work, not wanting to go home because then he’ll be there. And I can’t face the shame I’ve caused. 

The first incident was when we were together for about a month or so, and got into some argument, and I got the number of some dude that had a crush on me just to piss off my boyfriend and get some sort of emotion I guess. I don’t know why, I was so guilty of doing it that I forgot what exactly happened because I tried to block it off in my head. 
The next summer, we were going through a rough phase that we would argue every day. He went to work, and I thought it was a good idea to bring a male friend over without telling my boyfriend so I won’t get accused of cheating and have another argument in our hands, since the tension between us was so intense. He found out of course, and almost broke up with me. I know it looked wrong, but it wasn’t what it was. I understand why he was mad. Out of respect, I never talked to that male friend again. 

Around that same time, I had another male friend I would text every now and then. And since there was still so much tension between me and my boyfriend, I switched my friends name on my phone to a female name I admit, it was wrong from the beginning. We would hardly text, and went months without speaking until recently. I never changed the name back. My friend began being flirty, not over the top asking for nudes, but he would say how he was so happy to talk to me and would bother me if I didn’t text him back (I would ignore him sometimes). He asked for a picture of me because he hadn’t seen me for so long that he “forgot” what I looked like. I’m not THAT stupid, I never sent him any. But I still tolerated that behavior instead of telling him at any point in time “hey dude, you know I have a boyfriend. Don’t talk to me that way” or just block him. I never reciprocated those feelings, I never flirted back. But my inaction, that i never did anything about it, is almost worse though. 
My boyfriend saw those texts when it obviously didn’t come from a female. He refuses to be around me right now. Understandably. 


Incidents like this pop up every now and then. I don’t know what I would do if he did that to me, I would be hurt and devastated. I’m surprised he’s been with me for this long, after everything he’s put up with. Sometimes I would lash out over the smallest things. I’ve been abusive at times too emotionally and physically. And every time I would lash out and bang my head against the wall or say fucked up shit or hit or scream or anything, I would just feel fucking  terrible.
So I’ve noticed this pattern of behavior with men and aggression. And I hate myself for it. I don’t want to be this way. 

When I was a child, my adopted dad’s grandson (my dad is old, so he has older grandkids than me) used to molest me. I think I was about 5, and he’s probably about 8-10 years older than me. I never told anybody because I had tried and wasn’t taken seriously. 

When I was 11, I was raped behind an arcade at the mall by someone who was 24. Me and my mom went to therapy where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I would always end up not going because I never wanted to talk about it. I just couldn’t finish. I had gotten pregnant from that rape, and when I thought I could tell my best friend at that time with trust, only for her to tell everyone and so became the “pregnant girl” in middle school, then the girl who killed her baby because I had an abortion.  People would never leave me alone for a while after that happened. I thought I was a dirty girl, so I dirty girls do dirty thing. I began having sex with guys older than me at the age of 13. 

My parents divorced that same year. Throughout my adolescence, I found out who my biological dad was. I had a relationship with him, Only to get rejected by him and calling me an “abomination” and how much of a mistake I was.  (I was born out of wedlock and from an affair, biological dad is a pastor). And since my adopted dad divorced my mom, I guess he divorced me too because he never bothered being in my life much. He abandoned me and ignored my phone calls when I needed him. He would come in and out of my life but only to the benefit of him. 

Throughout my teenage years, I was in/out of hospitals for attempts of suicide. I used to drink bottles of Zquil in hopes I would fall into a painless death. Since I was the age of 11, to the age of 19, i would cut myself and slice my thighs like a goddamn Virginia ham. 

Before my current boyfriend, I used to be in relationships where I’d either get beaten, or get confused because I was with someone that didn’t know what he wanted and dragged me down with him. Even then, I would still have self-destructive behavior throughout. 

I tried bringing this up to my boyfriend yesterday, that I need therapy. I need to talk to someone that could help me have a healthy relationship, that could help me be a healthy nontoxic person. Because there’s just SOMETHING that’s not allowing me to have normal, healthy relationship. especially when I would lash out at my boyfriend and be unfair to him and start acting crazy, when he has been the sweetest, loving person I could’ve ever asked for. 

He told me I should stop using my past as a crutch and as an excuse for me being a whore. That’s just how my personality is: an unfair, habitual lying whore. I know he’s mad at me because I betrayed him and was dishonest with him, but now I’m just trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong with me. Why the fuck do I do these things? Why do I lash out and become abusive and seek attention from other men when I don’t actually want, or need it?
Am I just a piece of shit that needs to stop finding excuses for my actions? Or is there something wrong with me? 

Regardless if he decides to leave me or not, I’m tired of myself. I’m just so... fucking... tired. I don’t want to be a toxic person, i don’t want to lash out or be abusive. I don’t want to be that shitty girlfriend everyone hates, i don’t want to be me. I want to be able to provide someone with a healthy relationship, and be a good person for once. I want to change. I do.... 

Please don’t be cruel. I know I fucked up. I feel so terrible and dwell in guilt knowing I hurt someone that I NEVER wanted to hurt. Someone who doesn’t deserve to get dragged down by me.  
I feel so shitty that I find myself sitting in the park in open woods at dark alone, debating to throw myself off an overpass so I could stop hurting the  ones I love the most. 
Whats wrong with me? Why am I like this?

TD;LR I keep fucking up in my relationship with abnormal behavior and I don’t know if it’s just because it’s who i am and I’m using a crutch, or because something is wrong with me and I think  I need help.

12,"We met online without seeing one another, became penpals, visited, worked apart, applied for a visa, moved in together into a small country cottage near a pub, duck pond, and historic mill. She made me gluten-free banana bread, and I made us bad espresso.
But I was depressed, anxious, and became cruel, ungrateful. She pulled away, yelled, stormed around the house, slammed doors. I asked her to attend therapy. We argued. I slammed doors, punched a wall, attended therapy for PTSD.

She has a childhood history of abuse. I have a childhood history of abuse. She was the only woman who never cheated on me. I was her second partner. She worked all day, and being on VA disability, I stopped leaving the house.

I was sullen. She yelled. I became suicidal, mentioned divorce, took off my ring. She followed me upstairs during an argument, broke a glass, threatened herself. I froze, said something critical, failed to support her. She cut her arm in front of me.

We researched then scheduled tattoos, one to cover her scar. One to cover what I felt inside. Both on our left forearms. We flew to Paris. She worked, I cleaned house, waited for her to come home. We flew to Rome. She worked, I cleaned house, waited for her to come home. We flew to Florence. She worked, I cleaned house, waited for her to come home.

We continued to argue. She threatened herself. I held her. She screamed. I grabbed her shoulders. She screamed, dug her fingernails into me. I grabbed her neck. She couldn't speak. I stopped, felt mortified.

She loved her tattoo. I hated mine, scheduled appointments to get it removed. She worked more, started going out more. I became jealous, asked to see her phone. She said no, grew distant, changed birth control for her PMDD. I noticed that she wore new makeup, got her hair cut differently, ordered lingerie to wear to work.

She followed me upstairs, pulled the covers off me, pulled me out of bed. I screamed. She blocked the doorway, grabbed me. I slapped her, turned redfaced with shame, shook, began crying. We scheduled couples therapy for the weeks ahead. I engraved a lock to give to her, to place on the fence above a stream beside the council office where we were married. It said ""Always.""

She confessed to having feelings for a co-worker. He appreciated her outright, no conditions. We still attended a couples pottery session that I planned. She threw four perfect pots. I didn't manage one. She stopped kissing me. We stopped making love. I cried. She yelled. I said words out of anger, raised my voice. She threw dishes.

We slept apart. I kissed her long, hard. She scowled at me, said that's not my style. Alone in a dark room, I threw my phone, smashed a mirror. She cried as her mother arrived to ask us a favor. I shared that I needed to go to a hospital, get help, get medication. Her mother said ""That's manipulation.""

I returned to an empty house. She went to work. I called her. She told me that she would be home in five hours, that she had news. I lost my composure, packed a suitcase, left for the U.S. She told me not to come home when I called from the bus, nearing the airport.

We couldn't attend our couples sessions. I went on a retreat for veterans, saw broken men and heard stories of broken marriages. Watched my roommate nearly kill himself. I tried to tell her how I felt. She told me to tell my therapist. I asked what she wanted. She said that she didn't know how she felt about us. I asked if she would visit. She said maybe.

We would miss a concert that we'd planned in May, orchestra seats in London, an artist who wrote a song I'd heard before I met her and that stuck in my head. She said that she would take her mother. I texted too much, called too much. I began therapy. Helped a friend move. Renewed my drivers license. Fixed my car. Got my tattoo lasered, watched it swell and blister over the coming days. Attended another friend's daughter's first birthday. Slept alone in my single bed, in a room in my parents' house, at 36 years old.

My wife continued to pull away. I went to buy groceries, asked to say goodnight. She left me on the phone as I sat in my car in a parking lot, said that I don't have mental illness, that it's an attitude problem. I emailed. She responded, said that she should have only ever been my friend, wished me well, changed her number.

I researched domestic violence, called the crisis line, labeled myself an abuser. I researched transference, projection, object constancy. Researched the basic needs of interpersonal relationships, self-care, love: attention, acceptance, appreciation, affection, allowing. I emailed her a confession of abuse. I emailed to ask us to separate, rather than divorce. I emailed to apologize for emailing, as that's a sign of control, of domestic violence. I emailed her videos about transference, projection, object constancy, the basic needs of interpersonal relationships, self-care, love. I emailed a poem by Ellen Bass titled ""Marriage"" that goes: ""This is not / neat and white and lacy like a wedding, / not the bright effervescence of champagne / spilling over the throat of the bottle.""

I realize that I don't know how to love properly, with safe boundaries. I want to learn. I know that I'm choosing to live. That she deserves a life without me. That I'm choosing to remain single, celibate, trying to recenter. That I want only the best for her, which means I eventually disappear. Soon. That I entirely disappear. 

She's the most beautiful person that I ever met.

He wanted to talk. He wanted to meet me halfway. He said he loved me. That he want's to quit everything that harms us.. asking me what I want.

My friend and I host a weekly podcast with the goal of getting people, specifically guys, to talk more. We feel as though talking nowadays isn’t as real as it should be, and we really want to encourage people to speak up and tell people their thoughts, feelings, dreams, how’re they’re feeling - honestly, literally anything.

This week we had the absolute pleasure of having our friend Nadia on. She has suffered with mental health issues for years, but has had a really successful and inspiring journey to date. After many years of struggle, she is now working with those with mental health, she is a mental health advocate, she is a beauty queen (Miss Intercontinental Ireland), and has also started an excellent blog about her experiences.

I’m posting this here in the hope that it could help someone, as well as bring a smile to your face! 😊 I’ve posted the link below, so I hope that’s ok. Enjoy! 😊

26,"Storytime.

3 weeks or so, my s.o. broke up with me. We were together for 2.5 years. Her reason for this was; she didn’t feel happy. Couldn’t tell me any more. For me, it was unexpected. We had the kind of relationship that even after 2.5 years, we still would cuddle together. Weirdest fact for me; the night before we’ve been talking about the universe, the next day, Boom. Over.

Now. There’s a lot more that makes my mental condition low. My grandmother passed away recently and I’ve made drastic changes in life hoping it will get better. Quit my job, started going to school again. I’ve taken my challenge and make something out of it. Besides that, There’s also a physical handicap that doesn’t allow me to walk a lot.

In the past, I’ve had times where I also felt down. Thats how I learned that in life, everything comes and goes. It has ups and downs.

In the past, my solution was easy. Walking and smoking. It reduces the stress, but never got to the real problem. My real problem is; I need someone to take care of me when I need it the most. I miss just a simple touch. Just someone who bends over me and tells me everything is going to be just fine. And here’s the root of the problem; I don’t have such a friend. Even my ex-girlfriend couldn’t ever be there for me like this.

And I feel like such a loser right now. For every person who tells me he/she feels bad, I’d stop whatever I’m doing and drive straight towards him or her. 

I feel like a loser because last night, for the very first time in years, I’ve had a bad anxiety and panic attack. No family members know about how bad I feel right now. I can’t talk about it, because I don’t have the feeling they would understand. They are pretty stubborn about these mental conditions. Anyways, Around 20:00 I started to fear everything. Strange noises. And since I can’t walk well enough, I didn’t feel strong enough to do anything about it.

Not much later, I became nauseous. So. I struggled to get up and walk to my bathroom (at most, 5 steps). Along the way, my ankle started to hate me, and I fell.

Moments later, I woke up. Vomiting and stressing out more. Went on my knees to get my phone back from my bed. As I sat on my bed, I thought I could walk back to the toilet. And thats where I was wrong.

I tripped over something, bumped my hip against some wall and found myself crying on the floor. I felt like a worthless piece of junk. With the last dignity I had inside of me, I tried calling my ex-girlfriend. I didn’t want anyone else to find me crying, panicking, laying on the bathroom floor.
I didn’t know what to do. I felt powerless. Nothing. Fear. 

As a response, I was told she couldn’t come.

Rationally; my mind is telling me; sure. She makes her own decisions. But mentally, she was the only one who could help me. 

Last night, I couldn’t sleep. been awake now for nearly 30 hours. And I still stress out about a lot. The worst pain is her. Why couldn’t she understand me. What did I do wrong about this.

This is my last option to get to understand it and help me find a way to get better. My I'm down rock bottom and have no motivation to get up. Can't eat and have a lack of responsibility right now. Have 3 deadlines for school, but I really can't be bothered. 

On a positive note; I'm not suicidal, not aggressive, no self-harm. Just a big bag full of tears.

Is there anyone who has tips or ways to feel better? Or stuff that could help me understand?

28,"All of my life I have struggled really badly with anxiety and depression. When I was younger I struggled with substance abuse. I spent a year in rehab treatment when I was younger. I got clean but did not really get help for my underlying psychiatric issues. 
I'm still sick I just don't use. I never found any solace in the 12 step programs and never felt right and felt out of place there. 

I went to college and a really hard graduate school and academically did well but my depression and anxiety got out of control. I drank a lot and gained a huge amount of weight and developed a sleep disorder. I started taking a lot of risks and would do anything just to escape my anxiety. My anxiety got worse and worse. 

After I graduated I felt burnt out and incredibly anxious and I've never been able to start or manage my career. I hate what I do and want to change but i took on so much debt. I have incredible anxiety and freak out and feel suicidal at work so I haven't been working. 

Now I am broke, uninsured, living with a parent, no car, no job. I have sunk into a giant depression. I can't afford therapy. I have a psychiatrist I see who is trying different meds but none have really helped much. What I am on now just leaves me loopy and tired and im still anxious and very depressed. 

I still go see her and tell her but I get very little time with her and i dont have a lot of faith there. I will keep going to see her and taking meds as prescribed because i know i am supposed to. My family has a lot of problems and pressure and I feel like i put a huge burden on them and my girlfriend with my problems and how i am. 

I need serious help for my depression and especially for my anxiety. I can't function. I have panic attacks going anywhere or trying to drive or do basic things. I have trouble getting through a single day. Working seems impossible and I feel huge amounts of guilt over that. 

But I want to get help, I just think I need long term inpatient care. But I am broke and uninsured and unsure how to find it. Maybe such a thing doesnt exist for someone broke and uninsured, i don't know, it probably doesn't. When I try searching online I only end up finding places that cost a lot of money. Am I just screwed? ",07Apr2018,1,
29,"I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and adjustment disorder about 10 years ago. Since then I got help, went on meds and have had everything under control. But the last few months I’ve noticed the changes and I know what they mean. But I’m scared to admit I need help again. I don’t know when I last felt happy or didn’t spend my free time sleeping. 

I’ve made an appointment for Monday with my GP. He’s great and I trust him; but I’m scared. To admit I need help, to even know where to begin. I feel I’m being over dramatic, this isn’t a big deal, how privileged of me to see a doctor because I’m not happy? 

I just needed to vent and was hoping someone could share about their fear of getting help.

31,"I've been on multiple neuros. The worst neuros are probably **risperidone**, then **sertindole**. **Ziprasidone** was fine, but my psychiatrist mentioned I had disordered speech, and he wanted me to switch to **aripiprazole**.

Aripiprazole has been causing a burning, depressive feeling for me and nothing else. I've been on aripiprazole for less than a week. The burning feeling seems to be disappearing slowly. I'm just not confident the depressive feeling will disappear.

I'm meeting with my psychiatrist on 12th of April. I'm trying to decide what to tell him and what to ask from him. Obviously, I'll tell him my symptoms.

I also want to know what options I have left regarding neuroleptics, if aripiprazole doesn't work out at all. I don't want to take any of the more extreme or hormonal neuroleptics. If there's nothing else good left, I'll just switch back to ziprasidone.

32,"Recently broke up with my SO of 5.5 years. It wasn't our first breakup but I intend for it to be the last. I'm not sure if I'm stressing over him or if I'm stressing about being lonely. In retrospect, the relationship died a long time ago and we've been using each other as a crutch. At least, I have, I *think*. Now, I'm obsessively spending a lot of time on tinder and looking for an outlet, a distraction. Chemistry class is also kicking my ass and I'm pretty jaded with school and have no motivation to maintain my straight A record. I have no idea what I want to do with my life and I'm almost 24 and my parents definitely don't let me forget this. I even noticed I'm shedding hair more than usual. Everything seems to be falling apart. 


These past 3/4 days have been the worst. I literally laid in bed from 2am until 11am yesterday and couldn't sleep. I'd drift in and out of sleep but never entering REM. I'm currently in bed now and have been since 3am (it's 6:30am now) and I can't sleep. Even when I detach myself from my phone and try to relax, I can't sleep.

35,"My husband Paul (32M) and I (30F) are in the US, have been married almost 3 years but together for over a decade. We're each other's best friend, we love making each other laugh, we're planning our future and are interested in children soon. But Paul's mental health changes have thrown both our lives into turmoil. I'm looking for advice on how to communicate and be calm and supportive during episodes.

A little while after we got married, our business folded and we had to move. Paul then starting exhibiting some frightening symptoms. Extreme paranoia, auditory hallucinations. He's always had some mild depression, even as a young man before I knew him, but this also increased dramatically. He was unable to leave the house. We eventually got him into a short term intensive program, and believe he is dealing with depression with psychosis.

Now a year later, his mind is clearer, he still struggles with the above symptoms but they are lessened. He is compliant with medication. We are searching for a therapist, but having trouble finding one he trusts.


The hands down most difficult symptom is the crying. Paul can cry for hours and hours, inconsolably. Nothing I do helps. I try to hold him, say soothing things, just be there. When this happens, I get a crushing weight in my chest and my heart is pounding. It's awful, I know it's anxiety. I know this is coming for me every day when I get home and it's physically painful, as much as I love him and know it's not his fault.

I can't even sleep some nights. He doesn't want to be away from me and he'll lay in bed next to me and cry. A few times, in the early morning, I've begged him to simply go to the couch because I get so desperate for some sleep. It makes me feel like a horrible person. It makes me feel like I'm losing my mind, it's the worst part.

Please, I would really love some advice on how to be supportive of him during these crying fits and how to deal with them compassionately. I've really walled myself off a bit I think in order to be the strong one, to deal with work and medical bills and every aspect of everyday life, but maybe it's left me a little numb. Is it fair that I ask him to let me sleep? How should I word it?

tl;dr, Husband struggling with mental illness, cries for hours and doesn't like me to have alone time or most seriously, has trouble letting me sleep. Hoping for advice on how to compassionately manage.

I was in a horrible place mentally and instead of me being able to work on things ( since I had the time now) things got worse and it turned into agoraphobia.  


Recently, I've been making tremendous progress. I've started walking and going to the gym to lose weight and better my health.  I also have an amazing therapist and have been reading up on CBT. Things are looking up! So I feel ready to look for a job.

My problem is, when I get to the part of the application that asks me to put down my most recent job, it also asks why I left. Most of the applications I've done don't just let you put, ""I quit"" and that's it. They always ask why. I don't know what to put down. I feel like no one is going to hire me if I put down that I left because of mental illness problems. So, what is a safe anwser? What would you put, if you were in my shoes?

40,"Hi Reddit. I recently became single in early March, after seeing a girl for a year and a half. She is mid-20s, I am late 20s. I have spent the last few weeks really reflecting on the relationship and what went wrong. 

I always would joke that the relationship has an expiration date. Because that's what happened with my ex from a few years ago, I knew it would happen again here. When she ended the relationship in March, she claimed that I was manipulative and emotionally abusive. I thought to myself.. how is this possible? Sure we had a few fights recently but you always said how much you loved me. If I was such a horrible person, why would you say such things? And then I reflected.. and she may have been on to something. 

I never cut her any slack. I always seemed to try to find a problem with something. The three main issues were: 

* Facebook digging, trying to find something about her past, questioning her about it enough to really upset her

* Her family, I felt that they were always getting in the way.. if she decided last minute to see her family instead of spending time with me. I made an issue out of it even though we hadn't planned to see eachother during the timeframe. 

* Me not communicating my wants/needs but still expecting them to be met. This affected us from making plans on a weekly basis, and also from an intimacy standpoint. I'd want to see her X number of times a week.. but whatever she did wasn't enough for me. It's like nothing was ever enough. I don't have a ton of friends.. but I could've made more plans with my good friend.. but instead I would have rather spend more time with her. An example I can think of is we had plans to meet up after she had a happy hour at work to grab dinner. I expected we would go to her place after, she planned to go home alone. This really bothered me and became a big issue over text. Another example is that I wanted to have sex before bed, but because she didn't initiate it didn't happen... and I didn't sleep well that night so I made a big deal about it. 


I never called her names. But, I wouldn't be nice over text, especially if I wasn't happy. It was all just very immature. Now that I have had time to reflect and think about everything that happened, I am ashamed of my actions. I'd say the last few weeks leading up to the end was the straw that broke the camels back. 

We had a big fight in mid February. She wanted to end the relationship. I asked her to give me one last shot to change, because I wanted to change and didn't want to lose her. I did everything that I said I would do, and she acknowledged it. But the damage was too deep, and she couldn't put the past behind her. I don't blame her for ending the relationship, I am just sorry I didn't recognize my issues sooner and try to change my behavior. But, I recognize my mistakes and want to make sure that I don't repeat them. I don't want to hurt someone else. I want to be able to love again at one point. And I want to receive the love, and contribute to a happy, healthy stress free relationship. At the end of it, our relationship was toxic. In November, things were great. She wrote on my anniversary card, how the past year had been the best of her life. And, I ruined it. She had a bunch of family issues come up November to present day, but instead of relieving the stress.. I added to it. Maybe I didn't know how to respond when she was in need.. I don't know. 

Firstly, thank you for reading. I know I put a lot out there. I don't think I am a horrible person. But I know that ultimately I did not treat her how she deserved to be treated. Am I just immature, or is there something bigger wrong with me? I don't have a lot of friends, I feel kinda isolated. I wonder.. if that has anything to do with the pressure that I put on her to be there for me. I have a feeling that it does. 

Anyways, thank you again for your time. ",07Apr2018,12,

One moment he is the 11 year old himself. Then he falls asleep out of nowhere and wakes up a different person. He's like in a trans. I ask him questions like how old he is and sometimes he answers with 3, sometimes 5 etc. He also behaves that way. It's as if his subconscious takes over and goes back to a younger him.

46,"Using a throwaway to post this- I'm scared that someone will identify me. I posted this on /r/relationships originally, where some helpful people gave me some great advice. I was told to post this here, so here it is. I added more than in the original post, but just wanted to talk about this. I'm just hoping someone could give me insight on what is wrong with me.

 My brain is scattered, so if this post is unclear, sorry to everyone on this subreddit. I just want somewhere to talk about my issues. I grew up as a young kid with my father's love (or so I believed as a small child) The past few years though, he would guilt trip, punish, and otherwise just yell at me for anything that I would do that otherwise didn't fall perfectly in line with what he wanted from me. It wasn't until the past couple years that I started to feel physically unsafe. His emotionally and verbally abusive behaviour also increased. He became a severe alcoholic until the point where he started to insult me- yelling horrible things and even threatened to attack me. The rest of my family and I were forced to move out of the house we grew up in.


Because of this, my life has been blown in all directions. I don't know if I'm mentally unhealthy or not, though I strongly believe I am. Even though I am now away from my dad, I have become extremely flighty. If anyone touches me where I can't see them, I will freak out. Sometimes when someone yells at me, I start shaking and flashback to my dad yelling at me. I have lost interest in things I used to enjoy. For one, writing. I used to sit in my room and writer stories for hours on end. I was starting to get into screen writing and was hoping to continue to study that and then possibly go to university and get a career in that field because I loved it. But every time I try to write, I am reminded of my father. I have lost my spark for many other things to. I just feel empty.


Sometimes I feel as if I am going insane. I have long gaps in memory during the day- sometimes I'm on the laptop at 3:00 and then all of the sudden it is 8:00. My mother frequently calls me a liar for things I have no recollection of doing. Sometimes my friends say I did things that I don't remember doing and it scares me. One time, I heard a dog barking. It continued to do so for a few minutes- during this time I asked my mother if she had heard the dog (she was sitting with me at the time) and she said no. Sometimes I hear voices, although they just come and go as a few short words. They are always different people though. Sometimes, they are sentences.


I have told my mother about these symptoms so I could go get evaluated. She just told me what I was experiencing was normal teenager problems and all of them would go away if I stopped overthinking things and just hung out with my friends more often. I don't know who could help me anymore. I just want to go back to the person I was before or at least be close to it. I have no idea what to do or what is wrong with me.

I'm in currently in high school and I'm a female. I've always been very diligent and self-motivated, and was very smart when I was younger. I take challenging courses and maintain a high GPA. However, I go to an extremely competitive school in a very wealthy county. I feel like I don't do enough and it absolutely wrecks me mentally. I grew up playing soccer but was too afraid to try out. I run pretty regularly and want to try out for cross country in the fall but I have a feeling I'll be too anxious when the time comes around. I'm involved in clubs, but I feel like it's not enough. I constantly compare myself to my peers. Everyone seems to do everything at once. Perfect GPA, perfect SAT, plays sports, in clubs, does internships, tons of friends, perfect instagram feed, beautiful, talented, and just look so happy. I'm so jealous of everyone. I don't feel talented and I don't feel attractive. In fact I feel so unattractive that I often spend up to an hour at a time looking at myself, touching my face and being displeased. If i catch an unflattering glimpse of myself then my mood is ruined for hours. I have good friends and I love spending time with them. It's probably the only time I'm really happy. When I'm alone I feel absolutely horrible and useless. 

I think I'm getting worse. I've realized I've lost interest in all my hobbies. I have no current obsession. No show I love to watch, nothing I want to learn about, no significant other to obsess over. I don't want to draw anymore. I don't want to watch netflix or play video games anymore. I'm developing bad habits too. I can't stop bouncing my leg when I sit, and I subconsciously wring my hands nervously and pick at my fingernails. I always feel like I'm on the verge of tears. I go to bed early so I don't have to be awake and bored. I feel like my brain is in slow-motion and I have tunnel vision. In class, I feel too drained to do my work, so I just sit. In school, I feel so bored, miserable and confined that I want to cry. I know I shouldn't feel like this because i have a good family, a nice house, and good friends. What's wrong with me?

Now I have bpd and people hate me, I work hard to change and spend hours doing research and looking up better ways to overcome my disorder. I care about the people I affect and I want to be a safe and healthy person to be around. 

I know people with anxiety and depression who take meds and treat me like shit. They act like taking medication is the worst thing to happen for them. I want to have children one day and I don’t know if I’ll ever be healthy enough to actually be a mother. I want to be loved one day but no one will stay.

I know everyone’s emotions are valid and everyone deserves to feel as they do but as I struggle with life no one is here for me.

So now one year and a month have passed and I changed a lot about my lifestyle. Made new friends and moved into a new house with them. Started exercising weekly, new hobby, etc. I feel a lot better then I used to.

Now the thing is that sometimes I feel completely 'normal', life is in control, I have an overview of my day, week, year, all emotions are there and are relative and my self image is coherent with my real life situation. However, almost on a daily basis I still feel like I'm pulled from reality, emotions are gone, overview is gone and life is not in control.

55,"Hey everyone. I'm looking to see if anyone has any ideas on how to deal with strong long-lasting anxiety produced by confrontations, even tiny ones, or maybe other people who feel the same way.  
  
I don't like confrontations, but having to have one isn't as much the problem for me as the way they leave me feeling, sometimes for the entire day afterwards. No matter how small it may be, whenever I get into any kind of confrontation I'm left with my mind reeling, my heart thumping, nervous fidgety ticks firing off, swarmed by feelings of angry self-loathing, depression and catastrophic thinking, for hours and hours and hours.  
  
I can't seem to just let things go and move on. I'll dwell on it, and even come back to it many times in future. I should also mention I have an anger problem, not only can these situations make my depression go from 0 to 100 in a matter of seconds, I do so with anger as well. Yeah, as you can see I'm a real winner. Whenever I feel these rages I also feel my heart thumping, my face flush, hands shaking, kind of  dizzy even. I try really hard to not have it effect how I behave in the situation (I don't start screaming or swearing or anything) but I think it's at least obvious that I was annoyed. Then I'm left super low afterwards, filled with anxiety and self-loathing for the rest of the day for being such a shitty person.  
  
I hate it, and I hate myself for reacting like this to situations that other people can just shrug off. I can be a mess for a whole day over a mean landlord refusing to help with something, yet my friends can get into freaking fist fights or screaming matches with people and just laugh them off five minutes later and forget about by the next day. I know this might make you think I'm some soft pampered kid who's never hard any real problems, but my background is anything but soft or privileged and since I was quite young I live with constant serious problems that I have to deal with on my own. You can imagine how I react whenever the big problems come up. This means I end up feeling like this quite often. Instead of a hard life making me strong it's just made me a pathetic mess.  
  
How do I calm myself down and move on from things? Or how do I just avoid being set off to the max at the drop off a hat? Breathing exercises don't help, believe me I've tried. I'm also living in a country foreign to me, so finding an English speaking therapist is out of the question - not to mention my price range - and I have very few people I'm close to here that I can turn to. I feel very alone in this so I'm hoping maybe someone on Reddit can help me out in any way possible.  
  
I'm sorry for the wall of text and hope I haven't broken any sub rules. Thanks for reading.",07Apr2018,4,

I don't know how to parent now.  She has two younger siblings here, and I am questioning every decision I make for them, and second guessing every word I say to them.

59,"I apologize in advance, this will probably be long. TL;DR: my nephew in California was diagnosed bipolar 3 years ago, he's 26. His wife had the paperwork to contact his doctor about his meds, which she did. They were changed, and she did so without notifying him. No gradual switch, just a pill swap. Manic episode set in very suddenly. He made great money at his job, which he's now lost and is going to court in Victorville over next Thursday because he destroyed some property. His wife kicked him out and has a restraining order on him. I have a lot to say about this that is feels related but to keep things brief I'll refrain. 

My parents drove to California from Nevada (they have residences in both states) after the psych hold my nephew was put on elapsed. I'm told it was a four day hold that he talked his way out of in two days. He got a Rx for Zyprexa and a ADHD stimulant. My parents got him a hotel room after, but he roamed the streets at night running up tabs at restaurants and bars, gave his clothes away, and got robbed of his stimulant meds when he invited strangers back to his room. During the day my parents took him to the gym, stocked his fridge, and errands he needed to do were done. He didn't seem to sleep. He sometimes got confrontational and angry with them, so they didn't feel safe having him at their house. They're 79 and 67 years old and can't physically restrain him or defend themselves. Nothing physical happened, but the posturing was there so my nephew at a hotel was a safety measure. He got into a verbal altercation with management and got kicked out after a month. 

Parents did get him to Kaiser for drug testing because the only treatment center they found with a bed was for drugs and alcohol. Nephew was clean, treatment center option evaporated based on that.  Now he's stabilized a little, so he's staying at their house with them but the posturing continues over what would (usually) be minor stuff. His demeanor is described to me as hyper, child-like, needy, and argumentative. Not a judgment, I fully sympathize with him and understand he's in need of treatment. 

My parents are doing their best but aren't the best help right now. Since he's going to court in less than a week the treatment center lookout is on hold pending the judge. My mom is talking about hoping for house arrest and the possibility he could work again. He's been kicked out of Kaiser and Costco in the last week for verbal fights with staff, employment doesn't seem like a priority right now. When this happens my mom breaks his Zyprexa in half and gives it to him. She has no idea if he's taking it because she doesn't want to make him mad by asking. Regardless, I have a son with Autism who takes Abilify and breaking antipsychotics in half at random is NOT how this works. I think she hears me, but finding a doctor with no insurance who will see him on short notice has proven impossible so far. I don't know what to do other than email her info on his meds and hope she gets it.

So far I've told her to save all of his bipolar documentation and his clean drug test results for his lawyer on Thursday in the hopes that he can be referred to a mental health court. I'm in Texas, do those exist in California? The goal is to get him into court mandated treatment. In my pov employment, his wife, permanent dwelling, everything falls after getting him stabilized on his meds and off this manic swing. Maybe court is the only way to do it, I don't know. Considering how every mental health place so far is full I'm at a loss for what to do or how to help other than helping with the costs of him living with my parents. He told me what protein drinks and bars he likes, ear buds, and what clothes he needs since giving his others away, so he's got some small comforts and a work/court appropriate wardrobe. We talk, but it's about his feelings on the situation rather than logistics. I don't want to stress him out so I don't bring it up and let him lead the conversation.  

I know a lot depends on how court goes on Thursday, but what else can I do to help? Any good California mental health resources? I'm drowning here in all the state laws that I don't know and don't want to chase non possibilities. Thank you for any advice.",07Apr2018,2,

61,"I've been changing a lot of the past few months.  I've been branching out, getting over social anxiety, and low self esteem, shyness, and low self worth.  I didn't whine and complain about this about a week ago.  I chose to go to the laundromat to have my laundry done and not go home for the weekend.  My mom called and I noticed she was cutting me down.  It wasn't out of concern, she was actually cutting me down.  Ex: She asked whether or not I was with someone when I was at the coffee shop. Sounds innocuous right? Well, no.  She knows I don't have many friends (that's changing. I'm getting over things and I'm making friends), and she said that only to put me.  I don't think I'm crazy, that conversation was all put downs, and designed to inject insecurity to make me feel incapable of taking care of myself.  My dad just called, and it was a never ending slew of shaming, worry and anxiety. That's all the conversation was.

Yeah, I'm just whining aren't I? I don't think so unfortunately.  ",07Apr2018,3,

66," For better context, I'm 17 years old (which is the age of consent in NY), gay, and considering yet unsure of the prospects of dating, kissing, and sex. My mental health has vastly improved over the years, yet I feel rather afraid if that is a boundary I am willing to cross.  Since the beginning of my adolescence, I haven't really given much thought about interacting with another person in such a deeply intimate way until recently because to put it simply, I early on in life that I REALLY need to focus on myself first. To make a long story short, I was molested at the age of 7 which led to major implications going forward like: depression so ""edgy"" I was indefinitely incapable of functioning in a public school where I was a top student so I was; had a fucking dissociation in a middle of a therapy session; had my first of 7 psych ward admissions when I was 13, with 15+ ERs; Borderline Personality Disorder (no one is shocked, lol); PTSD (again, no one is shocked); Lithium overdose; threatened to be sent to a residential; and me jumping into traffic (I was thankfully left unscathed) which in hindsight led to me having a hell of a turn (no pun intended) for the better. Fast forward to today, I have been in remission for depression for almost a year; haven't self-harmed in over two years; haven't made a suicide attempt (which also meant I haven't been hospitalized either); and while I am still working through my trauma, my life mostly consists of ordinary happiness and unhappiness like anybody else would. There is a guy who likes me and I like him back, which in itself isn't something I am worried about. What I am worried is the prospect of dating anyone for that matter which could potentially lead to sex, and the idea of me doing it makes me feel unreasonably anxious, vulnerable and tainted. I will never shame anyone for what they do the bedroom, and I know it is absurd to view myself as tainted, yet I feel it deeply. I wish to optimistic about this in the long term, but for now, it just pains me for how obvious my past affect this aspect of my life which involves someone else's.",07Apr2018,2,
67,"I'm fine during the day but at night I feel scared, vulnerable, something is missing, empty, Sad and Don't have a desire for anything. It happens every once in a while and then goes away for a bit.

I have a fear of the dark but I have learnt how to control that.

I want to understand why I feel this way and how to control this, I like knowing exactly everything is fine and safe, at night I'll start to worry about my online accounts and I go down everything to make sure it's all secure. Is there something else mentally that is happening to me? I don't like not knowing what is going on because I become paranoid. I'm just so confused.",07Apr2018,1,
