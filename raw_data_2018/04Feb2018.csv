1,"My family has a medical record of mental illness and — about two years ago — my family sent me to a psychologist to treat my ""self-destructive phase"".

I feel like I'm starting to go back to it, and that — even though I've just reached my 19 years of age — I'm failing at life.

I like writing, but I feel like I should be better at it for my age.

I like drawing, but I feel like I've wasted my opportunity to improve it, and that it's too late for me to take art classes.

I like cooking, but I get angry whenever I mess up, and I feel like crap for the rest of the day afterwards.

I like reading, but seeing how other people have worse problems than mine in those stories makes me feel like I'm weak — that I should be better at what I do and complain less whenever I fail myself.

I try to give it my best studying for college, but I panic whenever I realize I'll have more B's than A's at the end of the semester. I have a firm belief that — if I'm sh*t at everything else — I shouldn't be failing at the one thing that will help me get a career.

I feel like I'm falling behind at my age, and that I'll never get to make a future for myself. I fear I'll be a pest to my family if I don't stop this now.

Any advice as to how to lessen these thoughts? I feel like I'm going back to my period of self-destruction, and I really don't want to go back to it.",04Feb2018,3

4,"I am asking because I've been going to therapy since October following a nervous breakdown. It's going very well, but outside of therapy I've struggled in stabilizing (it's taken a long time to recover).

I would say my biggest struggles are panic/anxiety from all the stress.

Given that therapy is going well, I'm worried that an antidepressant will somehow mess with my emotions, and it won't be the same. It's really important to me to emotionally process things the same way -- particularly since my root issues are emotional repression.

I also worry that if I have a darker emotion I need to experience (like anger or resentment), the antidepressant will hide that.",04Feb2018,1
5,"I know this question may be obvious, but can you tell me how your experience with taking medication while seeking therapy treatment helped you? How do they work together?

--------

In part, I'm asking this because I'm in therapy now following a nervous breakdown (panic/anxiety mostly, but depression too). I have been hesitant to take an antidepressant for fear that it'll diminish my emotions, however it's also taking a long time to recover from this breakdown mentally and physically.",04Feb2018,3
6,"Why am I such a bitch to my boyfriend when he's sick. I'm mopey, distant and just miserable when he's ill. 

Background: 
1.) My bf has poor immunity (obviously not his fault) and gets a cold about once a month, this week has been the worst in a while, thought it was the flu considering the massive outbreak recently but he tested negative.

2.) I've been having trouble with social anxiety all my life but it's gotten a bit out of control the last few months. Makes me feel worthless, weak, the whole shpeil, although I don't think it's the reason for my behaviour.

3.) I want to be the perfect girlfriend that's sweet and supportive emotionally, I should say he's not the complaining big baby that apparently men turn into when they don't feel well. He basically doesn't require anything extra of me except for running out for medicine, food, or a bit of cooking, nothing I mind doing, it being easier anxiety wise knowing he needs these things. (Normally I won't go out more than absolutely necessary because I think anyone who sees me instantly hates me, irrational I know but hey social anxiety)

I guess my anxiety does have a role in this because I rely on him for emotional support and reassurance and I don't feel like I can do that while he's sick. Instead I feel like the one that's supposed to be picking up his mood. The harder I try the more frustrated I get and the worse I feel for being upset at him for something he can't control, enter endless destructive negative thought cycle. I know I should just stop whining and get over it but I can't drag myself out of this angry disgusting selfish person that I am when I'm not the center of his attention. I hate myself for not being strong enough to be what I should be when he's not 100%, he's always there for me no matter what even with all the crazy stuff I lay on him and he never gets upset or annoyed. I feel disgusting, like a self centered spoiled child, which I probably am, just wondering what you all think.

TL/DR: Feel like a disgusting spoiled child for not being there emotionally for my boyfriend when he's sick.

7,"Hey everyone. I would really love the opinions of some diagnosed schizophrenic people on the following. For background I have a long and complicated history with mental health. I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety three years ago when my SO pushed me to seek help. This was due to a short talk and description of my symptoms which were pretty typical depression symptoms. I was later diagnosed with depression/anxiety/ptsd from another clinic after finding both a therapist and psychologist. During these appointments I always told the truth and tried to stay open, but I had never fully divulged the scope of my illness. The following is very difficult for me as I don’t want anyone to think I’m crazy, but here goes. When I was a kid I invented people to help me deal with my issues. My parents were dreadful and we moved to often for me to have friends, so I created them. At the start there many of them adults, kids, you name it. However, eventually a man named Sarge took over. This guy helped me through life and was there for the majority of my formative years. Yet again, I’m not crazy. Him and the others also gave me gifts throughout these years. Little things like toys that no one would know where they came from. The age this ran was 5-12, but it didn’t end there. At 13, after not seeing or communicating with these thoughts for a while, I saw the grim reaper. This is no means a light subject. I figure it was due to stress because I was at my grandmothers bedside. I saw him point to me after recognizing I saw him and then point to my grandmother after. Not in a menacing way just in a hey I’m just sort of waiting you guys out then she’s gone. She died that night. Throughout the years following these experiences I would have flare ups where I would see or hear things, but overall they weren’t a major part of my life. That is up till recently. I took on a major job working on a game title I cannot discuss due to NDA, it’s dope though. I believe yet again the stress is triggering symptoms and I have begun to see and hear things more often. Every time I masturbate I hear people making fun of me, and this isn’t just laughing I mean full on commentary. Another example would be seeing people around me when I am in bed. Yet again they do nothing menacing they are just there walking around and chatting while I’m trying to sleep. Really I don’t want to think I’m crazy. I never wanted to be diagnosed with this disease, but I am unsure I can continue to live my life knowing there could be a simple solution. ",04Feb2018,4
8,"I’ve never at any point in my life had plans for my future. Nothing sounds like it’s worth working towards. Either I talk myself out of a goal or completely forget about it within a few days. People say just keep throwing stuff at the wall until something sticks but I can’t figure out why at this age not one thing has felt like sticking with. I am not able to stay on target for any goal. I’m also not able to stay consistent with anything. I’ve been on 20 mg Prozac for about 6 years now. I have no strong personal relationships and no real vision for my future. Nothing in life seems achievable or worth achieving and I don’t know where to start to find some hope for my future. I’ve seen therapists before but it doesn’t do anything for me long term. Eventually I just revert to my old habits, ",04Feb2018,3

10,"Very rarely I get hypersensitive and empathic to peoples emotional states. As if I’ve been color blind for the past years and suddenly I can see a whole new spectrum. As if I’ve been living on mute and then it got dialled up to 11.

I feel like that only when smoking weed (haven’t in years).

The experience is scary for several reasons:
1. It makes me question my reality. Am I making these things up or are people actually feeling like that. 
2. People tell me I am sociopathic/autistic/schizoid etc. I do not agree. However, in moments like that I feel as if they actually have a point.
3. I become massively creative and that makes me feel like I am not truly alive 99% of the time. I want to know how to reach this sensitive state when I want to.
4. My lack of awareness becomes apparent and shockingly scary.

Is this a symptom?
Could meditation make you numb?

I cannot seem to get my ex boyfriend (who raped me, abused me, and drove me to a suicide attempt) out of my mind. The doctors say it's because of my BPD. I feel like I am spinning out of control. I've been doing everything that I can since my suicide attempt to change who I am and stay off the grid. I just want a new identity and to start over. Now I'm getting these impulses to do insane destructive things that I wouldn't normally do: speed down the highway and shoot out the window with a gun, have sex with all of my ex's best friends, do a shit-ton of drugs, kill someone, kill myself, set my ex's house on fire, etc.

15,"It’s like the title says. Recently tried to hang myself, haven’t told anyone (no one to really tell to be honest) but am thinking of seeking out a school counselor so they can refer me to professional mental help (if it’s deemed necessary). However, my parents are extremely stressed and preoccupied with things. For example, my mother recently had cancer (it went into remission luckily) but she is definitely preoccupied with physical health. 

Moreover, I’m worried the counselor will call my parents. Actually this is inevitable, and understandable (parents should know if their kid tried to kill themselves) but I really don’t want my parents to have a mental breakdown and stress more than they already have ; or worse just disregard or misunderstand whatever the counselor tells them. 

They have disregarded me before— saying you aren’t suffering, you’re mother is (what do you even say to that?), we can just go to a psychiatrist next summer maybe possibly, you don’t know what mental illness is, etc.

So... when am I supposed to talk to my counselor?

16,"Hi guys, I'm new to reddit and am seeking support in this issue I'm facing with my sister when it comes to personal hygiene. 

Here's a little background. I'm 22, and my sister is 24. We have grown up in a single-parent household with a loving mother who is supportive and hardworking, but is exhausted. We lost our father at a very young age and have been through other traumatic family losses as well. My sister did not do well in school (but was able to graduate by the skin of her teeth), was bullied by her peers, and did not join the workforce until about 3-4 years after she finished high school. She still does not have her license and is very dependent on my mother, who is a night shift nurse. I just graduated college and have not had the same challenges with mental health as my sister has, and am more independent. Unfortunately, this causes a lot of comparisons to take place due to the fact that we're so different from one another, and that I am the younger sibling. These comparisons are never overt or stated aloud, but are seen more through the tensions that arise in our household. There were tensions among my mother and sister during her teen years for sure, but I am noticing that they haven't really gone away and are worsening as of late. My mom means well, but she is tired and frustrated. Working nights, she has to sleep during the day and organize her time so that she can bring my sister to and from work or tend to other needs (as my sister will not do chores). Now that I'm officially finished with college, I'm living at home again, and will be for a while and I want to do what I can to help my sister and my mother ease some of the tension and get my sister the help she needs. So I've been making sure to bring my sister to and from work and of course make sure chores are being done. Although there are many issues that need addressing here, the latest one that has caused the most tension is my sister's lack of hygiene/personal upkeep. 

This isn't a new problem by any means--I don't ever recall her being regular with her hygiene. However, it's gotten so bad recently that we can smell her from across the room. My mom can't help but gag at times, and sometimes she'll make comments that are honest, but are of course, very hurtful. I've been trying to help my mom think about other ways to soften her approach. Sometimes she's receptive, other times she's not. My sister will often try to cover up with perfume before she goes to work, but that's a very temporary solution. She keeps her hair pulled back, but it's very matted and I'm worried that it might be beyond repair. I have gently approached this issue with her multiple times, discussing with her the importance of being clean and doing her hair. She always says, ""I know"" but never does anything about it. I know she knows. My mom isn't as soft with her approach, as I've said. She's straightforward and honest, but sometimes in ways that can be hurtful to my sister's self esteem. 

In the past, my sister went to regular therapy sessions, some of which she invited me to attend with her. However, the last appointment she made was in the summertime, which was one I was present at. If she were to make another appointment and would allow me to go with her, I would like to bring this up, but also realize that she would likely be very embarrassed. I have trouble figuring out when I'm overstepping and when I'm helping. Anyway, since she's not seeing her therapist and hasn't for quite some time now, I'm at a loss for what to do or who to turn to do address this issue. I'm worried about this being an issue for her at work or in other public places where people may pass judgement on her. I'm not sure if there's anything else I can do to help her--if so, what can I do? I know she's the one that has to make the decision to shower--but I'm really concerned that she won't because it's been such a long time. If we keep waiting until she's ready...it's going to be a much larger issue than it already is. If anyone has any words of support or ideas for next steps to take, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",04Feb2018,4
17,"Lots of people seem to think that I have an unhealthy focus on violence. My dad wants question my obsession with True Crime documentary shows. Whenever I come up with hypothetical scenarios about violence, and post them on the internet, people accuse me of being mentally perverse, and say that I need help. And I don't really understand why. It seems as though these people believe that you should only think about negative things for a limited amount of time. And I don't think that's fair. Everybody is interested in different things. And just because somebody is interested in violence, it doesn't mean that they are more likely to commit violence, or remain complicit in violence. And besides, I am autistic, it's so sometimes I get fixated on certain things. And even so, I feel like I have the right to be interested in as many or as few things as I want to be. And people should not assume that I enjoy other people's pain or what have you. The problem, if it can be called a problem, is that the bad things in life are often more interested then the good good things in life. Think about it. What do you watch a movie or read a book where nothing bad happens. Why is it that every time something bad happens, the media is more likely to report it then with something good happens. Humans are hard-wired to be interested in Bad Things. It does not make you a bad person, I feel. But maybe I am out of touch and wrong. And I don't like it when people presume to tell me that I need therapy to deal with that stuff. Yes I do want to go back into therapy, but I am underemployed. I don't have any sort of healthcare insurance coverage. And I haven't yet figured out what types of free services are available in my area. And I don't know what types of Public Assistance I am eligible for, if any, such as any free insurance plan under Obamacare, or Medicaid or whatever else the government offers. And so I take offense to people telling me to get help, not knowing that I'm not able to do that this time. And I just feel very very unsupported in misunderstood. I feel like people are being very judgmental towards me.

20,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the right sub for this but I texted my friend last weekend and asked if she wanted to hang out over the weekend but she never responded. Although we’ve texted since then, she never really brought up the fact that she completely ignored my message asking if she wanted to hang out. 

Just to be clear, she sometimes doesn’t answer my texts out of nowhere—like we’ll be having a nice conversation and then all of a sudden she just won’t respond and the conversation stops. A lot of times she doesn’t reply to my texts. I’m generally fine with this because I’ve gotten used to it and I understand that she’s always really busy, but I have a hard time believing that she can’t just take 5 seconds to text me back and say “Hey, sorry but I’m really busy this weekend. Maybe next weekend?” or something, and spare me all this worry and all these invasive thoughts. 

The fact that she can’t just respond really quick to me asking her to hang out over the weekend often gives me a ton of invasive unwanted thoughts when I think about it. I always wonder if she’s quicker to respond to her other friends because they’re funner to be around and better than me. I always think what if she only hangs out with me at this point because I comfort her when she’s upset and she comes to me with all her trouble and I help her? Last time we were out together I feel like I talked too much and the time before that I feel like I didn’t talk enough (granted, I feel like we’re close enough that any silence between us is never awkward) and what if she’s annoyed by that? 

I know all of this isn’t true. I know she cares about me—just a few weeks ago she told me she couldn’t ask for a better friend. I just love her so much, more than anyone in the world, and I’m afraid of doing wrong by her, and I’m afraid that I am. I know I’m not, but I just can’t shake these invasive feelings.

Slowly, even simple things are becoming a task to understand. Whether it be understanding what people say in conversation, following a podcast or reading a couple of lines from a book, everything to do with processing information has become unbelievably difficult. I either take a very long time or can’t understand at all. Metaphors are particularly hard to connect and understand. I also don’t find anything funny anymore. Even when I do understand the intent behind a joke, I can’t find it in myself to take pleasure in it and laugh. Everything I do now seems to be out of habit or instinct. I still laugh occasionally at something that would be considered funny but it seems to me that I only do it because I’ve been used to doing it for all my life, which is a pretty long time to establish a solid habit. Another example would be I’d read a piece of poetry that I used to like or a new piece of poetry that I feel I would have liked before all this, feel a tinge of something, also what I suspect to also be the cause of a well-established habit and then it would immediately go away. I’m scared of what will happen after the habits have faded away completely. I used to be a big fan of the arts. I’d be able to find it in my heart to appreciate even the most awful creations from any medium (books, poetry, movies etc) as well as understand and enjoy daunting literature for my age but now it’s all gone. It feels like a chunk of my brain has shut down. When it first started, I was convinced it was a temporary thing and that it would go away on its own...

26,"I've been through alot the last year and I've started to take care of problems that I have. I just realized a big reason why I'm not that assertive and I would like some feedback.

It all started when I was young, I didn't get the respect I wanted from people around me. I was often bullied, teased and punched but I didn't have a real problem communicating with other people. But it made me draw back from other people and become more isolated. A big problem from that was because I often had problem with skin rashes and diseases which worsened the problem.

It got better when I was around 13-14. I had always been practicing sports, ishockey, football, wrestling and a bunch of other stuff. Around that time I was putting on some serious weight and gained some big muscles as compared to the rest. My main motivating factor was to scare away everyone else. And it worked. People were starting to harass me less because they knew if they put me on the serious wrong spot they would get messed up. But a problem remained. I manage to stop people from harrassing me and I gained respect from others. But I still in my head remained in that weak spot I was in before, I didn't take any initaitves, I was non-assertive.

I continued to do the same. Workout at the gym 5 times a week for years and years on end, I called it as a religous experience, something you gotta do. I got more and more respect from people, even the biggest people started respecting me. But today I'm 23, still very big compared to other people but I lack the ability to take initative and to be assertive. For example I often take on lots of responsibility because I feel like I need to be nice and because I have a problem to say no. This often results in me destroying everything for myself because I get to much responsability till I snap. I had a period a year ago where I just dropped everything went apeshit towards everyone who put the responasailbity on me, they saw me differnetly after that. ´ I've started to take care of it, sort of. I've started doing things that scare me. It gets me alot of adrenaline but it also gives me alot of anxiety when it dropps of. I feel like the biggest boss player around one minute and a weak person the next. I watched Jordan Petersons videos and read the book No more mr.nice guy and he talked alot about fire learning to be agressive and then become passive to learn your real power. I'm thinking about also starting to take up MMA if that might help me, I also booked in a time to parachute jump because why the hell not.

I was out partying yesterday for the first time in a while after my first real girlfriend of like 1 month broke up with me a couple of weeks ago, then it dawned on me. I often have problem getting what I want, I seem to wait and be polite rather then go for it. I don't know why, I get nervous because it scares me being with girls and I assume it makes me even more non-assertive which made her less attracted to me. I'm going to therapy for the first time in a couple of days which I hope will help me, but I wanted to get a headstart because I can't stop thinking about this stuff it's like a rabbit hole and it goes on and on and on. It makes me question everything that I've ever done which makes me regret stuff and gives me more anxiety.

One things for sure, it feels good to write everything of.

tl:dr: I get respect from other people but lack the ability to dominated and be assertive, how can I become more assertive?

28,"So, basically my story with HOPEFULLY Harm-OCD began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific.
Here is what happens.
After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Feeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.

Less interest in people.

Less apetite.

Sudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.

Nearly constant, uneasiness.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific: 
Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows:
It is triggered randomly.
This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

Also, when I am feeling fine, I do not feel completely fine, the background feeling is still there, I just somehow convince myself that it is OCD, and I feel happy about it. Of course, the doubt if it is OCD is still there and I still obsess I catch myself sometimes and stop, but still i destroy my reasurance and It starts to feel bad again. Another thing is my mood is not normal, it is close to my normal self, but not completely, as I mentioned and I have days in which it hits and my mood is low, then I start obsessing if it is depression and it makes it worse, when it happens a feeling like i fought with the bg feeling appear and like now I am exausted and it hits and make me more anxious. I even asked my friends if i speak too fast or change topics too fast or look overly happy etc. Multiple times to see what they will tell me.(they said no.)

29,"I work overnights in a gas station. I’ve had trouble holding down more serious jobs in the past due to my anxiety and my depression, those conditions dating back to when I was a teenager (I’m 24 now.)

Last night, a man came in with a gun and demanded the money in the register. While he was thwarted in his efforts to get anything, I was and still am shaken by what occurred. I already am on such shaky ground and while I am on the right batch of medications right now, I worry that this may worsen my conditions even more.

Does anyone have any advice? Maybe gone there something similar? I just want to live as normal and healthy life as possible and continue to get on the right path to overcoming my illness.",04Feb2018,4

For example, if i see something in tv about suicide, ill think about suicide for myself despite not been depressed then i just get stuck in a cycle of thinking about it not really reaching any sort of meaningful conclusion until another random thread is started. It perplexs me tbh and at worst is painful.

34,"I had a nervous breakdown last June that I'm still recovering from. This happened as I was living at home with my parents following my college graduation (2 years ago), and me reaching my absolute limit. The root issues have to do with codependency, an inner passive identity, and relationship issues with mom.

I was in such a bad state in June -- I was so angry, and I told myself I am so determined to fix this and stop feeling like shit about myself. I was SO over it.

I've been going to a therapist stably since October. Therapy has been so helpful and we're making such good progress, my therapist has stated we're going at ""lightening speed.""

I am stressed, however, because I absolutely hate my hometown and was so over it in June already. Like I can't stand it, I regret even staying here. I want to be in NYC with my friends, thus I haven't made the effort to find a new job or reach out to people here.

So it's this uncomfortable situation of being at home (even longer than I had planned) and all these deeper issues coming up, that I know if I just worked through I'd be better.

To add to the stress, I just started taking an antidepressant, and I know it can take a while before you find the right one so now I'm worried this will delay my time from leaving home even sooner.

40,"Know let me begin by saying I am trying to be as truthful as possible with this. It is difficult for me write all this, in fact I feel quite queezy right now knowing i am about to write all this.

Know understand that i am not one of those people that think mental illness is cool or what not (yes i have met a few people like that).

First i will begin by describing myself and somethings i do. First off i am eighteen in my senior year in high school about to go off to college this fall. I have chosen to go to a college hundreds of miles away in an effort to avoid as many people i know as possible. I do not like being around people, doing things with them, or talking. I do have friends, really i have quite a bit. Really i just don't have many enemies. My friends very seldom invite me to do things with them but find it just fine discussing their plans with myself present. Really the people i enjoying being around the most are not the people i have known sense 1st grade, but just two people i have known for a while but only recently got to known through one of my classes. This spring break three friends and myself are going down to the beach to i guess vacation. One of them has a condo and invited us along. This is the first time all of us has done anything all together sense 8th grade. I should be happy but i think its nothing more than a set up to embarrass me and harass me as they always do when we are all together. one of them is an upcoming womanizer (he has hooked up with probably a dozen girls) and the other is always in a relationship (sense 7th grade never spent more than 3 months without a girlfriend). And they love to tease me about this. I have never had a girlfriend i made the mistake of tell the Womanizer that i liked one girl in 8th grade and has sense taken every possible opportunity to shout this out to everyone while i am around. I should get past it but i can't.

Just a couple days ago one of my friends was snickering and giggling at me in a malicious way. he was mocking me and trying to get my other friends in the class to join in. I wasn't going to have it that day. So i got up and moved after telling him off. Well he got all hurt and tried to act all buddy buddy for the rest of class. people do this all the time mocking me and telling me they weren't. I can always tell by that ridiculously smug grin they all wear. Even those people i enjoy being with the most do it from time to time.

I get paranoid. There is no better way to say it. I know i do. I am always looking at the cars up to four behind me to see if they are following me. If they are I drive erratically and fast to loose them. I never choose food objects in the front or back out of fear of someone poisoning them. I believe someone did poison me with an elaborate plan while i was touring colleges a couple months ago. (Its quite long so i won't out it down). When ever someone calls me to go somewhere I get very anxious and paranoid. For example anytime my dad calls me and go with him to get something i asked for or he wants to show me something i pick up some sharp object and follow him at a distance rounding corners very carefully. I have no reason for this behavior but i do it. My administration at my school is conspiring against me. Last year there something fishy going on out side my English class with my teacher being called out to be spoken to. Admin poking their heads in gazing across the class. I swear i nearly screamed and panicked. I was so anxious i could not sit still or barely think straight. Just thinking about it makes me relive it a bit. The tea machine in the cafeteria is broken and the admin broke it. (i won't get into that very much) or the teacher and student that i have never seen before roaming the halls. It's safe to say that there are far too many coincident's in my life.

Another of my friends i swear is an upcoming serial killer. I have refused to do thinks with him before out of fear of him trying to kill me. When he had a bit of a get together on a Friday the 13th I was in a panic and it took two of my other friends to convince me to come. The thing is is that he never tried anything and never has that i am aware of but i still do not trust him. Another of my friends (or lost friend) is a narcissist. I hate him. I Really don't know how to spot a narcissist but this guy is one, i just know it.

you know those paper swans. I make those. a lot. Its good luck, right? I need luck in life. to keep the bad spirits away and propel myself forward through it all. But everyone thinks it strange i do this. I place a penny face up through door ways i travel through daily. and i never drive my car through those clouds of black birds. I am just now doing this because yesterday got an intense feeling of dismay and turmoil. Even when i just sat in my car waiting for them to move. It was an omen because that day someone have very little trust for reentered my life through being present in someone else's life.

I think i have said it before but i enjoy being alone. People complicate things and are always against me. I rarely have positive feelings. and i do my best to avoid people. I tend to be near panic in a crowd or when i am the center of attention. But sometimes its switched. and how i love it! I smile all the time, i am full of energy, i disrupt class and am so chatty. I just can't help myself. i feel invincible emotionally and and physically. Its great. If i have a presentation i get up and ramble all over the place taking over and making everyone laugh. (i have won numerous presentation competition this way). The thing is is that this always short lived and i can crash very hard afterwards. I love this because i love life when i am like that, but not so much otherwise. I would never kill myself. Its embarrassing and petty in my eyes. but i do feel for the losses of thousand because of it. I just would never do. I could see myself being reckless a having a death wish but never putting a gun to my head.

I have never had a girlfriend. I am a little embarrassed by this. I have a idea of the girl i want to date and love. I am not a very superficial person. I just want to get that out there, but i am very particular about personalities. I would like her to be a bit of a tom boy. Tough and physical, plays sports like basketball, softball, cross country, or soccer. She wouldn't wear skinny jeans or dye her hair that ugly blond so many do. She would like to go out and door all sorts of things outside. It's unfair for me to be so particular about girls while at the same time wanting to be in a relationship so badly.

Personalities are important to me. they should be to every one else too. They are who we are. It is the most valuable thing we have. I am very afraid of people stealing mine. They can do this. Serial killers do it, narcissists do it, therapists do it, and your friends do it (sometimes).

I have never been very much like the other people i am around. I don't conform to what they want. I have only ever followed one TV show, i despise sports (playing them and following them), my music tastes are incredible irregular even bipolar at times i love some metal and then i love some folk or country. i have never gotten into any of the music everyone else listens to.

I have no real plans for my future. I haven't the slightest clue of what i want to study or do. I feel like i will not have a future so i refuse to plan for it.

I know this was long and i thank you if you read it. I know i left somethings out; i have trouble remembering things. The thing is is that there can't be anything wrong with me. Just what are the chances that I am the one who is crazy or insane. Its genetic ins't it? There have been no one in my family with any mental illness other than an emotionally unstable aunt. I always end up saying ""I know I am not, but I think I am."" I say it on repeat sometimes for up to half an hour or an hour. I am pretty sure i am mentally feeble. Just gonna throw that in there. Just i cant be and i feel like i somehow making all this up. Like all that i do and think is nothing more than my imagination and nothing is really wrong with me. I am incredibly embarrassed by this, you understand. I mean i KNOW i am not, BUT i think i am.

If you have anything to say go ahead. We will probably never meet.

I haven't seen a counselor many times--my university allows you to go 4 times quarter and there's a cap--but as my sessions have begun to run out or come to a close, I find myself making my story seem not as bad as it feels or trying to tie it up as a happy ending. I'm not sure why. Maybe I just want to make the counselor feel like they didn't just waste their time and I feel like I'm not progressing or understanding the purpose of being there quickly enough.

46,"I know there's a bunch of actual therapists hanging out in here so maybe you can give me some reading material.

TL, DR: Due to childhood abuse which I will not get into here much, my main mode of ""fueling"" myself seems to be verbal conflict; meaning that expressing anger, frustration, impatience and all that pent-up energy towards someone else is what makes me feel sane when things accumulate. Pressure builds up and I just **need** to get it out explosively, and verbally, either in writing or in person; but there has to be an impact on someone else. (I do realize this is probably a form of sadism, but do sadists feel remorse!? Because I do, eventually.)

Writing letters and burning them unread doesn't really work, neither does journaling. Screaming at myself doesn't work. Exhausting myself physically? Just makes me more frustrated because I didn't get the release I was ""looking for"". Does this make any sense?

It's like an addiction. I am addicted to flinging sh*t at people! (If your reaction is to say ""well just stop it, duh"": quit reading, go try to help someone else, you can't help me.)

---

This is my throwaway profile to indulge in verbal uh, ""sparring"", but the issue is I realize now I have to get away from this 100% to become a healthier person overall. I'm far enough along this process to really see how incredibly destructive this is, even as it gives me tremendous amounts of energy. I've never done hard drugs but I figure it's gotta be close to how coke feels after seeing folk in movies... after a fight I have enough energy to clean the entire house for two days straight, get 150 things done all one after the other and don't really think of taking any breaks.

I am married and have worked extremely hard to quit the relationship-destroying fighting behavior. Yes I have been abusive in the past, but have moved past this. The last 2 years or so, we get into actual fights (only verbal) less than once every 2-3 months.

Note that I'm working hard to eliminate that entirely because seeing what this has done to my marriage is completely heartbreaking and just makes me want to kill myself. So. Instead of trying to die, I'm going to try to do better. Enough with that!

The reduced fighting frequency is incredible for me because I grew up fighting with both my parents 4, 5 times a week... all-out yelling, screaming at the top of our lungs (which they did to each other before separating), they were also physically abusive towards each other but one parent shielded me from the physical aspects from the other at least. The neighbors in every direction knew exactly how bad it was. 

This continued long after I moved out with a single parent who continued the verbal abusive behavior with me for 10 more years, until I was a young adult and the behavior was well-entrenched. However... funny thing is, that parent also made me completely hate any physical violence due to their disgust over what happened to them, so we never touched each other, just hated each other's guts through words.

To have no fights for 2-3 months on average with my spouse, not even a bad word... is **huge** for me. It'll continue getting better if I can get a handle on this portion of the problem.

The result though is I am listless; anxious, angry, impatient. I have PMDD and at that time of the month it becomes almost impossible to hold in. I hate everything about how I feel because I don't really feel anything unless I break something (verbally) but the results always suck.

I figure I'm repressing all of this energy, I don't know how to create a new outlet that serves the same purpose as fighting. Like I said above... nothing I do by myself seems to work, I need the interaction.

Someone suggested martial arts to me once, or self-defense classes. I don't know if I can bring myself to those because I'm really worried I'm just going to end up physically sadistic as well and I **do not** want to discover if *that* monster exists within me (it's not a possibility I'm ready to face.) I am also not looking forward to being a ""beginner"" at the mercy of anyone more experienced.

47,"I had a nervous breakdown last June after living at home with my parents for 2 years after graduating college. I had reached my limit, because I was keeping deeper issues from them because they aren't the most supportive when it comes to mental health.

Ever since, I've been going to therapy and have been determined to fix my issues and have been making rapid progress. However, I just started taking antidepressants to stabilize further (it's taken a while to recover from the stress, panic, and anxiety).

48,"21/F

I don't even know where to begin. I have no idea what is happening to me, and I have a vague idea of why but I have a hard time believing that it is the main cause of why I feel like I can't control myself.

Some background: A little over a month ago I had to go on a trip to Spain with my family. A couple weeks before that my mom has revealed to my dad that she was going to leave him specifically because she wants to play tennis and meet some new guys... it's terrible and my dad is horribly upset. To top it off my brother still lives at home with them and has to deal with all of this sadness and fighting all around him. The trip was torture, I almost flew out after 2 days because it was awful to see my mom being so mean and just laughing at my dad hysterically whenever he did something wrong, like knock a fork on to the ground in a restaurant or etc. My dad was incredibly depressed and moody. It was the worst 10 days of my life. When I got back home, a pattern has emerged where my dad calls me 4-5 times a day and I can't answer because I'm in school and work 2 jobs, but when I do he's either crying or complaining about mom. My mom on the other hand has made it pretty clear that she is just done and wants to do her own thing. She has maybe talked to me once in the past month and a half. 

I think this may be why I am acting out (see below) but I keep telling myself that it shouldn't. I live away from home and go to a university. I have a really great internship and love what I study. I have friends and a boyfriend (who has been a saint through all this, bless him). 

To put this all into context: I'm usually very happy and positive. I don't give up and I work really hard. Occasionally I get a little upset, but not to the degree of where I am now. As of lately I just kind of snap and totally lose control at any moment. Usually it's when I should just be slightly sad or upset and can get through it by just taking a moment to relax or breathe, but I don't know why this isn't happening.

It will be little things, like I'm with my boyfriend and we are trying to decide on what to do. He feels like he make many decisions so he tries and makes me decide. As of lately I end up snapping and crying and yelling and begging him just to ""tell me to do something because I don't have anything and am not an interesting person""

This above statement just isn't true and I have no idea why it flew out of me. Yesterday it was so bad, I totally broke down wailing and screaming because I just have been having these fits of extreme rage and sadness so constantly, I am so tired of them taking over my life. I don't feel like myself anymore. This past week I was trying so hard not to let them take over but yesterday and today I had two really bad ""episodes"" to the point where my poor boyfriend begged me to leave so he could finish his physics homework. I of course was furious but left. And now sitting down and being clear, I don't blame him because I was just screaming about nothing (we literally just had an hour long argument about coding).

I find myself just getting so mad and this force just taking over. It's like I can't stop it and it consumes everything, and I immediately regret anything I've said or done, and I break down bawling uncontrollably. I am so scared that I am hurting relationships around me because of the way I have been acting and I have no idea how to be myself again. I'm so scared of whatever force has taken me over, it's terrible. I'm miserable and have no idea where to even start to find help. I think there is something seriously wrong but I don't know, I haven't felt like this ever before in my life.

I've given up on things that make me happy. I can't clean my room, I barely do my homework... I'm a filmmaking major and my boyfriend has been trying to cheer me up so he brought me a super 8 camera and film to try filming on, because I never have before, and I keep swinging back and forth between excitement over a movie I could make and screaming about how everything I do is shit, and how I have no ideas and I study ""such bullshit"" and I have ""nothing to do in my life."" I often feel such a strong urge to rip the film out of the camera and cut it up. This is how I feel about a lot of things, and lately it has gotten so bad that I threw my laptop on the ground when a DVD wouldn't work and threw my camera on the ground when my boyfriend begged me to leave for a little bit and calm down, since I was screaming at him over nothing while he tried to do his physics homework- what I got set off by that time was my squarespace site not working, he fixed it, and yet I still threw a fit for 2 hours. Whatever this is, it's getting out of hand and so unlike me. I'm terrified.

I'm sorry if this is really general. I promise it's not usual for me and I am just really scared of what is happening. I need help.",04Feb2018,1

I know this was long and i thank you if you read it. I know i left somethings out; i have trouble remembering things. The thing is is that there can't be anything wrong with me. Just what are the chances that I am the one who is crazy or insane. Its genetic ins't it? There have been no one in my family with any mental illness other than an emotionally unstable aunt. I always end up saying ""I know I am not, but I think I am."" I say it on repeat sometimes for up to half an hour or an hour. I am pretty sure i am mentally feeble. Just gonna throw that in there. Just i cant be and i feel like i somehow making all this up. Like all that i do and think is nothing more than my imagination and nothing is really wrong with me. I am incredibly embarrassed by this, you understand. I mean i KNOW i am not, BUT i think i am. 

I suppose i should clarify why I don't think i am. First no one in my family has anything, i have heard that often people who have real issues don't actually know they have them, it just doesn't feel real like any of it or my life, and why would i have anything? i feel guilty for thinking i do because there are people out there with real problems. not me. my issues are nothing compared to some other people. Plus I am a young adult going through the phase of childhood to adulthood, yes this is the time some mental health issue would surface, but it's also entirely possible i am just reacting poorly to my growing up. I know that being diagnosed with something can ruin your life, but i am quite miserable and am often scared for my life. I know I'm not, but I think I am.

If you have anything to say go ahead. We will probably never meet.

54,"I just switched over to Music Composition after being a mortuary science major for a year and a half. I played music all through junior high and high school, took theory in High School, was a state recognized drummer my junior year, and I had to force myself to go to school because I really didn't care about anything but music.

However, I lost interest in it my senior year. I just didn't have fun anymore, I was too hard on myself when I played badly, I couldn't accept complements because I felt I didn't deserve them, and I took criticism so hard that I would spiral myself into a terrible depressive state. I have bipolar disorder and the usual depression/anxiety bullshit, and it has been a reoccurring problem since my freshman year of high school. I decided to go to &lt;state university&gt; for sports broadcasting, and got a fair bit of money from them. I enjoyed the school, but didn't like what I was studying, and moved back home to start studying to be a funeral director.

Yeah, huge jump, right? Something about the funeral business felt so right to me, like I needed to be there. My biggest quality, at least that I see in myself, is that I am always trying to make people happy in any way I can. I felt that when people were at their lowest low, I could help them by arranging a beautiful service that would not only make them happy, but also relieved, knowing that their loved one was treasured by many, and will rest peacefully, wherever they end up.

Long story short, I wouldn't have been able to exactly start studying it for another year or two, and as somebody with depression, I couldn't have picked a more goddamn morbid job to reach for.

During all of this time, I didn't play music or study it at all. I listened to it a ton, and I've always wanted to create my own music, but I never made the effort back in the day, knowing that when senior year came around, I was going to give up on music and focus on something else.

So, I've come full circle. I guess the good news is that I'm playing again, in music classes, involved with bands on campus, and am starting to compose my own stuff. However, almost daily I freak myself out about money and buying equipment and having to learn so much that I freeze up. I know I want to be in music, I really really do. But I'm surrounded by people in my classes who are far more advanced than me, and I'm so behind anybody who is a music major at my age, considering I started so late. My girlfriend who is studying music education has been fantastic, helping me with whatever I need, but I'm also jealous of her! She's incredibly talented, she got a full ride to her university, and is a hell of a singer. 

I love her, and I respect those people in my classes, but I can't see myself getting to that level without a change of mindset. It doesn't help that I worry about everything under the fucking sun, and have little to no self-confidence.

I know I can do it. But my brain keeps telling me I can't.

I apologize for the sloppy writing. I wanted to get this up because I needed to, if anything else, just rant and type it out so I could see in front of me what I need to work on. 

If you have any advice, that would be awesome. Or, just a constructive comment. Seriously, anything would be incredibly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",04Feb2018,0
55,"I’m a 14 year old girl. Every time something doesn’t happen the way I expected it to happen I start freaking out. I start crying and don’t know what to do with myself. I get scared scared of being in my own body bc I feel like I can’t control it. If it’s at home I’ll start screaming bc that’s an easier way to get my feelings out.
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.
If anyone has any advice, I’d love to hear it.
Thanks for reading!",04Feb2018,1
56,"So me and another friend have a friend we are worried about. He is borderline obsessed with a person, despite the person outright saying he does not have feelings for him. He is overly attached to this person, to the point where he is depressed to see that person with someone else. We’re worried about him and we want to know how do we get him to stop obsessing over the person. ",04Feb2018,5
