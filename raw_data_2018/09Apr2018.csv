0,"This is going to be a very difficult subject for me to approach mentally, never mind be able to put down in words. As there are so many aspects that have collectively become such a consuming factor of my literal reality as well a huge contributor toward me battling with my own mental health.

This subject being the relationship with my mother. However I want to be clear that I am in no way blaming her for any of my own short comings, I just feel the need to share this or even just write it for my own benefit. I am not able to talk to my friends about this and nore my girlfriend. As I know they don’t have the power to solve these issues and I have never expected them too.

My parents divorced when I was born, I had a difficult up bringing, with my mum changing partners and bringing home different men throughout my childhood. My elder sister getting involved with gangs, drugs and choosing life partners that were physically  and sexually abusive to her and having children much too young, left mentally weakened from her awful experiences that she cant cope with having kids but keeps having them anyway.  

After my sister and I my mum also went on to having kids with other men, I now have 2 step brothers (one 18 and one 7) My mum has serious mental health issues now and hasnt had a job in years. 

For many years my mum encouraged me not to work but to claim benifits and would be upset with me when I got jobs and changed  from job to job as it would interfere with her benifits. I remember the first job I got, I was 16 washing dishes in a pub, that day I came home she said ‘lets see how long this lasts’.

I worry about my little brother as hes only 7, I see so much of myself in him and I worry for his well being a great deal. My mum and her partner (who also doesnt work) as hes living off his parents inheritance and now hes supporting my mum financially and so shes not actually recieving any benifit at all now. They had an argument and woke my little brother up, he woke up scared and screaming for me to go in. I went in to comfort him and told my mum to stop shouting and i have work and my litttle brother has school in the morning. I came back from work early the next morning, they had kept him off school because they woke him up and scared him. I reported them to the school. 

This isnt even the tip of the ice burg but my girlfriend doesnt understand why i dont talk about my personal life. The reason is because it doesnt do me any good, just puts negativity in the air and I dont want that. It doesnt solve anything and so whats the point.

1,"It's been about 10 months since I started my gap year, and I've been following the same routine for these 10 months, and I think It's taking a toll on me. I'm finding that I'm losing quite a chunk of the enjoyment from activities I would constantly draw energy from and I generally get a really morbid sensation around any activity I do. I do still enjoy a lot of things, but not in the way I used to. I do know I'm an introvert, and although I haven't been medically diagnosed with depression, OCD or any other mental disorder, out of concern I've compared the symptoms of OCD and depression to my behavior and I satisfy some of the criteria, and hence I suspect that one of the conditions in the title (if not more) could be the culprit.

Depression

* Not wanting to talk to or be with people: The only people I'm around are my family, and I don't like being around my parents or siblings. I get agitated any time I'm around them.

* Feeling restless and agitated: Like i said, I constantly get frustrated when my family is around me. 

* Suicidal thoughts: I constantly find that I when I think about my own suicide, It's in accord with the idea that the only reason I would not end myself is because of my religion. 

OCD

* Obsessive thought: These thoughts manifest themselves as both sexually intrusive thoughts (slightly pedophilic) and constant obsession about my future (Among other things, I'm constantly thinking 5 to 10 years ahead.)

* I do a lot of double checking of things to ensure I haven't made an accident.

My routine since the start of my gap year has consisted of me staying home, watching videos, playing video games, staying up late into the night, having 1 meal a day, and showering at least once a week, and spending nearly all my day In a dark room. That's obviously unhealthy and I'm taking actions to change It, but with that said, even though I know the question I'm asking is odd, I really need any insight or help I could possibly get. Could the excess of solitude due to my introversion, the constant repetitive lifestyle and hence the boredom and/or OCD and/or Depression be the culprits? Beyond that, what insight or advice would you offer me.

Note: I also believe I might struggle with pornography and hence that might what be solely responsible for my sexually intrusive thoughts, but I don't really know.

So I read an article online where they said that people some people with depression actually mistake it with other mental disorders and go on to say that a depression makes someone totally unsocial and unmotivated. They also sleep often and have bad personal hygiene, and so on.

Now my problem is that I might have a lack of motivation or I'm just really lazy (dont know how to differentiate), and I sleep often. I also have these weird episodes where I feel extremely suppressed from isolation which makes me feel alone and by myself, like no one is here to support me when in reality, I have many friends and parents that are here for me. I am social and I enjoy texing witu my friends and going out to dinner sometimes with them.

He’s incredibly understanding of my mental health issues, but this is something I really struggle talking about. We’re both trying to make an effort to be more open with one another, but I’ve never really had to open up about this before. 

My self harm has a lot to do with my anxiety and inability to cope with stress. I don’t do it because I feel negatively about myself, I don’t even do it to hurt myself as such. It’s just about creating some form of control in a situation where I don’t feel in control. 

He said there’s no rush and I can talk to him when I’m ready, which is amazing of him. I really want to talk about it, but I never really know how to do it.

9,"Hi all,

This is extremely complicated and I don’t quite know where to start but here goes. I am very worried that my aunt is indirectly going to kill my 30 year old cousin. 

Around 8 years ago, my cousin got sick. Several doctors diagnosed her with an eating disorder. Her and my aunt did not like that diagnosis. They kept seeing doctors until they got a diagnosis they liked: chronic Lyme disease. 

For those who aren’t as knowledgeable on this topic, while Lyme disease is real, chronic Lyme is not. It is not recognized by the CDC or most medical professionals. She’s been treated for this for very long at this point and her and my aunt have clung to this diagnosis. 

My cousin is extremely underweight. She’s probably around 90 lbs if I’m being generous. My aunt will also buy her food for her to eat just for her to throw it up again. They hide this from my uncle and others because they know how it looks. 

Another issue is, and I’m leaning this tends to be associated with eating disorders, is although she is 30, she acts 13. She’s extremely immature emotionally. Her best friend is 21, who she met on the internet over their shared interest in a pop star. She is also obsessed with Taylor Swift and has social media accounts dedicated to her. She tweets at her incessantly, makes her videos, writes her letters, and just generally acts like a child. 

But the number one problem is my aunt. Normally, if a child was acting like this, a parent would seek help for their child. But my aunt is the enabler. My cousin is not capable of making her own decisions. My aunt refuses to accept the extent of her mental health problems, thus refusing to seek the treatment her daughter really needs. 

They will not see doctors who are not versed in Lyme disease, but since most doctors do not believe it’s real, they seek alternative treatment. When anyone suggests otherwise, they get extremely volatile. They are quick to just start yelling at people, and I mean actually yelling. My aunt has also thrown things, told my mom (her sister) that she “doesn’t have a sister anymore” when my mom suggested it may be bulimia years ago. 

As were rather sure she has an eating disorder, and at the very least has the body of someone with one, our fear has been ultimate organ failure. Last week we got the first sight of that. She has ammonia in her brain, which is probably because of a liver problem. I say probably because her doctor said that “Lyme was mimicking a liver problem” and also that it’s a genetic mutation. I know nothing about this but obviously I don’t trust her doctors and would like a second opinion. 

Of course, my whole family is even more worried now because of this recent development but we just don’t know what to do. My cousin is technically an adult and my aunt won’t listen to a thing we say.  I know the police is an option but I’m not sure what’s involved. Not sure if there are any other options. 

Please, any suggestions are welcome. 

I know this is crazy and only the tip of the iceberg so if you have any additional questions, let me know. 

Thank you so much. 

TL DR: 30 year old cousin was diagnosed with chronic Lyme eight years which isn’t real. Has eating disorder. Aunt refuses to get her help and is enabling the problem. She now has ammonia in her brain and we’re worried her liver is starting to fail. Need options for actions my family can take to intervene. ",09Apr2018,1
10,"I have a very stressful and abusive home life, and as a form of control I obsess over my studies. I'm a freshman in high school, and my entire life is essentially dedicated to my grades.

12,"Hey, looking for some advice.

I found out relatively recently that I lost health insurance. I apparently haven't had it since I turnt nineteen and only found out when a 700$ labcore bill came in from my gyno visit. I have to re-apply, however It's not guaranteed I'll get it back, and I won't know anything for probably a month and a half.

I've been in a downward spiral ever since everything finally sunk in regarding my abusive father (Junior year of HS, am now a senior) . I don't want to go into detail here about it, but he's in prison now for abuse against another family member. Only few members of my family know he also verbally and occasionally physically + sexually abused me as well. This along with a really fucked up childhood, having no friends growing up and facing sexual harassment and bullying from the peers I did have before my transition from homeschooling to HS really fucked me up. After a long time of denial, I'm fairly certain I have some messed up cocktail of depression/BPD and PTSD and have come to terms I need help. These feelings are unbearable. The only problem, as I have described above, is that I have no insurance. I have no idea what to do to get help, but I know it I need it as soon as possible. I'm beginning to not feel safe with myself anymore, and I'm not sure if one day I may become capable of actually acting on my thoughts and harming myself. My feelings are affecting my relationships with people I care about, and I'm not able to maintain or create new ones. I literally do not have the emotional capability to anymore. On top of all of this, it's that time of the year again where most of the major sexual abuse that my father attempted to inflict/did flict upon me occured and everything is just coming back to haunt me.

I tried going to a school counselor about my feelings, but didn't try to go any further after our first meeting because I know as soon as I tell them the extent of my emotional state they'd have to contact my mother and tell her, which is the last thing I want right now. I'd also be required to go to a crisis center which I've thought about going to myself, but I know someone else without insurance who admitted themself into one. They got the help they needed, but now owes a lot in medical bills and I don't want to be a few hundred grand in debt. I Just can't do this anymore.

15,"Yesterday morning my husband and I (we own the house this happened at) were woken by our housemate/tenant. She told us her boyfriend (other housemate/tenant) and her had a fight and he went into the garage, turned the power off in there, closed all doors and turned on both the lawn mower and hedge trimmer to get the fumes to kill himself with carbon monoxide. We tried to talk to him, get him to open up the door so we can get in and after about 5 min we called police and ambulance who took him to the hospital (physically he’s going to be fine btw.)

Now I know we did everything we could’ve done, right in this situation. But what I really need help and advice on is how to continue. Some background information might help.

 He has had a problem with his mental health for years but has been dealing well in the past 8-10 months. Since Christmas he started smoking weed with friends. It was only a weekend thing and we had no problem with it. But it was every weekend. They were messy would leave everything dirty and would be loud. It was like our house became the place for weekend hang outs. We prohibited him from doing it in the house because they were too destructive and allowed them to do it in the garage. Over a couple of weeks he started becoming obsessive. He bought like 4 bongs in the course of 1 1/2 months and spent a lot of money on weed every weekend. He started buying seeds wanting to grow his own stuff. That’s where we became very clear that we don’t want anyone to know outside of his close circle he’s growing weed on our property because we don’t want to be involved in it (we’re in our early 20s but neither me nor my husband party much or use drugs). And in the past month he has started taking Xanax. 
Every Friday and Saturday he’ll have 4mg of Xanax each night and will wake up the next morning vomiting and not knowing at all what he did the night before. We disapproved of this but we can’t really tell another adult what he can or cannot do. He is also on prescription anti depressants but uses Xanax illegally. He’s been mixing the Xanax with weed as well doing both at the same time, always incredibly high and absolutely out of it. 
Now I’ve been trying to talk to him, to our friends etc telling them they need to lay off and need to slow down, it’s becoming dangerous and that they’re heavily abusing these drugs. But no one listens to us. 
Yesterday when the police came to get him out of the garage they of course saw all the bongs and the illicit things the boys leave around in our garage because it’s become our housemates party place with his friends. (We don’t use the garage and weren’t aware it was left in that state after every weekend). The police made a comment about it all and it looks like this will have further consequences.
My husband is an accountant and could loose his tax license if he gets caught up in something and I’m waiting on my permanent visa and could be thrown out of the country if I got caught up in something even though we have absolutely nothing to do with drug abuse or anything like that and we have been telling him to get help and go to therapy for over 1 year now and have tried a lot of things to help him.

After he was taken to the hospital one of our friends who uses these drugs with our housemate and his girlfriend came over to clean the garage out. Basically got rid of everything, all bongs, all weed, anything that has got something to do with drugs and we have made it clear to all of them that if we see anyone using drugs on our property again we will report it to the police and kick them out. 
Is that a good way to handle the situation as landlords? We want to be able to help out friend who just tried to kill himself but we also want to protect us and we don’t want to be to stern. I’m just lost and don’t know what to do at this point anymore.",09Apr2018,2

My uncle and aunt-in-law have been having problems even before I was born and it's taken a toll on their children. They keep dragging other family members into this. Because of this they caused my parents divorce (my aunt-in-law is against my dad and lied to my mom about him). Legit the conversation they have could have nothing to do with other family members, but somehow someone's name gets said. 

My aunt-in-law is very manipulative. She acted completely nice to me and said ""You're my favorite niece""  but later on said I was being inappropriate to her daughters and that's why she won't send them over to my uncle? She tells me horrible stuff about my uncle like ""I bet he suffers from schizophrenia is he on MEDs?"" and told me ""Don't tell anyone but we're leaving this state."" But when it was brought up she acted like she didn't know what I or someone else is talking about. My uncle wanted to divorce her and she told her daughters to text him ""Why are you divorcing my mom? You're so mean!""  

My uncle is kind of strange and is sensitive. He laughed hysterically when he heard his wife's grandma was sick. He randomly described killing his wife and taking her life support in front of his kids as a ""joke"". Whenever you try proving him wrong or criticize him a little bit he gets defensive. As you can see they're both lunatics. 

The kids lived with their mother for a while after she randomly disappeared. And now they're showing a bit of her traits. Like pretending to love you when in reality they despise you, lying like crazy, being very rebellious, and getting mad at their parents. Their youngest has been affected the most... She randomly says ""I'm going to kill myself... I wish I was adopted."" She twerks when she's only in elementary school, she throws shoes at and spins around our cats. 

Honestly, no one knows how to fix them and their relationship. One moment they are acting lovey-dovey the next they're hurting everyone including themselves.

21,"I’ve been playing with my hair since I was in 9th grade. I am now 21 and it is worse than ever. What started out as mindlessly touching my hair during class has turned into me compulsively pulling on/running fingers through chunks of my hair for long periods of time, unable to stop. 

I’ve always been obsessed with a specific area, the nape of my neck, slightly on the right side. While I am not intentionally pulling the hair out, I’ll notice myself covered in my own hair after pulling it for long periods of time. I do not have a bald spot, but the hair I pull is noticeably shorter and thinner than the rest. I worry that I’m losing more every day. For some odd reason, I only like to pull on the short, damaged hair. Something about the feeling as I pull it away from my head feels different than the feeling of running my fingers through the rest of my hair. I also do it in a ritualistic fashion and have a specific way I like to pull it. 

I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think this is starting to interfere with my life. I’ve seen counselors and have been told it’s simply my way of self soothing (I have generalized anxiety disorder) and not something to be concerned about if I’m not pulling the hair out.  However, I feel as though I can’t stop. If I’m not pulling at my hair, I’m thinking about doing it. Specifically at the nape of my neck.  I don’t like the way I look when I do it, multiple people have pointed it out or told me to stop, and the hair is beginning to fall out of ponytails as it is significantly shorter than the rest of my hair. It also has interfered with productivity and is a distraction while driving. 

I understand that this is not characterized trichotillomania because I am not intentionally pulling the hair out but this is the closest I can get to understanding it. I’ve done a lot of research trying to find just one person who has a similar background as me but have found nothing. 

Does anyone else pull on their hair compulsively (without pulling it out) because they like the feeling on their scalp? I’m willing to try anything to keep my hands out of my hair. ",09Apr2018,2

I feel like I’m watching myself in a movie, and my physical body is on autopilot. Have you seen that episode of Black Mirror with the woman whose consciousness was put inside another person’s head? That’s a good representation of how I feel.
And because I can’t see myself as the character in the movie I’m watching, even though that is me, I’m just waiting for something to happen. I don’t feel anything most of the time and I have no passions or hobbies. I do things because I know I have to, and I know if I didn’t do things it really wouldn’t be socially acceptable, but if I had the option to be locked in my house for the rest of my life, I would definitely be okay with it.

23,"Long story but I need some advice.

It started about a month ago, when finding out my bestfriend had unexpectedly died. I have been hit pretty hard by this news. I live in another state and have no friends here to talk to about it or get me out of my house. I am so shocked to hear that someone I love so much, like a sister is no longer here anymore. 

Ever since the news I have been in a deep depression. I have had lots of concerns about my job, future and weight. This has resurfaced all these concerns and have amplified everything. 

The weight is the main part of it all. Ever since college I gained 30lbs. This has affected my back and has brought a lot of pain to the point where it is hard to walk and lay down some days. I don't feel comfortable having sex or being naked. I hate me. I have been trying to lose the weight for 3 years now but it feels impossible. 

The ammount of depression my weight has caused is starting to eat me up. I am not who I want to be and it is stopping me from living my life at this point.

My boyfriend (6 years together) also suffers with depression and has recognized how much my weight bothers me. He hates working out and eating healthy. He peomotes my unhealthy life style by getting us fast food, buying alchohol. I have asked him several times if he is willing to help me on my weight loss journey by doing some quick workouts after work and cooking at home instead of eating out. He always agrees but takes the opportunity when I relapse to eat out, buy beer and sit around. 

I do everything I could think of to try and help him with his concerns regarding his mental health. I will sit and talk with him so many times a week about his mental health. I will offer to help him in any way I could and devote lots of time switch around plans for him. It isn't always helpful or effective but it helps him know I am here for him. 

I jumped on the scale last week inly to discover I gained 3 more lbs. It has me so upset. My back is foing bad again and its now affecting our sex life. I don't have a good sex drive anymore and hate being naked. I started having suicidal ideations. I figure I am only going to get heavier at this point because I can't stick to a healthy plan. I am also so ANGRY at my boyfriend because he tells me ""it doesnt bother me. You are so sexy and beautiful"" but he forgets that it bothers me and I dont feel sexy or beautiful. He doesn't care to help me but I put some much energy in him and his mental health. 

Is it wrong for me to be angry at him for not helping me along this journey? I have made so many cries for help but all I get is ""Just do it"" or ""I know you can do"" but the scale keeps going up. 

I know it's not his fault and that I shouldnt expect sh*t in return, but am ready to give and end it all. He knows it too, because I told him. 

After talking about it he asked if I wanted a ""break"" but now I feel even worse and alone. ",09Apr2018,1

I hadn’t taken this road in a while, so I didn’t realize it’s condition. I was driving, not too fast (about 30/35 mph), and was not distracted. I noticed what I thought was a big pothole (it was actually where the road had been washed out a bit and was connected to a pretty deep ditch), I swerved because I was in my dad’s truck and didn’t want to hit it and ruin the new tires he had just put on.

I’m assuming my back tire still hit the hole because I swear the truck bounced and I swerved even more onto the left side of the road slightly hitting that ditch. I went to slam on the brake, but my foot slipped and slammed on the gas and I overcorrected and flew back into the ditch head on and flipped and rolled several times into a field. 

I saw everything. I didn’t blink. I saw everything turning upside down and things flying everywhere. There was dirt and glass and papers from my backpack and mail from the dash. When I finally stopped moving, I knew I had to get out. The truck was on it’s side, and as I am short, I couldn’t get out of my door because it was flipped up. The front glass was shattered, but I knew I wouldn’t be able to kick it out. The other window had been busted out but there was so much dirt that had somehow been pushed up against the door that I couldn’t crawl out. I had unbuckled myself (if I hadn’t of been wearing one I would have been thrown and killed) and slowly was able to stand on top of the other door. I felt completely trapped. I started panicking and called my mom (who actually moved out of our house and several hours away, taking all of my siblings, whom I’m very close to, away). My dad works at night so I knew he was asleep, she answered and was panicking, yelling at me to call 911. When I called the dispatcher, I became calm. I suppressed everything. 

Luckily a trucker was coming down the road and stopped and quickly dug a hole under the door and helped me out. The moment I was outside of the truck and standing there, it was like it was in all happening in slow motion. I couldn’t stop staring at what I had done. The bed was completely busted. The headlights had been thrown several feet into the field. Glass was everywhere. I had busted every part of that truck. The front of the truck was completely smashed in, the hood bent almost in half, covering most of the windshield. 

I was, and still am, so mad at myself. Why couldn’t I have done the right thin? Why did I swerve? Why did I have to take that road? Why didn’t I just spend the extra 5 minutes taking the safer route? I’m embarrassed that police had to come. That paramedics had to come. That I threw off that trucker’s day, I took 20 minutes from his day that he could have been doing things he needed to get done. I’m mad that I had to wake my dad up and make my grandparents drive 20 minutes just to pick me up. I’m mad that I ruined my dad’s truck that he’s spent so much money fixing. I don’t care how many people say they don’t care about the truck, they only care I’m safe. I’m so mad at myself. 

Every night that I lay down and every time I close my eyes, even to blink, all I see is everything rolling and spinning. I keep seeing the glass shattering and things flying. And I can’t smell anything other than the dirt that was everywhere. I feel like I deserve the pain I feel and I don’t want to take any medicine to suppress it. It’s the thing that keeps reminding me of how much I screwed up. And some part of me is mad that I didn’t die. I know that’s bad but I feel like things could have been easier if that happened. Maybe my mom would come back home to my dad because I’m not there to cause problems anymore. And my boyfriend could find someone who didn’t fight with him and feel jealous of any girl that he’s friends with. And my friends could be happy that I’m not there to bring things down anymore. It would have made life easier for everyone else for sure.

And I’m sorry it’s so long and sad. ",09Apr2018,1

31,"I have been bullied during my childhood and haven't had many friends during high school. After school my depressions got suicidal and during that time I lost contact to the few friends I still had. But now after therapy I feel much better and have tried to find some new friends and what I have noticed is that this is really exhausting.

Most of the people I talk to are from my sports club or people I still know from school, so they mostly know me already and I also have the feeling that they like me, but anytime I talk to them I struggle internally to seem interresting. I constantly am afraid to be boring, or worse, to somehow make them hate me for some reason. Holding conversations just seems so exhausting, but at the same time I really want to be good at it, because I feel like an extroverted person (I feel more comfortable with other people than alone). That I have episodes of insomnia and nightmares which makes me extremly tired the next day does not help either.

Is it that hard for normal people too to hold conversations? Or does anyone have some tips for me to make me feel less under pressure when talking to someone?",09Apr2018,1
32,"Hey reddit, I seriously need help as soon as possible because I'm suffering too much physically as well.

I'm posting this to mentalhealth and offmychest , since I don't really know where does this post belong at, so forgive me if any of both aren't the right place.

So... a little background on my big problem:

One time, years ago, I made a Twitter account with the sole purpose of having friends (+ the news, but that doesn't matter).

I made many friends on my way.
A few of them were nice at first, but afterwards they became a pain in my head (I don't remember what happened, but apparently I was cringey with a Mario character and they even made me a ""meme"" while making fun of me). 

I blocked them, trying to move on, but they kept avoiding it by using alt accounts, with the purpose of making fun of me because I was resentful with them and even if I wasn't resentful I wanted to live like they didn't exist.

While avoiding them, I met two friends. They were really nice, but at times I was very negative because the other ""friends"" I had were still doing what I said earlier over and over again. Eventually, the two friends thought I was still cringey, so I left Twitter.

Last month, I made a temporary account so I could talk with the two again. I told them ""I'm alone but I'm fine, I'm kinda happy..."" and they were kinda happy and said that it should continue like that...

And yesterday I did the same thing with the ""friends"" that were making fun of me, earlier.

They told me I did stuff I barely remember myself doing, such as insulting them so they go away and leave me alone.
I told them the same stuff (I'm happy, I'm fine...)

But... I WASN'T HAPPY AND FINE. I'M NOT HAPPY AND FINE.

And here's the problem: My brain keeps remembering them and how they were doing all of that and what I did, like I'm stuck in the past, everyday.

This is giving me health problems.

My mind refuses to leave that alone, forcing me to always think about all that stuff mentioned earlier and because of that, I'm always overwhelmed with need to vomit.

As of this writing, I'm overwhelmed with need to vomit, of course. I even vomited at 10AM (it's 11AM rn , I'm Spanish).

I can't handle this. My body can't handle this. Help me, please... what can I do?

40,"I am a 26 year old guy who has had severe depression, anxiety and seemingly a near mental collapse since mid-January. This all began over something so stupid that it's laughable. I am a guy with a lot of weird kinks, and fetishes, many of them are rooted in strange themes of dominance and submission/humiliation. One of those is gender bending kink, where I would have sexual fantasies of myself as a woman (and usually with some ridiculous humiliating twist on that, like a dumb ""bimbo"", or a fat girl). I feel some of these kinks was me fetishing my own lack of self-esteem with the humiliation kinks and frustrations with the dominant ones towards women, which is a dark thought in itself. I would sometimes go to chat rooms on Discord app relating to these fetishes, and in one of these rooms, a user told me I only envied women. That comment seemed to trigger a psychological breakdown for me. Shortly after that, I noticed I wasn't getting aroused like I used to anymore and was also incredibly depressed. Everything just became bleak and unenjoyable. Prior to this, I already had low confidence with women, and in general, although it was improving some.

For years I have wanted a girlfriend and better social life in general, but it's difficult as I have Aspergers and am socially awkward often, cannot think of much to say usually, worried I will come off creepy, petrified of rejection, have a kind of emotionless robotic tone when talking which some find odd, think I am not interesting enough, etc. Family and peers used to add to this by pestering me about never managing to get a girlfriend, and comparing me to guys my sister dated, always acting like said guys were somehow better than me. Over the years, my confidence had gotten so low where I think every other guy had more to offer than me when it came to women, resulting in me not even trying at times. This lack of confidence spread to other areas, too, such as me thinking I am not good enough to get into grad school, for example.

As for the sexuality thing, I am worried I have somehow turned gay or am trans due to one of those kinks, and my reduced desire for women, despite me being not being attracted to males at all, or having no desire to live as a woman and being madly attracted to women physically and emotionally since my teens. This whole ordeal has completely destroyed the little bit of confidence I did have, and made me feel like I have lost my identity. Despite my frustrations with love, and socially, I have always wanted to one day have a wife, raise a family and just live a peaceful life as a dad and husband with a wonderful woman. I am crying now at thought of that never happening, it tears my soul apart. I have always been a family orientated, loyal person, and that has been something I have thought of doing since childhood. I have even had nightmares about it. On the topic of sleep, I barely sleep at all anymore at night, have a poor appetite, and nothing feels fun anymore. I am at the lowest point of my entire life, and all I feel is a sense of hopelessness with everything. This hurts even more because, despite my lack of confidence, before this began, it was slowly improving, I was getting the confidence to finally approach women, and starting to be more social, and finally seeing myself in a bit of a more positive light than before. It just hurts so much that everything I was working towards is gone, and how everything I enjoyed no longer makes me happy. I just go through the motions now. I don't feel I am living, but merely existing. I apologize if this sounds weird, but this is making me incredibly depressed.

44,"Hey guys, just wondering if you have experienced this before. 

I've been taking sertraline for about three weeks. I told my doctor I experienced mania (feeling really overwhelmingly happy and not being able to stop laughing - racing thoughts), confusion, extreme nausea (I couldn't eat for a week), dizziness and trouble sleeping. I told her that I felt the medicine was lifting me mentally in the first couple of weeks but now I feel low again. She then tells me that this is the placebo effect and that medicine does not work that fast. 

I am quite perplexed as to what to say in that situation. I want to have an open, honest conversation about how the medicine is making me feel but I am quite irritated to have my doctor continuously tell me in our conversation that it is just a placebo effect. Interestingly, she had my dose doubled after this conversation. Just wondering how any of you tackle this kind of conversation? Especially being told that what you're experiencing is due to the placebo effect and not the chemistry of the medicine.

I wont hurt anyone but maybe burn something down like a shop I hate or try to rob a bank. I'm scared that exactly these thoughts will escalate in strength and be what finally ruins my life in the end only from not or maybe ever getting the help I need. But in my daily life at the moment I'm not suffering A LOT ALL THE TIME, maybe just a bit sometimes or most of the time. That seems to be the general human condition? If that's the case why live in misery? I wont kill myself I'm just asking. That would be so absurdly funny to keep living in this increasingly awful existence where nothing is enjoyable or worthwhile not even a little bit. I can't believe people can live happy and with peace of mind. I cannot comprehend it. Sometimes I wonder if the truth is I am really happy but since I've never truly been happy only surfed different stages of unhappiness, I never knew it was so meaningless such at this and everyone is experiencing this but they call it being happy. I do have things that give me meaning, like reading and having ideas, or they give me calm, I'm not sure what they give me anymore but they relieve me of feeling like I have to destroy something and ruin my life completely if all the doctor will say is ""how are you"" and I say ""not great right now or ever"" and they say ""that's normal eat your veggies"" and out I go.


I just had to share AGAIN since i STILL DO NOT get a fucking appointment or help anywhere and soon a lot of things in my life will change again (some employment) and I fear the stress of having to appear as normal as pose as a social being and handle the nature of the work  will cause me to lose the final touch i have with reality - worse if I don't even realize it's happening before it's already happened which has been the case in these situations where I ""deviated from reality"" before.

 Thank you for listening. ",09Apr2018,2

Both my therapist and psychiatrist are on vacation, the university mental health services won't help because I'm taking time off, and there isn't a single behavioral health center in my area that takes my insurance. Oh, and I'm not suicidal, so there's no immediate threat and a hotline wouldn't consider me a priority.

I'm having a really hard time right now and I really need to just sit and talk to someone informed enough to give helpful/healthy advice. ASAP. Are there any options left for me?",09Apr2018,3

83,"Hi,

I have bipolar disorder and had quite an experience about 2 weeks ago. It may seem far fetched, but I'll describe it in detail nonetheless.

I was clearly in a hypo-manic state for a couple weeks.  I was smoking a good amount of marijuana to help with depression symptoms.  Long story short I had an incredible experience:

Symptoms started not long after I gave a donation to the funeral fund for a young unarmed man shot by police.  I gave a decent donation and made two points: that I was sorry the man had died in order for change to occur, and that I could offer whatever assistance was necessary.  Also about this time, I questioned my girlfriend of one year about her inattentiveness to important life details.  We had an intense discussion (she was very focused on the fact that I might leave her despite me remaining calm and merely trying to assess her issues).  My psychologist attributed that behavior to rejection sensitive dysphoria.  She had just started therapy, and I learned some ugly details about her past relationship with an abusive man for 10 years.

Maybe a day or two after these events, I was working from home and started hearing voices.  I have one previous manic episode where this happened, I followed the voices and ended up in jail for 10 days before treatment.  I knew I was taking a risk by not ignoring them as a side effect.

The voices questioned me on my ethics throughout life, to the point where I was instructed to call my mother and admit I may have been too rough sexually with a women many years ago.  This is despite talking about it in therapy years ago and it not being deemed a big deal.  She didn't think so either, and I told my Dad as well.  I've talked with the girl since then as well.

I had voices questioning whether or not I would actually support people of color in life or death situations (I am white).  I had a feeling that the weight of the world was on my shoulders, and only absolutely truthful responses would be accepted.  I was listening to Ripple from the Grateful Dead on repeat.  Anytime I felt overwhelmed by the voices, the refrain would come in and I would feel a clear head for a moment.  Another important theme was cultural norms.  I think the part about the women seemed to be part of accepting the toxic nature of male/female relations, and trying to design a new template for how a man should be.  This sounds like it is related to ""archetypes"", which I knew nothing about.  A few weeks ago I posted on FB that ""Culture is not innate and can change overnight if we so choose"".  These discussions lasted the afternoon, I must have calmed down enough that my then gf saw no issue.  Well, I did one thing where I forced her to make coffee from the grounds in the garbage while I went out and bought two real coffees.

After few more days, in which I proposed to my now fiancee after I felt I now understood her issues, I woke up totally manic and went to the hospital with her voluntarily, not really knowing why.

The real catch are the coincidences.

There were numerous coincidences that occurred.  Some men were talking outside a home that I walked by not long after proposing.  I heard one man laugh and say ""he's getting married"" after I passed.  The day after the main experience, there was a NYTimes article about whether we control our own opinions (I could look it up).  I also felt the news tone had changed, much less hateful/partisan Trump/Liberal hating in sites like CNN and FoxNews.  We traveled to Yosemite and stayed in Groveland, the ""name"" for our room was almost exactly the same as the name of a character in the story (Alice Monroe) my fiancee opened up to that night.  While in the hospital, a man told me I was like Steve Jobs and Einstein and changed the world.  I mentioned to someone in the hospital that I wanted to get the print paper for our city since I liked reading the paper in the hospital.  The day I got back, a High School age man dropped off a free news print to my fiancee while I was in the living room, giving no explanation.  My first day back to work, my Lyft driver gave me a card that read ""You're Wonderful"" and a lollipop.  I think there were a few more weird coincidences as well.  My fiancee felt the same sort of shift in the news tone, though of course she may have been feeding off of me.

Before I dated my fiancee (who I had only met twice briefly) she had a psychotic episode (she used Adderall without a prescription for years) and dreams in which I saved her from her abusive boyfriend.  She described it as lasting thousands of years, and berating her to convince her to leave.  She lived next to my best friend.  She broke up with him 2 weeks later, went home for 2 weeks, and I met her at a party after that and we have been dating ever since.  We had a 3 month break in which I knew she went back to him occasionally.

I've been fine since I got out of the hospital.  I'm convinced something happened at some collective unconscious level, everything felt was too real and the real world coincidences were one after another.

85,"Im not sure where this should be posted.

Im paranoid quite a lot and dont understand why. I think i can see how it relates to my past, but it seems quite excessive to me. 

I get paranoid about:
What people are thinking about me.

That people are judging me constantly.

I hate cars passing as i feel each person in them has thought something negative of me

I constantly feel that anyone i let close to me is going to emotionally hurt me in someway. 

I worry that they are only spending time with me for something, not just because they actually want to.

It sometimes gets so bad i find myself confronting those i am paranoid about. 
Ill ask questions to try and find their hidden motive. Such as a boyfriend - id feel he is with me just to pass time, not because he wants to. I feel im not good enough, so why would he want to spend time with me?

And loads more.

I know these are irrational, but at the time they feel so true its a battle to fight the urge to not confront. Knowing that if i did, theyd just think im a freak",09Apr2018,2
86,"Hello, I have initial appointments scheduled with 3 different therapists this week. My school counselor told me I should try a few at a time so I can find someone I feel comfortable with more quickly. I have been to therapy in the past but due to social anxiety I tend to freeze up when meeting someone for the first time. I struggled a lot with remembering my weekly struggles while meeting with my therapist. I'd like to prepare somehow for these initial appointments so I can effectively communicate what I need help with. Any tips? ",09Apr2018,3
87,"I’m new to this whole reddit thing and I really need help, I suffer really bad anxiety and it’s been going on for years I’ve been the doctors and they refer to me therapy which NEVER get back to me despite calling my appointments are always rearranged and the same thing happens or they somehow got ‘cancelled’ I really need help I’m starting to think I should start drinking but not heavily just enough to ease my mind and get me through a day without an awkward conversation and the feeling of people judging me all the time please help me I never thought I would have to do this online but I have no options and I’m scared it will affect me my whole life. I don’t feel comfortable sharing my age as I know there are people who relate mental illness to an age thing you know like oh your depressed? It’s just puberty of whatever else. I’m between the ages of 16-25. ",09Apr2018,1

89,"So I admit I come from a wealthy family. My parents are both in the medical field and their salary combined easily crosses $650,000 a year. Coming from money doesn't always mean things are ""better"". Yes, money makes things more comfortable and you don't have to deal with things like debt and fear over not being able to afford medical or other personal emergencies, but the deep rooted problems a family have are still there. 

Recently, I came to the realization that I have a lot of deep rooted problems. For starters, I'm transgender and I started transitioning about 2-3 years ago. I got diagnosed with ADHD and struggle a bit with that, even with medication. My family life was pretty crappy, no close connections with family and a verbally abusive father that puts everyone in the family down to the most extreme levels. My mom protects him and stays with him for financial stability even though she knows he's terrible for everyone's mental health. She has protected him even when law enforcement contacted her due to fear of severe verbal abuse. My dad has almost lost jobs countless times because of his behavior but he knows he can just get any high paying job he wants in the country because he is over qualified. To this day, I feel neglected and lost.

I just feel like I got lucky with everything and I'm struggling to validate my own struggles. I have no money issues and about my transition, I got pretty lucky with that too. I was a very late bloomer and by the time I started to transition, I was like a blank canvas. I transitioned nicely into the body, face, and voice of a woman very easily with hormone treatments. I had sex reassignment surgery that went smoothly and was covered by insurance. I've had a great dating life and I consider myself a good looking girl too. I can easily get a ton of clothes and makeup and a lot of other superficial things I want. 

Academically, I am successful too. Despite having ADHD and being undiagnosed for years, I still made it into engineering at a well respected school and plan on getting a masters if all goes well. Yeah, I failed a couple courses and repeated them, but overall I'm doing well for someone that had undiagnosed ADHD for a large portion of college. Better than the average engineering student, at least. The fact that I'm even here is surprising.


Ever since I got diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago, I've been having an extremely difficult time seeing my situation as a ""problem""... I have everything I need and I've come so far. I'm making a future for myself and I'm much better off than other transgender people in terms of just overall wellbeing and even in terms of passing as a ""natural"" woman. I don't struggle to be validated by society as a woman and I don't get discriminated against because looking like a woman just came naturally to me after a year and a half on hormones.

Despite all of this, I still struggle with everyday, normal things like managing my emotions, time, and feeling comfortable with myself. My lack of a family connection and the ""cold love"" I received is something that I recently realized was actually really hard for me. My parents treated me like I was 30 years old when I was just 10. I don't know what a hug from my parents feels like and I don't know what it's like to hear ""I love you"". They just throw money at me and expect me to feel better. 


I hate complaining when I know there are other kids that come from crappy neighborhoods with underfunded public schools riddled with shootouts and drugs and murder everyday. The privilege of even being able to go to college is tremendous enough, even in a developed nation like the United States. 

The guilt is weird for me. I downplay a lot of things in my life so my friends don't get the wrong idea. I act like my car was a high mileage used car when in reality I know it was brand new when I got it and cost well over $60,000. I act like all the furniture in my apartment is from stores like Ikea and Target when in reality they're from Anthropologie, Crate &amp; Barrel, or Perigold.

I just feel guilty and I feel like a giant wuss and I need to find out how to get past this so I can feel comfortable with facing my ""problems"". My guilt over this is preventing me from even attending therapy. ",09Apr2018,3
