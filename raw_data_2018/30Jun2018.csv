0,"I scratch myself subconciously when I get anxious. I dont notice im doing it until someone points it out , or I start to really sting.  People will ask me if someone else did it to me if they dont know about my habit. They look really bad sometimes like dark red marks on my skin. I dont self harm anymore, though I used to for years habitually. But that was a long time ago and I dont like doing that now. How do I stop myself before it gets too bad? ",30Jun2018,2
1,"It is so hard to give up a long time friend but she fits all the criteria for emotional abuse. I’m afraid to let her go because she’s all i have left of my old friends. Yet I know my negative self talk comes from her. 
When I paint a picture I think what she would say about it instead of what I think. I wonder what she would think of my life and she would have very snarky things to say. I used to email her things I was excited about snd I would only get:  “Oookaaaay” then tell me not to read too much into it.  I keep thinking I will impress her eventually but that day has not happened and it’s been 30 years. I’ve developed bad habits due to her. 

I need encouragement to find supportive friends or at least not contact her anymore so I can learn to not talk so critically to myself.  Most of all I need to encourage myself! ",30Jun2018,5
2,"Like a lot of people, a lot of times I'm self conscious about being annoying to others. But for some reason, a lot of times, I'll get the extreme urge to annoy or anger people to an extreme extent, and I'll do it, and get extreme pleasure out of it. It isn't sexual pleasure, it's like an immense feeling of happiness, victory, and just seeing it as plain funny. I've looked on the internet for if I'm the only one, or why my urge to do this is so strong (It inconveniences me a lot of times), but I couldn't find much. Does anyone experience things similar or know why?",30Jun2018,5
3,"I finally contacted a therapist in my new city about EMDR. I've been wanting to try EMDR for my CPTSD. In the initial email I sent to the therapist I mentioned covert incest. 

She normally does 30 minute phone consultations with 1st time patients, but She was in a hurry because she was leaving town for a week so ours was all of 10 minutes, and basically just her seeing when I was available next. I agreed to just schedule a first therapy session. 

I told her I was interested in EMDR and that I had spoken to a therapist in my old city, who I went to specifically for that therapy, and I almost started before I had to leave to get a new job. 

This person went on about how she doesn't normally do EMDR and prefers family systems. I looked into it and am not sure if that's a right fit. I didn't over email or the phone (because there was not time) mention the very violent aspects of my childhood or the overt sexual abuse. I read that some think Family Systems can be detrimental in cases of physical abuse. I now kind of feel like I was rushed off... which I was, and she thinks I'm just some whiney rich kid with a mean mom. 

Anybody have any opinions?

4,"I've been living with depression and anxiety disorders for just over 5 years. I thought I'd share some wisdom with you all.

1. There is no instruction manual on dealing with your situation. Therefore YOU need to find what works for YOU. Drugs, alcohol and destructive behaviour are the easy way to deal with it because they work short term, find something more sustainable long term.

2. The opposite of depressed is not happy, happy is the opposite of sad. The opposite of depressed is connected and fulfilled. So find what connects you and fulfils you and your situation will improve.

3. You cannot control what you think, however you can control whether or not you identify with it and how you react to it. You are not your thoughts, and your thoughts are not real unless you make them real. You let them in, so you can just as easily let them go.

5,"I honestly don't know where to start, or even if this is the correct sub but I feel like it is. I have this problem with my wife where I get thoughts in my head and cannot get an erection (trying to have second baby). This starts to cycle in my head and turns into a vicious cycle and I can't stop thinking about my problem,  and it gets only worse. I can't relax and I get very uncomfortable, it always ends in a huge fight where I can't sensibly explain myself (I'm told), or my feelings, and made to feel even worse.  Even if I get somewhere,  she says she doesn't care how I feel cause I can't get her pregnant.

So I come to figure that under stress or pressure, I can't perform. If she gets upset, I am extremely bothered and uncomfortable. I'm a smart person but can't for the life of me express my feelings in a way that is understandable. I feel like I am a complete and utter failure when it comes to making my wife happy.

Another problem is that every fight, I feel this terrible guilty feeling like I can't meet expectations, and I always want to end it all. The thing that holds me back is my 2 year old daughter but everytime I feel like I get a little closer.  I have put my gun to my head multiple times knowing I wouldn't do it but I entertain the thought.  I wouldn't want to do it at home but have images of disappearing to do it where no one could ever find me. 

I feel like this stems from low self esteem and not feeling manly although I have an engineering job at a great place,  I just don't know.  I know it seems random but is so much in my head. I literally have no one I can entrust my feelings and thoughts with (again this is my fault) or feel like I could talk to. 

Should I go to someone, maybe ask about my dysfunction? I don't know what I should start with and want to fix before I go too far.  Please help and thank you for spending the time to read this.

9,"Hello everyone,

I recently had to be admitted to the hospital due to akathisia caused by two of the antipsychotic medications I was prescribed (Stelazine and Abilify) for anxiety and depression respectively. 

Before I left, the doctor told me that some of the symptoms I’d shown looked like early signs of schizophrenia. 

For context, after suddenly being dumped by my girlfriend of 2 years and doing a shit ton of acid to cope with it accompanied by lack of food, I’d wake up and see acid-like visuals for the few seconds that I’d wake up. Once, when I hadn’t had food for 5 days, I started hearing a constant chatter speaking in Scouse. Once I ate, it went away. Even today, it doesn’t happen unless I’m hungry. 

Does anyone have any advice about this? I’m terrified and don’t know what to do. ",30Jun2018,1
10,"I'm 17 years old and since I can remember I have intrusive thoughts, I didn't know that it had a name until today. I used to be so scared of being alone when I was because I thought I would die, that something bad would happen, even I thought I was pregnant without anything happening and me being a child, but those thoughts about bad things haunted my mind all the time when I was alone so I would tell my mom or my dad not to leave me alone because once they did, or once everything was dark in the night and no one was awake I started to compulsively think about bad things that could happen. Until today those thoughts have changed but they are worst things to think about, and they scare me profoundly.  


I think I have had depression since I was 15, at least there's when I think it started. It has gotten worse with the past of time. I had constant thought of dying and hurting myself, of not being enough and being a burden to others (I still have them) but at least it wasn't so bad, I still talked to people and shared things with my parents and siblings. Lately I have been pushing away everyone, being hostile, not talking, treating them badly. 

My social anxiety has always been there, at first I thought I was shy but I was even scared of ordering a pizza through the phone, what people think of me makes me extremely anxious, I apologize constantly for everything I do or even for the things I don't to keep people happy. When something happens with someone my social anxiety and my obsessive thoughts combine and I get extremely scared of what the other person might think. 

I'm extremely tired, sometimes my thoughts are so unbearable that I just want to end that suffering. I also feel so lonely and even though I'm hostile and drive away people I crave for someone to be here with me, but every time there is, I can't help to feel as the most annoying person in the universe. Sometimes when I'm with people I want to cry because I get so anxious. And when I'm alone horrible thought plague my mind and is even worst, because at least when I'm with people I'm distracted from them for a little bit. Help me please.",30Jun2018,2
11,"I'm not sure if this is where his post belongs, I just felt if there's any place to get help with this then here is where I should ask. Now this isn't going to come off as a super serious issue but it's starting to worry me.

So I have been recently getting these sudden bursts of anger that I don't even know why sometimes. The way the feeling starts is as if I'm a container being filled by a liquid and I can feel as it builds up from my feet and then when it reaches my head I just burst in anger. One thing to note is it never makes me feel violent to anyone, I've never caused any physical harm to anyone or even thought of doing that when this has happened. I find tears start to roll down my cheeks and my fists will clench and I will start yelling stuff normally along the lines of ""why am I so angry?!!"" 

A lot of the time these outbursts happen for no reason, like today I got in from a BBQ and sat down in bed then all of a sudden I just felt it happening and I yelled when I was lay down and I had the tears coming down my face and then after a few seconds it all cleared and I had no idea why I got so angry but I just felt out of control. The reason this is worrying to me is because I'm scared that if it happens when I'm with my friends or family that I might end up hitting them or doing something to them. I am pretty strong willed and believe that this is closer to impossible but I feel there may still be a chance it could happen.

Sometimes these outbursts are provoked but by the smallest things. Last night is a good example, when I was at this BBQ I had originally planned for a night in on my own and ordering a takeaway. I then agreed to go to my friends house but I didn't know it was for a bbq when I got there and when I realised this I knew I wasn't going to order a takeaway when I got back. Once I got home I just felt the anger fill me because I hadn't been able to stick to my original plan, yet usually I am very spontaneous and enjoy random events like this BBQ. 

All I want to know is what people think this could be, also I understand the example that I used may sound funny but as you can see it's the smallest most unexpected things that are causing me to lose control of my anger. I've also never had anger issues previously. The only other bit of backstory I have is that my parents split up a while back and I still haven't really forgiven the side of the family who I have to live with whilst home from university. Another thing is that I never had this issue when I was away at university living with friends.

I would love to hear if other people have experienced this and if anyone has any advice it would mean the world to me.",30Jun2018,1

I’m very worried about my fiancé and I am just at a loss.  

He has a history of anxiety and being on the suspicious side.  Gone through long periods of being seriously concerned about his health and having cancer based on “symptoms” that many people get (constipation, etc) and that his doctors told him were nothing to be worried about.  

Fast forward to yesterday morning.  He works evenings so often comes to bed at 4 or so after I’m asleep.  This morning I wake up at 6 to just livid.  Finally I got it out of him that he got a weird feeling and decided to take me phone and go through everything as I slept... okay... and I got a text from what I assumed was a wrong number last week saying “going to Raise Draco, want to help?”  I ignored it and didn’t even get it (apparently it has a sexual connotation that went right over my head?) and got on with my night, dismissed it as a weird wrong number text.  When he saw it he took it as proof I’m cheating on him... it’s extremely hard to disprove something once he’s convinced on it, but I have no idea who the sender of this message is and have never done anything disloyal or unfaithful.  Later that day he seemed to come around and I thought we were fine.

Tonight on his break he calls and immediately goes back on this, telling me we’re back to square one in our relationship... throughout all of this I’ve stayed calm and reassuring but I finally had it and broke down crying.  I’ve never ever done anything wrong and have gone above and beyond to be so supportive of him.  Things have been so good - so good - between us, we get along and never have big fights, everything has been wonderful.  And this stupid wrong number text is enough to make him question it?

Other issues:
ANow he’s convinced someone is targeting him and messing with him (when he’s not convinced I’m cheating).  -Like the majority of us he gets spammy emails and is convinced it’s the same person.  
-We live in a strata and someone has parked a car for an extended period of time in a spot near us and he keeps commenting how suspicious it is and wonders if it has anything to do with the emails.  
-He says the text I got is “harassment”.  He says he is going to find who is causing all this distress (ie the text sender) and settle things “his way”.  When I tell him it’s not worth ruining everything for and that he’s overreacting he thinks I’m protecting this person, and questions why I don’t want him to find out who it is.  This line of conversation also got me extremely upset, he can’t go around hurting and threatening people over a wrong number.......
- He also sometimes comments it’s someone he works with trying to screw with him. 
- He’s started bringing up a message an ex-bf send me 2 years ago apologizing for being an asshole which I never told him about (gee I wonder why) - I have not been in touch since and recently he sent me a “wave” on Facebook that lead to be just blocking him.  Now my fiancé is talking about going to his wife.  Ok fine I have no feelings about this person anymore but it’s unnessessary.

Anyway I’m sorry this is so long and probably hard to follow but I just don’t know what to do and feel so alone in this...  I feel like he’s suddenly spiralling here (he recently hurt his back and his work duties have been reduced, too much time to think?).  For the last couple weeks his appetite has been down and now he’s lost weight and convinced there’s some underlying health reason, not simply because he hardly ate last week.... I just don’t know what to do.   He went to to doctor for his back last week and his anxiety came up so he got a referral to a psychologist that I really want him to follow up on but if I mention it and that I’m worried he says”you can’t try to gaslight me into thinking this is a mental health issue”.  We just sold our house and are in the process of getting a house in the neighbourhood he’s always wanted to live in, I wonder if the stress is part of the problem or the feeling that things are too good to be true that he’s looking for problems.

Any advice or support would be so appreciated. I love him so so much and it’s killing me to see him so upset and nothing I can do helps when he gets in this frame of mind.",30Jun2018,1
13,"I’m at a lost. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for almost 2 years now. But recently I’ve been going through what almost feels like psychosis episodes. Something will trigger me, or sometimes nothing it seems, and I will be screaming, crying, hitting and biting myself, calling myself these horrible names and it’ll last maybe an hour or two. I don’t feel like I can call these panic attacks, which I have had in the past chronically. Once I’ve calmed down I am upset at myself and my behavior but I go about my day.

14,"I just have a question.. it’s kinda weird but I thought I’d reach out. So I have a form of schizophrenia and certain horror related things trigger me. Usually they cause my brain to obsess over the image/video/story which causes me to become more and more paranoid. I can’t close my eyes or I’ll see it. I can’t do anything loud, vacuum or shower. Every time I turn a corner or open a door I have extreme anxiety that I will see something scary. And because of this I have to avoid these triggers for my own well being. And being on the internet there is a good chance at some point I might come across it, which causes me to very carefully scroll through news feed. I’m very cautious about what link I click. I have to read comments before I watch certain videos to check for jump scares. I feel like avoiding things like this, and labeling certain stuff as stuff to avoid is like building it up so much in my mind that when it happens it’s even scarier each time.. but I don’t know what to do. I want to be able to just see something and be like “holy shit. That’s scary. Moving on..” but instead it literally takes days to get over and I feel so stupid that I can’t move on from it.

16,"I’m 21, I’m 40 weeks pregnant and have an abusive ex’s history.  I’ve been with a guy for over a year now but he’s becoming less chilled. I have the confidence in me to not put up with abuse and I wouldn’t call him abusive. 
I think he’s bipolar, I don’t feel comfortable anymore to say whatever I want or think because I worry it’ll make him angry and not because I’m scared of him, just because I don’t want to deal with an argument that isn’t real. When I say “isn’t real” it means he only wants to scream for half an hour over nothing then apologise when he’s done because it was just a mood swing. I’ve stopped arguing back lately I just let him go and then close my eyes till he stops talking and moves on. He likes to pick on everything from the way I drive, how I walk, how I breathe, it’s all stupid random things just when he’s in a mood and I’m starting to reach my limit. He talks to me so condescendingly like I’m stupid which is frustrating because a lot of the time he’s stupid but I would never be mean to him because I wouldn’t want him to be sad. 
If I really tell him how I feel about how he treats me he gets so upset with himself and I can’t do that to someone. He cried once and I feel sick anytime I think about it. He isn’t always like this, we have lots of laughs and good days but when he’s in a mood it’s building up inside me trying to ignore it because I know he can’t help it. He also smokes pot and it’s worse when he doesn’t have any but if I mention that he hasn’t had pot and that’s why he’s angry he gets even angrier saying that it’s not pot it’s me making him angry. Again he will always apologise and explain later he knows it’s pot or its mood swings but the apologies are starting to mean less and less. He’s also in control of our finances which he’s not good at but he earns the money so I can’t say much about it. I keep stashing away money for when we have none for food but then he gets angry at me for lying that I spent money he gave me when I hadn’t. 
It’s a whole thing and we’re about to bring a baby in to this. Does anyone else have a partner with bipolar and know any good ways of coping? Because I am so tired. Thank you. ",30Jun2018,1

-never acted violently or been charged with so much as a speeding ticket 


I've been in great mental health for the last year, but I'm a bit uneasy about this sort of addiction I have going with what I've learned is called ""zoosadism.""

I grew up with a pet parrot who I never hurt even once or thought of hurting, as I loved him more than anything. When I was 16 or so I noticed I was developing some mixed feelings about animals. I would imagine hurting them and slapping them, which conflicted greatly with finding them cute. This was quite the source of cognitive dissonance for me. Imaging eventually evolved into watching animals get abused out of morbid curiosity, off and on every few weeks or so. Fast forward to age 21. I now can't seem to help myself from watching videos of animal abuse. I regularly search the internet for videos, which has extended to using the tor browser to find new ones, since I've watched everything available on the surface web. It feels satisfying to watch these videos. It's like watching someone get instantly arrested after doing something illegal and enraging. I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I just keep looking because it has almost become a vice for me. I don't think I'm going to hurt any real animals.

Does anyone out there ever feel this conflict? I would liken it to a chemical addiction, almost. Is this something I can tell my psychiatrist without getting sent right back to the loony bin? I would rather that didn't happen because it really derails your life.",30Jun2018,1

20,"I don't usually post on forums, in fact this is my first official time. I always worry about what people will say to me, and I realize it is stupid to worry about with all the problems I have going on in my life. 

Well to start, I have always struggled with mental health. I suffered from extreme separation anxiety, not even wanting my parents to leave for a second without having a panic attack. This went on until my parents divorced when I was 12, and my mom moved across the country. My dad knew me and my sister had mental health issues, but didn't care. My sister once tried to kill herself and well.. my dad just called her an idiot as she was laying there dying just a month after my mom had left. Mind you, I was 12. My parents had divorced, my mom moved across the country, my sister tried to kill herself (in front of me, I might add) my sister moved out and became homeless and I was left alone at home with my dad. We were never close. My mom used to be the housewife type of mom who did all the cooking and cleaning but when she was gone I was left to fend for myself. I eventually moved with my mom for a while, becoming even more estranged from ALL of my family. On my 14th birthday no one called me, I had no friends and all I had was my mom and step dad. Fast forward to now, I moved back to my home state to be with my boyfriend of 2 years. I have family here, but am estranged from them after the years I lived with my mom. My dad barely talks to me, in fact I texted him and told him I loved him but he ignored me. I am still close with my mom, but only get to see her 1 or 2 times a year. I only get to talk to her through the phone. My sister is a mom now, and is always busy. I still dont have a lot of friends and am not in school. I lost my job after getting injured  and have not found work since. I just went on instagram to see that my boyfriend is cheating on me. He has been my best friend for over five years, and has been my boyfriend for 2. I am devastated. Life seems to keep fucking me over. It wasn't bad enough that I had my parents, my family and my friends taken from me but now the last thing I have? It especially hurts because in the 2 years we have been together I havent even flirted with a man. I have given him all that I have to give. I have given him the last of my money to make sure he can eat, I have missed appointments to help him with his youtube videos. I have gone without food so that he can eat. I have sacrificed so much. Even worse? he makes comments about my weight all the time. Since I have been depressed, I have had issues with binge eating. He even told me the other day that there is nothing nice he can say about me physically... I feel like a monster. I feel like I don't matter to anyone in this world besides my mom. The other day I was at a ""friends"" house and her mom took us to the grocery store and I almost cried because it makes me jealous. I am jealous of my friend who has a mom to hug every day, I am jealous of the girls my boyfriend calls beautiful, I am jealous of my sister because she has my dad and a whole network of support (friends/ family) but I.. I have nothing. I feel dead inside.. I have literally lost everything i had. How do you recover from that?? ",30Jun2018,1
21,"To preface this, I've been diagnosed with major depression, social anxiety and general anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Not currently feeling depressed but still have problems with mild OCD (which I think may be a part of or even all of why I feel like this, taking 150mg zoloft) and in therapy for adjustment disorder.

For months I've been stuck on this idea that I'm a narcissist and it lead me to read a lot about the disorder and how it affects people. Mostly stuff online, which obviously isn't the best resource all of the time so that makes me feel like I'm overthinking things but at the same time I might not be. It's crazy how much I've read and connection the symptoms and actions and thoughts to my own in the past and the present. 

I've manipulated people in terrible ways. Mostly women who I'm interested in sexually. I have gotten access to many women's social media accounts, very very close friends even, and used this to look at private photos/text messages. I once destroyed a freindship between 2 close female friends of mine because I spread lies to both of them about what they were saying to each other, and at the same time I was reading their messages with people to find out what they were saying and create another false backstory behind any possible question they could have asked me to shut down my lies. When one of them threatened to stop being friends with me after I tried to kiss her when she didn't want to, I threatened to kill myself and told her I needed her to survive and she meant everything to me. I was in love with her for years, and that was truly how I felt. I didn't realize how very manipulative and damaging I was in the moment, though I see that now. I just think, if I really loved her and care about her so much, why would I do these evil things to her?

I lie a lot to people, about the smallest possible things just to seem cooler or more impressive. Sometimes I'll lie about things for a long time just because I don't want to ruin the illusion I've set up because it would undo all of the trust the person put in to me in the first place and possibly cause them to hate me or not want to be my friend. I want to be honest but I feel like I can't sometimes, and I want to tell them to try and rebuild the friendship from an honest place, but with that also comes the possibility of them not wanting to continue the friendship so I have to keep up the lie. Then I wish I was just honest in the first place, but then I feel like nobody would like the honest, raw me anyway, so there's no point.

When I was younger I was very open about how much better I thought I was than everyone. I bragged about how smart I was in school because I got in some high level classes and couldn't even keep up or do well in them, I frequently made fun of my parents and put them down because they didn't finish school and told them I was smarter than them. I wasn't even that smart and I acted like the smartest motherfucker around. I was extremely disrespectful to teachers, never showing up to class or doing my work, talking back to them, doing things just to piss them off. Video games were something I put a lot of time in to and really enjoyed, and were something I was actually good at, as I could make it to pretty high ranks in most online games I played. But I constantly bragged about it and put others down and shoved my achievements in their faces just because I hoped they would look at me in awe. 

I try not to do drugs or drink around other people because I hate the feeling of losing control of myself and it terrifies me that I may accidentally let one of my secrets slip or I might act on some of the very bad urges I get, such as raping or killing people. I do smoke weed still in my own time, because at least then I can't hurt other people, but then I'm scared that I still might end up doing it some way. I've been trying to quit for a long time and I keep coming back to it. 

When people tell me things, I really don't feel anything or care a lot of the time. I don't listen to a lot of what people say. My ex told me once about how she was sexually abused for years as a child, and I really felt nothing inside, but I managed to whip up some tears because I thought she would see what a caring guy I was and love me even more. I ended up getting in the relationship with her in the first place because I lied to her, saying the guy she liked called her a whore and a bitch, so she would stop liking him and see me as some hero who cared so much about her and stood up for her to this douchebag guy. And I guess it sort of ended up working out like that, but we had a very rough relationship filled with drug use(usually started by me), fighting, losing friends and others for a year. It's like I can sniff out the insecurity and instability of people and I prey on it. I was also a terrible influence on her. We started dating in high school, she was the standard good girl, didn't really want to have sex or do drugs, went to school always and did work, by the end of that year she was cutting classes too, doing drugs, fighting with her parents(who heavily dissaproved of me, she's told me that they havent fought with her really at all since we broke up), doing worse in school and caring less about it. When we broke up I promised her I would go around shit talking her and literally the first thing I did was go to my friends (who were also her friends, because we had the same friend group) and tell them about how terrible she was to me and now they don't like her. 

There's a lot more but I would write a fucking book at this rate. I read about narcissists and how they are terrible and feel nothing and deserve to be cut off by everyone, and it makes me sad that I may be one and if people ever found out, I would be condemned to this fate of losing everyone I care about. I'm constantly paranoid that my friends are talking about me, plotting against me to one day expose me in front of everyone and humiliate me, destroy my ego etc. I've shared these thoughts with my therapist, she doesn't think im a narcissist but I haven't really told the full story and emotions I have so there's no real way to judge. Because I'm terrified she is really judging me, thinking ""yep this guys a total piece of shit narcissist"", in her head shes just egging me on to say all this weird stuff to later use it against me and humiliate me. I'm being as honest as I can here and I hope anybody reading this trusts me because I feel this pain 24/7 and I want someone to know it. Maybe to reassure me or even make me feel like im not a bad person so I can keep living my lie of a life and convince myself I'm ignorant to my actions and intentions. 

I don't want to be a piece of shit, I'm recognizing my bad patterns and trying to change them and do better, but I just feel like my existence is a poison with no cure and no matter how much I try to care about others and be better, it's never coming from a genuine place. I try to care for others, ask them how they are doing, experience their feelings, but I can't so the best I can do is replicate the actions of a caring person. What does it matter if I tell someone how much I care about them if I will go behind their back and try to make their life a pile of shit.

Sometimes I feel like I’m too smart for my own good. And that I feel too much. I’m an empath so socializing really takes a toll on me. And then seeing any sort of unethical or illegal bs upsets me.

23,"I sit here staring at the last kit kat with pains in my stomach as i try to think how to begin this post. I have just partaken in a junk food binge due to not being able to sleep because of my caffiene consumption today. This morning i had two cups of coffee and then some tea in the afternoon. I dont know why i drink it, it makes me feel like shit, but if i dont i wake up every morning and think about it. although even if i have one small cup, i wont sleep really that night. It was not always like this, but has been for about a year or a little more. In high school i used loads of drugs, mainly prescription stimulants which i was never prescribed and used them consecutively to pass my first semester of college. I used way to much mdma combined with alchohol and everything else almost every weekend in high school as well. After my first semester of college i felt sick and like i had changed so much that there must be something wrong with me. I didnt realize it at the time but very slowly over time drugs appeared to change who i was and how i felt. After that first semester of college i was depressed, and felt fucked up in the head, but i was pretty much able to function as normal. Anyways time went on and i adjusted to the point i moved out and was working in another city. I had quit school though. So time went on and i started smoking and drinking again. eventually i took shrooms and didnt sleep for three weeks after. Not really sure why, trip was fine, intense but okay. Some weird reaction seemed to happen in my brain, ive been climbing out of a hole ever since. Almost a year since and i feel a bit better. Went on a very strict diet, sobered up, and have been trying to get better ever sense, but it seems these drugs have caused irrepairable damage. Not shrooms in particularly but i beleive it was the amphetimines. Scans showed my brain waves were slowed, i cant get good sleep anymore, have pretty bad ocd and obsess over things, yet i am not really able to feel anything mentally. The hardest addiction ive ever tried to quit is coffee. Seems like i should stay away from it being a stimulant an all but i just cant. I need something to make me feel good anymore. Its in my brain it seems like a lack of dopamine. Ill crave food even though i hardly ever feel true hunger in my brain. my portion sizes are way too big, and then ill eat junk food to the point where my stomach is so stretched its painful... Just to feel something. Nothing is fun anymore and life does not have its magic. I feel like fake almost and not in the moment anymore. I love and care about myself now which is much more than i could say in high school, but i feel stuck now. Like i cant get out of a rut. My brain is slow and sometimes i have a hard time talking to others and making decisions. I cant really focus on anything and lose interest to most things immediately. i have tried diets and supplements although am looking into a nootropic stack. i fear pharmaceutical medicine as it could make things worse and i dont trust doctors. i really just dont know what to do anymore. All i want to do is get better, and back to my old self. If i force myself to follow a strict schedule of a clean diet and exercise, i feel great but its so tough for me too adjust and mainly stick to it. I dont get too much out of personal interaction and am always chasing something to make me feel good. If anyone has a similar experience or story and would like to share feel free to respond or message me. Any advice anybody feels they should reply would be greatly appreciated. I know its i pretty sorry situation, and dont mean to post a sob story, just wanted to share my experience, and potentially get some helpful feedback. Thank you.",30Jun2018,1
24,"Twenty minutes ago i was sleeping and i sat in the bed my SO was looking at me but his face began to melt.  apparently i punched my  S.O in the face.

I just heard a scream .

I woke up and his face was alright but i told him to look away because i was scared.

We spent 5 minutes trying to understand what happened. He is sleeping now. But he is beginning to have a black eye. I don’t even remember feeling my arm punching him.

I’m scared because a week ago my grandfather died ,we were extremely close.
Since his death I’m having my moods in a rollercoaster. Also i began to see a shadow walking around the house.

It’s not the first time i see a shadow .The others time happened in a big period of stress but i didn’t talk about it at all.

Now i feel it’s more serious with all what’s happening . I feel confused. I’m also dealing with Borderline Personnality Disorder. Being able to live with it since a while but now i just feel my mind is in shock.

What should i do? How can i confirm if i am at risk to have a psychosis? Was it one? I still feel uncomfortable and confused like i’m in a dream.

I tried to smile ,put my arm in the air just to make sure it’s not my heart . Never had issues with my heart but i’m freaking out.

30,"Hello everybody! Let me tell you about my night. O took half of a 10 mg pill at around 8 pm, as instructed by my psychiatrist.

Around 10 PM I was exhausted and fell asleep on the couch while my boyfriend played video games( this is our normal routine, he has a different schedule than me and I can't sleep in the bedroom alone).  He wakes me up at around 2 AM to go to bed. Normally I stumble into bed and pass back out. But I was wide the fuck awake.

Now, I toss and turn for about an hour, he wakes up and decides he wants to have sex. He begins to play with me. I get *insanely close* and then it just goes away.  No biggie, that happens. But it WONT come back. We start having sex and I pull out my vibrator. Nothing. It all feels amazing but I just won't cum. He finishes, I turn my vibrator on HIGH and *press it firmly on my clit.* Finally after 5 or so more minutes, I cum and it's very unsatisfactory. Boyfriend goes back to sleep, and I'm here, it's 4 AM and I'm still wide awake.

32,"I'm sitting here after another predictable payday which involved me spending over half my paycheque (I work part-time as a chef to put myself through University) on meaningless objects, an expensive dinner and drinks at bar with people I barely know (it's not that they're bad people, it's just that I don't really know them that well) so that I could get some sense of social belonging. I've basically impoverished myself for the next two weeks (probably month) on yet another series of impulses I couldn't control, and it makes me sick to my stomach. I've been smoking weed again lately, which is and has always been terrible for me mentally and socially, but gives me a subliminal excuse to be fucking useless and stupid. I'm hopelessly addicted to porn, despite the fact that I have a fairly long-distance girlfriend (who is a great, beautiful girl and that genuinely loves me but that I'm slowly starting to suspect I don't have deep enough feelings for). I just forgot my sister's birthday on wednesday, because I'm so tangled in my own web of anger, anxiety and self-loathing that I have no energy or will to maintain any of my meaningful relationships. 

This is a recent snapshot of my mental state, but it goes deeper and farther back than that. Around one year ago I was working as middle-management for a restaurant where I was historically accepted as part of the team and reasonably well-liked. However, my new position (which I was simply not prepared for) caused me to alienate a lot of my former friends and my general incompetence at it combined with my poor social reputation eventually resulted in me being a complete and total punching bag at work for two months straight (it was a summer job and this was my fourth year). I'd already established a reputation as being socially awkward, especially around women (I have memories in that regard that will haunt me forever) but the fact that I was also generally seen as good-natured and harmless meant that I had some social protection. Someone couldn't just insult me for no reason and not face some kind of social backlash. This stopped being the case once I became a supervisor. The last few years I've really tried to train myself to stand up to discourtesy and bullying. I've been successful at the expense of a few friendships but there's just so much anger welled up inside of me that any time I fire back verbally at someone who's trying to mock or humiliate me I completely lose my temper. I don't consider myself weak-willed. I have had cowardly moments, almost always concerning women but when I set my mind to something I can stick to my guns better than many, maybe even most people. 

They broke me. There's just no other way to put it. For the first two months of the summer it was bad, but in a manageable way because the people that hated me (there were quite a few) still felt threatened enough by my position that they kept their insults confined to passive insinuations and ""Just-Kidding"" jokes. In the middle of the summer I made a serious fuck-up (I booked the wrong set of days off on the scheduling app, which ruined an entire two week schedule.) and the floodgates just opened. All of a sudden, everyone realized that the target on my back didn't come with any consequences to it. I was subjected to verbal abuse on a daily regimen, sometimes somewhat bearable and sometimes unbearable. I tried to keep sticking up for myself but the constant abuse from so many different angles was too much. Eventually I broke, and just started swallowing whatever people threw at me. I was an absolute joke, a laughingstock suffering humiliations and mockery at an ungodly frequency. I was too broke to quit, too afraid to worsen my already abysmal social status by firing back at the people mocking me, and I just took it. Every basic notion I had of my own personal dignity and worth as an individual just eroded. It was the biggest personal and professional failure of my life and it stretched out over an entire summer.

Here are some of the quotes that continue to come back and haunt me a year later.

""Anon, get the fuck off of Ovens (kitchen station)! You're SLOWING THEM DOWN.""-this while I was a supervisor, which made it that much more humiliating. I hear the mental echo of this dozens, if not hundreds of times every day. It has effectively removed my ability to experience happiness, because it's so firmly engrained in my mind that essentially everything is a mental trigger for it. When something happens that should make me feel good, it's inevitably ruined because the feeling of happiness itself makes me think about how it's inevitable that I will experience this flashback at some point, which makes me experience this flashback.

""Anon, may I? NOBODY laughs at your jokes!"" I know this was more of a result of my social standing than my actual comedic ability. In most of the friend groups  I've had people have considered me funny. Still, even the memory stings in a way I can't fully describe. It completely sapped me of any confidence I had with making people laugh. My delivery is always nervous now, so I default to being serious and humorless in most conversations, which is completely the opposite of my actual personality.

""How does THIS GUY have a girlfriend?"" This was worse because it came from a girl, one that I had actually trained, that I had always treated with respect who just arbitrarily seemed to decide she didn't like me midway through the summer. Most likely swimming along the social tide.

""You're a pussy!"" This was an instance where I actually fired back and managed to dominate the person saying it, but it still resonates with me because at the time it was more than just a plain insult. This was a person who witnessed enough to know how submissive I generally am in social situations that was making a plain, albeit cruel observation.

There's dozens more. Dozens. Insulting my demeanour, my intelligence, my dexterity, my composure, my personality, every fucking aspect of my being. These are just the ones that come to the top of my mind. I know I shouldn't dwell on them, but I can't stop. The harder I try the worse it gets. My fear is that this isn't just a bad year. I genuinely believe that last summer will, at least in some capacity continue to haunt me for the rest of my life. I've tried abstaining from all of my addictions, but the sense of satisfaction that gives me just isn't enough. The shame of being me just creeps in eventually and it all goes to shit. What solace I can find in momentary chemical distractions is the probably only thing keeping me from hanging myself, or worse, following through on the million tiny revenge plots I've fantasized about over the last year, many of which involve physical violence. Yes it is that bad. I fantasize about beating people to death every single day. My heart pumps venom, and somehow I can physically feel it. Something's just not right inside of me, and I don't know what to do. I don't have money for a therapist, and even if I did I don't know if that would even help.

I need help. I don't know what form it will take, but I fucking need help. I can't go on like this.

People with mental illnesses are at the mercy of the hands of their enemy in that based on an enemy’s statement the mentally ill can be jailed in a hospital for days and weeks without ever having their opposition to the hospitalization considered by EMTs and police. It’s a sort of prosecution without due process!! This cycle can then be repeated so often that the quality of life is further reduced for the mentally ill person.

35,"Does anybody else severe new/current relationships simply because you don't think you're good enough? I've been noticing myself having these really negative thoughts, where I'll try to distance myself from people because I don't want theme seeing how much of a loser I am. With current relationship, I'll try and distance myself from friends and family, because they're the ones I care about, and I don't want them to think of me in a bad light. With new relationships, I'll just completely go MIA as soon as I meet someone new. I'm afraid they'll look at my personality, and judge me for it. I'll match with several girls on tinder, and by the end of the week, I'll have unmatched all of them. I say to myself, ""she'll never wanna date you. There's so many other guys; better guys, that she could go on a date with. Who are you?"". I'll notice a girl on the street/party/club and think she's pretty, but I'll be so hesitant to approach her because, like I said before, I just don't feel good enough. I met this girl on bumble last week, we hit it off right away. I asked for her number, and within a couple of days we went out on a date. I texted her something around lunch time, but she didn't respond to me until 9pm. However, the whole day I was just beating myself over why she's not responding. A normal, rational person would think that maybe she's at work, or out with her friends, or she's just too busy to respond. I on the other hand, though I did something for her not to like me anymore. 

The problem is, I know I'm not a loser. I'm in my last year of chemical engineering, I do MMA, I have 3 VERY good friends, a family that loves me, and I would think I'm an attractive person from the amount of matches I get (sorry for the humble brag!).

38,"Some background:

I am a 20 y/o male from Europe and I desperately need advice as to what to do with a complex and painful situation my family is in.

Up to age 12~ I was a pretty normal kid, my father was kind of an asshole but ok overall. I have 2 younger sisters and I was especially close to the older one, we'd do everything together and play every night.

God knows why, maybe because I was a shy and unpopular kid, but for some reason I began developing a sort of ""lust"" for my sister, I didn't have romantic feelings for her but only physical attraction. I knew this was extremely wrong and fought against it, but on several occasions I ""played"" with her and took sexual pleasure from it. There was no sex or something like that, but mostly just touch with clothes while ""playing"".

This went on for about a year I believe, I'm not sure how many times it happened but probably about once a week, I don't know. After about a year I decided I must stop doing this as it was clearly twisted and disgusting, and so I decided to completely cut off any interaction with my sister and mostly stayed in my room all day. 
I can't show a direct correlation but about this time things started going really bad in the family, between me and my parents/ sister and parents/ just parents, the atmosphere became more tense and unpleasant, and I also developed a pretty bad social anxiety.

Since then I always wanted to try and fix all the bad shit in my family, but everytime I want to try and make things better I remember what I did, and feel absolutely unworthy to even try and fix things, as I cannot even allow myself to be honest about what caused me to change to who I am. How could I tell such things to my parents? I'd rather die.

Flash forward to today, I want to leave home soon for university, but I feel it in my bones that if things stay like this I won't be able to live with myself, I can't stop feeling like I singlehandedly destroyed my family with my behaviour and lack of honesty.

-have been diagnosed with depression and ADHD
-feel as if there is more too it
-have almost exaggerated emotions that are completely random and not usually triggered by anything
-patches of extreme empathy and talkativeness and then patches of the complete oposite
-not sure if the prozac or concerta caused this, if i was misdiagnosed etc

Now for those of you that want a bit more information, here you go...
I am 17, have suffered from depression for about 4 years (cant remeber details as i have literally the worst memory) and was recently diagnosed with ADHD.
I am on 60mg of prozac, and 18mg of concerta.
Ever since ive been on prozac (was around time puberty started aswell so could be coincidence) i have had periods in my life where i would find a new hobby, interest, new idenity even and i would get excessively optimistic about that certain thing, sometimes i would even have multiple things that i would take on at once but then fall out of that mood and realise how stupid those things actually were and lose interest in basically everything again. Those patches would rarely happen but last a few weeks, but up until now the fluctuations have been getting more common but wouldn’t last as long, literally can last 10 minutes up to a week now, and it happens i would say once or twice a month.

Typical depression symptoms usually last longer and sort of fill in the remaining gaps (except for the rare occasion that i feel normal)
Motivation sucks and really bad pessimism.
Depression is no where near as bad as it was pre-prozac though.
I will sometimes have extreme empathy for people and a ridiculous urge to talk, other times i can be hyperactive and extremely annoying to everyone, and then of course there’s those times where I don’t care for others and hate when people talk to me.

I just want to feel “normal” again like i was before these teenage years, im not sure if its hormones or something more serious but its really tiring.

I dont bother talking to most of these people, but the really negative ones, get stuck in my head the most. I will end up imagining them following me everywhere i go and haunting me. just criticizing everything i do. For example, if i am at the gym, I will imagine this one guy in my class mocking me for not lifting heavy enough. Or i just imagine him or anyone else telling me Im dumb. Also, If I get time off from school, like on the weekend, I still hear them all and I cant stop. Its just my imagination but i cant stop it. 

Similarily, if i surround myself with positive people, they tend to follow me around as well in my head. If i am watching youtube videos, sometimes those people in the youtube videos will stuck with me for a while too and usually this is pleasant. However, these pretend conversations i keep having are really stressing me out in general as they are very exhausting.

44,"(For the record: I was diagnosed with ADHD, OCD and have “borderline traits”.)

I’ve noticed that as long as I can remember, I have this intense overwhelming overreaction to being reprimanded.

1) Age 6: I was at a summer camp in a local park, got yelled at for not knowing how to play soccer. I was so upset at people being upset that I ran home, and stayed at my front door for hours till my parents came home.

2) Age 11: Pulled a stupid prank on a friend during drama class, got reprimanded by the teacher and sent out to sit in the hall as punishment. I felt so ashamed that I quit drama, despite doing it everyday since I was 5.

3) Adult: Tried to be funny, ended up bothering my sleeping partner, and got (rightly) told off. In order to calm myself down, I had to leave his place and talk myself down from vowing to never talk to him again because I felt so stupid about being an idiot.

48,"TLDR: I feel like I ruined my wedding a year ago and I’ve been depressed ever since and feel like I have no one to talk to.

I’ve been wedding obsessed 5 years before I was even engaged. Planning my wedding and getting all the details was the best time I’ve ever had! I loved planning the wedding with my now husband and living my dream. We were planning on getting married outside in a rose garden with rose arches. We had parasols for the sun and had a beautiful reception site right on the grounds.  Cut to the week of the wedding, the forecast said rain the day before and the day of. We had a plan b but my dream was completely ruined. I cried so so so much because after planning for over a year it’s coming to not be what I wanted. 

The day of the wedding it wasn’t raining but the ground was soaked and not good to walk on so we’d have to do it indoors. My bridesmaids like to party and at this point I was kind of numb to the whole experience since it wasn’t what I really wanted. I did have a nice time getting ready with my bridesmaids the champagne was flowing and there was even a tequila shot. On the way to the venue some of my bridesmaids were passing around a bottle but I didn’t partake at this point I was having a great time laughing and smiling. The moment we got to the venue my mom scolded me for being “blado”, her word for drunk, right before I walked down the isle. 

The wedding happened I read my hand written vows I cried, a lot because I love my husband and was feeling the love. I was also nervous and ended up going off script from my vows since I wrote them too long and it was hard to read while shaking.  At the reception I only had my one glass of champagne for toasting because my moms words were echoing in my head and I already felt like she hated me. I drank water all night and actually got sick after eating from nerves. I danced the night away and had some fun but again not like I imagined.

The next morning I woke up crying and got sick because I felt like everyone hated me and I ruined the wedding. I still feel this way today. I’ve talked to my bridesmaids since the wedding and they all say that my mom was out of line for saying that to me right before walking down the isle and that I was fine and just nervous. But I still feel like I let everyone down. 

I’ve had this pit in my stomach every time I think about that day from the rain to my moms words to maybe I shouldn’t have drank at all. I can’t keep the thoughts out and it has had a toll on my relationship with my husband because I’m carrying this weight and feel like I can’t talk to him about it. I don’t like to complain to my friends because I feel like it’s not their problem and I’m being ridiculous because others have real problems. I just can’t shake this and our anniversary is in 2 weeks. I hate myself and I hate my wedding I want a do over and feel like the worst person alive. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I’m medicated for it but these thoughts won’t stop. I feel so lonely because I feel like I can’t talk to my family or friends about this. I’m literally crying as I write this. I feel like my husband doesn’t deserve me and like I’m a horrible person. Sorry this is so long I’m not really looking for sympathy I just need to get this off my chest to see if this helps because I don’t know what else to do. 😔",30Jun2018,3

The objective is to understand whether/how social status affects low mood (and possibly anxiety). My aim is to further understanding of how a person's social environment can mediate negative affect.  


I do warn that some of the questions involve assessing your levels of anxiety and low mood and a lot of questions refer to perception of social status and some people may find these distressing. Please make sure you only participate if you feel it will not affect you negatively to be asked such questions.  


People in all countries are welcome but If you're in the UK or are able to use UK Amazon vouchers from your country you have the chance to enter a draw for one out of fifteen £20 Amazon vouchers at the end of the survey.  


The exact theory being tested is explained at the end of the survey to avoid biasing people's responses and I will happily share the results once I've got them.  The data you provide is completely anonymous and cannot be traced back to you.

56,"I don't know if this even belongs here, but I'm feeling heartbroken and I don't really know where to talk about this. I saw something just horrible today, and I'm having a really hard time trying to forget about it. Part of me feels like I'm being a huge baby but I love animals, I care about them and their well being very much. I'm also a very sensitive person, always have been. 

My boyfriend and I were out running some errands, and getting lunch before heading home. He was driving. There was a parade on the road we normally take back, so we took a different way that we rarely go. On that road was some construction reducing the road to only one narrow lane going each way. We were driving along when I saw something up ahead, moving. As we got closer I could see that it was a dog, squirming around on the side of the road. I won't go into too much detail on what he looked like but he was obviously badly hurt, he probably got hit by a car, and was stuck in the road trying to pull himself over the curb but couldn't. 

I immediately went ""oh my god"" and tried to not look at first, but I wanted to see how bad he was hurt, and it was bad. And we just drove right past, as did everybody else. Traffic was bumper to bumper. My boyfriend tells me that the road was busy and somebody would definitely help him or call for help. That one of the construction workers would probably do something. That we couldn't have just stopped in the middle of the road and help up traffic and we don't have the money to pay a vet anyway.

I'm trying to tell myself he's probably right but I can't stop seeing what I saw in my head. It kills me thinking about how he was hurt and suffering and I worry nobody else will help him. We should have helped him. I feel so horrible, I cried for about an hour after we made it back home so hard I couldn't see and I'm struggling not to cry now. I'm trying to stop and get it out if my mind but I just can't. I feel disgusting because we didn't stop and help him ourselves. ",30Jun2018,0
57,"It’s been a very frustrating, difficult journey for me, particularly the last two years. I’ve always had anxiety, since I was like 10 years old. I saw a therapist back then, but truth is my parents didn’t know how to handle me and my anxiety, so it got swept under the rug a lot. It got worse when we moved to a very conservative/religious country. At that point my mom would ignore it, and whenever an issue happened the excuse would be “Dianna just gets nervous easily.”I also stopped seeing my therapist shortly after I turned 11.

After years of no treatment and trying to ignore the problem, I took the initiative and told my GP that I thought I had anxiety and that I thought that was the source of a lot of my physical ailments at that time (and turns out I was on most cases). She referred me to a psychiatrist who evaluated me and said I could really benefit from CBT, but also gave me a very low dose prescription of Xanax to take as needed. I was then given a list of possible psychologists available to me and picked one that was highly recommended. Truth was the whole reason behind wanting to take the initiative, was because my husband and I had decided we wanted to start trying to have a family, and I could only see benefits in trying to get therapy before even being pregnant so I could be the best version of myself for my future child. And this where the story turns to shit.

My therapist and her treatment has been awesome, and she helped me through issues I didn’t even realize were an issue. Overall, I am a much better person than I was before I started seeing her. But our journey to parenthood has been anything but easy, and that has caused my anxiety to retrograde my progress a little. In the first six months of trying to conceive, I got a nasty urinary tract infection that landed me in the hospital for a week. While it was stressful, I was able to overcome it because I figured pregnancy was inevitable. But then, six months later (1 year trying), I checked in with my gynecologist and after doing the usual fertility work up, we found out one of my tubes was blocked. I started fertility treatment, and six more months no pregnancy, so we followed up with a second opinion and a surgery. I have now recently been diagnosed with endometriosis. While the surgery cleared all the adhesions and scarring caused by the endometriosis, it’s been a rough ride to deal with because now we have to wait three months before we can start trying again with a “clean slate”. The anger over his is overwhelming as now my best friend is pregnant. To make matters worse, the UTIs came back in April and today I was confirmed I still have one and the doctor is at a loss as to why I keep getting them. This is just fueling my rage even more.

My anxiety has gotten to ridiculous levels that I don’t think I ever reached before. It’s been a roller coaster of emotions (some days I am ok, other days the sounds of my neighbors’ kids laughing outside my window makes me depressed). I feel so angry and I feel bad because I feel like I am taking it all out on my husband. I feel guilty because I feel like no one is getting the really me anymore, just an angry and bitter version of myself. The anxiety and anger are making me question everything. I have never considered myself an overly religious person, but I always knew I believed in and trusted God. But this journey has me doubting everything I ever thought I believed in, and for some reason loosing my faith has hit me the hardest. Some days I feel like I can’t even trust my doctors (even though they are all very well regarded and specialists in their fields). I just feel like a burden to my husband because we can’t even afford fun things anymore because of all the money going to pay doctor bills. Not that it matters because I don’t even want to have fun anymore. I barely even have the energy to eat sometimes. 

And the worst part is, I got a notice yesterday that my therapist is having a procedure done next week when my session was supposed to be so we have to reschedule for week after next. When I got that notice, at that moment I was in one of my “highs” so I was fine. Today after seeing my urologist and getting the “great news”, I am so not. And of course the anxiety is in the drivers seat showing me how everything is terrible and will be terrible and.....yeah I don’t even know anymore. I am so sick and tired of this defective body of mine. ",30Jun2018,2

I have post-traumatic stress from the fall out but with therapy, emotional healing, faith and mindfulness work... I’ve been much better and symptoms are !greatly! improved although still working through some things.

I am still working through and understanding and coming to terms with what happened and learning from what lead to that gnarly situation.

My question is that: is it common to become delusional in the acute stage of an emotional breakdown. I was paranoid, needy, codependent beyond measure, became suicidal, and of course emotionally unstable.

I was being told constantly by my abusers/ qualifiers that I was being immature, I was the, “crazy one” etc. all this has played out that they really had some serious problems themselves. 

Sometimes I still have those feeling of paranoia or I have to take a few steps back to get clarity on a situation when it comes to how people are approaching me about things... which I think is healthy.

But what prompted me to write this is reading an article about a delusional person and wondering if I exhibited that same stuff, as I was a bit triggered and like to keep a clear narrative as I continue to grow and learn.

61,"   Hey reddit. 
Ever since I can remember, my mother was a raging alcoholic and my father was a raging man child who wouldn’t leave her no matter how many times she slapped me, cheated on him, tackled my brother (I always called the cops when she’d get violent with my little brother), got DUIs (3 of them. In, like, a year. Absolutely crazy that she’s still allowed on the road), costed us thousands in booze and unlawful bails from jail, and belittled me to the point of tears and suicidality. She was abusive both mentally, physically, and emotionally, but he chose to turn a blind eye constantly, holding onto the hope that rehab would work: even though after two months clean she would always rebound worse than before. He, on the other hand, was completely disrespectful, childish, immature, and angry constantly. When he wasn’t screaming at video games, he was screaming at me. Everything I did was a crime to him; sometimes I would get fed up with his demeaning (and often sexist) remarks and call him out on his immaturity, to which he’d respond in a sarcastic manner, saying “yeah sure” or something along those lines. I would tell him that his response only proves my point, to which he would, once again, respond sarcastically and probably break something and slap me. Never has he shown me a grain of respect, and though I’ve tried, I can’t feel any for either of my parents. It’s truly sad. Anyways, my parents rarely (very, very rarely) showed me love as a child, and it’s left me completely emotionally hardened. I no longer cry when I’m sad, I don’t yell when I’m angry, I don’t laugh much or smile, I don’t express any strong emotions. I’m entirely composed, and I often lack sympathy and empathy for others; the thing that makes me angriest is when people complain about little things. I know it probably shouldn’t be like that but... Is this normal? I’m not depressed, I know that much; but is it normal to be so emotionally “hardened” to the point of complacency? I suppose it’s good because I can take a lot, but... it makes me feel like I’m not really a person, because everywhere I turn people are laughing, crying, yelling... never me though. I feel detached, even if I’m not wholly unhappy about that.

Anyways, my question stands: is it normal to feel this way?",30Jun2018,1

Sorry for the rambling.

First of all let me just say I love my mum but I am really struggling with her behaviour and wonder if she has a mental health problem to help me understand her more.

Mum is a compulsive liar, she lies about everything, including little things of no great importance (changing a story she told 5 mins ago) as well as larger heath issues that constantly seem to contradict what was said previously.

She does seem to care about me but you cannot hold a proper conversation with her. She seems to ask questions about my life to tick a box and when I respond, takes one word and goes off on a tangent about something in her life.

She has to make everything about her, thinks people stare at her (because they find her attractive), has no real opinions (they change based on what you say to her as she always wants to agree with you) and can be too spontaneous without considering consequences (buying a new car for no reason).

Recently I have really been struggling to deal with her,

My question is, does this seem to be some kind of mental health issue? Should I be concerned for her wellbeing or is this just her.

I'm still trying to get my thoughts together on this article. To summarise, it's a critique of the contemporary conversation around mental health, the attempts to normalise mental health by reducing it to the status of physical health problems, like the broken leg. What the author characterises as the imprecise and dismissive language in this conversation runs parallel to criticisms of mental health practitioners, care systems, and public policy around mental healthcare provision.

64,"I'm a 19 year old male.I have strongly suspected that I have ADD for years because of my inability to focus, slow thinking and lack of motivation.

My life looks fairly calm as I do not attend classes nor have a job. I have struggled in school ever since I was a child with anxiety which has increased with age to the point where I got a medical certificate a year ago. I always used to get enough sleep during school days and even now when I go to bed 11-12 PM and wake up 8 hours later. My anxiety has calmed since then.

However, in most cases all my symptoms of ADD goes away after around 6-8 PM and it has always been this way. At that time, I feel a burst of motivation and I become in a good mood, I feel self confident, I become more social, my anxiety goes away, and best of all I can think better, faster and I have complete focus (overall stimulated). My ADD has a big impact on processing information, my constant brain fog makes thinking difficult such as understanding what I read and interpret vocally; it leaves my mind so quickly that I forgot what I read before the next sentence and this makes it hard for me to keep up in conversations and learn new things. It makes me unsocial and quiet for most of the time.

Strangely, all my symptoms goes away at the evening and in some rarer cases from the time I wake up and can last for 3-12 hours. A while back I read about the circadian rhythm and its symptoms and it might have something to do with my situation. A disturbed circadian rhythm has been linked to Bipolar Disorder and depression but the only symptoms I experience are decreased cognition, fatigue and anxiety during these times. I have never had major depression or manic periods. I have also looked into chronotherapy and some of its methods to adjust the circadian rhythm which I have planned on attempting along with low dose of lithium orotate which has yet to arrive at my doorstep.

I recently started experimenting with sleep by going to bed at different times and sleeping less in hope to recreate the desired effect and to my surprise I could  start seeing some patterns. Turns out I am experiencing much less symptoms of ADD and anxiety after going to sleep late at night around 2-3 AM compared to 10 PM where I would feel anxious the next day, which could explain why I felt worse during school days compared to now. Getting less hours of sleep have also shown to have an improvement in my symptoms and I can consume caffeine without getting more anxious during the day.

My little experiments with sleep have been more effective than any drug I've used. I hope that this can raise more ideas on how to treat similar cases.

67,"I’m a 22 year old girl and I have really bad social anxiety. I was abused a lot as a child including a lot of sexual abuse and because of that I have a hard time making friends and keeping relationships. I tend to get depressed a lot and bad thoughts come into my head a lot. I pretend to be completely dumb, like I literally act like just the ditzy giggly girl that’s always happy even though I’m usually sad. And it’s been long enough people have forgotten I’m smart. I get treated like a child a lot, like My friends like won’t let me do certain things and won’t say certain things around me. I still sleep with stuffed animals and I have a lot of like stuff most people my age wouldn’t. I’m extremely irresponsible with money and nearly drink myself to death every day. I’m not sure really why I act the way I do. And sometimes I get really depressed over the way people view me. I don’t know what the matter with me is :( ",30Jun2018,3
68,"TL;DR - I am quite a paranoid person but the past 2-3 months have been hell, I am currently seeing a GP and a private therapist but want to get to the bottom of it and find out what is actually up with me. 20 Y/O UK Male.

First of all I want to make a big point of saying I don't intend to offend anyone, I know obviously how serious ADHD is and  although I have some symptoms I haven't actually been diagnosed.

I am seeing a therapist and trying to clarify with my GP and hopefully get to the bottom of it.

The reason I feel as if I have ADHD is due to the fact that I have a constant restless feeling I cannot sit still and certain symptoms have flared up over the past 2-3 months. I have been in and out of employment from the age of 17-20. I then started a business at the age of 18 and I have been running it ever since. I wanted to start focusing more and working harder on certain aspects of the company when I returned from my holiday but I had vivid flashbacks from when one of my old bosses told me I had ADHD and I thought no way could I as it would have been diagnosed earlier in life right? 

However as I say i've been doing things recently that would make sense, sleeping problems, constantly feeling as if I need to do things, worrying about a million and one things constantly and now more than ever I am realising certain traits that I show which could be linked to the issue. I have always been a massive worrier as well, I hate not being in control so when I have alcohol for example that really affects me.

What I am also worrying about now is the fact that when I get to the GP I will forget a lot of what I have been feeling, to counter that I have written down on a notepad the symptoms I have been feeling. I almost feel as if I could cry if I did have ADHD as it would explain so much about my life and I am now just really keen to go forward and learn what I can do to control it if it is that.

I also fear that I have a whole host of other medical problems, my GP thinks it potentially could be diabetes related but I suppose I will learn about that in coming weeks.

As I said I have been keeping a list of symptoms because I am being extremely forgetful at the moment.

\- Constant peeing in the day and sometimes at night, I do drink a lot of water at the moment as well.

\- Excessive sweating, not all the time but when I try and focus on a hard task or something in general I start to sweat on my forehead excessively.

\- I get an off balance feeling, almost like vertigo and feel as if I need to sit down when this happens.

\- My skin is quite itchy a lot around the forearms

\- Terrible upper back pain and I am constantly trying to stretch it out all the time

\- Major procrastination of tasks and I will literally wait until the last minute

\- Loud noises really get on my nerves, I can lose concentration on anything when a loud noise happens whatever it would be 

\- Sleeping issues, I have racing thoughts at night - then I will wake up at 3/4 sometimes and then wake up again at 7 I genuinely can't think of a time i've ever had a good 8 hours.

\- I feel as if for my age I seriously struggle to do things that would be classed as easy or menial for example, creating a plan of action or a regime for something I just can't seem to bring my head around it.

\- I also have two great parents who actively disagree that any mental disabilities exist so trying to convince them is driving me up the wall :)",30Jun2018,1
69,"I think my 19-year-old older brother is beginning to develop paranoid schizophrenia. He's autistic, has a huge learning disability, and suffers from depression, so my mom has been taking care of him (he still lives at home and hasn't graduated high school or ever had a job). He also suffered a lot of mental abuse from my dad when he was younger. 

He's beginning to think that my mom has been poisoning him with pills that in reality are multivitamins and prescribed antidepressants. He even talked about how he thinks my mom tests him like a lab rat by getting him addicted to certain pills then taking them away from him, and that my mom's end goal is to mind control him so he will do work for her. He believes that the pills that he's taken have been making him lose his mind and are responsible for him hearing voices in his head. He thinks that somehow me (his 17-year-old younger brother who barely interacts with him) and his mom have driven him to insanity by experimenting on him and playing mind games with him. His theories are really far out, and it's scary. All these theories and things about hearing voices only come to the surface when he throws a tantrum. He acts like a little kid in a lot of ways, so when he doesn't get what he wants he throws a massive terrifying threatening tantrum until he gets his way (he's very mentally abusive to my mom). These tantrums are when we hear all these crazy things and get really worried about him. Whenever I intervene in a tantrum I guess I push his buttons, he usually gets way out of control when I do. I've had to buy a taser and pepper spray because he's at the point where (when in a tantrum) he's constantly threatening my life and threatening to assault me. He's accused me of stealing his friends and manipulating him to get what I want from him. He also smokes a lot of weed and tobacco, drinks occasionally, and experiments with psychedelics.

He needs help, fast, whatever he has. But he doesn't cooperate with my mom or I, and whenever we call police or mental health services, he's able to pull his act together and pretend he's totally fine, and they believe him. I don't think he'd ever willingly be tested for schizophrenia or any of the other mental issues he has, and that's what I think needs to be done in order for him or my mom to move on with their lives. 

My question is: based on the way I described it, does it sound like my brother is starting to develop paranoid schizophrenia? and how can I get my brother the treatment he needs when he refuses to cooperate? I'd basically like to know whatever I need to know to be able to help him.

Thanks so much!",30Jun2018,4
70,"Long post for some backstory:
So for the past year and a half to two years my mental health has been steadily declining it seems. I first noticed symptoms of pretty severe social anxiety after the first year out of high school, this went on for about year before i started seeing a therapist. Seeing a therapist definitely helped reduce the anxiety some what but it was still affecting my life negatively, then i went into two major depressive episodes and was put into an outpatient program for suicidal ideation. I was put on Zoloft starting at 25 mg(now taking 50mg) and the suicidal thoughts feel different now i still get them, but less. Sorry if this is all over the place but last night i watched American horror story and in an episode the daughter makes a suicide attempt with pills and for some reason it must’ve triggered my SI and later that night i couldn’t stop thinking about killing myself and i started looking for pills i could take to do it. That’s the first time I’ve ever gone that far but i still think I’d never go thru with it but that just frightened me a bit. Again sorry for the lengthy post, just had to talk about this . If anyone can add some insight it would be much appreciated. ",30Jun2018,1
71,"I think I have been experiencing dissociation or depersonalization/ derealization. I first heard of these symptoms recently. I thought I was just losing my mind, so it’s comforting knowing others experience this. 

Sometimes nothing feels real at all. I get overwhelmed with frustration and just cry because I do not understand this world. I feel like an alien. Everything around me just feels so confusing. Who am I? This person in the mirror is me? Is anyone else real? What are we doing here? Sometimes it feels as if I’m waking up to reality and realize that I’ve been going through the motions not realizing what’s going on.

 Does anyone else feel like this? I just feel so perplexed by this world. Maybe I really am an alien.",30Jun2018,4
72,"Not sure this counts as a mental health issue. Basically I do this thing where if there’s somewhere I’m supposed to go, someone I’m supposed to meet, something I’m supposed to do I’ll continuously plan the whole scenario out in my mind. Like, extremely detailed. I plot out entire conversations, reactions, emotions, outcomes, literally every detail. I even have several different scenarios for the same event. The most frustrating thing is the fact that things never actually go the way I plan them out to go. Which is obvious because you can never really predict how a conversation with someone will go or anything of the sorts. I don’t know if I do this because of anxiety or something but I just wanted to know if anyone else does the same thing.",30Jun2018,1
73,"I've had OCD for 25+ years and recently read about Borderline Personality Disorder for a friend and was surprised when I recognised myself in a lot of the symptoms.

Before investigating my options with this further I would like to see if I have any other overlapping conditions that I didn't know about. I know a self questionnaire isn't a diagnosis but I just want a rough idea.",30Jun2018,2
74,"This will not sound like your typical r/mental health, and isn't anything like which I usually post, but it's relevant and the positives should be just as much valued as the negatives. So went to my guitar teacher's wedding today and I met this 36 year old woman (I am 15) and she was so remarkable that I just don't know how to describe her. She also has autism (I was diagnosed with moderate autism in 2016) and I went out to cool down and she was smoking alone outside. We just smiled at each other and living in London (this was in Oxfordshire, which is a small village in the country side of Oxford) that is the nicest and friendliest a person can get. But she started to talk to me as if I were her equal and we didn't not know each other. It's a country side, so people are generally quite honest, so she said some things which might be considered racist in London, but she was nice and it came from a good place and not the KKK like how the media describes people with different opinions to be. So we got talking and she genuinely seemed so nice, despite being so much older she spoke to me like I was an equal. So naturally our mental health problems came up and she seemed to be going through the same problems as me, with anxiety and depression, and because she was so nice and comforting I felt comfortable mentioning my depression to her and didn't feel like an attention seeking bitch whenever I usually accidentally let out the fact that I had anxiety to people. She seemed to have the same thing, and later I found out she has autism as well but on the deeper side of the spectrum because of her disprexia. She told me that she sometimes get so anxious that she has to excuse herself from social situations and start crying, and she cried in front of me thinking about it and I told her that's exactly how I felt. We talked about autism for a while and she said that it was more like a strength as well as a problem because you can empathize and sympathize with other people better. So I stated with her for the rest of the night and we had so much in common and I feel so happy because I have so much trouble making friends generally that having someone else be so readily enthusiastic about being my friend that I felt so relieved and comfortable around her within only a few minutes which seems impossible generally because of my social anxiety. She also told me that if I ever needed any support then I should text her (we shared our Facebook details and are now friends on Facebook) which I thought was lovely and almost made me cry. So yeah, I just thought I should share that with you guys because sometimes positive mental health is just as important negative mental health and to give all of you out there going through a hard time a boost in finding the right people who ease your anxiety and you can relate to.

75,"Right off the bat: I'm an 18 y/o that recently graduated high school, going to community college in the fall and likely starting my first job this summer. 

I have a nagging feeling that people don't actually care much for me, particularly friends, but there was even someone who had a crush on me not long ago, and it just feels fake. Like people are pretending to care for my company so I don't feel bad. 

Yes, I probably have some self-confidence issues, such as downplaying myself often and tending towards a pessimistic outlook for most things. I don't feel like I bring much socially. My friends try to tell me otherwise but I struggle to believe them. 

My friends are reasonably connected, my family is supportive (though they don't know about this problem, just my pessimism), I'm not suicidal.. but I just don't feel sure that the people I hold close are honest with me and interested in having me around.",30Jun2018,2
76,"My mom sounds, to me, like she’s got some undiagnosed mental illness, but I’d have no idea what it would be. So today, she walks up to me, smiling, and flipping me off. I said what are you doing that for? “Your shirt”, she said, referencing my Johnny cash shirt that I was wearing. I said, oh ok, but she kept doing it, and I asked her to get her hand out of my face because she’d raised it to my nose-level, and bought her hand close to my face. She immediately became defensive as I asked why she’d yelled and my dog yelped loudly as I was in the restroom. 

She started answering me, but not directly. I asked if she hit him, and she didn’t, but I guess when she slammed our sliding door he’d put his paw out and it got pinched. I said “oh nice” and started to walk away because he’d just recently gotten a hurt paw, and she just went off on me for being snotty. Keep in mind, she was getting overly frustrated with the dog not listening, I mean yelling and losing control over her own emotions. This isn’t just impatient raising her voice, I’m talking full on yelling. I asked if she wanted me to bring the dog inside, and she said, “oh yeah, so he can get hurt again?” I asked, “bringing him inside would hurt him?”. Again she tells me I’m being very rude and I’m legitimately confused. I’m literally just asking her what her logic is here, and she spins it as if I’m accosting her. She said something like, “I’m gonna walk away before I catch an assault charge”, to which I said I have no idea what I’m doing wrong here.

The next part’s what I really found weird. I was wearing 2 compression elbow sleeves (was working out, and I’ve got very bad tendonitis) and she says “why are you wearing those?” And begins to imply it’s like a tough guy look or something. Then she said, “oh I know, it’s for dance right, you’re taking up ballet, yeah?” Obviously this is false, and I said, “you’re literally insane, what are you doing?” I think she started to realize how fucking odd she was acting, because she tried to play it all off as a joke, and ask “no seriously, what are the sleeves for?”  


I don’t make enough money to move out, and I don’t know who to talk to about this, because it isn’t the first time she’s just acted fucking strange like this. It’s like I’m talking to a different person, almost like how “crazy” people act in movies. Am I just overreacting, or is this as weird as I feel like it is?",30Jun2018,1
77,"Because I surely do. I stopped going on Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook, bacause seeing people I know so happy, careless and meeting with each other makes me feel so pathetic. I even stopped watching a TV show for a bit because watching those characters so happy just hurt. I'm out of high school now and have already spent a whole month in my house, occasionally meeting my friend and family. It's no surprise that I'm quite lonely. 
I also feel so lazy and not as productive as I would like to be. I wanted to work on so many things during this break (if I get into college, I will have summer break till the start of October) but it seems to me that I've wasted the last month on YouTube (because I apparently have no friends, so watching YouTubers makes me feel like I'm not that alone. Some of them even feel like friends to me. I know - pathetic). 
I know I need to stop comparing to others but I simply can't. 
I don't really know what to do and why I've written this post. Maybe I just need to let it all out and make sure that I'm not the only one doing that. 

Take care!",30Jun2018,209
78,"My brain feels like a constant stream of thoughts and voices, but none of them are constructive or helpful. If one event happens, all I can think about is that event. ""Did that person like me? Am I good person? Did I say the right thing? I hope they didn't think this about my comment."" Etc etc etc. Earlier this week, I got into a car accident which was very obviously not my fault. However, all I could think about was my image as an Asian woman driving and getting in a wreck, the cost of car repairs, and constantly playing the same event over and over and over again. I feel as if my brain is on a million shots of espresso and is just buzzing constantly.

Because when you think about it is that not when anxiety starts getting really bad, when you have had it for so long that this high level of anxiety basically becomes your natural response.

80,"My mood is so fucking unstable. Seven days ago I was incredibly depressed, laying on the floor, drinking and listening to military marches all day. Then I felt fine for like 3 days, reading, studying, attending to my duties, etc. Nothing has actually changed in my condition, and it made me paranoid. Like I'm going to remember all of a sudden how lonely I am and how impossibly fucked the world is and I'll start feeling sad again. 

Then I had one of the best nights of my life 3 days ago, yet tonight I've been so depressed that I cut my legs to try to make myself feel better with an endorphin rush and cried for ~30 minutes after I saw a white girl holding some darkie’s hand. My mood is so volatile that I don't even trust myself and my inner thoughts anymore. I look at everyone around me and I feel like I'm not even a real person.

82,"This is my first post here, but I wanted to let something out. I have realised lately that my mental health problems started in childhood. My mom was an alcoholic and I'm convinced she had a personality disorder. Anything I did she would manage to turn it around to her, for example if I fell over in the street I would be told off for how this made her look. I was always insulted, and she would belittle any positive's I had in life. When I reached my teens I felt I couldn't cope any more and I started self harming, I even took over doses. Again I wasn't shown compassion it was all about how this affected her. She would tell me how I was a mistake and how I made her mentally ill. I grew up thinking that I just made things worse and that I would just be better off dead. On a few occasions she went into a psychiatric hospital and I often thought it was because of me. Because she wasn't ill until she had me (or what I was made to believe at the time.)

My therapist told me her behaviour towards me was a form of emotional abuse, and I feel this has all contributed to how I am now. I have social anxiety and bad depression I find it hard to trust people, but yet I won't let people down even if it means I have to do thing's I don't want to do for fear of their reaction. My mom passed away a few years ago and I feel this just adds to the issues, because I find myself grieving for my mom, but then I am also angry at how she was with me.

How have your mom issues moulded you? And how do you cope from day to day?",30Jun2018,2
83,I have a lot of social anxiety and I sometimes feel less than for having a mental illness. I've been pushing myself to meet new people and go out more. I just don't really know how to tell people I have bipolar disorder without feeling like they will judge me for it. I guess I should work on feeling more secure but I'm young and struggle with self esteem. I'm currently in therapy and it's helping I just wish I could move past these feelings. Anyway I was wondering if anyone else felt similarly. ,30Jun2018,4
