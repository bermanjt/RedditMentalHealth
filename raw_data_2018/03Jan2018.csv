0,"Hey guys, 

Ever since I can remember I've been a really jealous person (likely stemming from insecurity and a propensity for standards of perfection that I set for myself but cannot meet). It has affected my relationships since I was young and I'm really ready to rid myself of these behaviours (I'll lash out when I'm jealous - if I'm feeling upset or threatened about something I'll state it to the person that I feel is wronging me (typically my partner) and that'll result in a fight and them feeling awful). I want to be secure in myself and not let fear of abandonment or being disliked stop me from enjoying myself in the moment. 

I hate the idea of my partner liking or connecting with someone more than me and I have this intense desire to just be the best and be the most loved etc etc and I'm so exhausted by it and feel absolutely crazy. 

I should also mention that I struggle with pretty intense anxiety (which has gotten better over the years since I've actually put a name to it and am able to separate it from who I am as a human), and have periods of mild depression. 

Any advice/tactics? I've been to multiple therapists and all they use is talk therapy and I'm much more of a creator/doer/pragmatic person so need tangible tactics to use to feel like I'm making strides. 

Thanks so much in advance for the help. I'm honestly at my wit's end here and am worried I'll never be able to have a normal relationship because of my broken brains. ",03Jan2018,2
1,I am so embarrassed to be lonely. I feel this way as I don't seem to be seeing my friends as much any more (to do with work) and I am single. I have one friend I see nearly every week. I think I should thank him for being one of the few people who seem to want me around. He actually invites me to stuff where I meet others. I need to let it out to this friend because I think he will understand he already understands the lonliness I get from being single. Like I said I am embarrassed to say it. I don't really talk to my therapist about it either. I tend to focus on my social anxiety. Im hoping talking to a real friend might make me more comfortable with talking about this issue. ,03Jan2018,1

3,"I know it's really messed up but I just hate reality so much and would prefer to not live in it even if it sucked. At least it would be better than the dull reality of our rotting world and the treadmill of work and death that I'll be on once I'm out of school. It's defiantly not for attention cause I'd really hate to go back to a mental hospital and the meds make you fat. Preferably no one would find out. And besides I already got to much attention for my ed and being trans.

I think that i might be predisposed cause I have delusions on and off especially about magic. Also I can spend alot of time just pacing and or fidgeting while daydreaming. Also I have a family history of mental illness cause my moms blood related aunt is schizophrenic. And my gramma and aunt are bipolar. I also get these weird imagerys and compulsions in my head most are based on fantasy.


 Like in impatient for my ed and self harm I tried to summon a demon to get out but I couldn't make it work:(. when when I'm in them I'm convinced even if I prove it wrong like having a spell do nothing. I end up rationalizing it as having to get more skilled and having to absorb more energy from the darkness, night and other people's life forces. I also get some more paranoid or bizarre ones but there less frequent and shorter. When I'm out of the delusion I can tell there false but with the magic one I still feel compelled to eat people's life forces and stuff even when I know it's not real. 

Anyways I'm starting to think that I might be able to trigger psychosis in my self by sleep depriving myself. I'm started trying it last night by getting 4 hours of sleep after a week of trouble sleeping.",03Jan2018,0
4,"I’ve been trying to find the words to write for about a week now. I want to write something inspirational, something helpful. Something that will show other males that while what happened is not okay, it’s okay to admit it and seek counseling. 

I’ve been struggling to find the words. 

I was groomed and molested regularly at a young age by a pedophile. I’m 28 years old now, and it’s been messing with my head for years. I didn’t recognize it until about two years ago, but it affected me more than I realized. 

Today I went and met with a therapist for the first time about it, and all of the issues in my life that I believe might be directly related to what happened. 

In the end, all I can say is: If you were affected in a similar way and you haven’t attempted to seek therapy, don’t be embarrassed to do so. It’s not fun, and meeting a perfect stranger to talk about my regular childhood rape/molestation is hands down one of the most stressful and anxiety inducing things I’ve ever done. 

But after a week of trying to find the words, I came home and was able to write this. 

It’s okay to seek help.",03Jan2018,6
5,"Today, I told the girl I am deeply infatuated with that I couldn't be as close to her because it hurt me so much to see her take interest in other guys and that I couldn't get over her if I was as close to her as I was. 

She broke up with her boyfriend in November. She said that she thought my priority should have been to be there for her, but its been two months since she broke up with her boyfriend and I've felt this way about her for over six months. 

I told her back in August how I felt and she said she understood but that she was happy with her boyfriend and I told her I understood and that I didn't want things to change. I told her that I still wasn't over her last Wednesday and she gave very terse responses. We hadn't spoken again until tonight. 

Tonight I told her that I didn't think I could carry on our relationship the way that it was. She was clearly hurt by it and from the tone of her response I don't think she wants to speak to me again. I think she feels betrayed. 

I feel awful now, and very, very alone. I've got friends who are there if I need them but I still feel very isolated.

I can't even bring myself to cry over this so I can't express my sadness. It's not that I don't want to, it's that I am literally physically struggling to do it.

Now I don't know what to do. 

Is she right? Should I have disregarded my feelings and tried to carry on? Have I betrayed her and abandoned her?

Any help is appreciated. I could really use it right now. ",03Jan2018,1

8,"I'm not even entirely sure this belongs here. I don't know if any of you will care, or have any idea of what's going on with me. But I have to try. I have to tell someone.

First and foremost: I'm not making this up. You might not believe me, and that's okay. Just know that I am not lying.

For the past week or so, I've been experiencing memories. At least, that's the only thing that I know to call them. I'm not hearing voices, except in the context of when you remember voices in a memory. I'm not having hallucinations or seeing visions. 

I don't know how else to describe it.

About a week ago, something triggered these ""memories"". I heard or read - I can't remember which - something about a willow tree. This triggered a ""memory"" of a girl sitting beneath a willow tree, waiting. I also ""heard"" or ""remembered"" her saying something like, 'Come back to me. Meet me beneath the willow tree.'

This girl doesn't look anything like a celebrity, or anyone that I know. In fact, I don't know her. I've never seen her before. Except that a name immediately came to me - Kenzie.

This is strange to me because I don't know anyone with that name at all. It's not a common name, at least where I'm from. I've never seen it on a billboard or a vehicle or anything.

Over the course of the week I've been having more and more ""memories"". They are always in first-person. I never see myself, or hear myself speak.

This afternoon, I had a montage of memories of sorts. Kenzie and I were driving, her blonde hair blowing in the wind. We had a picnic. Walked through the city (which I didn't recognize) in the middle of winter. 

I am going to be 30 years old in February. Kenzie, in these memories, appears to be in her early or mid 20's. 

I don't understand. Am I losing my mind?",03Jan2018,1
9,"Hey guys, so for some background, I'm in a great relationship with an incredible guy for about one year. He's given me no reason not to trust him, he's kind and loving and accepts my insecurities and does everything he can to reassure me, and yet I am feeling myself get more and more insecure about my looks as the relationship goes on. I think I'm becoming more paranoid because I'm becoming more afraid to lose him (edit: because I am falling more in love with him), but it's starting to really negatively impact us. I'll obsessively scroll through girls who like his pictures, or who he's following. I've even invaded his privacy to check if he spoke to his friends about other girls, and even when he agreed in one conversation that another girl was hot it enraged me. Now, I came clean about the invasion and I know it's so wrong and I shouldn't be mad, but I really can't help it. It's gotten to the point that I don't even want him watching porn because I get jealous that he might think the girls are hotter than me/think about sleeping with them. I ask him obsessively if I'm hotter than anyone he's been with, or this girl or that instagram model. It's insane. I know I have a good personality and that's what he values, and I also know rationally that I'm a pretty girl, but I keep obsessing and it's getting worse. I tried deleting social media but I end up finding other ways to compare, or making fake accounts to check his followers. I really don't know what to do. I go to a psych but nothing's really helped.

Has anyone had any similar experiences? And if so any coping mechanisms? This is really annoying for my boyfriend, I'm sure, and it's really killing me to consistently feel inadequate.

Thanks a lot :)",03Jan2018,1
10,"I’ve been under high stress since freshman year of high school (I’m a freshman in college now) due to the emergence of mental health issues with family members as well as my own. Before I even knew that depression and other mental health issues ran in my family, I thought everything was fine. 

Of course it wasn’t fine because I self harmed back then, had suicidal thoughts, had body dysmorphia plus a whole lot of other problems back then. It just wasn’t until I had names for these issues that I started to fail at school. And it wasn’t until I started to fail at school to realize just how unhappy I really was.

That leads to where I am now. Feeling like there’s no way to help myself long term even though people keep telling me about these magical coping skills. I’m sure what they are are methods to calm yourself down when you have no other way to but I can’t get that calmness from myself. Deep breathing doesn’t work for me, I have no patience for meditation and so forth. 

I no longer contemplate suicide often or harm myself, which are pluses. But my lack of alternative coping skills do lead me back to that point every once in a while. The only positive thing I do now is talk to other people, whether they be friends or strangers. The issue there is sometimes there’s no way to talk to other people. I also medicate with marijuana. The issue there is the altered mind state leads me to still be unproductive and care too little.

I have yet to find coping skills that can come from myself and myself only, not from outside forces such as peers or medication. 

Any ideas reddit?",03Jan2018,1

14,"A new year usually means a fresh start, which is always a good thing. But remember, you don’t need to have a sudden drastic change for the better! Small steps are all you need. Improvement takes time.

Don’t have the “near year new me” mentality, as if you should completely change yourself for who you are. Add some things into your routine that may benefit you, but large change is hard for anyone. Don’t beat yourself up about it if you don’t “fix yourself” this year. It may take decades to get to the state you want, but remember: it’s always worth it at the end.

You don’t have to make 2018 the best year of your life—instead, try your hardest, seek professional help when needed, talk to a friend, etc. If you do things that make you happy and feel better, good things will come to you. I promise. 

Some suggestions I have for people of any mental condition or feeling to make this year just a little bit better: 
- Write in a journal! Its good to vent, especially daily. Letting things out is great
- Drink a lot of water and eat healthy. Eating lots of fruits and veggies is what we’re supposed to do. Remember: your mind is part of your body. Treating your body well is also treating your mind well.
- Read! Learn languages! Draw! Invest your time into innocent tasks that let you safely escape from the world around you.

17,"On the surface it all feels fine. Except when people walk out and leave. Feels like a blur though. No one reacts, to it. It's a common thing here but I can't remember why. Had a mental breakdown but I don't know what pissed me off. I don't know how I concluded I was being used, I forgot after walking around in a daze through the store and them letting me do things in the back to calm down.  I felt drained but everyone was smiling, I felt detached and disconnected. Went home and my mind is coming up blank.  I don't know what caused me to break. Happens everytime after being high on happiness only to become more aggressive and in a few months I fall into depression again and cycle repeats itself. I can't remember much but something just feels wrong and Im frustrated cause I can't remember anything.:( I always forget what sets me off. It's just a blur. It always feels like I'm in another body.

18,"(preface) hi guys. i’m very new to reddit, i joined because a coworker at my job-starbucks-constantly shows me memes about our job and i have a crush on him so of course i joined, for cool points and it’s genuinely interesting to me. i usually just stick to the starbucks subreddit, but as someone who suffers from anxiety and bipolar depression i have found that this subreddit is very motivating and insightful. now, i will talk about my problem.

i’m only a junior in high school. but i’ve gone through a lot of sh*t in my life so far. ((sexual assault, loss of both parents (mom from leukemia when i was 5 and dad from suicide when i was 11) an eating disorder, and of course mental health issues as i stated earlier)) so i’ve had to learn coping mechanisms and ways to just be alive and function as a healthy person. i’ve actually been really good and i’m thankful for all of my experiences because they’ve taught me a lot and i’ve grown so much from everything. anyways. as it is hard to think about my past and sometimes my present day to day life situations, i’ve always coped by thinking about my future. truly living, happy and content with my life and my career and everyone surrounded by me. it’s comforting, especially now that i’m so close to being out of high school and “really experiencing freedom”. but now that my future is so close, i’m realizing that i have a lot of trouble seeing myself having that future. not that i think i’ll be dead or anything, just that i won’t be the person with that future, some version of myself that isn’t really who i am now will. but i also feel very disconnected from my past, its complicated. it’s very strange and it’s been bothering me a lot for the past several months and i know it’s not just some depressive or manic episode, it’s something deeper and hard to explain. i’ve looked into it and most of these feelings or “symptoms” i’ve been experiencing (like not trusting myself to make decisions, fear of intimacy or deep relationships, changes in how i perceive myself or just not knowing at all, etc) are related to identity crises. i haven’t talked to my psychiatrist about it yet, but i wanted to know if anyone else here has felt this way before. i’m sure it’s a common problem, i’m just looking for answers to a question i don’t understand i guess. 

i don’t want this to come off as a cry for pity. i know it’s all very sad and what i’ve had to go through is hard, but i do not need pity, and i didn’t post this looking for it. i have trust issues and don’t typically tell people about all of this, but  i’ve always felt more comfortable talking to strangers online rather than in person. thanks for reading this, and i hope you all have had a wonderful day/night wherever you are.

19,"Hi, this is one of the first times I am posting ever on Reddit in general so if I break any established rules when it comes to creating a post, I apologize.
I am 22 years old, still living at home.  We have never had a lot of money so any thought of leaving seemed improbable.  The health of one of my parents is terrible, but not enough to where he needs daily medical care (can still drive and get themselves to the bathroom).  That parent is in so much pain, that I would have to drive the other parent around to and from work or to finish errands since that parent does not have a license.
I aid one of my siblings in watching their child so they may have the opportunity to spend time with them.  I am working 30+hours per week and attending school online.  I don't feel like my own person.  I am, and always have been, the person the entire family seeks for help whether it be driving, watching children, paying a bill, etc.  
I have a hard time walking away because I would hate to see my parents suffer, my sibling potentially not seeing their child, and just for the family to suffer as a whole.  But I hate myself for being available to help others who have never shown genuine appreciation or made an effort to know me.
I have tried to open up about my problems, but it has been met with a few seconds of interaction, anger towards me, and one parent falling asleep twice on separate occasions.  I am not sure if I am just sensitive or genuinely upset at what feels to be a lifetime of exploited help.  I just do not know what to do. Somebody please help.",03Jan2018,2

21,"hello,, first off, id like to say i apologize if this is messy. i am simply at a loss and i desperately need advice but i will try my best to keep this clear and concise 

note before i begin: we are not currently irls. i moved last year so i cannot physically do anything to help her. (i live in the United States)

my best friend is 16 years old and suicidal, but she has a way of avoiding any conversation about it when me and our other friend address our concerns. she’ll post multiple statuses about how much she wants to die or how she wishes everything ended when she made an attempt a couple years back, or she will start messaging us in our group chat about it. i don’t mind her venting one bit, but my biggest worry is about how she doesn’t seem to want help or want to get better. whenever me or my friend try to talk to her about it, she’ll ignore it completely and move on with the convo saying something completely irrelevant to the topic at hand, or she’ll just brush it off and say “I’ll be okay, I always am” but then never elaborates on her feelings. She also always tries to reassure us, saying that she won’t do it. But it’s getting harder and harder to believe. 
This evening, she started talking about how much she missed people in her life who we both knew were extremely toxic to her. Whenever she reaches out to these people although me and our other friend advise her not to, she always seems to open up to them more than us. She does this a lot...I’m having trouble understanding why she opens up to people who have no problem turning around and hurting her again compared to her best friends who are practically desperate to just hear how she’s doing that day. (The more I think about it, I start to wonder if maybe she thinks of herself or her problems as a burden to tell us. Does she open up more to those toxic people because she knows they don’t care and won’t worry about her?) 
Earlier today, she hung out with some friends that she hasn’t seen in months. But the only thing she had to say about it to us when she came back was something along the lines of “I should have jumped off of that bridge that we were close by earlier today”. At this point, I suggested that she consider getting professional help (I have done this before multiple times in the past.) We started talking about what might be bothering her, or what mental illness she could be struggling with. When we settled on a few options, the only thing she focused on was the medication. She talked about how she would use it to OD and kill herself... that was her first thought... she literally planned it out in front of us. 

TLDR; my best friend has been increasingly suicidal as the days go on but doesn’t seem to want help or at least acknowledge how worried her friends are for her well being.

please help or give any advise you can whether it be from personal experience or just your opinion on the situation. i don’t want to lose my best friend.. just imagining life without her is breaking me down so badly.

I’ve finally reached the end of my rope and have acknowledged that I do indeed have a problem, and decided to reach out for help. My issue however, is I have no idea how. I’m not sure of the best process of seeking a therapist, or how to know I’ve connected with the right one.

Then I come across a photograph of my friends having fun without me. Or someone else's depressing rants about there problems. It triggers me to think of stuff. Nothing bad at first but my negative mindset eventually takes me down rabbit holes. Such as thinking I'll be alone for ever if I see a photo of a happy couple. It sounds like I'm jumping straight into the negative but I'm not its a slow process but I often seem to get to those kinds of thoughts. It doesn't happen if I see this kind of stuff in the street.

27,"Not sure how to put this down but here goes. I've always been socially awkward and had difficulty making friends. Until I met a girl whose company I enjoyed more than being alone and could talk to for hours, I felt normal and happy. A year later I moved home with her still at uni and something changed. Looking back I think partly it was due to me developing anxiety and mild depression over living with my parents again and failing at getting a job. But her growing doubts and the poor communication made me panic, and over analyse everything. I tried to force conversations and fill awkward silences on skype instead of being myself which just made things worse. Then when the one person I could actually hold a conversation with for more than 2 minutes told me we weren't right for eachother and that she'd felt that way for a while, something in me just broke. It was like I forgot how conversations and friendships work, it doesn't come naturally anymore. I can't tell if I smothered all my friends and pushed them away or if its all in my head. Sometimes I worry I've changed and I've lost myself and the uncertainty is just killing me.


A month and a half later now and all the feelings of panic and uncertainty have only gotten worse. Everyday I wake up anguished. I cry and have bouts of depression and these attacks where I just cry and hyperventilate and work myself up into a state just despairing worrying if I'm normal anymore. I barely talk to my long distance friends anymore because I just don't know how and honestly it's just easier. I can't tell if the same thing that happened with my ex is now happening with my close friends. My confidence is at zero and I just can't face applying for jobs but sitting at home most days being confined to my room feeling like a child again is driving me crazy. I applied for counselling almost two months ago but there's still a queue on the waiting list and I'm getting worse daily. I try my best to stay active and stop the thoughts from creeping in but it's a losing battle and I live in a constant state of unease. I feel like I'm losing myself while the days float by as I lose friends and all the graduate job opportunities.


This turned into more of a vent but really I want to get my head straight and know I'm not going crazy. I want to learn what to do and how to cope because I really don't know and I feel so helpless. Sorry if this doesn't make much sense but thanks for reading and hope you have a good day.

30,"I’m a 16 year old girl from the uk :)
I’m not sure if what I’m describing is psychosis or a nervous breakdown because no one has been able to explain to me . But, if anyone seems to have an idea of what it is I’m describing,please comment below. I have tried asking my family about this , but they never answer me or they don’t know how to explain. This has been on my mind so much because it’s really impacted my life.

About a year ago my brother had a nervous breakdown. It was so sudden and unexpected, we had no idea what caused it as nothing drastic ever happened. He got taken to a mental health ward and put on medication. There was a place up where he was staying where family could stay , so me and my mother stayed with him for a few days as he was getting used to the place. My brother was very mentally ill, he was hallucinating and shouting at the nurses because he thought they were demons. Whilst we were there , I noticed my mother started to seem different and always stressed and worrying which is understandable, as the circumstances were obviously stressful. I had never seen her like this ,she was definitely not herself. Before we left to go back home , me and my mum had to say goodbye to my brother until we saw him again in a few days. This is when my mother started to go downhill , in the room before we went to say goodbye to my brother , she was panicking, crying, shouting at me saying we couldn’t leave ( I was 15 , and suddenly felt like I was the one taking care of my mother). I was terrified seeing her like this, I kept reminding her that he’s in the right place , and he’ll get better , but she was absolutely distraught. I  didn’t want my brother to see her crying or panicking when we said goodbye because that would’ve concerned him and make him upset seeing her upset, so I calmed her down thankfully . My grandparents took us home in the car , my mother was crying the whole time. Whilst we were on the motorway ,(I’m not sure if this was a breakdown/ panic attack / anxiety attack / psychosis) she became a completely different person. She was trying to get out of the car whilst we were on the motor way going at a fast speed . She was saying “ I’m going to die” repeatedly. She kept telling me that she loves me and to tell my brothers that she loves them . She was saying how much she loves my dad. Then started talking to god , and about Jesus. I was so confused and concerned in the car. We pulled the car over to try and calm her down. My aunty said over the phone to take her to the mental hospital that’s in my city and she’d meet us there. We got there and my grandparents took her in to the hospital. That was the last time I saw her until 5 months later. I lived with my aunty for the next few months , and the whole time I was confused out of my mind. I kept asking to ring my mother or visit her but the doctors wouldn’t let me, because it wouldn’t help her recovery.  My brother came home with my grandparents and lived with them whilst still recovering and on the medication. I tried living back home again , but my brother would wake me up in the night and disturb my revision as I had exams. So I stayed with my aunt still. This wasn’t an easy time at all, I developed an eating disorder and became very anxious . I lost 20 kg in 3 months , but I didn’t even notice. Looking back it was a way to deal with what was going on in my life. I went to therapy because my grandma became concerned about how I looked so skinny all of a sudden , and therapy helped me so much , just being able to talk to someone. However, no one was able to explain the situation to me , or why my mother and brother were ill and what they were going through .

It’s a year later now , both my brother and mother are home , on medication and recovering. My brother is almost back to normal . However , my mother has blips where she has good and bad days. A lot of the time she gets angry for no reason , and does abnormal things like taking books off the shelves and putting them on the stairs. A few weeks ago, she left the house at 5 am and went wondering . This was extremely scary because she was not in the right state of mind and could’ve gone anywhere or gotten into danger but luckily she walked over to my great aunts house. Since then we’ve had to keep all the doors locked , and hide the keys from her. I’ve kept asking my grandparents what’s going on with her and why’s this happened,but they tell me they don’t know but soon the doctors will have a diagnosis. I’m obviously very concerned and just want a clear answer. I keep worrying that this may happen to me when I’m older as it’s happened to two of my relatives , and it’s also concerning me that my mother may be like this forever. 
Please,if this rings a bell to anyone ,or if anyone has had a relative or knows someone who’s gone through something like this , comment below. Thank you ",03Jan2018,2
31,"As the title says. I noticed that I no longer quite understand how to relax and have fun. It seems I took the ""relax"" out, and it has been out for a very long time.

I think I'd really benefit from seeing or understanding how others, who are at least remotely mentally healthy, have fun, relax, and enjoy themselves ""properly"" and not efficiently.

Lately, I've been playing Terraria, and every time I notice I'm thinking of something as pointless, which usually makes me want to avoid the activity or ""get over with it quickly"" in the unhealthy way, I try to embrace the activity as a sort of play. For example, I get no benefits from killing a Goblin Army, yet I still relax and let myself go through (not just do it). Another example would be giving away gold in OSRS via games, drop parties. Maybe even making follow trains. Just running around and looking at things in any game anyhow should work. I guess the most important part for me is to look for pointlessness, so I could cut myself away from the insane, efficiency-greedy side of self.",03Jan2018,1
32,"My girlfriend is currently shutting everyone out, this includes me, her family and even her best friends. She wants to be completely alone.

She promises that she'll come back to me and she loves me. But she's not able to talk to me either, she tried yesterday when explaining all of this.... After barely 20min she broke down crying and couldn't talk. I'm only allowed to say a short ""Good morning"" and ""Good night"" every day (Which i guess still is more than anyone else can say.)

I guess this seems like your typical ""I love you, but i need space"" but it isn't. I think she had some sort of nervous breakdown (She's had them in the past, last time was 1 year ago around the same time).

She has been like this for over a week now, and all i can do is to trust her. I don't know when she'll be back, but she promised she would be. She did not want to break up (Which i thought this was leading to at first). 

I had to convince myself not to take this personally, which is really hard. But i decided to trust her, cause for the first time in my life i gave someone my heart fully, i hope she won't crush it. ",03Jan2018,5
33,I am a seen as a quite type. I never wanted to be but it's just the way I come across. Because of my social anxiety issues I feel the pressure and it really gets to my head. Makes me feel stupid because I don't have the ability to think of what to say. But things seem to be changing I am doing therapy and I think I'm finally adjusting to the social world around me. I have met loads of new people over the Christmas break. I am seeing it as a game. How quickly can I get to the least amount of anxiety possible. So far I have made progress in stopping the overthinking. I am trying to change my body language. And my shortest conversations are a little bit longer than they used to be. ,03Jan2018,1
34,"Ok, once again as an intro I am smart. Ok, so here goes the tale, I have lately been in a burden of depression, I mean just some time ago people used to come to me for all sorts of doubts where intelligence was required, I used to clear them and even if someone said something stupid I wouldn't make a fuss about it. But lately I don't know how I have suddenly been the one who blurts stupid thing, and have been critisiced to a point where I can't think,I fear the future. But you know, the best part ,the stupidity is not because of any other reason,but because people themselves have pushed me to it. It was like one time I said a stupid thing, I was so much criticized that, I in order to nullify it,would hit in the dark, and ended up saying more stupid things. Help me,help me to get rid of this guilt of dumbness,this phase of low confidence.It's affecting me academically very much.",03Jan2018,2

36,"I have suffered with loneliness for a long time. 6 months ago,I fell in love with a man who I thought loved me too. He moved in, but left in the middle of the night with all of his things. Yesterday night in my sleep, he sent me a text message breaking up with me. 

I’ve never been good at this sort of thing. I’ve been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for my suicidal tendencies, but it’s always because I feel alone. 

I had one good friend but she stopped talking to me when I went away to a hospital. She said that she felt like I abandoned her. So now I’m truly and utterly alone. I have no friends. I now have no boyfriend. He won’t even answer my texts. I have no one. I know when I get like this, my life goes downhill. I turn to drugs and alcohol and always end up in the back of an ambulance. 

I don’t have money for a therapist. I barely make anything at a job I hate. I just didn’t show up for work today because the idea of getting out of bed isn’t one I can entertain. I just need some kind words or advice. Anything. ",03Jan2018,9

I am leery of online therapy because of privacy concerns (I have roommates now) and rapport/human connection. I'm looking for help with grief and ptsd. 

$660 a month is just waaaay more than I can afford but I desperately need help. I'm grieving and not sleeping or eating and having nightmares and live in a deep well of sorrow. ",03Jan2018,1

40,"So I'm 15 weeks pregnant. I decided to call my old therapists office last week and make an appointment to be seen. I had a great report with my old therapist but she left the office. They were able to schedule me five days out with a new one. I was grateful because i know a lot of offices take a long time for you to get in to be seen. I've been struggling with some issues recently. I'm a recovering addict and throughout this year i've developed an eating disorder. I've lost about fifty pounds this year. Now normally this would be a  good thing because I've struggled with my weight for years but now that I'm growing a baby i've gotta eat and I'm unable to. I've also noticed that I'm exhibiting depression symptoms. While back in the day it was usually me crying and feeling blue, lately I've just been kind of there, no interest in anything, no energy and just feeling nothing so i figured because i cant and dont want to take medication, talk therapy would be my best route. 

Now, I'm like my mother in that i show up ridiculously early for things in fear of being late. So my appointment was at 3:30 pm and i showed up at like 2:45, but i had a book with me so i figured i'd just sit there. I check in with the receptionist and I wait. Now, I've never met this woman but i was told on the phone her name was Beverly. She comes into the waiting area, pulls a woman into her office and i overhear someone say, ""That's Beverly,"" so now I know what she looks like. I'm used to these offices running behind but finally 4pm comes and I'm getting a little frustrated. Most people would have said something by now but i go talk to one of the receptionists and she says that shes running a little behind today and she's still in with a client. I can continue to wait about five or ten minutes or reschedule. I tell her I'll wait as long as i'm guaranteed the same amount of time with this woman, like she isnt going to cut my time short because she's running late. she tells me that absolutly won't happen. Now the waiting room is kind of full, I see a gentleman check in and five minutes later Beverly comes into the waiting area, says hello to him and brings him back!

So its 4:15 now and i'm about to blow a fuse. I walk up to two receptionists and tell them what just happened. They get on the phone to get her attention, they try walking down the hall to knock on her door and figure out what is going on. They were incredibly apologetic and had no idea what this woman was doing. So i'm fighting back tears at this point and I ask if i can just make an appointment later this week with someone else because its apparent without even meeting me that this woman has no interest in having me as a client. The accomodate me and are able to schedule me 2 days later with another woman and luckily i have that day off of work. I basically had to run out of there because i'm in tears. I actually havent cried in over a year, but i am balling my eyes out and blow my nose and blood comes gushing out. I was so beside myself frustrated and upset i gave myself a nose bleed. 

I called the office once i had calmed down because I couldnt bring myself to walk back in there and asked to speak to the office supervisor. i rarely complain. I've worked fast food, retail, i was a pharmacy tech for 8 years and I'm currently a waitress, i understand shit happens that you cant control but i couldnt let this go. Essentially I just wanted to let this person know that behavior like this is unacceptable especially in the field of mental health. For people struggling with depression or anxiety the physical act of picking up the phone and making an appointment is a huge leap and for me to make this appointment and actually show up was a huge step in itself. But if a person struggling with these feelings shows up and then the therapist cant even bother to look at her schedule and bring you in to be seen, to take other people ahead of you, to compleltly ignore you...do you understand how that makes someone with a mental illness feel? i went into that office feeling as if my feelings and my life means little or nothing to anyone and I left feeling as if those feelings were validated. I in no way was upset with the reception staff, they felt terrible and tried to help me in any way they could, they had no control over the therapists actions but this woman made me feel so small and insignificant. Like i said i walked into that office feeling as if i had no emotions, i left and i certainly had emotions. My pregnancy hormones had me crying the entire night because not only did i need someone to talk to that night, i was left with everything i needed to say and then some.

I meet with a different woman tomorrow and hopefully she's a good fit for me but i just needed to let that out. mental health providers cannot treat their clients this way. It's different in any other field but when you have a patient walking in feeling a certain way and you treat them as if they mean nothing, seriously you are just adding fuel to the fire....

46,"Im a male in his mid 20s.

So to get straight to the point, I have struggled a lot since puberty with, well, everything in life in general. Socially / emotionally kind of fucked, dont really want to explain the details here. 
Anyway, I have almost no (close) friends, have not ever had a relationship, that kind of good stuff.
The only good thing I guess rn is that I nearly have a bachelors degree. The downside is that it took me a really long time to get it, AND it is not the bachelor I started out in. I started out in a Engineering degree, almost but not quite Electrical Engineering (lets say 85% EE), and I got bogged down after about 1-1.5 years. The first year I did not do all that badly (though the important major subjects I failed, but I still got an average amount of credits). The second year I did worse but still not bad enough to convincingly say I should quit. The third year I failed extremely hard and basically gave up. After that I switched to a different major which you could say is Engineering ""lite"". I also switched because in the last semester I took 4 classes, of which 3 were extremely tough, got extremely stressed overwhelmed, and thus failed them all. 
I am happy that at least I almost got a degree now. But I can't really say Im passionate about what I do now. So I do not really want to do a masters degree in this field.
Could not really say that about the first major I did either. But I still find it hard to decide if that was because I am fucked as a person, or because I did not put in enough effort, or because I truly dislike the material/subject. Now I dont know what to do. Starting all over again is not an option. I can finish the first degree but I doubt I want to do the masters degree that fits with that degree. Very stressed about all this shit.

Background on my interests: been a computer nerd since very young age. Loved it. Love hardware and software. Knew very early on how to build a computer and all that stuff. At the same time learned about how to install an OS, repartition, all that stuff and really liked it. I just developed from there. Dabbled in overclocking and other stuff involving ""tweaking"". Love all of that too. Never really did any programming though. Only started doing that in college. I kind of like it but dont love it. 
I am passionate about certain music. Puberty / adolescence were awful for me. Had terrible self esteeem issues (still to a certain degree) and it fucked my life up. Shitty consequences like Social Anxiety and probably some depression too. When I most needed I did not get the help I needed. Also, those who could have helped me did not or did not understand it.
So, I got into music like Nine Inch Nails, and it has become an integral part of myself. Trent Reznor is the first person to truly make me feel less alone and genuinely seems to be someone I have important things in common with. I love that feeling. Later I found the works of MJK. I like a lot of that too. Celldweller is another good one. I like to really dig deep into the music and especially also the artists behind the music, and what makes them tick. On the other hand, I find it hard to relate on a deep level with most other human beings in my life. These people make me feel somewhat more sane, without them I would feel even more alone.
There is probably more I could write about this but I think it gets the point across.

I also like a bit of photography (tend to go through phases with that) and I like some films / series a lot. 

I like cars a lot too. I am lucky enough to own a decent one. 

Finally I like doing some sports and just general exercise. I quite like running too especially when you get runners high (sometimes I get all these big vision of ambition success which then fade quickly after).


Can anyone relate? Or maybe a more important question, did anyone make it through all this text? ",03Jan2018,2
47,"I've always suffered from depression and anxiety and have been being treated since I was 9. (27/F) About 3 years ago I felt I finally had the right diagnosis; borderline personality disorder. I was on medication that was working along with counseling. I have been on adderall IR for close to 10 years. My primary care prescribed it to me, increasing the dose up to 20mg IR twice a day. That dose has stayed the same for a couple years, trying out XR and always returning to 20mg IR twice a day.
 Everything was great med wise for me and I felt I was living a normal life until about March 2017. My mother lost her 20+ year battle with cancer (she was my everything) and everything just got worse. I could not cope. Family issues began instantly, I eventually stopped going to work, stopped cleaning and doing my laundry, eventually I started never getting out of bed and this is how it's been for 8 months. I still take an antidepressant, mood stabilizer, but haven't been to counseling in a year (been trying as much as I can to get in, they never answer phones or call back). To get to the point, I am at a rock bottom I didn't know was real, and I'm sick of just laying in bed letting life keep kicking me. 
  When I take my adderall, I am able to get out of bed and do things normal people do (laundry, clean, ect.) and I feel hope again. The problem? 40mg is not doing it anymore and really hasn't been for over 2 years (PC won't go over 40mg/day). I did what everyone says never do. I started taking 1 more pill (60mg/day) and here I am almost a year later and I take 120-160mg/day throughout the day (3 in AM, 3 early afternoon, and depending on the day/my mood 1 or 2 more). It sounds horrible. It is horrible. But the thing is, I'm not increasing my meds to get high or party, I'm increasing them because it's the only thing that will get me out of bed and start crawling up the wall from my rock bottom. I clearly run out of my script in a little more than a week, then the rest of the month is spent in bed like before. I want so bad to tell my doctor exactly what I am doing but I'm terrified of losing the only thing that helps. I don't want to be on adderall forever, my perfect thought of the situation is taking the dose that helps me, improve with that and therapy, and taper down more and more until I get out of this horrible hopelessness....

So now I've actually seen a psychiatrist, who said he recognized elements of some sort of obsessive compulsive tendencies in me, paired with some sort of anxiety disorder. He put me on some anti anxiety meds until out next meeting, and he also referred me to a psychologist (which I've also just met) to begin CB therapy.

Now, how do you internet while in therapy? Especially when it comes it mental health. I'm always afraid of self-diagnosis, and convincing myself I suffer from every symptom from every disease known to man, and I know how easy it is to fall into that trap. Heck, the reason I know how easy it is to fall into that trap is because I looked up obsessive compulsive tendencies and read somewhere that getting it into your head that you suffer from x y or z is a common occurrence in people who suffer from OCD.

Yet historically, the internet's also been a great resource for me, a source for learning new things about the world and myself, for meeting new people with experiences similar to my own.

54,"Well, the previous weeks haven't been the best for me

I have a planned trip to a huge event my family had to spend a lot of money in, even in the troubled financial situation they are right now. And since 2-3 weeks ago I've been having trouble sleeping because of the flight

I was never afraid of flights before, and I know all the facts and statistics tell me that I shouldn't. But since my last air trip where the plane almost crashed because of terible weather and a notoriously hard airport to depart from, I've been terrified. All I think before bed and during the day is how the flight might go wrong.

Since then, I've been in a spiral. The fear of the turbulence evolved into a fear of the flight falling, of me being ejected from the aircraft and now I'm fearing for my life on the trip in general. In new years eve I had a panick attack in a new years resolution excersise my family made because the only thing I could think about was that I wanted to survive (i believe it was an attack, not as strong as some people describe it but I was shaking and couldn't take that thought out of my head. I had to go upstairs and have my girlfriend calm me down before midnight so the owners of the house would not be upset)

My year has been far from healthy, as stress has taken me up strong in a super-demanding high school program that I love but is eating me up. My vacations (my country uses the feb-nov school year, so now I have my ""long"" vacations) have been eaten up by schoolwork due to february, and today was literaly the only day I could zone off completely for months.

Even though I read up online (not the best source, I know, but its hard to get therapy in this time of the year, but I'll start it as soon as possible) that this so called ""sense of impending doom"" can be caused by stress-related anxiety, I can't shrug off the feeling that this is a sign and that I will die in the trip. I even considered calling off the trip, even after all the work I put into making it happen, but I just can't do that to my family after all we have been through

I've been into terapy before, and I know there are no quick fixes, but what should I do to cope with this fear? 

I've always considered myself rational and chill, but now I'm starting to see this attitude was actualy me bottling up my feelings, fears and frustrations inside.

What can I do to at least improve the situation and be able to travel?

Thank you in advance, and sorry if I rambled. If there is anywhere else in Reddit/internet I could go to with this, it would be highly apreciated. My girlfriend knows about that, and she tried to help me, but there is nothing she can do except tell me what my rational side already knows but that doesn't change a thing. ",03Jan2018,1
55,"I'm not for sure. I've never had therapy, haven't had a doctor visit in over 10 years (pretty healthy for the most part)...

I took some online screenings, including the M3 screening and came back with a score of 63 and possible diagnoses of Depression, Anxiety and Bipolar Disorder.

A few things that I viewed as ""quirks"" and annoyances may be symptoms:

-An almost OCD-type obsession with making sure things are off or locked (ie, checking the front door lock, making sure the stove or electric kettle is turned off, staring at a light switch to make sure its off, even though I can clearly see that the light is off)

-""Creativity Swings"": writing and photography are two passions of mine, and I can experience extreme swings either way. Some times words fly off the page and I can't stop writing, other times I feel incredibly stupid and can barely put pen to paper.

-Mood swings. They're not violent, but I can swing from extreme personal positivity to moments where I get down on my knees and feel no desire to proceed with the day at hand.

-Energy swings: From barely being able to keep it together on one job to going to school full-time while holding four jobs, I can go across the spectrum.

As mentioned before, I've been managing this for 14+ years, and have never resorted to violence, alcohol or drugs for ""treatment"".

I'm not here to write a sympathy post; it's more about curiosity than anything else. I don't have the money, healthcare coverage (in the US) or luxury to go see someone, but I would like some opinions on what (if at all) this may be.

My doctor is recommending ECT for me. Said that the cognitive problems are overblown.

The thing is I am unable to manage myself at all and I am nonfunctional. 

Therapy does not work on me. Im incredibly resistant and it doesnt really do anything for my symptoms. Im also extremely impatient where if I apply a therapy technique and it doesnt do anything immediately then I start to get really agitated and wonder how long itll take for therapy to kick in.

I look at the clock constantly and ruminate over all my symptoms because there isnt much I can do. With anhedonia I cannot enjoy things and I am emotionally numb. The blank mind makes it impossible to socialize. The symptoms are causing more depression. 

I have never had anhedonia in my life and me having the anhedonia makes me less than what I used to be. And I have it in me that I wont live as a lesser version of myself. And changing that thought pattern does not help my symptoms therefore I wont change it. ",03Jan2018,1

61,"During the course of 2016 I steadily had to cut out more and more food/drinks. I allowed myself a treat every now and then, but not often, and not without going through a strict regiment of cleaning my teeth afterwards. Towards the end of the year, I decided that the wisest thing to do would be to eat one meal every other year. 

2017 was different. I became more relaxed and I started eating two meals per day, followed by a cleaning regiment that probably didn’t take much more than 15 minutes (as opposed to 40 minutes). Still, I stopped eating and drinking more and more stuff. Some of the stuff I had to cut out were: fruits and every kind of spice there is. It’s safe to say... there are a lot of things I enjoy that I will not even touch. 

As the year progressed, I eventually went back to one meal per day. Towards the end of the year, I went back to every other day. The meals also became smaller. I went from your average meal to just a few sandwiches.

Now, in 2018, I am currently planning on going two days without eating. I will eat again on Friday, and I have no idea what I’ll eat. Perhaps it’ll be a few sandwiches, or perhaps a salad. Whatever it is... it can’t damage my teeth. Oh, and this year I also decided to stop taking cough mixture as I’m unsure of whether or not it can cause my teeth to become discolored. I will, however, take cough mixture if my doctor tells me too. But even then, I will only take a sip on the days I’m eating food. By the way, I seem to always have a cough.

Why are things the way they are? Well, I’m too afraid of damaging my teeth. Not only by whatever I consume, but also by my strict cleaning regiment which includes: flossing thoroughly, several times between all my teeth, brushing for 20-30 minutes, and rinsing with mouthwash that contains fluoride for a minute. All of this can damage my teeth, so I figured the best thing to do is to do this as little as possible. I know if I eat anything I will have to go through that whole ordeal. That’s why the best thing to do is to eat as little as possible. Like the title suggests... I haven’t had a day where I’ve eaten properly since 2016. 

This is day one without eating. Tomorrow is day two. I’ll eat on Friday again. Am I starving? Oddly enough, I am. I tend to not get all that hungry. Going a day without food is usually not a problem at all. All of a sudden, it’s vaguely a problem when I decide that I need to step it up and go two days without eating! Argh, I’ll be fine. It’s not causing me too much problem. If anything, I’m more worried about tomorrow. ",03Jan2018,1
