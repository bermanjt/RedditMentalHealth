nothing prompts it and i could just be feeding my fish and break out into tears but it’s really scary when it happens cause i’m not used to it and not sure how to explain when someone asks if i’m okay. usually resulting in me just saying “im fine” and then they prod until they start asking questions like “is it cause you’re lonely” and i just say yes because i don’t know why i’m sad and i don’t want them to feel like i’m mad at them by not telling them

if it helps i just had my birthday at the end of january, am female and 14 years old (also if this isn’t the right subreddit for this please let me know!! thanks for any help) ",11Apr2018,3,

6,"Sorry in advance, this ended up just turning into a really long, vent-y post.

I'm seeing a psychiatrist at my university next week for depression and anxiety, and that 4-6 week wait went by a lot quicker than I was expecting. It's been really hard to convince myself not to just cancel the appointment. I know I need this, but I just can't help thinking maybe there's really nothing wrong with me and I'll just be wasting her time or she'll think I'm stupid and laugh at me (which is basically what happened when I saw a doctor about my depression/anxiety at the student health place last month). 

I've been to a psychiatrist before (following a suicide attempt, didn't really have a choice), but I didn't really like her still after a year and was too nervous to try to see a different psychiatrist. So I just stopped seeing her and I had enough combinations of medication dosages that I was able to taper myself off of my antidepressants before I ran out.

It's been difficult with almost no one taking my concerns about my mental health seriously just because I've always done well in school, have had a ""perfect"" home life, and have always appeared to be ""ok."" But I didn't really have a choice to be anything other than ""ok"" because my mom has always been very concerned with appearances, and I'd hate to disappoint my parents. Boy were they surprised when I tried to kill myself a couple years ago (even though I had expressed my concerns to them about my depression multiple times before, guess it wasn't just ""teenage hormones"" after all). This is what's prevented me from seeking out help so many times when I've needed it before though, since no one else took me seriously I just felt guilty for feeling how I feel, and that guilt made me feel worse, and it turns into this vicious cycle and suddenly I just feel like the worst person in the world for feeling this way when there are so many people who actually have the right to feel this way (I know that's not really true though).

7,"Hello. I'm fucking terrorized of driving (used to have horrible panic attacks behind the wheel. Am now medicated, have not had the truly bad panic attacks, the kind that feel like I am dying, in years, thought maybe it was time). I have PTSD (both from a shitty abusive childhood and from a car wreck) and I am also bipolar. I am trying to learn to drive again. Please help! Story below, any advice welcome!

I didn't get a drivers license until I was 21. I never attended drivers ed, because I was homeschooled by abusive assholes who wanted me to stay infantile and subservient (not that my father said that, but I know the real reason now, and yes, I have issues other than driving, and yes I am in therapy). I moved out when I was 18 and my boyfriend at the time drove me to work every day. It was my boyfriend who helped me get first my GED, helped me get into college, helped me find a place to live and a place to work other than the family business, and then taught me to drive and I got a driver's license. It was my boyfriend who helped me to become more of an adult and a functioning person, not my crap-ass parents.

I was scared to drive, and it took me a long time, but I did it. I was ecstatic! FREEDOM! I didn't have to take the bus to school or work anymore! Less than a month after I got the license, I totaled my brand-new car I had just saved up for. The wreck was entirely my fault. That happens a lot to first-time drivers. If I had hit another car, it would have been just a fender bender, and I would have probably learned from it and moved on, despite my naturally anxious nature. I didn't. I hit a motorcycle. I was told by the cops that if he had been on a crotch rocket, instead of a harley, he would be dead. He would have gone under my wheels, instead of over the bumper and onto my hood. And he wasn't wearing a helmet, either (that part is not my fault, but again, the wreck was my fault, completely). I will never forget the sight of him lying in the intersection in a pool of blood. He lived. I broke both his legs, but he lived. I was emotionally wrecked. I dropped out of school. I quit my job. I couldn't get out of bed. I got super, super depressed. I HAD ALMOST KILLED A HUMAN BEING.

It took me 2 years before I drove again, and it was only because I had a job that I couldn't take the bus to and my boyfriend got his own job. By that point I had been diagnosed as having bipolar disorder, PTSD, and a mess of other mental problems, and was on a bunch of meds. In the last 8 years (I am 30 now) I have driven off and on, only when I am on an “upswing”, and dealing well. My license is still valid. But I hate to drive, it terrify me, and I hate being a passenger when some people I know drive. And they think its funny, sometimes to try to drive dangerously almost to the point to reducing me to tears (I stopped hanging out with assholes like that).

Now its been 3 years since I've driven again. I'm 30 years old. The boyfriend who helped me so much and I are no longer together. I'm on disability (thank God), so I don't have to worry about work for now. I'm TRYING to be an adult, I'm TRYING to improve all my weak areas, including where I am socially stunted and my driving. My physical health is also going to be a priory this year.

But the point of this post. I just paid $425 to take a driving class, and I'm fucking scared as fuck. The class had 3 days in the classroom and I did ok. I usually do okay in classroom settings, but fail to translate schoolwork and high marks into practical skills – it was the same way when I took an EMT course – I was really interested in science and anatomy, and tested well, but failed to translate that into physical skills needed in the medical field, and also my anxiety made me realize on my first clinical shift that I can't/shouldn't be on an ambulance and I dropped out. (so much for making it up the universe that I hit that guy and doing some good for a change) Anyway in the driving class I was the only 30 year old in a room full of 15 year olds and that was embarrassing, but that's my life – now there's 30 hours of online class work and 6 hours of driving in an actual car. I don't think I have anyone who will take me out to practice starting and stopping before I go to the driving the school's car, which is what they recommend, but oh well. Just doing a few of the online knowledge tests for the driving class today just filled my stomach with terror. I don't know if I can do this.

Human beings were not designed to plumet along a highway at 60 miles per hour in metal death tubes! I know exactly the physics involved and what those sudden stops DO to a person! I wish I were stupider in this regard because ignorance really is bliss.

But if I give up, its accepting that I will never become a fully functioning adult by our ridiculous society's standards. It means I can probably never safely have children. How would pick them up from school or take them to the hospital if there was an emergency? I already have 2 dogs that I am responsible for, and there's no ambulance for the dog hospital, so I'm lucky that I have a roommate who loves them, but my living situation is not permanent and I'm keenly aware of that and if I don't know how to drive in the next year or two, if he decides to move, I'm not sure what I will do.",11Apr2018,0,
8,"I have depression and the main outcome i want is some sort of coping mechanisms 

Some background info-
I'm an 18yr old boy who is pretty ignorant to mental health, I have sort of self diagnosed myself with depressionand and anxiety as I have looked up all of my symptoms and they fit the description perfectly.

I procrastinate because I lack motivation, just the thought of getting up makes me feel ill.

I have resorted in getting pretty fucking drunk every saturday (at home)  just so my mind can relax.
 I'm shit scared of the future because I have no interests in anything. 
I have social anxiety so unless there is a need to talk to someone I will avoid it, I only really feel comfortable talking to people if they're customers at work (retail) when they ask for help or if I'm drunk at a party. 

I have seeked therapy but my college is crap for it, long waiting lists and shit. And my anxiety overcomes me when i try booking it any other way.
I want to die but im scared of the outcome, not just for me, but my family and friends. I did write a suicide note but my dad found it and it was the only time I saw him cry, they think i'm over deppression now. (My family are great, allways supportive, just not all that helpful it these situations)

One of my biggest fears is, if I tell anyone, that they think im being attention seeking.

9,"So, to get it out of the way my dx are BPD and schizoaffective, history of traumas, and OCD symptoms/tendencies. Basically a lot of this problem will stem from the bpd/trauma but as we all know they all feed and bleed into eachother when things are comorbid.

My counselor is leaving. Im aging out of my case management service as well. My counseling services changed their policy so I will be cut off and go back on a waiting list. My psychiatrist will probably discharge me from my program soon (this ones very uncertain, mostly a worry). I am crumbling. 

I am still not doing well in my college program (not in terms of academia but rather attendance and doing the work). Found out I'll have to utilize another program anyway to actually get where I want to go. I'm not even really trying at this point. 

I have all these initiatives for the organizations im a client of. I have taken on a lot. Im even in the process of getting a job (which at this point I dont care to get but I feel obligated). 

Part of me wants to just give up on treatment as a whole despite it helping me thus far. It feels right to me because ive gotten so far I was bound to fall through the cracks again at some point.

15,"I have episodes of depression that last around two weeks or so, around 7 or 8 times a year. I tried antidepressants before, it didn’t work btw.

However having an abundance of happiness and energy is obviously not a problem but a blessing, and it brings me closer to God and enables me to reach new insights.

Before I lied and said I was less depressed or less happy than I was so people wouldn’t think of me as odd. Now I am embracing it as part of my personality.

I've noticed a big change in my personality in the last few months and my wife pointed it out on the weekend too. 

When in get home she always asks how my day was. I'd love to just answer ""fine"" and move on but to be polite i tell some stories or something. Where as before i would always have a laugh about something that was said or happened. It makes me feel fake. 

I'm always tired and feel like i can never get enough sleep. 

I'm going out tonight to a craft beer event and i didn't invite anyone along because i couldn't be fucked with small talk. Well i did actually invite a friend but i didn't hear back and I'm not going to push the issue. 

I'm not even excited by this, even as a home brewer. I worry I'm going to sit there all night, listen but not talk to anyone and avoid making and new friends, because that means making a connection and having to spend time getting to know them. 

This is very different to the person i was 18 months ago. I've never been overly social, but now I'm just being rude.

There is this pattern where things will be fine then anything will set her off. I mean anything. I go to bed things are fine, wake up and she is mad. Once she is upset there is no apology that makes it right. I will have to sit there and listen to her break down my every action, intentional or percieved. And its not over then either. 

Any little percieved action is broken down to how im abusive, or negligent or disrespectful etc. I mean anything. If i dont do exactly what she says and how then i will suffer endless hours of guilt, shaming, buzzword diagnoses. 

She sees everything as a combined series of events that sets her up as the constant victim. And me (or her other family members) as being abusive. 

Beyond this. Over 10 years she has never apologized for anything. She rationalizes her behavior even if she is in the wrong. I have never been right. She hits me and its my fault for being abusive. 

What is this? What am i dealing with?

What is it called where someone will distort the truth and spin events to them being the victim? And furthermore never (and i mean almost 10 years) ever admitting fault.

I can't just break ties bc we have a child, im stuck with her and its torturing me. Its effecting my work. I cant leave, i dont want to stay and i never know peace or rest. Im terrified to go home because i just know im in for it again even if i apologize.

23,"I know this is unlikely, but are there any communities for adults trying to cope with or move on from emotional neglect and parentification, but whose parents weren't abusive beyond that, or actively malicious?

The closest I've found is r/raisedbynarcissists and r/survivorsofabuse, but those communities are geared towards children of actual narcissists and survivors of malicious parents/families.

Now that I know what parentification is, my mother is almost a stereotype of it and looking back, I can see that my childhood is almost a laundry list for ""emotional incest"" (a term which I recognize the validity of, but hate for its connotations). That said, she struggled with mental illness herself (depression for sure, possibly BPD), and was an abuse and neglect survivor herself. She is not malicious, but was effectively an overgrown tasked with raising a child, which is why I am looking for alternatives to a community for supporting children of malicious parents.

28,"If there's a more appropriate board for this, point me to it.

Alright, so to give some context to this;

I've noticed a recent urge to hurt or even grievously injure cute animals. It's always been there to some extent but has recently gotten very strong. Strong to the point where I've actually acted on those urges, or attempted to more than once. When I owned the cute animals in the past, I had no problem. I loved them and never wanted to hurt them and, on the one occasion where one did hurt itself, I cried for a good thirty minutes or so, despite there being no actual harm done.

The first of these incidents involved a friend's dog. I've always found the little thing to be adorable, however it never much took to me. That's fine, given that there had been an urge to crush it, so I was happy not inviting any opportunity; I know doing such would be wrong. That changed though, when it began barking at me and biting me without provocation.

Anyways, this continued and circumstances conspired that I was left alone with it. I cornered it and punched it a few times. Didn't leave any injuries though, and I felt three things; primarily, satisfaction at having indulged my urges. Then disappointment at myself for having actually done so, swiftly followed by disappointment at myself for having stopped short of causing more serious harm.

Now, I guess you could dismiss that as some kind of anger response or primal instinct given the fact that it had attacked me on numerous occasions. It's the more recent thing that has me concerned.

I tried to poison another person's pet. It wasn't spur of the moment either, I sat there for near enough an hour deciding on what might be a good way to do it. Eventually I settled on feeding the carnivorous rodent meat, laced with a number of highly toxic and corrosive cleaning products. I tried giving it some clean meat first to see if it would accept it, which it didn't - and that was the only reason I stopped. I'd have carried on with my plan if it accepted the food.

This, in my opinion, goes beyond typical primal instinct, as our desire to squish cute things has been pegged with. There would be none of that primal indulgence and the only satisfaction I'd have received was knowing that this thing had died. I'd have been physically removed from the actual killing, meaning it simply can't have been that urge we get to crush.

I had slowly been getting somewhat better before all this happened but it's just skyrocketed downwards the past few days.

For instance, a few days ago, I stumbled across a band that I have previously loved \(but I gave up on them because OCD told me that I no longer liked their music\) and it clicked with me again. I went back to their music and listened to it obsessively, and now I am starting to get the thoughts again. What if I listen to music just to pass time but I don't truly enjoy it? What if the music sucks but I just tolerate it because of the nostalgia?

OCD is killing me. I wish I could do something to stop it, but the more I fight it, the worse it gets. Please give me some advice. I can't cope.",11Apr2018,1,

44,"6 months ago my parents and i temporarily moved into another house that is right next to a very busy road. I hear traffic all the time. I literally just cried because it’s so upsetting never being able to have silence. even with earplugs in, i can hear the cars. and lots of jerks rev their engines or whatever as they pass by. we move back into our old house in just over a month from now, but i’ve had to deal with this for so long and there’s still a month to go.

i NEED SILENCE

i hate my parents. we MOVED OUT OF OUR HOUSE FOR SEVEN MONTHS JUST SO MY PARENTS CAN RENOVATE THEIR HOUSE AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT WOULD BE WORTH MOVING OUT FOR SEVEN MONTHS AND LIVING NEXT TO BASICALLY A HIGHWAY. i could go on and on. i hate my life so much it’s 6am i can’t sleep

freaking 7 months. there was nothing freaking wrong with the house. they replaced every single piece of hardwood floor in the house and the house is only 15 years old. they basically are trying to rebuild their whole house. JUST BECAUSE THEYRE BORED AND HAVE NO FREAKING LIVES

you don’t need to respond to my rant but i just want to know if anyone else needs silence like i do",11Apr2018,2,
45,"Hey everyone. So, I guess this post is just a rant... Not really important. Just that, I've been feeling the passage of time lately more than usual. I don't look my age (I'm short and baby faced, and I've been mistaken for 14 when I was 22. ) and I certainly don't act my age.

 I graduated college when I was 23. Which is later than most people. I've never had full time employement (internships and part time jobs). I've never traveled on my own. I live with my family. I don't have many friends, and the ones I do keep in touch with it's via instagram. The last boyfriend I had, I was 15. (I'm a woman, btw). 

It just terrifies me how much I don't know about the world, people, being an adult, responsibilities, and life. I have so much growing up to do. I rely on people way too much. I get attached. I run away from problems. I run away from responsibilities. I never intentionally step out of my comfortzone. 

And it's all too scary that I'm like this, but I also have dreams and big things I want to do/accomplish. 

That's it... just weird feelings about growing older. This hit me when I found out one of my friends from uni gave birth. People my age have kids! When did that happen? ",11Apr2018,1,
46,"Hey,

I'm putting this here as I need to express my thoughts about what has happened.

Bit of a back story, I've been with my boyfriend for just over 6 years. I live in the UK, he lives in the US. 

He's been diagnosed with BPD and Bipolar 1, and he's had a lot of stuff happen over the past month or so and it has sent him to a very dark place. I'm trying my best to be there for him and show how much I love him, but sometimes it seems like it falls on deaf ears.

Anyway, last night, it came to a head, and he ended up trying to overdose. I knew from his facebook posts, and when I asked him if he had done anything, he just replied that he's sorry. I knew then he had done something.

I kept trying to message him, but I ended up phoning his sister, who went and got him and took him to hospital. He's been admitted, treated, and is being assessed today. I just feel useless that I couldn't be there for him when he needed me. 

I'm going over to see him next Thursday and I don't know what to say to him. ",11Apr2018,1,

48,"so i think im suffering from depression, as well as pi-polar disorder, due to the fact that i have been super stresses ever since meeting my partner and having kids at 28 with no career. i get frustrated and angry very easily, do go out with friends at all (dont really have any) and have turned to nights of drinking beer and liquor to see if it makes me feel better. me and my partner have fought about current living conditions, and how i need to leave the city and start my life over, but she wont and i feel trapped and like i have no control over the relationship at all. this has made me more stressed and depressed and at points, made me want to talk to other females because i do not feel like im really her partner when we have said arguments or discussions. i also just got demoted at work, so that makes things even worse, and just viewing this world every day has made me scared, depressed, and angry. i dont know what to do. i just want to be happy and not wake up living life on auto pilot anymore. i think this is an issue i have been having as well before my current partner, mabye all the way back to a child. i dont really know. i just want me and my kids and my partner if she wouldnt be a such a bitch and move out with me. but i guess thats what life is like, never getting what you want, and not being happy.

I've had 2 lots of counseling, and recently started taking medication. But the anxiety is still there in some way or another,  whether it's the gut wrenching feeling in the stomach or the constant overthinking and negative thoughts.

58,"Hello, this is a long one please bear with me. 

Me - I am 40, I have had 5 abusive (all the types of abuse) relationships, that stems from a difficult childhood. These relationships started at 15 .Thankfully I broke the cycle 5 years ago with therapy and self insight

My daughter 17 - I have put her through these relationships and understandably they have taken a terrible toll, she has been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and possibly a PD. She is going to Cahms (UK under 18 mental health services) for weekly therapy - this has been ongoing for 7 years. she is also on medication.

My Partner - I met him 3 years ago, he is a wonderful supportive man, to me and my daughter. 

I have terrible guilt, it is so difficult to see my daughter struggle in this way, she has had 4 suicide attempts, and regularly self harms. Despite all this, we are, and always have been very close, I have made some terrible choices in life, but the love I have for her....she says there is nothing to 'forgive' me for. I am not so sure. 

At the moment my daughter is struggling with going to college, it has been this way for around 6 months, we know a fair amount about what we can do to help her feel more able to cope, and try so hard to do this every day. Some days though, my daughter just can't get out of bed. she has been close to being sectioned. 

I also have MS, and IIH. I don't know really what I am asking for, it has helped to write it down. Do you think, if we carry on, and just keep trying, things will slowly get better for her? 

Thank you ",11Apr2018,4,

I uncovered (or really just came to terms with the fact) that I was sexually molested at about 7. But as weird as it sounds, unraveling that trauma has helped me make some big break-throughs.

I need a job but have no motivation. I have no money because of this. I'm sleeping more and more and eating less. It's like I can feel myself slipping but it almost feels good to not fight against it.

So for the people who don't take medication for their bipolar, what do you do when this happens? Does this happen to you too? Am I just weird or is it normal to be totally exhausted from fighting depression and feeling like you want to let it take over?

•Ocassional nail-biting to the point of my index and middle finger-nails being bitten down to stumps. 
•Over-plucking of eyebrows and general  excessive grooming of ones-self when under intense stress. 
•Patterns of controlling behaviour in romantic relationships, I.e: Excessive messaging when relationship is not in a good place, over-thinking and irrational perception of circumstances. 
•Intense mysophonia around certain people, making certain noises. 
•Striving for perfection in certain aspects, in my case: Perfect grammar, or make-up.

She's been lying with manipulative tactics to get people to watch her kids to do...? She always lies about where she is going. If you ask her if she is ok she pretends nothing is wrong.

Since a big problem with her struggle (and something I struggle with myself) is consistently open and honest communication, I was thinking of implementing weekly coffee dates or something. I want something special for us (and another close friend, who's already on board) to share regularly to make sure we're all doing well and, if not, to talk about it.

I am so frustrated right now and need to talk to people who understand.

I finally, after years and years of dealing with debilitating depression issues (I'm in my 30s and have dealed with depression since my teens), I have decided to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist. 

The insurance I currently have states that I do not need a referral to see a mental health specialist. So I call and schedule an appointment, he tells me I need a referral from primary doctor.

I call my primary and talk to his medical assistant who says he can't write me a referral for something he hasn't seen me about. I tell her, well I talked about my depression at my last appointment in February (That was fun, I literally broke down in tears because it was the second appointment I had with him trying to get back on my meds. He looked at me and told me I wasn't depressed because I don't ""look depressed"".)

She says she will ask him but I can't decide to see a therapist on my own, the doctor has to tell me I need to see one.

My old doctor, who unfortunately doesn't take my insurance now, urged me on MULTIPLE occasions to talk to someone. He even told me I should check myself into a facility for 72 hours to be monitored. 

This doctor obviously has little experience with mental health. He literally had to Google my depression meds (I had to tell him what to prescribe) so he could figure out what dosage I should take.

If I don't get a referral...I just know I will give up and put off seeing a therapist for God knows how long. I am just tired of riding the bipolar express. I have a daughter who only has one parent and I need to be healthy for her. And for myself.

ETA: Any advice is also appreciated. Maybe I am going about this the wrong way ? (trying to see a mental health professional)

However, OCD is actually interfering with my therapy - I obsess about doing it the right way, worry that actually I should be doing self-help, and things like that. Every day, since January 9, I have been agonizing over whether or not to stay in. My therapist is aware of this, and we've tried to do exposures related to it.

However, I really can't buckle down and do those exposures because the intensity of the anxiety caused by the obsession with therapy is so high. I could stay in a couple months longer, but I don't think anything will get done as I just can't get any traction.

85,"It seems like depression is felt so differently depending on who you are. Anxiety seems to be a fairly similar feeling for most people but I've noticed that, when I talk to other friends who are depressed, they have different ways of interpreting their state of mind. 

Here's how I would describe it from my point of view: 

I remember watching a CNN video one time where Anderson Cooper listened to an audio recording meant to mimic schizophrenia. He had to listen to it while performing other duties: simple things like creating a paper boat, remembering a list of words, remembering what day it is, etc. The voices, whether quiet or loud, were often extremely cruel and insulting to him. They would say things like ""YOU SUCK AND THEY ALL KNOW IT!"" or ""God, you can't do anything right!"" or ""you are garbage! give up!"". There were points where Anderson would say things to the camera like ""God, I just want to talk back to them and tell them to shut up!"" or ""I can't do this. I have to stop"" (while he was making the paper boat). 

For me, depression is like that without the auditory hallucinations or psychosis. It very much feels like a separate entity in my head that will stop at nothing until I kill myself. It's like I'm being haunted by a ghost or a demon that's trying to make me kill myself to atone for some kind of wrongdoing. 

Its worst in the morning but I'll wake up thinking ""wow, I'm just so ugly and terrible and no one will ever love me. I should just kill myself. Then all of this will go away. No one will every really love me and it will never get better. Everyone is going to just leave me anyways."" 

Sometimes I even have that similar feeling of just wanting to tell my brain ""shut the fuck up! Leave me alone!"". I also find myself doing something and thinking ""God damn it, I can't do this. I just can't concentrate.""

88,"Throw away account.  Anywhere, US

I recently took a job that has me at the front desk of a business owned by friends.  The job is done by two of us at alternating times. Lots of interactions with public. 

The pay rate is quite low (the boss and I acknowledged that before hiring) but I took the job because I thought I could help the friend through a transition.  I haven't been at a job outside of my home for a while and it sounded like fun.  I'm an experienced front desk peep, but also a lot more.  I've owned businesses, been a COO of one and have helped others in a variety of ways with back-end systems to organization and leading.  

I specialize in helping people figure out how to improve their systems or find and use the best ones for their needs.  The boss that hired me actually hired me previously to do just that for them.  The funny thing about me is that this systems / organization brain is really just a coping strategy for my own ADD and PTSD.  I've just found ways to work around those limitations and it ended up being how I made money for a couple decades.

In the last few years though, I've come to better understand who I truly am and my true gifting and passion are in the Arts, in serving others and in making the world a better place. I've been researching an idea for a nonprofit I want to launch but put that on hold a bit when this need came up for a friend.

_______________

Back to present...

Asked to do job and then soon after asked to research a new way to do the primary aspects of the job hired to do.  Was also told to make sure I know how we are using the current system and to make sure new system would do what we needed after transition...so some of what we currently do but also needing to transition with us to a new way of doing business.

-Asked questions.
-Got familiar with current system.
-Found issues with underutilization of current system
-Found challenges with current training procedures
-Since I've been with so many businesses, I wasn't surprised to see areas with huge strengths and areas with big weaknesses...all business have them and all owners are not highly skilled at all the areas it takes to run a biz.
-I spent a couple months researching potential ways to go and had a spreadsheet with over 10 options segmented into those that won't work, those that I had concerns about and then those top three that I would recommend.

Prior to the holiday weekend, things seemed to be going well, in fact the owner gifted me with an item as a thank you.
After the holiday weekend, all hell broke loose.

Suddenly, I was receiving text messages that said others (not those who hold my position at work but those who hold a completely different position) were going to research programs.  There had apparently been some questions raised to the boss and so she decided to have someone else do investigating.

I was incredibly confused and felt like I was blindsided by something.  
I reached out to a friend and family member of the boss (who works at business) to see if I could get clarity on what happened and was essentially told that nothing was wrong with what was happening and I had no right to be upset.

I did not handle the next couple of days well.
I was quick to defend myself.
I sought to understand the situation by reaching out to people I previously had gone to for perspective on abnormal situations at work...later to find out everything I shared in my frustration was shared with the Boss.
I thought my job/share partner had contributed towards the confusion since she too felt underpayed and had told me she was looking for work elsewhere.
I felt like my expertise was not just being undermined, but that I was dealing with a level of unprofessionalism that was shocking and startling.

Once at work I was pretty much ignored by the boss and manager.  I did my best to assess what had happened, but really didn't understand.  I was asked to put together the recommendations for the program I liked as well as what I had found on the one the other team was to now look at (which I had already ruled out as not compatable with our needs).  I emailed it to the manager who later said she didn't get it.

After the manager left and while there were still a few employees remaining.  The boss came up to the front desk and began a very hostile conversation accusing me of things related to the research and my recommendation.  
I was shocked.
I defended myself.
I got a bit dazed and my breathing was far from normal.
By the end of it we had a quite heated discussion at the front desk with employees and clients on the premises.
She ended up leaving when I tried to move the conversation to a more private area and was told I was lucky she was leaving because she was about to get truly angry.

I made it through that day, but was a bit shell-shocked and stunned.  I think I stared out the front windows in shock a good deal and yet made it through the rest of the day.

Oh yeah...forgot to mention.  The week prior the boss had given the official ""Let's go with them"" regarding my recommendation. 

By the next day, I was still in a state of shock.
I arrived at my normal time and yet tried to stay mostly to myself.
I was doing normal things associated just with my regular front desk job.

At some point I was called into a conversation where it became apparent I was likely to lose my job.
I was told that the boss had never experienced anything like that, that I was not a good fit for the culture of the company, that I was wrong for speaking up, etc.

Thankfully, I was able to stay calm this time and tried to listen carefully.
I was able to try and explain a bit, but really tried to honor her position.
I did end up apologizing for how I had responded the previous day but also tried to explain that I felt I was dealing with a hostile exchange and was caught by surprise.
We seemed to be able to hear each other.
She admitted to giving the go-ahead to the program but then accused me of doing ""too good of a job"" on the research and performing at a ""much higher than expected or wanted"" level.
She then accused me of sending too many text messages (She leaves most days about an hour after I arrive and isn't responsive to emails. Since I needed clarity on how things worked, I thought text was appropriate...but apparently not.)
She also said employees were complaining about me. (yet I have had multiple former and current employees from this biz comment on me being the best ****** they have ever had.)
She said employees were complaining that I was spending too much time on the computer...which I thought she had asked me to do as it was part of the research and info gathering.

Ok...I know this is the TBI thread and you may already have quit and given up since I haven't mentioned it yet.

I got a concussion in June.  I didn't believe it at first and did everything wrong.
Once I realized I truly did have one I tried to recover, but then also tried to help a friend and ended up causing a major setback by working on the computer, not sleeping and attempting too much too soon.

My concussion ended up costing me terribly.  I couldn't drive for a few months.  I ended up needing a concussion team to help me with the symptoms. I had speech, occupational and physical therapy and progress was slow.  I wasn't on a computer for months and the limited screen time I did have was with a black and white filter on my iphone and for this artist / photographer...it just about killed me.

Eventually, I worked with a chiropractor and we saw some amazing progress once we addressed the neck injury as well.

Just before I took this job, I had seen so much progress that I was driving again, able to do journalling on the computer and occasional photo-editing.

So...I took the job with the intention of having fun, helping out and seeing how my recovery was going.
I totally forgot about my concussion though as the stress started to kick in.

I found myself at the computer a lot.
I was moving and doing a lot more physical activity than I had been.
The desk situation is not ideal for anyone with back and neck issues so I tried to make accommodations for myself but was told aesthetics were more important.

I thought I was doing a good job and was even finding some ways the owner could save some money and had prepared to share those with her.

Then the hell breaking loose.

So...because of my past one of my tendencies is to take on too much blame.
By 24 hours after the yelling match, I started considering if my concussion had played a bigger part than I realized.

I researched concussion symptoms and TBI's again and reread some of the symptoms.  I had to highlight about half on the list.  

Oh crap...
I had been missing a bunch of things and suddenly felt like an idiot.

Frankly, it was easier for me at first to think that all the ""hell-breaking"" was caused by my concussion / TBI than to admit that the situation may be toxic and hostile.

I spent most of the weekend processing it all and went from ""damn, how did I miss all the signs and how did I not know I'm still totally f**ked up"" to ""that place is not healthy and I need to get out yesterday.""

I sent the list of symptoms to my dr and she confirmed that it could be the TBI or prolonged stress.
I ended up sharing the details with my spouse and a friend and was convinced I would respectfully resign first thing on my first day back.

Then, the day before I go back to work, I get a text message from Boss.  She had talked to the system I had recommended for hours and felt really good about them.  Has lots to process but we will talk tomorrow.

What?!

Plus...she had just chastised me for texting her and had sent me one.  I honestly didn't know if I was supposed to reply or not and how do you reply when all you can think is ""WTF?""  I eventually sent a very simple one.

Yesterday, was my first day back.
Boss wasn't there.
Manager didn't talk to me at all.
My job share partner is distant.

The panic I felt at the end of last week began to rise again and all my self-doubt and confusion returned.  
I did my job but had my son bring me something to help with the anxiety level.

By the end of the day, I felt sick to my stomach and completely undone.

Today, I'm in such a state that I've ended up with a stomach bug or the anxiety is so bad that I've made myself ill.
I'm working on getting into my concussion team and addressing that piece, but this feels like more than just that.

______________________
So sorry about the length of this.  
I'm just truly a confused ball of anxiety and doubt.

Was I dealing with symptoms that affected my ability to remain professional in a normal situation or is this not a norma situation?
Should I run for the hills and who gives a rip about the relationships it may hurt?
Do I try to show the boss the reality of what happened?
Do I confront those who I thought were safe to talk to about their betrayel?
Do I quit?
Do I stay?
Is this my brain not working or a toxic situation that I wouldn't find elsewhere?

I don't remember the little shortcut people put next to the short version.  :-)

**tl:dr  Crazy situation at work has me wondering if my TBI is the cause, a contributing factor or if I'm just more comfortable blaming myself than acknowledging how toxic work can be?**

89,"She was talking about stuff that has never happened and claims that she has met famous people and speaks of completely irrational situations. This is also bad because she made up this entire scandal about my father and this random woman; and it just starts random fights all the time. I’m here because I want to know how I should react to this, should I play along or something?",11Apr2018,1,
90,"When my sister and I were children, we were in the car when a black man tried to carjack us. His car had been hit and slid into the median. My dad pulled over to check on him. The guy  was strung out on drugs and tried to unlock the door and snatch my dad out of the car. My mom was screaming and my dad punched the guy in the face.

It took 6 police officers to take him down. My then 5 year old sister ended up developing PTSD. She would have night terrors and have intense panic attacks when she was around black people, especially black men. She's 20 now and years of therapy have helped. But she is still very afraid of black men. How common is this? I know women can be triggered by men after they've been victimized but how often is the PTSD triggered by the perpetrator's race?

I fucking hate being sober, it's going to be the death of me. 

I haven't self harmed or had a drink in a while because I have a surgery coming up and I don't want to do ANYTHING that could possibly ruin my chances at getting this surgery. 

I just can't do it. 

I fucked up my wrist and I couldn't care less. I just want to keep punching Shit.

93,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but I'm going to post it anyway. 

I have a big problem with chance/bad luck whatever you want to call it. Whenever something bad happens to me (where I have no control over) I take it personally, VERY personally. Even if it's something stupid like dying in a game or other minor inconveniences. 

If I can't logically explain exactly why something happened, or if it's something I had no control over or couldn't see coming in any way, I get incredibly angry (even if it's about someting relatively unimportant). When this happens I feel like the world is conspiring against me, or I think that God must hate me or something. It just feels so unfair. I have tried to rationalize these thoughts by thinking ""It's just bad luck"" or ""Shit happens"" but that just won't cut it for me. I feel like I'm missing a crucial piece of information, the missing piece of a puzzle that would explain everything.

I know this probably has to do with the troubles of my childhood where bad things would constantly happen to me for no apparent (or at the time, understandable) reason, but even though I understand that and the fact that my reaction to these issues is probably unreasonable, I can't rationalize these thoughts.

Do any of you have the same issues? How do you deal with random and seemingly inescapable bad luck?

94,"So I have depression myself and Basically one of my friends tried to commit suicide a year before I met her and after we became good friends and she told me about it, it affected me much more than I thought, most of the time when suicide, hospitals, padded rooms and stuff like that are mentioned I start to feel sick in the stomach cause I imagine my friend when she tried to commit suicide. It's gotten to a point where I feel guilty for not helping her even though I didn't even know her when she tried to commit suicide. She is really nice and for some reason I blame myself for not helping her. It's also gotten to a point where I dreamt that I went back in time and was trying to stop her from suicide. So yeah...
