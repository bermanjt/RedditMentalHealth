0,"I know how to solve this: consult an expert, right? But im a broke 17 year old who just moved to a foreign country and came from a very conservative and old-fashioned family.

My first question is (and please pardon my ignorance): What is the basic difference of ADHD and ADD?

Second, I've feel like these are the odd things about me:

1. I have short attention span. Lately, I can't finish a video I saw on facebook without scrolling past it. Also films and movies and books I was eager to watch/read, I tend to pick my phone up. I also tend to zone out when my sister tells me about her day, and I zone back in, then out.

2. I feel a bit agitated and uneasy whenever we're standing during church mass. It was worse when I was a kid where I nearly fainted bc my vision went dark for a sec and literally broke into cold sweat. (lmao for a moment back then i thought God was punishing me bc i dread going to church)

3. Im always biting my fingernails and them bleeding is a normal sight (my shortest nail is .4cm long and the longest is 1cm) My toenails to are short. I dont bite them ofc, but I always cute them very very short.

4. This is disgusting but I bite on my arm hard whenever I'm angry or feel any excessive emotion. I bite on a pillow when I was kid and the habit kinda stuck on me so now i do it on my arm bc i cant always find a pillow haha.


That's all. Theyre not much and maybe im overthinking this but i cant talk to my friends or family about this so i just thought to share it here on reddit and ask for an advice",11Aug2018,0

3,"Hey everyone, I think I just need to vent a little...

I've been having problems for years now. It started out, when I moved out of my parents house. I've always been a little lazy when it came to cleaning my room, but when I moved into my first own place, it got really bad. I couldn't receive any visitors, without doing a lot of cleaning first. I also wasn't a great cook and usualy ordered food, which made me gain a lot of weight pretty quickly. I also didn't really watch how much money I spent. I had a good job (luckily still have it), so money shouldn't have been a problem, but I just spent so much for stuff I didn't really need. It's not that I'm really bad at handling my finances, it's more like I just didn't do it...

Of course this led to multiple other problems and eventually I didn't have any money to pay my bills. Because it became increasingly frustrating, I eventually just stopped opening my mail, which in turn led to even more problems, including more bills that I coudn't pay... you get the point...the more time went by, the worse it got, to the point where I wasn't able get myself out of this on my own.
All of this caused a lot of problems in my personal- and worklife. I distanced myself from most of my friends and at one point, didn't even really take care of myself anymore. This led to more and more problems at work. I regularely overslept, didn't really shower regularely, wore dirty clothes, etc.. it wasn't pretty and to be honest, every other company would have fired me pretty quickly. I consider myself lucky, that that didn't happen.

With the help of my parents, I got my flat in order, payed most of my bills (well, my parents did and I paid them back over time) and started getting my life back on track. all that worked out for a while. I moved to a smaller flat (because I still had to pay back a lot of money) and started to live a normal life again. Unfortunately, that didn't last very long. Because I hadn't regularely opened my mail before, I was now quite anxious everytime I did it. I was afraid, there would be more bills coming, that I couldn't pay again. Of course, I knew that ignoring my mail couldn't really be the answer and would make things a lot worse, still I did that. I haven't really regularely read my mail in about 4 years, haven't opened a single letter in at least two years. Also I didn't really take care of my flat again, barely doing any houshold work. At least I got the rest more or less under control, if you saw me on the street, you wouldn't guess that I'm basically living in a self-made shithole. I'm still pretty fat, but other than that, I look normal. So at least I don't have any problems at work anymore. Actually I'm doing quite well in that regard.

I'm really scared, though, that it all will inevitably fall apart someday. I know I can't continue this, but I don't know what to do. Every now and then, I get motivated and start tidying up and cleaning my flat, but the motivation never lasts long enough to finish it. I know, that I need to do something, I'm almost thirty and my private life has been pretty much on hold for the last 10 years, because of all this shit. I want to get on with my life. I can't do this anymore and I know I should talk to a professional, but it's just one more thing, that I know I should do...

Of course, I've tried to search the internet for people that have simliar problems. I've read that a lot of these ""symptoms"" can be associated with depression. I don't know a lot about depression and I'm not trying to self-diagnose myself or something, but of course I'm wondering what is wrong with me. The thing is, that I'm usually a rather upbeat person and not depressive at all. Of course, this whole situation sucks and when I'm sitting alone at home, surrounded by trash, cobwebs and dust, I could angrily cry for hours, but when I'm not at home, not thinking of all this, I'm actually a happy person. How does that fit together? I don't know what's wrong with me and it's slowly destroying my life... I'm sorry, I have to admit, I feel a little silly for writing about this here, because I guess the only advice you can give me, is to get professional help, right? I know, it's something that I desperately need to do, if I want to get any better, but to be honest, I'm also kinda afraid. It's been really hard describing all of this, even anonymously on the internet. I don't know if I'd actually be able to talk about it to someone face to face. I'm sorry, I don't really know what I'm expecting from this post, but as I said, I really needed to vent.

Thank you for reading this and I'd also like to thank everyone here in general. I think forming a community like this and trying to help people is an awesome thing to do! Also I would like to apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes... English is not my first language! :)",11Aug2018,2

6,"Hi! Back in 2014, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and it seemed to explain a lot of the problems I'd been having. However, I'm starting to notice some things that don't exactly match up with my diagnosis. Most notably, how I deal with change. I'll provide two examples.

1. Today, I walked into my bathroom to find that my dad had repainted it without consulting with me first (which I still think is kinda shitty, to be honest). First, I got mad, and then, just really sad. And eventually I just cried. Over the color of my bathroom.
2. My grandparents got new couches over a year ago. I have sat on the floor or on uncomfortable benches every time I visit, ever since.

I know that these are stupid and insignificant things, but to me, they're everything. When something that I don't want to change, changes, I shut down. I can't think and I can't function. It's bizarre, and yet I can't stop myself from doing it. It certainly doesn't help that my family doesn't even try to understand either, opting instead to just get mad at me to make fun of me. 

It's not my GAD, so what is it? It's certainly not normal, and I need to figure out how to stop it or control it.",11Aug2018,1
7,"30 year old male.

I think too much, it does not have to be about anything specific, but my mind is in a constant spin while I'm awake.

I am afraid I am thinking myself into some sort of mental break. I cant get it out of the back of my head, and that might be why ""it"" keeps happening. I don't know what to do to stop. I tell myself it is only me thinking so much, it gives me a physical reaction, but it doesn't help. I am also afraid that it could be something real, but I do truly believe I am thinking myself to symptoms. 
I had a period a few years ago where I convinced myself I had gotten bed bugs, and felt them crawling on me in bed. But when I confirmed there where none, I still felt them at night for months.

I get this weird rush in my body, it feels almost as I am slipping out of my own body and mind. It feels a bit like the rush you get when LSD starts to take an effect.
(I have not taken LSD in over 6 months, but I smoke marijuana daily(6 years) to slow my mind)

It is mostly happening while I am thinking about how shitty my life is, and when I am bored. 

I am by no means happy, but have all the opportunities you could want. I have a good economy, loving family etc. It's just not good enough. I do not know of anything that would make it better. I could not name anything that I would believe would make me happy with life. So I guess I am depressed.
In some ways I wish I WAS dead, because it would be so easy. But I do absolutely not wish to die, and I have never thought about ending it. 

My life is in a good state, at least by social norms. 
I do not want kids, and I have been single my whole life. I would like to get a girlfriend some day, but no rush. 
My only perceivable problems, would be that I have no real pashions, and have few friends that I like to be with. I am also bored very often, and struggle to find things to occupy my mind. 
I get bored really easy, and I handle boredom like a 5 year old. Bad.

10,"A few years back, I spent some time in a psychiatric ward due to depression and self harm.
I didn't have a bad experience there, unlike most people. It felt.. good to be away from the pressure of life and have a strict routine and not really have to make any choices myself.
Lately, when things have been getting difficult in my brain/life, I want to go back to the hospital. My anxiety makes me so exhausted that it's hard to keep going most days. 
I guess my whole question is, has anyone else experienced being in a hospital, and wanting to go back? Or is it just some weird coping mechanism I've created in my head?
Edit: I would love to just be able to take a few days break every month in the hospital but 1. That's not realistic, I can't afford it 2. I need my job 3.

Just feeling really vulnerable today and need to vent.

I am adult living with ADHD &amp; OCD and I’m not going to lie it has been an uncomfortable, sometimes self-destructive, sometimes triumphant journey to get to this point in my life.

My identity is starting to feel like me. I am mostly happy with my living + romantic situation. I am seemingly on an upward trajectory at work. I am almost able to see the proverbial light at the end tunnel with regard to impulsive decisions of years past.

It takes everything I have to maintain this. 

There are times like today for example, where my symptoms are shockingly obvious. I’m worried how my hyper attentiveness is perceived, my seeming impatience, needing to be involved in every project, you may know the feels. I live in anxious fear that it’s going to end up in a loss of professional respect. It is like my mental health (or lack thereof) was too visible and puts me at risk.

The reason I say text is beacuse I'm in a different state right now constantly going back and forth to eventually be in a permante stay in that other state. We have no time to see each other as of late and might not for a long while. Face to face is of course the best way. But text I think would help with gathering thoughts together? 

I'm extremely conflicted here. He's probably the ONLY person I'd be willing to tell (he's my longest lasting friend) 
But I would rather not tell him also. Beacuse I don't want to burden him with such information. Especially since I'll be gone for so long. And I just don't like the idea of people being concerned for me. I have terrible social anxiety and I think that would make it worse.

I don't want things to change. But I know it's not good keeping this stuff to oneself. I had a terrible episode last night. I'm having stronger urges this night. IDK it all just really scares me. I have fantasies about my death as well. I think I'm starting to get suicidal. But all my ""fantasies"" have always involved help. But sometimes i want it so bad that I am tempted to just do it.

My job is extremely stressful, I deal with people suffering, dying, attacking me on a daily basis so I guess so that might have something to do with it. I deal with the things I encounter at work by just not having emotional reactions to them so I can get on with my job more efficiently, but when I get home that numbness stays.

I live in the UK so NHS mental health isn't a good option, I would need an anonymous private therapist who won't communicate with my employer, and I can't drop 40 quid an hour on an online therapist. Job mental health is also not an option.

44,"Hello! My name is Zelda. I'm a 30-year-old British German-language instructor. 

When I was 18 years old, I won a scholarship with one of America's best international colleges. A young woman also attended there. Her name is Misora. She was a 20-year-old Japanese foreign exchange student who had always dreamed of coming over to the United States after hearing stories about the Land of the Brave and the Home of the Free. From all outward appearences, she was a very charming, witty, fun and sweet young woman to be around. 

And then, 3 weeks went by. 

Somehow, word got out that I came from an affluent family with a six-figure income and I currently had $100,000 in my bank account. I tried to keep this as confidential as possible, as I knew it would attract unwanted and unwavering attention and curiosity. And not surprisingly, EVERYONE was interested. From my financial standing to my background. It soon became word of the mouth at the College. But none were so intrigued, let alone eager to actually touch my savings as Misora was. 

One day, as I was walking down one of the College's hallways, Misora asked about my savings constantly, trying desperately to shift the conversation into a deal about how she could get money from me. Growing frustrated, I then asked her politely to please stop bothering me. But she didn't stop. The stalking actually got worse. It was as if that polite request for it to stop exacerbated the behavior. Eventually, after some time, Misora requested that I give her $25,000. I then told her no. But before I could leave, she stood in my way, telling me that she would lock me in a room full of snakes and tarantulas if I didn't give her the $25,000 within a week. So I did what she asked me to do, and she left me alone. Except, this wouldn't be the last time we had this transaction. Misora was a shopping, gambling,drinking and sex addict, spending her money on her favorite extracurricular activities, going through her given savings like it was water. So she would keep requesting for more money out of me, leeching off of my financial well-being in the process. Eventually, it got so bad, that I was left with less than $1,000 in my bank account. I was at risk of getting evicted out of my apartment, I struggled to buy things to provide for even my most basic needs, I was unemployed and my parents were far away from the United States. Not to mention, when I was done with College, I'd have to pay for my time there. I would've requested for more money from them, but I preferred not to leech off of them. So I had a back-up plan--drop out of College and work full-time at a decent paying job here in America.

Before I could follow through, Misora came over to my apartment one day, I haven't the foggiest how she managed to find out where I lived. After much arguing, Misora shoved her way through the front door, two young men of a similar oriental appearence following suit, grabbing ahold of me, shoving me to the ground. I was terrified, pleading with Misora not to hurt me. Misora knelt down slowly, gave me a blank, emotionless stare and said to me ""You will feel my pain. My pain will become yours."" She then proceeded to slap, kick and punch me over and over to the point of unconsciousness.

I was then found lying on the ground and was hospitalized. Misora and her accomplices were found guilty of grievous bodily injury, assault and numerous counts of grand larceny. They were sentenced to 5 years in prison with a $90,000 fine.

After Misora was released, she was put under psychiatric evaluation. They diagnosed her with Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Disorder Type I and Major Depressive Disorder.

When I got news of her diagnoses, it then made sense. Why she told me that I would ""feel her pain"". It also explained something else; Whenever I would walk through the hallways of the College during the night on my way home, I would catch Misora alone in an empty conference room or classroom, crying. There would even be many occasions of the woman slitting her wrists, chewing her fingers, banging her head against the wall over and over repeatedly until it bled, screaming, throwing things around, pulling her hair out.......honestly, these sights were just too frightening for me to watch.....

I've hung out on some Reddits or 'short-guy' sites to understand that I'm not alone, but it still does nothing to address whatever the real issues are surrounding my emotional triggering.

I find myself emotionally triggered by other guys - usually with a swimmers build or with low body-fat percentages. Even as something as simple as watching fail videos with my son will trip me up ([this guy eats it in this fail video](https://youtu.be/sXcYfWCW77Q?t=258) but he's got what would be the perfect build for my body type.) 

When my self-esteem is low, I find myself getting set off by a trip to the beach, or gym, or shopping on Amazon. Models, other guys that look like models. Totally bums me out. Instantly, I take on this jealusty like I wish I was that person, their life is so much better than mine, people like them better, this is why people don't care about me - etc, etc, etc.

The behavior doesn't take over my life, but it motivates me to focus on fashion (grew up pretty poor and dysfunctional, I'm a total clotheshorse for nice underwear, go figure), working out, nutrition - but ultimately I can't maintain focus on it for long enough and so I've been traveling along with this ebb and flow. I know I need to focus on progressive, repeatable health goals but I can't get past the self-esteem roadblocks that say ""You've worked out enough, you're neglecting other important things.""

This isn't, shouldn't be a big deal - I know that. My psych says I should work on self-compassion and I am doing that. 
I realize that none of these thoughts are rational, but after dealing with them for 20+ years I'm really trying to unpack them with therapy (and potentially Reddit). Is there any question I can answer to help explain this better? Are there any insights you can pull out of this already?

Thanks very much in advance

52,"Hi,   
I suffer from Bipolar type2, as well as PTSD and BPD andddd anxiety. What a great combo...NOT!   


Anyway,   
I am planning to start a blog soon and I want my first article to be ""an open letter to my Dad""   


He has been my rock and has taken me to the hospital numerous times.   
So I am wondering, any parents in here. How do you cope when it comes to your son/daughter needing to be hospitalised. Whether for safety reasons or for inpatient program treatments.   


Any advice would be extremely appreciated.

53,"I'll try and keep this as short as I can. I was abandoned by my parents as a child. Given to my alcoholic, hoarding, physically  abusive grandparents.

Abusive relationship at 15 that nearly killed me.

I have always had serious issues with commitment and abandonment, wearing my heart on my sleeve.

Back in May I miscarried a very wanted baby. 2 days later my partner of 6 years, my fiance, the only person i've ever truly believed loved me and wouldn't abandon me, left me. (he didn't know I was even pregnant as I was planning a little surprise for him to find out). Now found out I might need an operation and I may never be able to have more kids (already have 2 with my ex). All this has happened in the space of 4 months. MY ex has accused me of slagging him off in front of the kids, that i'm going to screw him over for money, that I'm going to take the kids off him, that I think i can stop him from talking to his kids. The last one occurred because for 3 days straight i was having at least 2 panic attacks a day and i thought not talking to him for at least 24 hours would help. I leave my house so he can have the kids, because he doesn't have anywhere to live, he only pays £100 child support for both kids a month, despite not paying rent or bills or anything so he can save up to afford somewhere, and all his stuff is currently being stored in my garage. I have come home early, left early, changed my plans all the fit around when he wants the kids, but he still believes all that stuff. 

I am going crazy. I have so much stuff to deal with and I can't cope. I don't want to be here anymore. I feel angry and anxious all the time. I have a short temper at the moment, I've started self harming again, I think about killing myself all the time and I can't stand to be alone right now. I can't go to my family, I tried taking the kids away for my aunt's birthday for a few days and after 2 days I found out my aunt was talking behind my back and started ignoring me which led me to lash out again and I just ended up screaming and crying and wanting to die, my anxiety went crazy

I don't feel any happiness or joy right now. I don't know what to do. I am taking everyones advice on how to help but I'm getting worse.

Please someone tell me what I'm suppose to do to stop this. I tried talking to a counsellor, im on anti-depressants, I've tried exercising and eating healthy, but there's that darkness that just lingers in all the time.

54,"Is mental illness on the rise, if so why? 

I am in my twenties and have noticed that a huge majority of people my age (that I know or observe on social media), particularly females, are suffering from some mental illness.

Is reliable research about the percentage/demographics of people with depression or other mental illnesses available? Is mental illness on the rise compared to past generations? If so, have any possible causes and recourses specific to people in their twenties been identified? 

I'm also curious about others' opinion on how current research/culture/perceptions are addressing and affecting mental illness. What have you noticed or think?

55,"Okay so I started this medication about a week ago. Before this I fell into a deep depression which involved high levels of anxiety. My depression was so bad I was having horrible thoughts about myself everything was just so negative and I was just on edge and stressed about everything. My way of thinking was awful I would go into crying spells asking myself “why?! Why am I like this?!” And I just felt like my world was falling apart. Well thankfully my mother took me into the ER after I called her panicking telling her I couldn’t take it anymore.

In the past I have gone through this as well. I have been without a therapist and psychiatrist for about 3 years thinking OH I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. yeah...no.

Well I am back on medication and on 10 mg of Lexapro. I take it in the evenings. The day after I took it I was a whole different person. I was very excited, happy, jumpy, and giggled a lot. My mind was racing but just a whole lot of ideas I feel like I could do. I have always had a mind with ideas like that but this time you can physically see me feeling joy. After a few hours or shortly I begin to fall back into my depression and feel worthless. My anxiety gets bad sometimes and I get jittery. I feel a bit disoriented and confused. I feel like I don’t have control of my mood shifting. Also there will be moments where everything feels like a movie or I’m not there it scares me. Does this happen to anyone? Sorry if this is a disorganized post I feel very agitated right now. I couldn’t sleep last night so I feel like crap even though I woke up in a great mood this morning. UGH

My main symptoms: -lack of appetite -feeling anxious -say dumb things (blurt things out without thinking) -feeling energized/happy/will get a tingly sensation over body (almost like orgasmic lol) that I will jump or clap it out (laughing makes it stronger) -feeling depressed all of a sudden and have to isolate myself again -brain feeling off -lose touch with reality -headaches -more lack of sleep -weird sweating started today -_-",11Aug2018,1

to the point, I am broke. barely making ends meet. i work a full time job, but have many medical bills that i just can never seem to catch up on (yes, i am paying bare minimum amounts on each bill instead of feeling like i have to pay huge amounts at once, which helps) but often times am late to even pick up my much needed prescription medications for anxiety/depression because i just cant afford them. 

i have insurance, but cannot afford therapy. certainly not another hospital visit. but i really just wish i could go talk to a proffessional, licensed person in a clinical (hopsital) setting, maybe stay the night, and then go about my business as i cannot miss any days of work. is that even a thing? i do feel like i could benefit from getting the help, but the thought of another medical bill terrifies me and paralyzes me to the point where i just dont do anything about my mental health situation. 

i'm not looking for hand outs, so please dont think poorly of me for all this nonsense. im just wondering if it would be worth it in the long run to bite the bullet and just GO and try and see if it helps, or if i just need to suck it up and 'fake it til i make it'.

60,"I never had problems with sleeping - I could always sleep up to 10 hours without waking up. 

For a couple weeks now, I wake up in the middle of the night with some kind of irritating thoughts that I can't control. For example, last night I woke up at around 3:30 (I went to sleep at 1am)  because of some silly thoghts about taking pizza orders (I work in some kind of fast food restaurant during summer) but the problem was - orders wouldn't stop. I woke up, sit up in bed a bit, then lied down to sleep again - and my mind did the same again. I know it sounds funny, but it was much scarier then it sounds. I just couldn't calm down and go back to sleep. Thoughts were just going on and on and I couldn't stop them. 
I also had some terrible feelings in my legs - I had to move my legs all the time to get rid of that feeling. I've read about restless leg syndrome,  and I guess that might be it but all of this is scaring me. 
I feel like I'm loosing my mind. 
This doesn't happen every night, but I'm truly scared and sad. I'm tired of all these ""stress-related"" health problems.  I just want to be normal.  

Do you have any advices for me? I guess I should go to therapy, but I don't have time or money for that. I have to work and study. I've been to counseling (I'm not sure if that's the right word but I visited psychologist?)  last year  due to my ""anxiety"" and fears but I felt like I was wasting my money so I didn't go anymore.

Then he told me to exercise and do what makes me happy and I would feel better. To which I told him that was shitty advice and that he doesn't fully understand. And now he's mad at me.

66,"In Australia euthanasia is not even available to those with a terminal illness yet but I desperately want to be able to die. I do not want to commit suicide because I fear it will go wrong and I will end up even more handicapped than I am now. I also know someone will have to find me and it will be traumatic. Yes I am mentally ill but I am still of sound mind. This is not just a depressive episode and to be honest even though I have been diagnosed with depression I am not sure that I am actually depressed. I think I am just exhausted. My depression would purely be a result of battling crippling anxiety, OCD and anorexia for almost 30 years. I can’t sleep so there is literally no respite from my mind.  I have tried so many different medications, treatments and nothing has helped. For the last 15 years I have had to exercise for 8 hrs every day and I have had enough. Broken bones are not enough to stop me. I am completely isolated and have no hope left.  I absolutely do not feel that euthanasia should be readily available to anyone with a mental illness but there has got to be a line somewhere. How much does one have to suffer? Surely it should be an option when all treatment avenues have been exhausted and someone continually expresses the wish to die consistently over a very long period of time. I believe just knowing that it could be an option later down the track could actually help some people get better too. It almost acts as a safety blanket. A lot of people who illegally  import a drug to end their life never actually end up using it. It is purely a source of comfort. Yes you might argue that someone has no right to die because they will hurt people they leave behind but someone is so much pain is surely already hurting everyone and some are so isolated they are all alone anyway. No one should have to continually suffer purely for someone else anyway. I am pretty sure an assisted planned death is also a lot less traumatic for everyone involved than the usual methods of suicide. I know I am dreaming to think that it will ever be a possibility but I just don’t understand the logic. Surely there are certain cases where it can be considered. ",11Aug2018,5

75,"I was recently misdiagnosed with PTSD (from my ""terrible"" childhood, the lady who assessed me kept pushing me to respond different ways than I meant to, I know this is a misdiagnosis), I'm certain I have social anxiety on top of my depression, but I don't mind that I don't like to socialize. My SO wants me to hang out with his friends and his family, but I have absolutely no desire to. When he goes places, I stay home and listen to music. When he has company over, I pop in my headphones and color or something. It doesn't bother me at all that I don't have friends or want to socialize whatsoever. So I was wondering if that means I have something other than/more than social anxiety? I definitely have other issues such as depression so I can answer questions if needed. I just worry that I might be dealing with something a little more serious.

76,"I was recently diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression around April. I have battled with anxiety all my life, in various forms, social, general and compulsive. I have throughout my life thought this was normal and that everyone faces this. My anxiety during childhood used to be so severe that I couldn't sleep at times thinking my house might catch fire. I used to circle the house to see everything was fine. Fast forward, sophomore year of college. Everything is going fine. I have improved as a person, managed to battle some of the anxiety until things took turn for the worst. I burnt out due to extreme work load. Started having extreme anxiety attacks, became socially isolated because my closest friends had a falling out. It started to morph into depression. I could no longer concentrate in class. My memory became weak as fuck so much so that I used to lose the train of my own thoughts. Everything became a burden. I was a complete mess. Grades were in free fall. I was in an endless pit. Nothing made sense. All I wanted to do was cry. All.The.Time.
Despite the social stigma present regarding mental health, consulted a doctor who prescribed an SSRI and wholly attributed it to academic stress. He told me to take it for two weeks until after finals week. And so I did. I became numb. Felt nothing but sadness. After finals, I consulted another doctor who gave a long term SSRI on a mild dose. Things improved... until I started to feel suicidal tendencies. Wanting to kill myself all the while and without any particular reason. I never wanted to go through it but the ideation never stopped. My psych thought it was attributed to the SSRI and gave me another med, citalopram 20 mg along with some mood stabilizers.

Again slight improvement but back to suicidal thoughts for a month until a friend recommended a therapist. Here we are. Had my first session yesterday it was okay and he seems nice but in all this while I don't what is wrong with me or what triggered it. The SSRI has stemmed my anxiety but has made me blunt. I don't feel emotions anymore. I have episodes of depression. I don't have the energy to get out of bed. I deactivated all my social media accounts because all I want to be is alone. Barely feel like doing anything. Rarely go out with friends. Here I am, a total mess. I am fine on the outside but burning on the inside. I just started therapy and I wanted to effin fast track it.

86,"Hey everyone, any recommendations on how to manage a situation with my ex who has severe depression and suicidal thoughts? We spoke every day for over 6 months and he battled severe depression throughout our relationship. He would drink himself into a blacked out state, get himself in reckless situations then call me crying. We ended it 6 weeks ago (he couldn’t give me what I deserved/needed and our relationship was very much centered around his issues and me supporting him. We had agreed to be friends on account of there being no “bad blood” and our long distance relationship (we really were good friends who happened to have some additional feelings above and beyond the normal friendship but because of the distance managed to forge a really deep connection). Unfortunately and perhaps unsurprisingly navigating being “friends” has been difficult as he’s in such a bad mental state. I miss his presence in my life, I’m going through some health issues of my own and would love nothing more than to be able to discuss them with him and feel like he was truly “listening” and supporting me but I’m not sure he’s capable of that. Last night he sent me a very dark message which concerned me enough to call him (it was very late where he was) and he essentially told me he had been feeling very suicidal of late and is consciously avoiding environments where he thinks he might actually act out his thoughts. 

While I feel incredible hurt and sadness for him and of course don’t want him to follow through with his thoughts.. I’d be an absolute mess... It feels a lot like emotional abuse as he literally doesn’t ask me anything about myself and only reaches out when he’s in a dark place. He knows I care about his well-being but being on the other side of the world.. it leaves me feeling incredibly helpless and uncertain of how to set boundaries to protect myself without leaving him with no support system. His family are not in the picture and admittedly a large factor in his depression and he doesn’t have any friends where he lives. He says he’s getting professional help but claims it’s not productive.

So in summary.. I’d really appreciate some advice on how to manage this situation without triggering him to spiral further but also making sure that my own sanity and wellbeing is being managed.

The turn around starts after you fall apart. Which I did. Like hiding in the closet, sobbing on the floor, didn't know why I was crying type of falling apart. Falling apart that I drove around in my car for a solid hour at the wee hours of the night. It takes that and falling apart to know that things get better from there.

93,"Hey everyone. I was in r/legaladvice, and as expected, they think i'm crazy. Can't blame them, really. So here I am. I don't know where to start, so i'll copy paste the main of my post from over there. Sorry for the laziness.

'm a young adult, and i'm living with my dad. I always knew something wasn't right with me, but no one ever told me. As I grew older, I did realize I was a bit paranoid, and maybe a bit autistic. To describe it better, I don't understand social ""rules"", I suffer from social anxiety at a pretty high degree. I can't make small talk, even with my close relatives: my brain freezes. I've been like that for as long as I remember. The only few times I get talking, I talk too much and too loud. But it's what's happening in my brain, really. Loud thoughts, anxiety, sometimes some sorts of hallucinations. Guilt, even for stuff i have proofs I'm not. (That guilt comes from my tyrranic stepfather I believe.) The worst and most disabling part of this is that, even when I see people are mocking me or bullying me, one part of my brain tells me I'm being paranoid, the other parts tells me I just don't get it, and my whole body freezes at the thought of confrontation anyway. So I usually do nothing, and once I am certain it's gone too far, I give people reasons to hate me. Be it trash talk about them, about myself, acting like a complete moron, anything. However I usually try to not do anything that could put me in troubles. (Yes, I've always wanted to smash that car's window, but I never allowed myself to, for example).

I also have a vast imagination, and i've been dreaming vividly since I was a child, but it's usually nightmares. When I wake up, I'm confused about those.

So, as you can imagine, I have troubles to fit in. I've had girlfriends, but my anxiety was too big, and I was plain toxic. I've had friends, but never for too long. They always end up making fun of what I now believe is my mild autism (asperger's they used to call that?)

So, going into my adult life, I was already depressed. Couldn't find a job, and I wasn't really aware of my conditions. So I never asked in specialized places. But I kept trying. 2 years after finishing high school, I only had a few months of work in an office. So I decided to get back to studies.

That was about 4 years ago. at that point, I noticed I was being \*\*watched\*\* in my own home. Whenever I did something weird, my stepmother would let ""slip"" a hint that she was aware. I was pretty conflicted. \*\*I assumed I was being paranoid\*\*, but I lowkey tried to make sure.  Speaking bullshit in different places and see what came back, spitting in a bottle she was drinking and see if someone drinked it, etc. Result: only toilets seemed ""safe"", and \*\*everything else checked out with them monitoring me\*\*. But I still assumed I was being paranoid. It didn't make any sense. Why would they, right? But as an extremely shy guy, this thought used to freeze me.

There, I met a group of people. There was a good vibe, they were somehow able to deal with my condition, they were patient and, I thought, weren't really judging me. However, someday I saw a message between them and another guy from the school talking about my ""disease"". I asked em, they said ""nah nothing"". So I let it go.

They smoked weed and I lowkey wanted to fit in, so I smoked too. They drank a lot, so I did too. Every friday, it was booze and weed. Not long after that, they started taking MDMA/XTC/coke. For a long time, I did not. That's crap. However, a couple years later (2 years ago, right when I graduated), I finally tried it. For a girl. We took mdma and ended up in the grass. The danger was that MDMA made me feel better. I was able to chat, make small talk, enjoy people around me, really. So I took it on and off for about 15 months, i'd say an average of twice a month.

Needless to say, drugs messed up the relationship with the girl, and she was out of the picture in a couple months. But she did try to help me. She suggested that I see a shrink, but not in a rude way. I still took it in a bad way because drug wearing off, but the idea was there. She also dropped hints that the others were mocking me, but since her and I were in a bad situation, I assumed she was just trying to ruin me.

But I was done anyway. I didn't want to go to these parties anymore. I didn't want to drink, didn't want to do drugs. I just wanted to stay home, find a job. But the group kept ""harassing"" me. Whenever I said no, they insisted for day. So I felt like I had to go. And once there, there's not really a choice about wheter or not you drink. Or you're a ""pussy"". I felt pressured into drinking and doing drugs.  That's pretty much at that point that I noticed they were mocking me. From innocent jokes to straight up \*\* recording me doing drugs and sending it to my family,recording me going to toilets,... \*\*

someday, the host brang magic mushrooms. I was really scared, but once again, I felt like I had no real choice. So we divided in 2 groups. The first one took first, and one hour later the second group took it. about 20 grams of fresh shroom.

I was in the second group. However, \*\*before eating anything, I remember I was feeling like I was on MDMA.\*\* my eyes were going left and right, colors were weird and I was pretty talkative. But once again I assumed I was just nervous.

So I just rolled with it. An hour later, I was eating shrooms. It was the worst idea of my life. I do believe I now suffer from PTSD from that night. The high never stopped going higher. I lost touch with reality, I wanted to die, really. But here's the problem: Whenever I reached back to myself, I just wanted to leave these guys. But they didn't let me. I felt stuck. Time froze. So I started thinking about a way to make them hate me and never ask for me to come back. So I told em I was gay (I'm not), since they dislike gay people. They didn't buy it. \*\*So I said more stuffs, mostly fake but with some truth in it.\*\* I don't remember all of it, but I had the duty to ""shock"" people, it was the only thing that made time pass. I only stopped when I was sure they thought I was a terrible person. Then I realized, said I wanted to die, etc. I don't have much memories of that phase, but they were \*\*recording and sending snapchats.\*\*

The next day, I felt terrible. I had no idea what to do. So I did nothing. a couple days later, they messaged me as if nothing happened. So I rolled with it. But their bullying kept increasing. Today I'm positive \*\*they were trying to make me go completely insane\*\*.

They were doing stuffs like dropping hints about those stuffs I ""confessed"", then said something completely different if I told em I didn't quite get it and asked for them to repeat. This happened a lot and went increasing. I had to record a conversation to make sure I was not losing my mind.

I now know they actively sabotaged me when I tried to work somewhere (boss dropping a hint about stuff I confessed while completely off topic, boss genuilnely surprised when I gave him informations conflicting with what that group knew, etc)

So I completely cut off the MDMA not long after the shrooms (I might have taken it twice after). However \*\*i still felt like I was under influence at most parties\*\*. But once again, I thought I was making stuff up. (you must be so tired of my behavior by now, i'm sorry but I was never able to act in another way). For the record, one of them is a dealer, that's where we got our stuff from.

After a while, the girl came back. We were friends and I didn't want it differently. She came to a party, and it was very... unhealthy. I quickly felt drugged, heart racing. I'd say something like coke or speed. And one of the guys (let's call him A) tried to be ""hands on"" on the girl. It stayed correct but it was flirting. Then another guy (B) came to me, and started hitting my weak spots, talking about the situation last time she was here, etc. He had such a stupid face, stupid smile, I should have known. I finished my drink and about 30 mins later my heart was speeding. At this point, A was still flirting, looked me dead in the eyes, leaned toward another guy (C) and said ""look at how he's pissed, it's working"". C looked at me and laughed out loud.

So I went to sleep. couldn't sleep. Took the first bus to the city. Early on, the guy selling drugs (let's call him V), who left the pary early, asked how it went in a group chat. I left the group, he added me again and said ""pretty well apparently"" with a crying laugh emoji, so I left again.

A couple days down the line, the girl asks me what happened. I just tell her what the dude said. Assuming she had no idea. To this day, I still don't know, so I still asume she did not. But we don't speak anymore. Then when I spoke with the others (outside A), they told me I was completely paranoid. that nothing like that was ever said. etc etc.

So they insisted again for me to come to a party, insisting A wouldn't be there anymore. (he was rarely there to begin with).  I didnt want to but they said they'd come pick me up if I didn't show up. So I went back. But I started forcing some time between parties. Until earlier this year. mid april, about 2 months after the last party I went to, they insisted quite a lot, so I went there. I felt so bad, light headed, vision problems, impossible to focus. It started as a MDMA trip but quickly escalated to a point where I felt fucking terrible. They insisted heavily with the stuff I ""confessed"", and still acted like nothing when I asked ""what about it?"". I went to bed at 2AM and couldn't find sleep before 8 AM and woke up with a \*\*huge pain in the jaw, blood on the lips\*\*. Once again I assumed it was something like ""leftover withdrawal"" or something, despite the fact that I completely stopped taking anything a while ago.

Not long after (about 10 days), I started scratching. Elbow first, then genitalia, and then hands. Went to the doctor, looks like it's eczema. I've never had eczema before.

But here's the worst. After that party, everything went sideways. That feeling of being ""watched"" increased. This is where i'll sound completely paranoid. Bear with me.

Whenever I woke up, I was getting a text in the next 5 mins. Be it from my father, a friend, sister, anyone. When I was playing on the PS with one of these guys, he would say stuff that sounded like coincidence. Like when I was scratching somewhere, he'd go like ""damn my X is scratchy"", X being where I was scratching. Or telling me ""when i'm doing nothing, I like to touch my beard and find longer hairs and pull them"". I know I have this ""OCD"". He, however, never does that. It sounds stupid but it was daily stuff, sometimes coherent, sometimes not at all. I couldn't understand WHY. So I still assumed it was paranoia, despite being proven daily that it was real.

Early june, I went to the last party. I warned that at the instant drugs were used, I'd go to sleep. But at this point I was convinced they were drugging me, so I went with a plan to make sure.

I usually buy a soft drink before going that I carry around the whole night. So I did, after 1 beer I opened another one and went to pee outside, and saw them moving toward my seat.

I came back inside, noticed my bottles (both beer and soft) had moved. I took a sip of my beer, noticed it tasted weird so I let it on the side. about 30 mins later, I traded it for someone else's. The guy was skyrocketed 30 mins after that, completely under influence. he even said something about ""the bottom tasting weird"".

So I took a few sips of my soft. It was tea so you can tell when it's been tampered with. And it was disgusting. about one hour later, half the bottle down, I can tell I can't focus, and at this point i've taken enough mdma to recognize symptoms. The guy who drank my beer is even in a worse state.

I made sure the window was open, went to pee outside. C said to V (you overdosed, I think he figured out). So at this point I stopped sipping in that soft, stuck to beer and kept it close to me at all time. I notice they're all under influence, as usual, but I have not seen anyone take anything. I start to feel tired and have to make sure. So I give a bit of the soft to another guy (B), and finish my bottle and go to sleep.

Not long after, B is in an even worse state. I go to sleep. It's around 6AM. My heart is racing, my eyes out of focus. I could not sleep before 10AM, and slept like 30 mins. I'm someone who needs a lot of sleep, so this would not be possible without drugs. I also woke up to a clenched jaw. (this is MDMA/speed side effect).

During that party, they stepped up the harrassement game. They kept saying out loud stuff I ""confessed about"". like the same sentences over and over again. When I asked ""what?"" they always said ""nothing?"". Once again I had to discretely hit record on my phone to have the proof.

So I decided to ghost em. They insisted for a bit, using money they owed me to lure me. I would say that's the week I started losing my mind. ""ruminating"" what happened. The ""PTSD"" from the shroom also increased. I felt lost, back in the bad trip from that night. The increased surveillance didn't help. So I started provoking whoever was watching me. I am now 100% certain my father and stepmother are watching me 24/24. But someday I said ""worst case, V is going down too. With all the shit he's selling..."". Same day, at 1AM, he sent me ""you ghosted me but don't forget I know where you live..."".

I tried laughing and say ""they condemn me for stuff I haven't even done, without even asking me"". the next day, my sister says something along the line ""I always give a shot to people to defend themselves if they want to"".

So I decided to go see a shrink. The first time was nice, but she just wanted to talk about my parents and childhood. I insisted something was off with my mind but she didnt give a F. Second and third time, I could tell she was obviously digging in ways targeting my ""confession"". So the second time I said ""taxis aren't good around here, I think I'll stop coming and maybe see someone else closer to my place"". \*\*The VERY NEXT DAY, my father insisted that he has a friend that can drive me to that town if I ever want to go shop there, and stressing the fact that she can wait the full hour.\*\* Note that I NEVER go there to shop.

The third time, I said to the shrink that I had money troubles and I'd rather wait a bit before next. The very next day, my father implied that I could ask him money if need be...

By the way I never said to ANYONE that I wanted to see a shrink. Ever. But I did call her at home.

Last week, I've heard my stepmother talking about something I said at the shrink's. This week, I've said, during my bath, ""I think i'll move to an asylum"". The very same day, my stepmother said to her sister ""he's getting interned"", and she said ""woohoo we won"".

Now i'm a complete mess. I have OCD (I don't know if it's the actual word) making me laugh without realizing it. I asked my father, he said I don't. But the neighboors are pissed, I've heard one talking to the cops. It's all night long apparently.

My brain completely zaps and my paranoia is going crescendo. I feel completely ruined by this harrassment while all I needed is for anyone to ask me what that bad trip about. But they didn't care and they tried to make me go nuts.

\*\*TL;DR:

\-I'm probably asperger or something.

\-Family has been surveilling me for a while. Even in the bathroom.

\-""Friends"" drugged me multiple times.

\-One of them lowkey threatened me.

\-""Friends"" started surveilling me down the line. No idea since when. Phone hacked I guess?

\-The situation makes me go nuts. Not knowing who to trust, why they surveilled me in the first place, seeing they even got in touch with the shrink when I only wanted to get better.

\-Ruined me work-wise (telling stuffs to my bosses)

\- I ""admitted"" terrible crimes during a shroom bad trip (and probably MDMA against my will), that would probably justify imprisonment. But the worst thing i've ever done was growing weed for my own purpose. I did sell a couple grams to those ""friends"" tho. I'd have no problem settling anything in court.

\- I now have eczema and OCD. Panic attacks. I feel like I'm in hell on a daily basis.

\- Have confirmation my stepmother tries to make me go crazy. Or crazier. Prob the others too.

\*\*

So there it is. Right now I don't know what to do. I know I sound ""batshit crazy"".  But there are stuffs and hints that prove it's not in my head. And I know I can easily create more proofs. I know that if, tomorrow, I go and mention or do something, it will come back to my face one way or another.  But I also know it's exactly what someone crazy would say.

But i'm stuck here. I don't have a job, i'm not rich, the shrink probably believes that sort of crap too. And she refuses to medicate me anyway. I'd go an see another shrink, but it would happen all over again, and I'm not rich so...

94,"Hello there

I come here looking for advise. I am really worry and scared.

My internet friend has had a lot of mental problems in the past. She has attempted suicide and had depression. She is better now but sometimes she has relapses and she cuts. Lately she is feeling worthless and like a burden to everyone. I always tell her that I love her and she is loved by a lot of people and she makes the world a better place, and that i love speaking to her, and all the good positive things i can think of but they don't seem to help. Today I am really worried cause she seems like she is having a really bad time. I wish I could be there but all I can do is telling her its gonna be ok and everything i think could cheer her up but it doenst help i dont know what to do. I am so fucking scared. I want her to feel good and loved and i want her to love herself and be okay. What can I do? Please help me",11Aug2018,2

I've tried identifying everything and catch myself now and again but the feeling.. in my chest, head stomach, just feels like i'm upset, frustrated, groggy.. For every moment and anytime anyone says anything.. or I think anything. I shame myself and pick apart others no matter how hard I try not to. I don't go anywhere because of this and it's so embarrassing because I feel like I know what's happening but why can't I control it? There's still a part of me that says i'm better than this, that i'm not the 22 year old living like a bratty teenager who can't clean up/fend for himself.

98,"So I’ve (19F) decided to finally take the first few steps and finally get some help for my (possible) social anxiety and panic attacks. I’m deciding to go see someone about it. So this is where it might sound really stupid, but I don’t know whether to go with going to my doctor for it or just getting it done at my community college.

With the regular counselling, I could get it right away (minus waiting lists and stuff). Money also might not be an issue as I do have other disabilities. There would also be more sessions in some situations. The only bad thing would be telling my parents why I need the help. I live with them and I kind of depend on them to book appointments and drive me there, so I would have to tell them. I’d rather not do that but if I really must, I’ll figure out a way to bite the bullet.

Then there’s college counselling. Depending on the waiting list for regular counselling, I might be able to jump into this quicker. It’s free here and I found their number and email on the college website. I would also be able to keep these issues secret from my parents. The only bad thing would be that it would have less sessions/resources, so I don’t know if I’d get the best.

99,"I've had this since I was a little girl. Being really mean to the people that I liked, I just had to hurt them. Not for a particular reason. It just kinda comes naturally. It doesn't even has anything to do with them getting close or something(it's kind of an cliche to say that). I noticed that when I'm with someone who allows me to be like that,(or someone who can't handle me) that it's getting worse.

100,"I have lots of suicidal thoughts but I won’t kill my self because I have a wife and my two daughters.

A bit of history; I’m 35, I’ve been married for eight years and have an eleven-year-old and a six-year-old.  My wife has been depressed for a while and has stopped doing anything except for what she must do.  She’s on antidepressants and has been to coinciding so now she’s much better but she’s just not interested in anything that’s not constructive somehow.

My two girls are at the age now where my oldest wants to be with her friends all the time and my youngest wants to follow her big sister everywhere.

When we first started dating, I had to move out of the country for a year but knowing I would be back we stayed together while I was gone, but after I got back, I really didn’t have any friends left.

So now, 18 years on and the only things I have in my life now are my work and the walls of my house.  I have no friends left that have contacted me or wanted to do anything for years.  My wife only ever wants to be in the same room as each other-she isn’t interested in anything I do or want to do, and she has no hobbies or interests of her own really.  I’ve tried so hard to suggest different things we can do but she just doesn’t want to!

I’ve thought about leaving a lot but with the economy the way it is, if we weren’t both working full-time, we wouldn’t make it so if I left, my kids would suffer.  On top of that, I really don’t have anywhere to go and I certainly can’t afford to live on my own.

Everything I do-I do alone now, so everything has become boring to me.  I’m no longer excited by my own interests...

I’ve tried making new friends but guys are so strange.  They always say things like ‘yea, we should hang out sometime’ or ‘come over for a beer sometime’ or whatever but then when asked the answer has always been a definitive ‘no’.  I understand people have lives and they’re busy but so am I and I still have time that I would like to spend with friends...

I’m 35, I live on a planet with 7.5 billion other people and the harder I try to socialize, the worse it gets.  Now I just want to skip to the end!  Can I just go on auto-pilot for the rest please?  I don’t wanna die because people will be hurt, but can I at least fast-forward or something?  Please?  I’m just so bored and alone...",11Aug2018,1

The last week or two I’ve been having nightmares almost every night. I looked it up and apparently nightmares can be common in PTSD. Last night was particularly bad, my fiancé had to wake me up from screaming at 5am. I was hard to wake and when he finally woke me up, I didn’t remember having the dream or what it was even about. It scared me. I was hoping someone might have some insight into why this is coming so frequently now or if anyone has any tips that can make it better. ",11Aug2018,1

Short after that, I started hearing voices which told me this ""Hey, do you see this bald man? He's trying to hurt you! You should go and kill him instead!"" That made me even more nervous, because I told them to shut the fuck up and they told me back ""I won't shut up, do you want me to kill you?"" I started to get anxiety, which lead me to abandon the place and tell my dad what was going on. I went back home and waited to calm down to write this, so yeah, that's it.

I don’t want therapy, I don’t want medication - I needn’t feel any more numb - and I’d like to just have this all erased. 

I feel if everyone’s got in their heads that I’m suicidal they’re going to be skeptical at best about just letting me stop but I don’t want to bother with it any more, I’d like to just have it all swept under the rug and forgotten about. If I just stopped going abruptly with no word then I’m worried there might be some questions asked and intervention involved.

I can't tell my family because I don't really have that sort of relationship with them and I don't want to get involved with the constant tension and arguments.

But I really hate it. I can't think straight or focus on anything. It also makes it really hard to sleep. 

It doesn't help that I have a recurring nightmare which stops me staying asleep. So I'll be lucky to sleep 3-4 hours a night.
