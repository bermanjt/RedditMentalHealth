0,"So, I recently had a friend attempt suicide. Many people around me were sad. I completely faked all sad reactions. He is my closest friend, I have known him for four years. Is that weird that I felt absolutely nothing. That I just completely faked that I was sad. ",17Dec2018,1
1,"I've noticed that during random occurrences this small voice calls my name or tells me something. It is weird like for example when I was having a coughing voice it told me to cover my mouth but it wasn't my voice and I didn't think of it. 
I was diagnosed bipolar psychotic.
I also noticed shadow people at the corner of my eye sometimes too.

2,"Im always so proud thinking ive conquered my disorder, my life seems to be running somewhat smoothly, then comes some huge fat hiccup in my life, a mistake, the type of big mistake that no one else is making... &amp;&amp; then im reminded of my disorder, how im different, how im the single handedly responsible for blowing up my life &amp; burning all those bridges years ago, and even still, now.",17Dec2018,1
3,"I don’t think so, even if I have terrible thoughts... they don’t mean anything right? I shouldn’t have to feel bad for them? I do honestly though... I have nasty intrusive thoughts and I’ve had intrusive thoughts regarding violence when I’ve been angry, but I ultimately believe in peace.

4,"Possible trigger warning? Graphic dreams with descriptions of deep cuts. 


So I’m not even sure what my point will be.. I just found it weird that these dreams have started again as if to show me that I am not doing well mentally at all. 

I was in a much worse place about 5-7 years ago. I was self harming every day, completely isolated myself and so on. I was diagnosed with BPD. I used to always have these absurd graphic dreams where I would hurt myself in some way and then see the inside of my body, but without blood. 

Anyway, I took a nap today (also have been sleeping an insane amount of hours per day, sometimes more than 12). Woke up and after a while remembered my dream which was horrible. I just have to write it down. 

So in the dream I had scraped my knee and it would not stop bleeding no matter what. Then someone else in my dream (unknown person) pointed out that I had other cuts on my legs. And we’re talking my legs sliced open from knee to ankle. In my dream I could basically open two flaps of skin and look inside my leg.  It just looked like I’m looking into a black hole. There was no blood. Just my entire leg sliced open, I could see all the layers of skin and fat but no bones or blood. It was so disturbing.

My dreams always give me an unsettling feeling when they’re like this. That’s why I felt maybe writing it down will just help me process it. 

Thankfully next week I have an appointment with a therapist for the first time in 5 years. Still I just wanted to share this. 

Maybe someone has similar experiences with weird dreams they get whenever they’re in a bad place?",17Dec2018,1
5,"I took my first dose of Wellbutrin 75mg around 10 this morning. By noon, I began feeling slightly lightheaded, not too bad, but noticeable. At some point I began sweating excessively. Around 4, both got worse and by 5 I began having intense nausea. I haven’t puked but it feels like if I bent over the toilet I would. My whole body has chills and I’m sweating profusely. I’ve been laying in bed since 5:30 (it’s 7:30 now) and it got a little better with a stomach pill and some Tums but when I got up to go to the bathroom 30 mins ago it all came back. 

Could all of this be from the Wellbutrin? It just seems like so much considering it’s my first dose and such a low mg. It came on so fast too. Maybe I have the flu? I want to give it a shot and I know most of the side effects don’t last but a week or so, but if it’s going to be this intense I don’t think I can handle it.

7,"I really don’t remember a time that I wasn’t depressed. I’m sure it wasn’t until I was a preteen that my depression really started, but everything before the age of ten is a blur. My older brother bullied me relentlessly when he lived with us (he either lived with us or with his dad), and by the age of eleven I had developed bald spots. The balding simply brought more bullying from other students. Since there wasn’t much I could do to cover it while it grew back I wore my hair in low ponytails. My classmates found anything to bully me about. I wanted to wear makeup? Let’s make fun of her! I wore oversized hoodies because I was always cold? Yup getting bullied! I held hands with my best friend? Going to get called a lesbian (jokes on them, I like girls now too)! I moved in grade 8 and made friends with the misfits. It was great I was so happy to finally have friends who liked me and wanted to hang out with me, but they even bullied me. Most people in town were a bit wealthier, and I lived in a ratty house right on the train tracks. I tried to separate myself from the girls that were the rudest, but they gravitated towards me to harass me. After a few months I managed to find a different group, and realized in high school they were a bunch of stoners. Fine by me, they weren’t treating me like shit. I never partook in smoking until much later in high school, but they were some of my best friends. After graduating my depression worsened, probably because I wasn’t seeing my friends on a daily basis, and wasn’t getting out much. I started dating my moms bosses son who quickly turned into an emotionally manipulative prick just like his mother. We broke up rather quickly, and I realized I was polyamorous. I started dating my friend Emma, shortly after I started sleeping with one of the guys I was friends with back in high school. I broke things off with both of them after I almost killed myself through alcohol poisoning. Found out that the friend who was hosting the party I was drinking at (while being underage) had said that it wasn’t her job to look out for me. It wasn’t her job to make sure I was fine. I never felt more unloved in those following months. I started using tinder to make fun of guys with a friend of mine, and stumbled upon this great guy. We hit it off right away and have been together for almost two years now. I’m feeling better. I’m still depressed. I’m still learning that some of the things the guy I was sleeping with were abuse. I’m still learning so much and still hurting over many things but I’m doing better. Seasonal depression is in full swing, and I can’t seem to get this weight off my chest, no matter what I do. The Christmas spirit hasn’t been present for so long I just want to be a little kid again. I want nothing more than to live a life unbothered by depression and anxiety, and I’m sure in time it will come, but for now. I’m simply trying. ",17Dec2018,1
8,I’ve been alone all day haven’t talked to a single person. My mind goes to very dark places when I’m by myself and I had an emotional breakdown. My friend was supposed to come say goodbye to me today before she left for Spain. But she didn’t call me or text me but she went to dinner with other people. People she claimed she hates. My other friends are hanging out together and “forgot” to invite me. Why am I not worth it? Honestly tho why?,17Dec2018,1

10,"At the end of October this year I was put in a situation were I was forced into treatment. I stayed inpatient for a week and then got diagnosed with mdd, ptsd, anorexia, and opioid use disorder (or some shit like that, I fr didn't know that was a thing). I've been on cymbalta (it did nothing) and lexapro (it made me worse) and now I'm on prozac.

Fuck I just want to slit my fucking wrists so bad right now. I don't want to kill myself, I've seen what that does to people, but do I really have much of a choice at this point? I'm loosing control of everything. I have goals I wish I could accomplish but they're too far out of my reach. I should honestly quit while I'm ahead. I wish I could od and just die peacefully.

It was one of the worst experiences of my life and it made me worse. Sure, it made everyone around me know that I was struggling and that I needed help but I'm worse off now. I'm just rambling at this point. Fuck why do I even try? There's no fucking point to anything. Ip made me fucking worse and it was so expensive! I just want to fucking die. I want to go to sleep and never wake up, agh there are so many different stereotypical things I could say to describe how I'm feeling.

12,"last semester I failed every class. This one I passed one class. Failed the other two. I remember when I was 13 and my mom said I can't do anything right. I remember all the times my parents wondered how I'd get through life if I can't keep my room clean or seem to pass college. Now they're supportive but no matter how many times my mom tells me I will succeed I don't believe it. I have just one more chance at retaking these two classes before I can never take them again. I had a wonderful day then the reminder that I failed college comes back. I wonder what the hell I'm going to do with my life. I only have a few friends and don't have the energy to text people anymore. I lie to strangers asking me how college is going and it hurts. I am a loser and I've already failed life at 20. I am seeing a therapist but she's like a friend I pay to like me. My real friend is great but I feel like I can't talk to her. I feel like I push everyone away. I barely have enough money to get by, I'm living at home. 

I am afraid all the time. when I walk out the door it's like a game of survival. Make it past this cross walk, bike in the dark before the sunrise and watch out for animals, people, cars, just make it to work alive. I wonder if I will live past tomorrow. I am just used to it by now. 

What people think about me, I speak weirdly sometimes I think. I wonder if people think I'm slow. Maybe I am. I don't feel smart. I used to but now I feel uneducated, dimwitted. 

I can't function. And it sucks. I could have a beautiful day but come home depressed. I hate this. It's living in hell. But I think suicide is wrong so I won't go there. But each day I feel like I just am losing bits and pieces of myself. 

I have had a difficult life, I watched my dad almost die at 9 in a car accident, he barely survived and was in the hospital for an insane amount of time and my mom was taking care of him and the baby and I was left behind. My childhood ended. I watched my sister having a seizure twice and I thought she was dying. When this happens it's literally like a real life horror movie. It's horrific and terrifying. And in both of these cases no one was around to help me.

I am so screwed up. I hate it. This sucks. It just sucks and I want to be normal. I want to be average. I don't care if I'm not special or amazing I just want to be average. ",17Dec2018,1
13,"Hm where to start. 
I’m 16, 
I’m definitely depressed. 
I think about suicide, a lot. Never attempted it. 

The thing is people are usually depressed for a reason, right? Whether it be finical issues, family, education or something else, there’s always a reason. But I don’t really have a reason. If anything, I think living is just a waste of time. To me it seems pointless to go to college. Work a job for like 50 years and then die? And for what? A few good memories that will be outnumbered by bad ones. 

I’ve asked myself that question; Do you actually want to die or do you just want to not feel this way? And with all honestly. The only way for me not to feel this way is to not be, right?

 I don’t really have many people to talk to about this. I don’t want to make things worse and end up in some hospital. If anything Life is ok, I have good grades, I’m doing well physical but mentally I’m exhausted. I’m exhausted of putting on a fake smile everyday and walking around pretending like I care. 

Maybe another factor is religion. My parents raise me catholic. I guess I believed in it up to the point were I was constantly just asking for guidance and never received any. They don’t know I think it’s bullshit (no offense to anyone). I usually can get out of going to church by claiming to do school work but being forced to go there makes me feel sick. 

I’m not sure why I came to write today. 
I guess I’m just looking to see if there’s any advice anyone can give me.
I’m sorry for wasting your time though. Cause honestly I’m probably a lost cause and you have a better chance convincing someone else life is worth it.  ",17Dec2018,1
14,"I’m 17 and just now coming to terms that I am probably seriously mentally ill. I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression which was later rediagnosed as a branch of borderline personality disorder, severe anxiety, ADHD. I think I have gender dysphoria (undiagnosed because I’m in the south and in high school so if I came out as trans I’d be bullied. Will probably come out and transition in college, or switch to online school soon so I can do it sooner without the judgement) if that counts. But aside these, I still feel like there may be a bigger underlying issue. I’m being treated with lithium, zoloft, and vyvanse and while they have helped in some ways I still feel crazy. I also recently started using NuvaRings for heavy periods, I don’t know if that counteracts with anything I’m taking but just in case that is necessary to mention. 

I’ve experienced both visual and auditory hallucinations a few times in my life, mostly while I either had a fever or was under the influence. Recently I smoked weed while severely sleep deprived and heard music, laughing children, and tapping on my window, and saw a face through the blinds in the window.  I smoke a lot and have never had anything like that happen prior, but that can probably be explained by the sleep deprivation. Have smoked since and nothing of the sort has happened again... to my knowledge. But then again I didn’t realize the auditory hallucinations weren’t real for a few hours until I started hearing kids laughing, when I realized that there were no kids in my house and put together that it wasn’t real. I heard them like they were right there... who knows what else my mind has gotten away with convincing me. I have always had delusions, however, which have increasingly gotten more and more irrational and odd. To name some....
- I’ve always felt an unwarranted sense of superiority? It’s weird because I don’t like myself at all yet I have always considered my mind “superior” to others. In turn this makes me feel worse about myself, and it’s a weird cycle. It has made me terribly lazy because I don’t feel obligated to do anything for myself or anyone else. I still have a sense of morality and know how to act normally so I don’t come off as selfish, but if I didn’t have the people in my life who I have right now I’d have literally no one to continue acting “normal” for and gladly lock myself in a room with food and a computer for the rest of my life.
- I’ve had an on and off delusion about being a reincarnated archangel. On and off because part of me knows there’s no solid evidence to back that up and that it doesn’t make any sense considering I’m an atheist, and another part of me says “don’t fight it, everything points to you being Special and you know it. you have psychic and empathetic abilities, it must be true.”
- oh yeah I have believed I have psychic and empathetic abilities since eighth grade. The rational side of me knows that is a big red flag for delusions, but the horrible gremlin side of me... well... right now I think it‘s true despite that I know it doesn’t make sense. I predicted a lot of weird things relating to my friends and family and now my mind won’t let go of the idea. :(
- I can’t think of a way to accurately reword this so, try not to read this in the tune of the popular Michael Jackson song: I always feel like somebody’s watching me. I have a hard time being home alone because I feel someone will try to kill me. I always have to shut myself in my room when I’m alone, with my windows and door shut because if I don’t I will feel like someone is staring at me or following me. I have had a lot of nightmares about this concept starting in my early childhood... I would often refuse to sleep in case someone would break in and try to kill me in my sleep.
- Perceived past lives that are either delusions or real depending on your beliefs lol?? And lots of dreams about those too
- Not really a delusion I just have no sense of self whatsoever and it’s worth mentioning. Most likely from BPD but yeah I’m constantly dissociated as fuck. I don’t associate my mind with my vessel. My relationships are confusing and sometimes chaotic because of this.

I have mental illness on both sides of my family; most notably mom’s brother killed himself after experiencing severe agoraphobia and paranoid delusions keeping him locked in his own house since pretty much immediately after he graduated high school. He was a genius, I went with my mom to his house to collect his things before his house was cleaned up (the actual scene in his bedroom hadn’t been cleaned at all, besides his body being collected by the coroner the day before. I was unfazed and I feel really horrible about it, almost 3 years later) and he had a ton of video game platforms and multiple journals he’d kept for *years* loaded of tips and shortcuts for various games including Mortal Kombat, but obviously he was severely mentally ill. Unfortunately his agoraphobia kept him from going to get diagnosed with anything, and he refused to let a doctor come to his home because he thought they’d poison him through medications.

Sorry that was a lot of rambling. I am kind of manic right now, I took my medications late this morning and had espresso. I will probably delete this later. 

TLDR: I’m worried that I have psychosis because I’ve had auditory and visual hallucinations while sick or after using weed, and several delusions starting from childhood including an unwarranted sense of superiority, random delusions about being a reincarnated angel and a psychic, a lot of paranoia about being watched or killed while alone. Worried that BPD, anxiety, and ADHD might not explain this. Also have gender dysphoria but haven’t come out. Family history of psychosis.",17Dec2018,1
15,"So, I don’t really know how to start this, In 2016 I was told by my therapist that it was very clear i suffer from social anxiety, Self Harm, not willing to participate socially, and i still to this day think everyone lies about how much they care and need me, but even my therapist says their seems like alot of things she cant say that i’d have to see a doctor to talk about like the fact i talk to myself and uncontrollably laugh “maniacally” ,I Have dreams where i scrape my skin off but its never really bothered me, i always chalked it up to my psyche and my love of horror

20,"My mom is 57 years old and I think she has depression with psychosis. It’s either depression with psychosis or lingering effects of a UTI ( which I know sounds weird, but apparently it can legit mess with mental health). Ever since my mom went through menopause around age 50 I noticed that she was is more isolated and cries/sobs every single day which she never did before and up until age 50 I had only seen her cry twice in my life! Not only had she started to cry everyday, but she started to say that things in the house had started to go missing- little things such as clocks, cooking utensils, books, toys, little Knicknacks from the thrift store etc. At first she accused another family member of taking the things , but after awhile I would find the missing items around the house. 

After a few years, it then progressed to her “sorting” all of her items around the house which resulted in many mixed match items just being thrown around the house in boxes or just scattered around the house. She did this for some time while I was still living with her. Then she changed and out of nowhere she started to accuse me of taking her things and selling  them for drugs. Let me note that I have never taken drugs or took any of her items. When I would find the items that she accuses me of taking she simply stated that she had caught me just in time before i sold them to a drug dealer for drugs. She accused me of taking her baking pans, her pens, her travel bags to a drug dealer! It got so bad that she continued to pack all of her things and then when she couldn’t find it, she would automatically assume I sold them and would barge into my room in the middle of the night threatening to harm me. It got so bad that I had to move out even though at the time she wasn’t working and I had to support her.

Now it has gotten to the point where I haven’t seen my mom in a year and she won’t even let me in the house!! She constantly leaves me messages asking me to bring back her things ( I don’t have access to the house anymore) and is always crying and stated she’s even afraid to leave the house because she still believes I’m taking all of her items! I constantly tell her I haven’t taken anything, but she absolutely refuses to believe me and will go back to accusing me. When I try to prevent her with logic or facts she completely disregards it and goes back to yelling and crying. 

I don’t know what to do! My mom needs help, but now do I help her when she doesn’t think she’s the one who needs help?? Has anyone experienced this? I’m so lost and I don’t know what to do! To the best of my knowledge she doesn’t act this way at her new job or when she talks to people on the phone. How do I help her?

23,"Spring semester 2018: failed every class, couldn't get out of bed because of constant panic attacks and depression. Got diagnosed with anxiety, major depressive disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. First time going to a psychiatrist. 

Summer 2018: continuing to see psychiatrist, trying out different medications. Something doesn't sit right with me about my diagnosis. I start therapy. 

Fall semester 2018: after tracking my mood for some time, I notice a sort of pattern. My diagnosis might be changing from all that from earlier to cyclothymia (pretty much the step below bipolar II). Found a medicine that WORKS. Now I'm thriving, i can get out of bed and function in public, know how to manage my panic attacks (but it's still a work in progress), and on top of all that, it's the middle of winter. Passed all my classes (with A's!!)

A few lessons here:

1. If your mental health diagnosis doesn't feel like it fits you, go to therapy, and get some mental health tracking apps to discuss with your psychiatrist in case there's some pattern that you don't know about or don't recognize. 

2. If you have a super rough couple of months, you are not a failure. It'll get better. But you HAVE to take some of your own steps because therapy and medicine alone won't fix everything; they will give you the extra boost you need to function in your everyday life. Own the fact that you have (or might have) a mental disorder, and figure out what to do about it. Nobody can help you if nobody knows about it. 

3. If you take all of the steps you can take and you have a rough day or two, IT IS OKAY. Everybody has down days. Instead of focusing on how the day might be terrible, focus on how much better it is than the last time you had a bad day. Don't ever forget to tell yourself that being in a low spot is normal, and you'll get back to a better spot soon. 

4. EMPLOYERS/PROFESSORS/ANYONE REALLY: Just because someone has a rough couple of months DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE STUPID OR AREN'T WORTH YOUR TIME. Talk to them and figure out what was going on. Especially in mental health cases; maybe they were switching medicines because the ones they were on weren't working out. Maybe they went through a significant trauma. 

If anyone has any questions about the apps that I use or about my meds or anything really, ask away. I am an open book and will tell you anything!

P.S.
Eat fruits and vegetables and really focus on your self care. You matter before anyone. Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. It's okay to take a mental health day if you need it. You are loved. You are strong. You and your feelings are valid. You will get better. You will learn to cope. And you will live your best life. Unfortunately, it just takes time. Be patient and you'll make it.

24,"back story:

I (20f) have had panic disorder and GAD since childhood. My parents (the two most loving and amazing humans ever) just have this old school Asian concept of anxiety as something you just suck up and move on from. In college, I had panic attacks more often and experienced severe insomnia sometimes only sleeping 1.5-2 hours/night which fucked up pretty much everything. Finally it caught up to me one day in class when I got nauseous and went to the bathroom and my vision went black. Ended up in student health and they sent me to the ER because my vitals were abnormal.

Got started on some Citalopram and Xanax as a sleep aid and for panic attacks. Citalopram made me kinda foggy and indifferent but it worked. Xanax was fucking great for sleep and killed those panic attacks like nothing else but I couldn’t remember anything while I was on it. I hated the dull feeling and memory loss and the feeling of being dependent on pills to be a functional person. Also felt guilty because I knew my parents don’t approve of medication. without my psychiatrist knowing I tapered myself off and never refilled my scripts.  

now it’s back and taking over my life again. I know I was a fucking idiot for thinking I knew better than my psych so please don’t rub it in. I just want to get help again but I’m too embarrassed to go back to my doc after basically blowing off his help last time. Any stories or tips appreciated. ",17Dec2018,1
25,"This is the lowest I’ve ever been.  I’m running on 100% logic at this point, and the only reason I haven’t killed myself is that it doesn’t make financial or emotional sense to do so because I have two girls.

I barely see my family because of the hours I work.  I have no friends that I talk to, and I don’t know the last time I was able to get out of my house for fun.

My wife worries about me and she cries and stresses about my mood but she also doesn’t try to help.  She just worries and hopes it might get better.  We don’t share any interests either so she can’t be that friend I need.

I’ve tried everything at this point.  I’m on anti-depressants but I need to change them and because I’m forgetful I’ve missed three appointments to do so and am now in financial debt with my doctor.  Even if it’s only $70, I don’t have $0.70, so it really doesn’t matter anyway.  I’ve tried opening new avenues by joining groups or calling old friends.  If I don’t do the calling, I don’t hear from anyone at all.  The groups I’ve joined, I can’t spend any time with because I lost my job due to lack of work, and I had to pick up a job where I work in the evenings, and on weekends.  This also means I’ve missed all the Xmas parties and events we were going to take our kids to.

This was supposed to be the first year since 2001 that I was actually going to have a holiday, and time to spend with my family, and now almost all of my time is spent alone, even with others in the same house.....

I honestly just want to die.  There is nothing here for me except servitude towards those around me.  There are no people who are interested in taking time out of their lives for me.  For twenty years I’ve been trying to make things better and for twenty years life has been blocking all my effort.  I’m too tired to go on...

Yes I used to have emotions.  I don’t really anymore.  There’s no point.  Being happy is just a tease until something goes wrong (which is frequent).  Being angry, even at something that a normal, sane person SHOULD get angry at, just nets criticism.  If I’m sad, I get the ‘everyone has problems’ line.  None of my feelings are valid to anyone so I just pushed them far enough down to not have them.

Today I had a day off work, and I did nothing.  And I don’t feel much about it.  Should I have tried harder to do something anyway?  Should I just cut an artery and get it over with before I drag someone down with me?

I have been lost for as long as I can remember....

And now I’m half laughing at myself because I realized that it really doesn’t matter what I type or say, or where I type or say it, it’s not going to make any difference for me at all!

I just want to skip to the end....I’m really really bored.... ",17Dec2018,1

Dont want to appear crazy but I have a genuine concern 

I care about family alot, I care about a lot of things in general , 

You could attach all sorts of negative deconotations , I'm selfish , nothing meaningful in my life , don't care enough about others , etc

besides all the trials and tribulations , good times bad times , all said and done  , I just dont really give a fuck about living , not in a depressive, suicidal way,. No matter how much people say you couldn't be one without the other ,

28,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for quite a while, and I care a lot about her. She is one of the most supportive people I know in many regards, but especially when it comes to mental health. She is always the first to advocate for being understanding and respectful of whatever it might be that others go through. She is always there for friends, letting them open up to her and lean on her when they need help or someone to talk to. She is the first to push people to get the help and support they need whenever she sees that they might be struggling. I love that about her. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that this only applies to other people. She herself has struggles with mental health and deals with what I would say is anxiety and maybe depression. I am not in any way a mental health professional and she has never been diagnosed with anything, so that's just me conjecturing based on the way she acts and talks, but that's sort of my point. She is so quick to support and encourage others to get help, but she refuses to seek any kind of help for herself. When I try and talk to her about her emotions and how she's feeling, she insists that there's nothing wrong with her and she just needs to toughen up, which is exactly the mindset she is quick to help others out of.  I try and have honest conversations about how I haven't seen her smile in days, or how she seems subdued and sad for weeks on end, but the conversations are just shrugged off, even if what follows is her telling me about a friend who texted her in need of help and whose side she jumped to. It makes me frustrated and more than anything sad, because I hate to see her struggling at all, especially from a problem she helps others with but won't get help with herself. ",17Dec2018,1

Full disclosure I'm having a lot of trouble writing this so I apologize in advance. It's also worth noting that my family has a history of lots of mental health issues.

I have a lot of issues managing school and stress. I go from completely apathetic and insistent on not thinking about stressful things until it's down to the wire and then I freak out. Like, full-blown freaking out- not just about that particular thing but about everything. It feels like the world is ending.

I randomly get super uneasy in a very sort of deep and primal way that I legitimately have no clue how to describe. It's a super specific feeling and it happens more when I'm under stress but it doesn't seem to be triggered by anything. I could be sitting in bed or hanging out with people and it'll just wash over me out of nowhere. It's really hard for me to gather my thoughts during these weird episodes. It feels different than an anxiety attack.

I have incredibly bad memory problems and I don't really know if this has to do with anything but I'm gonna put it out there because it's really annoying lmao.

33,"Long story short about my back story: I’m constantly sad about my family’s situation, and I’m worried about my dad being lonely. I’m basically his only companion 90% of the week, and I feel stressed that I can’t fulfill that need. 

In result I’m always feeling sad and heavy hearted at home. I cope with it by spending time by myself in the room, distracting myself with things.

Idk if this is the main root of it, but I’m beginning to feel like I’m losing grip of the important things in my life. I stopped working out, and I’m too exhausted to do anything or even hangout with friends once I’m home from work. In fact, I can’t even bother cleaning my messy room even though it bothers me day to day. 

The worst part of all this is how I treat the people around me. I’m absent most of the time and I know I’m not being the best version of myself. Easily irritated and zoned out most of the times at social settings. Sometimes I can’t even bother replying to texts. 

I’m not suicidal at all and some days I really want to be better as a person. But most days I’m just doing what I have to do to get by and I can’t even share all this with anyone because I really don’t know what’s wrong with me.

35,"Hello, I am a 23 year old female. I am reaching out to see if others have had complications with their mental health after symptoms subside following mononucleosis.

I contracted mono in January of 2017 and experienced symptoms of exhaustion, depression, apathy for one year. Now, two years later post contraction, I  continue to feel periodic anxiety, depression, apathy, distrust of others. I experience heavy mood-swings a few times a week.

Before mono, I was confident, outgoing, bubbly, and though there are times I feel like my old self again, it is much less common. 

I am unsure if these changes are due to the transition I am currently experiencing (finishing school, entering job force), or  an undiagnosed disorder I never sought treatment for (I had severe mood swings throughout puberty), or perhaps a chemical imbalance in my brain caused by my illness.

I would like to know if others have experienced the same phenomenon. Did your personality ever go back to ""normal""? Did seeking professional help prove successful? Did medication work? What do you think is my best course of action?

Thank you in advance.

36,"I think that there’s something going on with me. I used to be a very motivated person but now I can’t get myself to do anything, like I spend an entire day on what could be done in an hour because I can’t do things but I get anxious when I don’t think that I’m doing things. 

I’ve broken down multiple times in the past two weeks, and my appetite has reduced (not to startling levels, but I generally eat a lot and it’s definitely reduced), and I get tired frequently. I’ve also noticed that I suddenly withdraw myself in loud settings when I used to thrive in them before. I also shake almost uncontrollably whenever something remotely emotional comes up, and I question everything that happens in my life. I remember that I used to have intrusive thoughts as a child (like I always imagined that I might start to uncontrollably pee in front of my teacher in kindergarten even though I was potty trained at an age much younger than most or I wouldn’t be able to sleep if a teacher tells me that I need to work on penmanship) but they subsided around middle school (I’m a high schooler now) but they’re definitely back (I didn’t sleep for a long time one night because I didn’t smile at a classmate and I always imagine that I would do stupid things like stick my hand under a stapler even though I never would). 

Idk if there is something wrong, but if there is, I can’t get professional help cuz then I’d have to bring it up with my parents, who think that a bad mental health is something to be ashamed of. Before anyone says that I can make them understand ir something, I’ve tried that before. A couple years ago, I had a pressing matter regarding my mental health that I had to discuss with my parents about, they walked on eggshells around me for 2 days and snapped at yelled at me the next day. They still use it against me, and I’m not gonna put myself through that again. What should I do? ",17Dec2018,1
37,"I have had anxiety and depression since I was about 8. I spent a large part of my teenage years trying different medications and in CBT. I learned how to manage my mental health fairly well and I'm a relatively functional, responsible adult now. 

My boyfriend and I have been together 2 and a half years. We don't live together, but see eachother 3-4 days a week. 

My boyfriend has had ADHD since childhood but never received treatment of any kind. He was a troublemaker in high school and failed to recognize limits and consequences. Through his adult life, the combination of his lack of concern for consequences and his forgetfulness, landed him in a mountain of debt with credit cards and service providers, unpaid parking/driving fines, a suspended drivers license and city fines like failing to register a pet. Some of these fines are a decade old and a warrant was put out for his arrest earlier this year - fortunately he happened to have the funds at the time to pay it off, but it was $600 instead of the original $200.  

He misses appointments. He puts off booking things until it becomes a crisis. He forgets to set his alarm and misses work. He forgets his phone or wallet EVERY TIME we leave the house - and regularly leaves them wherever we go. He insists on staying up until 2-4am every night to watch movies and play videogames, giving himself only a few hours of sleep, then says he's exhausted and feels terrible. He hits 'accept' for data charges on his phone, then is surprised at his bill at the end of the month. 

He also deals with panic attacks occasionally. He regularly feels too anxious to go to work and calls in sick - he's on contract and I'm afraid they might not keep him in January. He used to smoke marijuana occasionally, but now smokes every day. He has to have an energy drink every morning or feels like he can't function. Now he says they make him feel even more on edge and physically restless, but he says he's still not willing to give them up. He's also addicted to pop and sugar and can't go a day without it. 

He hinted at some of these issues earlier on in our relationship, but I only found out about the extent of these issues in the spring when I snooped through his email because I was suspicious he was hiding something. Our relationship has been strained, to say the least, ever since. I have a hard time trusting him because he lies to cover up his mistakes. I feel like his caregiver because I have to badger him to check that he didn't forget his wallet or force him to make phone calls. I don't want to continue to do this. 

His anxiety seems to get really intense around important events, and he has blown up at me a few days before every important event this year - including my graduation, which should be a very happy memory for me. It's not. 

I think most, if not all, of these issues are related to his untreated ADHD. He has a friend he grew up with who started taking Adderall a few years ago and says his entire life changed. He was finally able to focus and take care of the things he had been neglecting. I think my boyfriend would really benefit from drug therapy, but I'm not sure it would be safe to take with the marijuana and stimulant drinks. I'm not sure if he would have the self control to stop using them. He said months ago that he's interested in seeing a doctor and trying medication, but still hasn't made an appointment. 

I have tried to discuss a lot of these issues numerous times, but his reactions are volatile and he derails the conversation to avoid talking about it. He gets defensive and points the finger back at me for something unrelated. I try to steer the conversation back to the original topic, but he continues to bring up unrelated issues until I give up. We have never actually had a productive conversation about these issues that resulted in a plan or agreement. 

He has started to deal with his financial issues. He's seen advisors and lawyers, but he won't tell me the details. He's very ashamed of his situation. I want to remain hopeful that all of this can be fixed, but I'm terrified that the same pattern of behaviours will continue to bury him as his tries to dig himself out.

He is a grown ass man and I can't force him to get help. These issues have taken a huge toll on me and I'm not willing to put up with this for the rest of my life. I'm considering ending our relationship because I'm not sure that he's ever actually going to get help, or stick to a treatment plan. Currently, I'm a few days away from writing a professional licensing exam, and I had to cut contact because we had another blow-out fight - almost immediately after I told him that I couldn't cope with any extra stress before this very important exam. I told him I would contact him after I write the exam. 

I'm angry and resentful, but I still love him. I don't know what more I can do, or what I can do differently. Should I leave now? Is medication/treatment likely to help? 

TLDR; Boyfriend with untreated ADHD has financial, organizational, and mental health issues that are seriously affecting our relationship and my wellbeing. Continues to delay seeking treatment. Should I leave or is there still hope?",17Dec2018,1

I believe almost anyone can agree we would like to change the perception of and stigma behind mental illnesses. I have experienced the same in my own life and seen it in others. 

I do not fear confrontation. I am that friend that will look you in the eye and ask you “when was the last time you ate?” or “have you slept in the last month?” when we get the chance to talk one-on-one. 

I am also proud of openly saying, “I am a man of action.” Meaning that even at the risk of looking like a total idiot, or worse, figuratively stepping on my own dick- I would rather have done *something* rather than taking no action at all. I feel that inaction is too easy, and even if it’s harder to do it, often I hear a voice in my head cheering me, “Seize the moment!” 

Personally I can see a few outcomes to my actions, those being:

1) Feeling shame. (because people were “talking” about it)

2) Sincere appreciation. (because someone reached out and without judgement conveyed a message of community and understanding)

3) Feeling as if I’ve invalidated his emotions and experiences. ( YOU DON’T KNOW ME)

I just want to express in my letter that even though we are acquaintances- *that I’ve been there too. You’re not alone. It does get better, easier, and is worth it!!* 

Am I overstepping a limit that would be better if I don’t? 

Am I making a positive change in the world that I wish would have been there for me when I was surrounded by my darkest, most self-loathing thoughts?

Or am I figuratively putting my foot in my mouth and making a mistake that could possibly hurt a person I don’t really know?

Would this be considered helping to turn the tide of irrational stigma and depreciation felt by those who are suffering from a mental illness?

I would like to add that I have considered if they have been hospitalized it would be most obligatory to wait till they are not.

To jump right into it always start off making connections when your younger, you never know who that person will mean to you in the near future. I am currently 2nd year university studying trying to undergo my business degree. I must say it was an extreme jump for me getting into university from high school. It was a completely different scene with completely different people. I started off my first year thinking that I’m going to meets tons of people especially that I was living on residence... the outcome? I was wrong, I have never been lonelier in my life. I got to know all my floor mates, we would talk on a daily basis on basic stuff about life such as school and events happening nothing more. I became friends with a group of girls that were at first kind and very open minded but as time started to fly by, and they started meeting more people and more guys, and everyone around me started changing after gaining more experience from the “university life”. People started forming their own friendship groups and enjoying themselves, while I stayed in my room most of the day smoking pot and playing video games. At that point I have completely lost control of my life, I wasn’t interested in making new friends thinking that everyone has already created a connection with other people and we’re not open to meeting new ones. I eventually became depressed and didn't have any motivation to study or do anything other than lay on my bed and watch tv stoned. That’s when my marks started becoming worse and worse to a point where I got placed on academic probation. At first I was extremely terrified, only thinking of what my parents will think about how their son is a failure and not capable of achieving anything in life. Although my depression was still there and it didn’t make me care enough about the situation into seeking any guidance to the right track. I felt and still feel lost, here I am second year university taking 3 courses which I hope to get good marks on in order for my to improve my average and entering my program of choice. This year I feel that I have more control over my depression, I try to be as most outgoing as possible but still lacking. I have moved into a place with an acquaintance I have met first year. Notice I did not say friend because I wouldn’t categorize him under that since I didn’t know him that well at the time. We have now become closer, we have similar interests in career paths and we both share the hobby of blazing. I would say he is the closest thing I have to a friend in university. ",17Dec2018,1

Last year, I was admitted into in patient treatment for bipolar disorder symptoms. I completed my program and came back to my normal life. I did about 4 months of outpatient work after my 30 days. I had a therapist. Now I dont. 

Anyways......within the last 2 or 3 months I have started slipping back into a deep depression and things have slowly been falling apart.

So, my parents step in from time to time when I need a quick break. Lately, my mother has been stepping in to help more and more. 

The more help I get from her, the worse of a parent I feel like. And I feel like my family is going to try to take my son from me because I feel like I'm doing such a terrible job.

When I list things out, it looks like everything is ok, but I'm finding myself less and less capable of keeping it together when my son gets difficult to deal with.

Ar this point, I don't know if it's just the shitty depression voice in the back of my head or if I'm just actually a terrible mother. 

It's been about a half an hour since I've tried reaching out to the Crisis line and I've still gotten no response from a human being. I am so frustrated. ",17Dec2018,1

Its unhealthy and exhausting and dangerous for me! I work with patients who have schizophrenia and other illnesses and if one went off and my coworker wasnt awake or aware I'd be fucked. 

I love my job and enjoy my coworkers but I'm honestly hoping my boss let's me do this by myself or makes an adjustment where my help comes in at 5 and works till whenever. I'm just glad that my patients love me. ",17Dec2018,1
59,"It usually involves a somehwhat yet not plausible that someone stole something ,or that people are out to get me. It only happens when I’m like ten drinks in and never when I’m sober. I’m very smart, articulate, and I’d say socially I’m either in the 10-1% of people. Yet when intoxicated I get paranoid and apparently have false memories, that blow way out of proportion. I’m not sure why this happens but it is kind of scary. I’ve recently quit alcohol for good as well as weed, as I’ve noticed that my reasoning is profoundly effected by marijuana and alcohol. I cannot control my thoughts or actions on these substances. I have had extreme paranoia many times on weed , and large amounts of alcohol in particular. I feel like I may be developing some type of schizophrenia and I’m worried about what will happen in the future, if these symptoms persist, yet they are only there while on weed and or alcohol. I think I may have had my drink spiked a few times and it may have contributed. I’d rather not get into details but maybe just sole more information. I’m in no way a danger as I’d surely be hiding under a bridge if this ever happened again. Fearing for my life more like. I’m thinking I may have some sort of delusional disorder.

60,"Long story, but my mom has accountability issues and I’ve seen her deny reality, and be pretty overprotective or intruding. For instance, as a teen I remember she kept checking on us in the basement... I think I even remember her peeking down on her belly... from the top of the stairs?

My stepdad is probably a narcissist? He’s threatened me many times, even as an adult. He’s made off-the-wall comments and expressed sadistic behavior, mocking the teenagers who tragically ate tidepods and did other silly things.

I’m convinced my brother is a narcissist. He’s obviously never been diagnosed but apparently I’m a:

* Lazy piece of shit
* Too sensitive
* I don’t help the family out enough
* I’m depressed (as an insult)
* I sleep too much
* I have PTSD from my parents (he claimed, but I think it’s depression/anxiety associated with memories)
* My favorite, I make too many mistakes.

Now my brother and I have clashing personalities. I find he puts me down quite a bit. I can expand on my childhood too.

Long story short, he’s simply insensitive and blatant about it too. He’s even said:

&gt; I don’t really care about anyone really.

There have been times where he’s judging me, and I’ll get super angry and tell him to fuck off and it’s none of his business what I do, and he’s being insensitive. Other times he’ll judge and I’ll feel depressed and look for reassurance from my friends because I feel so bad.

I take pride in my empathy, and helping others gives me a warm fuzzy feeling. It honestly might be wrong of me to judge others who judge people? I know it sounds ironic... but I feel like people who judge others should be challenged in the truth of their statements... or they should just let people be.

Sometimes I’m condescending towards my family and express:

&gt; I mean that’s what family is for: to judge others and claim you know what’s best.

Anyway... I also have an anxiety disorder which causes me to ruminate, seek reassurance, ponder intrusive thoughts, etc. it’s not good... but it’s simply life. Sometimes my intrusive thoughts really worry me.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble.",17Dec2018,1
61,"Hi guys first time posting and I really don't know how to explain this that well.  Also sorry about the layout I'm posting on mobile. 

So I've dealt with depression in high school (I was bullied a lot) and that caused a serious dink to my self worth. It's been about six years, and a lot of positivity. 

I've just come home from university and I'm working as a host in a restaurant while taking some extra classes to supplement my degree and I've found myself going through insane mood swings. 
I can joke and laugh with the customers for my entire shift and then I come home and break down crying.  Today  was particularly bad and worrying to me. 

While lying down in bed I found myself fighting hard to resist a voice telling me to replace the mental pain with something physical. That voice has been getting louder and louder the last few weeks as well. 

I'm gonna talk to my parents about getting a therapist tomorrow. I really could use some advice on what to do when such a voice comes back. 
Thanks guys!",17Dec2018,1
62,"I’m a college student in the US, and I’ve been doing this for long enough that I know the end of the semester is always difficult for everybody. That being said, I feel like my mental illness makes the experience a thousand times worse every time.

In the past, I have been diagnosed with ADD, anxiety, depression, and very minor ASD. I also periodically suffer from insomnia. I see a really great therapist every week and I’m prescribed medications by my psychiatrist that help keep things in check. But during really stressful periods, like the end of an academic term, it feels like nothing works anymore. I become so overwhelmingly scared and so desperately unhappy that I just want to curl into a little ball and keep curling, tighter and tighter, shrinking myself down until I vanish into a single point.

This sort of thing always fucks me over. On the nights when I most need to get to bed on time, I can never fall asleep, and on the days when I most need to get up in the morning, I can barely pry myself out of bed. I rarely experience suicidal thoughts (and would never act on them anyways), but when I do get them, it’s almost always during this deadline-filled, end-of-semester rush. 

It’s so strange because I feel like I have my mental illness mostly under control during the rest of the semester. I have friends and I’m dating a really awesome guy. My professors seem to like me for the most part. Sure, things aren’t quite where I’d like them to be, but I’m definitely getting there. On paper, I’m doing much better than I was last year.

Or at least that’s what it feels like until the last few weeks of school hit me like a sledgehammer. At this point, there are only a few more days left, but it might as well be an eternity. I just hope I can pull it off.",17Dec2018,1

I used to box as that gave me a lot of pleasure, the feeling of going in the ring and not knowing whats gonna happen, winning, losing, all that rush. But I have never had any fun and dont even understand most of the stuff other people do. This came up during this wekend when me and my fiance went to my companies christmas party. We went to a concert, everybody was dancing, singing and looked happy and excited. It just doesnt do anything for me. I took out my phone to browse reddit and waited for it to be over. Then the party itself. Coworkers socialising, dancing, there was a proffesional photographer taking our pictures, a DJ. I just dont care about that and its actually annoying to me. This hasnt bothered me a tiny bit, I have been like this all of my life. I dont drink, dont smoke. I have allways hated loud music, clubs, concerts, large gatherings, parties. Well hate may not be the right word. I just dont care for them? I can be somewhere to the side, I like observing others. 

I have never been diagnosed with any mental dissorder. I have been in the military and gone through extensive tests, though I think they are overlooked mostly. 

All in all in order to feel happy I need a thrill, adrennaline and some serious stimulation. I feel best when Im closest to death if thats not over exagurating.

71,"I have always been the kind of person who is perceived as a ""weirdo"", for both behavioral and physical reasons. I have done research on many psychological illnesses but none of which that I found  seemed to suit my personality. Lets go through some of the many weird things that are going on with me..

* I lie on a daily basis and I don't even know why.
* I seem to lack emotions in some cases. A few days ago a somewhat close friend of mine passed away on a tragic car crash at a very young age. I am very surprised that this event has had no effect on me whatsoever. The same thing happened when my uncle, that I loved, passed away from cancer. However I think that I would be very sad if I lost my parents.
* I have hurt and tortured animals in my childhood, and I still occasionally do. It's an urge that comes out of nowhere for absolutely no reason, which I cannot control. 
* Other than animals I hurt myself too. I'm not talking about cutting myself with razor blades here. I rip off skin from my fingers on a daily basis, sometimes until I see red flesh. I've been doing it for at least 10 years and my fingers look like a mess. It is also an urge that comes out of nowhere like the previous case, but whats more interesting that I do it without noticing. Sometimes when I'm sitting and thinking while doing nothing else, I find myself ripping skin off of my fingers without even noticing it. Even when I do notice it its very hard for me to overcome this urge and stop doing it, despite the fact that it hurts.
* When I'm guilty, I blame others. If someone confronts me, I turn the tables around and make them feel guilty.

So after reading that you might be thinking to yourself that I might be a psychopath. I do in fact share lots of traits with a psychopath but there are a few very important reasons why I am not one. Firstly, I am not an arrogant person. I'm humble and do not like to brag. More importantly, I am very insecure. It is at a level where something as simple as a pimple on my face or a bad hair day can make me skip a day at university, even if I have very important classes that day.  

Secondly, I have high levels of anxiety and poor communication skills. When I'm anxious I cannot seem to be able to communicate at all. I start to forget and mispronounce words in my mother language. And the more mistakes I make while talking the more anxious I get. This continues until I feel so bad about myself that I end the conversation and leave immediately. Usually when this happens I start to avoid that person and never talk to him/her again. For instance if this happened while I was talking to a cashier at a supermarket, I would never go there again even if the next closest supermarket was miles away. 

So now that psychopathy is out of the way lets see a few more traits..

* I can spend days in my room without talking to anyone, including to my parents. I am most comfortable when I'm alone. I think the reason for which is the fact that there is nobody around to judge me if I do something wrong. And yes, I am afraid of judgement. This fear is so intense that I cannot stop thinking about what others think of me. However I do not mind being judged online by people I do not know and will never see. 
* I have sleeping issues. Even after a tiring day I find it very difficult to fall asleep.
* I have always had difficulties while describing my emotions, the same difficulty I am having right now while writing this. 
* I live far away from my parents but I never and ever miss them. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents. They have never treated me badly, there is nothing I can complain about them.
* I cannot easily concentrate.
* When I'm texting someone online, especially someone from the opposite sex, I tend to pretend to be someone else. That someone is usually the person I want to be.
* I never get offended and I rarely get angry.
* Matters that make other people angry or upset usually doesn't mean anything to me.
* I only have one friend, who is almost exactly like me. 
* My feelings can change at the blink of an eye. Currently I'm staying at a dorm room on my own, but before that I was at a rental house with a roommate. He has a really cute kitten, when I was staying there she was about 4-5 weeks old. I absolutely loved to pet her, but sometimes I hit, kick and punch her for absolutely no reason. It  wasn't something that I could control. At night when I failed to fall asleep I was thinking about how I could kill her and get away with it.

Finally I would like to state that the only things bothering me from the above are my insecurities and anxiety. I don't mind the rest.",17Dec2018,1
72,"So I'm sure this is fairly common. You're minding your business and suddenly you are ambushed by a horrible memory about a mistake you made or something you deeply regret or just anxiety starts bashing you about a scenario and how you totally screwed something up.... some times I just mumble something to my self like ""WHATEVER"" or even start singing to basically tell that thought to go away or drown it out by singing something positive. Sometimes it works, but sometimes it's not that easy. Sometimes these uncomfortable memories linger and I know the best thing to do is not worry about things I can't control that are in the past. I try and focus on how I can learn from those experiences, but sometimes this doesn't work either. It's like the memory is on repeat and every time it replays I see more things wrong with what I did/said or see more ways I might have royally messed everything up. It's the kind if feeling that can keep you up at night.

73,"I'm not talking about PMS or PMDD, I'm talking about full-on monthly psychotic episodes. How normal is it, and does anyone else experience it?

I don't really know what to do about it, but over the past year and a half it's manifested and has become an annoyingly regular fixture in my life.

It starts with the normal PMS symptoms. Very very slightly more emotional than usual, aches, etc.
But in the 46-78 hours leading up to it my mental state rapidly deteriorates into a pretty severe state.

It comes on quickly. One moment I'll feel perfectly fine, and the next I'm so disassociated I can barely stand up or recognise myself, I'm paranoid, I'm hallucinating, I'm having full-blown panic attacks, and I can hardly make sense of what's being said to me if I'm spoken to. I'm having a hard enough time even writing this. And the second my period comes? Gone. Poof. Back to normal. It resolves in under an hour or two.

75," 

I think this was the worst year of my life

I thought I found something special.

So I held onto it for as long as I could. I cherished her, I pushed myself, I made myself a fool.

I cried so much. I cried more than I ever have before. Almost everyday for a few months. The person who made me cry so much was the one thing I cherished so I kept putting myself through that torture. It was to be happy. I made myself depressed, so I could be happy. Do I even need to say more.

My mom started becoming senile. She’s on the beginning of losing her mind. 

I don’t even know if she’s a person. Nothing she does makes sense.

I don’t know what’s going on anymore. Mentally I’m lost.

I’ve been on my own this life. There was no father. This mother had lost her mind. 

I’ve been desperately submitting myself to find love in that place. I don’t know how to love. 

I’ve got not real friends. I just had that one girl who used me like a bag of blood. I can’t tell anyone how I feel. They all have their own friends.

I’m here alone. I’m here suffering. I did it for that girl. It was for that girl. 

Crazy mother raises crazy son.

Who would have thought.

Where am I now?

Cats who I try to put my love onto. They’re just cats. I love them but they are just cats, they aren’t my lover.

A screwed up relationship with that girl. I will just let go. If I love myself then I will let go. If I don’t love myself then I will learn to love myself then let go.

I need some real friends. I need friends who I can tell anything to. Who I can always call, who I can trust with my heart even though I’m a broken man. 

I’m a mess right now. I can’t wake up at the same time everyday. 

My life revolves around league of legends and just cutting it off for a week has turned me into a mental retard

I cling to habits and distractions because it’s all that I feel like I have. Dopamine? Really? Well okay then! Everything is great for one moment.

I’m so lost in this world that’s all I ever feel. I’m so lonely. I’m so sad. I’m a 23 year old virgin. I’m so ashamed.

I’m so broken. I just want to be killed so my shame can end. So I can just say okay life you beat me that’s all I had now please let me quit. But it keeps going on.

Why do I have to be such a loser. Why did I have to not find love. How can I? What do I need to do?

Am I ready yet? Where do I meet people? Can I even meet people if I’m so desperate? It’s so unsightly.

I’m so unsightly everyone says. I want to fit in but I’m unsightly. In the eyes of the people who say reality is stupid were all freaks, I’m unsightly. I just want to not be alone anymore. I just want to be rescued, to be saved. 

But I’m disgusting, I’m unsightly. I need to recover. I’m so sad. I’m so crushed. I feel so weak.

I am going to have a job next semester. There is pressure from myself to be strong. But after feeling that girl again I’ve become hurt again. She makes my life hell. Attracting me with honey, saying that she’s helping me, but never giving me a thing. I’ve been clinging to the idea of a fruit I can never have. I’m so twisted now to the point where I probably wouldn’t even feel upset about seeing someone die in front of me.

I feel like I’m at the bottom of the ocean stuck to the floor like an urchin. what do I do now? 

Love fucking hurts the most. 

To everyone I know I’ve just been putting on a face pretending to be happy.

The truth is I’m not. 

I’m miserable because I’m the biggest idiot imaginable and I’m not proud of myself.

I’m just really lonely and desperately want love but I’m so damaged now that I can’t do anything.

I’ll find someone nice. I’ll give myself structure. I’ll buy clothes, I’ll get rid of this acne, I’ll get a diet, I’ll make it easy to do, I’ll find help, I’ll take it slow, I’ll go to the gym every morning, I can run if I don’t want to.

77,"Hi everyone! The title says it all, but let me elaborate further. I have been qualified in the my country's top university (which I have been dreaming of since high school) but got in a program that I don't like very much (i.e. I can't see myself practicing Pharmacy in the future) for scholarship and financial assistance. 

Four months into the semester, I became anxious and depressed to the point of quitting and not taking the finals. I was too weak to do the paperwork and luckily my parent was there to help me through the long process of talking to several offices to sign such-and-such documentations. I have also checked myself into therapy prior to this decision (they gave me an SSRI--escitalopram oxalate). 

Living away from my family was the easy part--I knew how to take care of myself and am responsible enough to live on my own and with others. However, forcing myself into the program gradually emptied me from within. I started having panic attacks when I wake up, thinking that this is another day I have to endure. Soon, my anxiety morphed into depression. I no longer knew what was fun/relaxing and my priorities are askew. Throughout all these, I remained functional and responsible, albeit with occasional bouts of crying and morning panic attacks...until I just gave up. One day, after a series of breakdowns the night before, I had a major mental breakdown which consisted of me crying for hours on end while my mind is on a constant loop of rewinding my stupidity and worthlessness. I was only relieved when I finally admitted that I don't want to pursue this degree and I just want to rest.

That was 3 weeks ago. Now, I am at home trying to get better. However, every day still feels like hell because now I'm depressed due to regrets and my giving up the program means I have no concrete career path to get back to. Although my dropping out is just a Leave of Absence for the second semester, I still feel like shit and overall a stupid human being. I don't know what to do exactly with my life and I still have anxious and depressing thoughts that revolve around what career I should take as well as my being ashamed to admit that I stopped going to school because I was too weak. 

Hope I made sense, any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Freshman in dream school but not in the program I like, ended up anxious and depressed and dropped the 1st semester and filed a leave of absence for the 2nd. Now, I am depressed at home without a concrete plan for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Today is my first time posting something on this subreddit. I don't know anyone to talk to, so I decided that maybe you guys have some useful advice for my situation.  


So today is my birthday and my parents gifted me a USB-Stick. I am a college student and they thought that I could use it for some college related stuff.  
Seriously, I don't know why it bothers me so much but I am somehow kinda sad that that was the only gift they gave me. I know I sound like an ungrateful person right now and actually I don't care how much my parents spend on my birthday present but somehow it makes me sad (a quick note on the side: my parents are neither rich, nor poor so the reason they gave me this present is not because they couldn't afford something more expensive). I really don't know why this makes me so sad and I want to understand why.  
I mean they got me something at least and like I said it's not about the money...it's better than nothing.  
But somehow a voice in my head tells me that didn't give me something more valuable or more personal because they don't love me. I know it sounds ridicolous but I just can't get that thought out of my head.  
Maybe some of you guys can explain to me how these thought processes work and why I get these very bad and awful feelings altough I know they are far from rational. It just feels so stupid to complain to someone about something so insignificant...there are enough people on this planet that have actual problems. And yet, here I am complaining that my parents gave me a cheap birthday present.   
If anyone could maybe give me some advice how to stop believing in these irrational emotions I would be very thankful. I dont't want to spend the rest of my birthday (which I will spend at the University) with the thought in my head that my parents don't love me.",17Dec2018,1
79,"There are conversation subjects I can't participate in if they illicit an emotional feeling in me.  I literally choke up and can't speak. When watching TV, reading, whatever, and come across something designed to get an emotional response, mine is difficult to control.  This is rarely a sad or negative input.  In fact, most sad issues have little effect on me. Other than seeing old people in love struggle, most of my responses are from things like lost dogs being found and reunited. Now I can see something like that affecting me but also minor things like a Nike ad will lock me up.  I may be starting to be seen as avoiding people, or kinda shut down and not participating. In fact I'm simply trying to avoid bursting into tears. 

Years ago when this problem first surfaced, I went to a couple shrinks and was eventually prescribed Lexapro.  It worked great but due to a broken mental health system here and not knowing how to get more meds, I was forced to ween myself from them.  Now, my attitude toward the mental health system won't allow me to deal with them again, and this problem seems to be getting a little worse.  My question is wth is this? I'm not depressed really, the 'sadness' is more like the feeling of intense pride, but overwhelming.  Will Lexapro work if I can get it again? I heard once you get off of it, it doesn't work when you try again.  Just a rumor.  I tried a couple other antidepressants before Lexapro and they were all too intense with too many side effects.

Anyway,I think I may have schizophrenia or something like it, I have looked at the symptoms and I have a lot of them;

Ex: Symptoms I have are; Social Isolation, I really only go out once a week, unless my family makes me, I don’t go to schooled cause I panic a lot, I got bullied, and I would start crying out of no where and my chest would heart, I think they were panic attacks; 

Another is aggression, if I get mad I start yelling and my dad starts yelling back and I start to threaten him;

Agitation; I get agitated easily, sometimes when someone’s talking loud or touches me not even for a long amount of time it just gets me really mad and I have to leave before I blow up at him;

Hallucinations; I have been having them for awhile, sometimes I see stuff in the corner of my eyes, like someone is watching me, sometimes I see things look around a door just starring at me, I see bugs on the floor around me (that ones kinda rare for me it’s mainly human looking shapes.

Delusions; I am paranoid almost 24/7 (I am alone everyday for about 11-12 hours cause of my dads work, I always have my door close cause I hear sounds that I don’t know are real or if my cats did something (the one I knew outside my door doesn’t jump up on stuff and sleeps a lot and rarely meows so I don’t it’s him, (this should go with hallucinations but here is another thing) I always feel a presence outside my window like someone is stalking me, and I heard something crash outside my window at night. It my dad didn’t hear anything;

Speech, when I talk sometimes without realizing it I start to just mumble and I ask if I made sense and my sister would say no and I’d be confused why cause she didn’t say anything, (realized this after I recorded myself ranting once) not sure if it’s  because I talk kinda fast or what,

Last thing; i think this is more depression than anything but I for the last year or two have had the worst time trying to sleep but it may be because of the paranoid part, not sure.

I know this needs to be a medical diagnosis but i just want your opinions on what you think and how or if I should bring up this stuff to my counselor because he asked if I heard stuff but I lied and said I didn’t and I shouldn’t of but it was my first time doing something like that and I was scared.

81,"After years of being scared to go to see a psychiatrist (at the suggestion of multiple doctors in the past) I did, and was prescribed 10 mg Lexapro and .5 mg Ativan (both the generic versions if that matters).

I started Lexapro two nights ago. Night one I felt like I was in a fog until I went to bed. Strangely quiet and it felt like I was moving slow but I wasnt. Night two, I had pretty bad insomnia (which I got regularly before Lexapro, but this felt worse). I also was grinding my teeth a lot, something I've never done before. Woke up today (day 3), and my emotions feel so out of wack, I want to cry. My insides feel like guitar strings pulled too tight and will break at any moment.

86,"I dont know if this is the right subreddit for this, but I didnt know where else to go to, and I know this post is very long but please read it, I think my mental health is at risk but im not for sure.

Okay so for context I am 18 years old, I have a girlfriend (1 year), and I am in the first year of the IB program (yes I go to a nice school, and yes I am a very privileged kid). I have ADHD/anxiety and dyslexia. For those of you who don’t know, IB stands for International Bachelorette. I might have fallen into depression several times (as you will see later on) but i cant trust myself to think I did because there is always the possibility that I want/like to think I fell into depression, but it’s impossible to tell (because it is subconscious, correct me if im wrong because I don’t genuinely know).

(I don’t know how else to structure this so I am going to divide it into sections as can be seen below)

My girlfriend:
I love girlfriend, and she loves me, but I have serious trust issues because before we actually started dating, she did somethings with other guys/girls (sexually) and it haunts me. She also said some pretty bad things. Around 4 months ago I found out that she had lied about some things, and did even more than what she said she did (I didn’t even know half of it). Every day since about a month into our relationship I have involuntary thought about what she did. These thoughts are typically uncontrollable (although sometimes if I efficiently distract my self in time they go away) and completely spontaneous. Also, since I found out she had kept things from me and lied to me, its gotten worse. She has also lied to me on several occasions. This mixed with my anxiety...you can imagine its not fun. I might have fallen into depression. My girlfriend also has anxiety and has had a very difficult childhood, and yet I burden her with guilt from the past even though I hate to. She is very sorry about it and I wish I could just forget because I love her. I am also very self conscious and am constantly doubting myself. At the very beginning of our romance I was overweight, but I wanted her more than anything and wanted to be the best for her, and so I lost a lot of weight over two months (for those of you that want to know how: All you have to do is eat healthy and run like hell). Then once my excess fat was gone I had fairly defined muscles. By the time we were dating I had was in good shape, and very handsome (Im not trying to be cocky/cool/etc, its just part of the story). This lasted up until school started and I started gaining weight again. I am now more overweight than I was originally. This has to do with my girlfriend because it makes me doubt myself even more. I feel like shit compared to other guys and I feel like she wants other guys and wants someone who’s is attractive. I sometimes cant even be with her because those thoughts get into my head. I dont know if these are anxiety attacks or not, but sometimes when I think of the things that happened spontaneously, I cry uncontrollably. Sometimes I hyperventilate very briefly then cry. I can merely prevent this by taking many consecutive deep breaths.  She once suggested I could have a form of PTSD, but that sounds pretty serious.

My ADHD/Anxiety/Dyslexia:
I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was 7 years old, and when I moved my current school in Europe, I needed a new diagnosis to begin the IB program. So I went and got one and the results were fine and that was that. However, the diagnosis revealed evidence and symptoms of ADHD. We showed it to my school so I could get accommodations during exams and such because of the ADHD, but since I didn’t actually get a diagnosis for ADHD and only for dyslexia they didn’t allow it. Then the psychiatrist who originally gave me the new dyslexia diagnosis gave me a recipe for Concerta (methylphenidate) for the ADHD. So I went to the pharmacy and got it but the dosage was too low to have any effects, and to get a higher one and to prove to my school that I had ADHD, I had to go see “my own” psychiatrist. Correspondingly I went and got me a psychiatrist (don’t worry, he has high credibility) and he gave me a diagnosis. Turns out I do have ADHD and clearly show it and even stronger anxiety (he says its a dead giveaway). We meet for the second time with my parents and he said  that my anxiety must be treated first in order to treat my ADHD (he didnt say it had to be in this order but he said its the more effective). He also said that the treatment would last until next christmas (a year). So he gives me Sertraline (anti-depressants) and tells me to not change the Concerta dosage because taking the Sertraline and the Concerta at the same time is not recommended and overall not a good idea. I am in my second week of taking the Sertraline and I have been taking the Concerta for a month now, but still no effect from the Concerta apart from being less hungry throughout the day and less tired (as previously explained the dosage is too low have significant effects). The Concert also made me very very angry and frustrated. To put things into perspective: I almost broke up with my girlfriend three times. I fell into depression again. I had very intense arguments with my parents several times. (I live with my parents alone meanwhile my brother is in college abroad, and my parents and I have never understood each other and have always had conflict. I dont have an emotional relationship with them, so it was hard for them to believe I had ADHD and especially Anxiety.)

My IB so far:
I am one semester into my first IB year (out of two) and it is proving difficult and im pretty sure is adding stress. Sometimes I do good and get 5/7, 6/7, and sometimes even 7/7! But besides that I get 2/7 and 3/7 on most of my work. I think it is adding on to my stress and pushing me pretty far and im pretty sure the courses im taking are out of my league (two of my high level courses are Economics and History). Keep in mind that the IB is very difficult (SAT is a joke when compared to the IB).

My exposure to graphic content: 
As can be seen on my account, I am relatively new to Reddit, and so far I really really like it. I love how it works and the sense of community. So far everyone on this website seems to actually be functioning humans, meanwhile other platforms such as youtube and instagram typically offer pretty toxic/uncharming communities. One subreddit I somehow ended up on is one of those fucked up content subreddits (a lot of you now know where this is going). The content that I see is not so different from other videos/pictures ive seen on the internet, so I didn’t hesitate to watch any of the videos and now they dont even remotely bother me. On the contrary, I now watch more and more fucked up content and I in a sense want to find something that will scar me. Its like im testing myself to see how much I can handle, even though everything I see ends up having no impact on me. I wonder if this is turning into something else. (for those of you who are going to freak out in the comments, its out of curiosity, I dont get off to it). Although I have to admit, I dont feel like this is affecting my mental health, but you never know. Also, this all started around the time I got my anti-depressants and I have gradually been getting less and less sleep (last night I was up until 3 am trying to sleep, woke up at 5 am, then at 6 am, then at 7:30 to go to school).

And finally, my concern:
When I tie all of this together I feel like I could be seriously damaging my mental health. I dont know how to tell because at the same time I feel fine. With all of that being said, is my mental health at risk?

Lasts just a couple minutes. Unfortunately, very often in the morning I wake up crushingly depressed for a time. Ruminating like crazy. lasts usually 15-30 mins and no longer then 2 hours. I have to get up for work or other obligations as early as possible just in case. I've even developed a kind of mantra to remind myself that it will pass and that it's just what my body/brain feels that it needs to do for some reason. So I let myself not feel bad about laying motionless , unblinkingly staring at the ceiling. Then eventually it's gone. This happens anywhere I sleep and I've not always even had a bed or room. Fortunately the euphoria is more common and the morning depression, along with most of my other mental quirks didn't start until I was about 14-15. 
I actually feel like I've got this one in check though. I'm getting really good at recognizing it for what it is and riding it out. But I wanted to share this with everyone in case you experience something similar. Also Ive always wondered what the pre sleep euphoria is from.

I have a friend who i have noticed have moods swings. Some days hes good and sociable and some days he doesnt want to talk..

Id ask if hes ok, and Id get the usual “im fine.”

Unfortunately, in november the latter has been more frequent. Hes been a bit snappy and just antisocial to the point where he himself has told me he doesnt want to talk anymore (through text-long story). I have never said anything offensive. This coldness started IMMEDIATELY after we had a good day together (absolutely no signs of him disliking me...especially considering how he was jolly and a lil touchy with me on that day)

I sent him a text about how i noticed the mood swings and how he can still talk to me if he needs someone - eventhough he said he doesnt want to talk anymore. And how if he doesnt want to talk to me, then talk to someone because bottling things are bad. Got no response.

He has mentioned before that his family has financial troubles. He also seems panicky about finding a job - its been two weeks since he finished college. 

Could he be going through something that makes him cold? Could he have stress/anxiety/depression due to the above reason? And probably some stuff I dont know?

In no way am I self diagnosing, this is just the closest thing to what I’m experiencing.

•I experience impulsive behaviour and problems controlling emotions
-I have incredibly sudden mood swings where I’ll be feeling excited and then absolutely nothing, this makes me rly irritable and I snap at my mum and my mates and it’s really uncalled for and so sudden.

•My relationships so far are intense, unstable and short, I obsess over the person and I’m terrified constantly of them cheating on me or leaving me and it ruins them every time.
I then blame it on them and then a week later I blame myself and I apologise, then I blame it on them. During this time I can’t describe it other than disassociation. I feel extremely jealous of them and when they say anything in person or in text I always overthink it and make the stupidest decisions and responses.

I’ve hurt people emotionally in my life that I promised I’d never hurt, all because I believed something I thought about or someone else told me and never backed up

When I’m passionate about things I’ll randomly just feel so bored and empty about it all and just wait days to feel good again.

I’ve been to therapy for my anxiety but it only helped a little bit, now everything feels like it’s falling apart again. I keep believing I’m a good person but I’ve hurt so many people for no reason and it feels justified until I’m told the reality, like today. I’ve said things about someone I believed cheated on me, they never did and they truly liked me and I’ve hurt them.

96,"To preface, I also posted this on the veterans subreddit but it was flagged for being related to suicide and mental health.


So a little backstory: I met my best friend in elementary school. Our friendship has survived numerous ups and downs, but he is ultimately an extra brother to me. I've even grown close to his younger brother over the years and consider him one of my closest friends as well. We've literally experienced everything together and he's usually the 1st person I share any important news with. We both ended up joining the military but took different paths. I enlisted active duty Marine Corps right after we graduated high school. Then a couple years later he went into the Army National Guard when college just wasn't doing it for him (I never let him live it down haha). Lo and behold, I never deployed overseas and he did.


When he returned from his deployment (Camp Buehring in Kuwait, he said he didn't see combat), he spent a lot of time alone and drank everday. I was stationed in NC at the time and only saw him when I'd come home on leave so I was unaware of the extent. I'd still talk to him everyday whether it was playing video games online together or just texting. After finishing my time, I went to college down there, found a good job back home, and moved back. So all in all I was away for 8 years total. I've been out of the Marine Corps for over 4 years and he's been out of the National Guard for about 2.


Last week he had a bit of mental break and he's currently in a behavioral health facility trying to figure this shit out. He lost it for a couple days and ended taking a significant number of pills with alcohol then called the suicide prevention hotline. PTSD, depression, anxiety, alcoholism are all words that are being thrown around right now. I'm no professional, but my suspicion is that it's a combination of the above. He's supposed to be released in a couple days.


Most of his family is moved away but he's got his fiancee, brother, myself, and my wife still here. We have other friends here, but he only wants select people to know. He's still close very close with all his family, but there's only so much they can do being half the country away. We all care about him deeply and want to help him get through this tough time.


How can we best help? How can his fiancee prepare their home (there is guns, pills, and alcohol in the home)? What's his best course of action as far as the VA? Should we not leave him alone for very long periods of time?

The pharmacy would not fill the Adderall prescription for some legal reason, but did give me a 5 day supply. No big deal I'll just ring up the doctor. I left a voicemail and he called back within a few hours saying he would get it straightened out. This was surprising because he's always been hard to get a hold of.

Next day I sent an email and left another voicemail to see if he had an update for me. No response. After repeating this process for the next few days I went to his office. I didn't expect him to be there, but he shares office space with some other medical group. I ask around and two people agree to relay my contact info.

I honestly don't know where else to post this. 
I'm 19 year old female and feel like I need help. I'm currently taking a year off before college since I didn't get into any courses this year. Recently graduated high school and I don't know how to fix my life. I have depression and anxiety + undiagnosed adhd I'm pretty sure. I have tried to get help when I was 15 after my suicide attempt, but it didn't last. I was put on Zoloft but my mother quickly stopped giving me my meds after I showed progress. Later I was put on sleeping pills to help my insomnia but she took that away pretty quickly as well. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my mother more than anything in my life. But she's the pure definition of a ''helicopter parent'' and thus feels like anytime I muster up the courage to talk about my mental health, she tries to pin it onto a single problem. Like: ""It's just high school, it's not gonna last.'' ''You're just sad because you had a fight with a friend.'' And more recently: ''You're just sad because you didn't make it into college this year'' 

What I'm trying to say is, I WANT to get help, I WANT to feel better. But I have bad anxiety, plus my doctor is good friends with my mother, so if I went without telling her all hell would ensue.

I feel happy when talking to people and I enjoy doing things, just not that much as other people. I'm 16 and male, I've always been like this. I have a girlfriend, we've been together about 4 months and I really believe she loves me but my emotions for her are muted. I know I like her, it's just I feel an attraction but it's not that strong, and it's never been strong for any crush I've ever had since I got out of elementary school. She's offered me sex, but I find an excuse, because 1) I hate my body, 2) i feel like im gonna mess up the relationship, it'll hurt her more if we have sex first 3) have very little feelings of sexual attraction, i'm attracted to her more than anyone else, but it's still not strong at all. Overall, when people die, I barely feel sad, when people get hurt, I feel almost no remorse. My girlfriend lost a close family member a little while ago and I felt a little bad for her, but barely. I try my best and usually succeed at being a good person, but that's only because of the way I was raised, if I was raised in a worse home I'd be a terrible person.

108,"PTSD is caused by exposure to a single traumatic event, such as robbery, military combat or a serious accident. With appropriate treatment, full recovery can happen.

Complex-PTSD typically occurs after prolonged, repetitive interpersonal traumas. These traumas build layer upon layer in the brain and body. 

Due to the nature of C-PTSD being rooted in events such as childhood abuse, domestic violence, it is often inescapable, especially for younger victims.

Unlike PTSD, C-PTSD affects the development of psyche and how we perceive the world around us. Recovery can be a lifelong journey, but there should never be shame attached. ",17Dec2018,1

i (21f OCD/PTSD/GAD/SCD) have been feeling really sad lately. but it's not just sad. the sadness that i feel is so immense and intense that i can physically feel the sadness weighing me down. the thought of wanting to end it all is almost always there, though it's not something i have any intention of acting on. i just feel like a burden to everyone and it would be better off if i wasn't here - i just feel like i inconvenience everyone with my mental issues. i had a huge mental breakdown yesterday and tried breaking up with my boyfriend because of it. i feel bad that he chooses to be with me, and i figured he would be so much happier if he didn't have to deal with me. he of course knew the intentions i had when i brought it up and he managed to bring me back down from wherever i was, but i feel like i keep hurting him because of how i am. i started lexapro recently after a failed trial with zoloft. i can't tell if i'm spiraling out of control because i'm having a true depressive episode, or if it's my medication. i feel lost, hopeless, sad, and i don't know how to deal with it.

it's just so hard going through my daily life when i can physically feel the full weight of my depression weighing down on me. i'm having panic attacks at least once a day now, and this has been happening for the last week. i just needed to get this off my chest. i feel like i can't bring any of this up with my therapist, because any mention of wanting to end my life in any way will result in me being involuntarily hospitalized. i get that, but i really 100% do not have any intentions of acting on it, and i do not need to be taken away from my friends, job, or family for a certain period of time. that would only make things worse for me. just needed to let it out. i feel like i'm going crazy.

I have diagnosed anxiety and depression, but I've been adamant on not using medication (just a personal preference, I'm glad they work for a lot of people!). I've told my doctor this a lot.

Now, I've an somewhat healthy life but I still face mild depression, low motivation, helplessness and impulsive thoughts once in a month or so. Now, when I think about it I feel that either these feelings are the post Schizophrenia symptoms or I am just being lazy.

So I've been worrying about one of my best friends lately and so has all of my other friends.
She has been really down lately: she doesn't laugh or smile at all, she is always silent and keeps everything to herself, she is always studying and she has gotten really really skinny (she used to be skinny but it's gotten unhealthy looking). 
But the thing is that she has always been super fun, always saying dumb jokes and a havinh a great sense of humor in general, she was also the most social person of my friend group. But since the begining of this year (highschool senior), so like for 4 months I haven't seen her laugh even once.
I'm not a doctor and I'm not trying to diagnose her or something but I've been worrying and I want to help her because I truely care about her. I don't know what I can do to make her smile again.

128,"So over the past while (year or so) I have noticed a... decline of sorts in my decision making. I was diagnosed with ADHD last December and was medicated for a bit but because of the side effects of the meds I weaned myself off.

I still have anxiety/depression. I started working a first real job out of school and now it's like I am absolutely paralyzed when it comes to making decisions. When I do make a decision, it is heavily criticized and this makes me not want to make important decisions, so I try to avoid tasks where I don't have to make important decisions.

This is an even bigger blow to my ego, because I've always prided myself on my intelligence. At work I am made to feel like a complete moron and don't feel like I am very smart anymore. Even the guys who were hired on at the same time as me (in June) from the same class are making really important decisions and are being tasked with very important projects while I am... not. I'm not even asked by the team lead to really help with anything--he asks the other guy who is excelling at the stuff to help him instead of me.

I am not sure if anxiety/depression can cause this kind of decline in decision making/logical thinking, but I was wondering if anybody has experienced something similar? I am in computer programming and am starting to feel like maybe I'm just not smart enough to be a programmer. That being said, I did do very well in school (80s - 90s), but in the real world I am failing hard, and it is very taxing emotionally, and mentally.

**Cut to the past 2 weeks**: I have been weaning myself off of Zoloft (100mg) by slowly halving the dosage, the ""weaning"" process was one recommended by my DR.

I've started eating high protein foods such as chicken, fish, eggs, cheese, milk, tofu, soy, peanuts, turkey, pumpkin/sesame seeds, &amp; even some chocolate. Some supplements/vitamins I've started taking are iron, B6, B2, B5, ginseng, C, magnesium, SAM-e, 5-HTP, L-Tyrosine, L-theanine, E, zinc, and folate (most of which are in a daily multivitamin). Some other changes I've made are decreasing/eliminating sugar and caffeine intake.

Since making these changes, which I feel are minimal, I have felt free and positive! Those words would not describe me AT ALL if anyone were to know me in the past. A lot of things have become so much better since being off of the medications also... no dry mouth, loss of appetite, NSFW dysfunctions, etc.... If I would've known that I could do this years ago I definitely would've chosen this path over the medical one...

Like I stated in the disclaimer in the title, please consult your DR if you want to make any changes in your diet/medications. Just wanted to give a little insight that may or may not help others struggling with the same situation. Good luck in whichever path you decide to go on, as everyone is different &amp; needs different things.

If you want to learn more about the diet/supplement changes you can make to naturally help you mental state please do some research, it helps so much!!! &lt;3 thank you for taking the time to read this post!",17Dec2018,1
142,"This past week my partner attempted suicide. This is the second time in about 8 months, so this time she has been sent to an impatient hospital. Thankfully the place she's staying is super lovely and all the people who work there are giving her the support she needs. 

We were talking on the phone tonight, having a general talk about how we can improve a huge range of things in our day to day life. One of these things is that I can be quite distant, sometimes for pratical reasons; I'm in my final year of my degree and I'm busy, and for other reasons too; a lot of my interests aren't very social (watching films - something she's not interested in doing a lot of the time and reading) and generally I've always been quiet and somewhat anti-social. Of course, I'm totally up for looking at this behaviour and trying to change to make her feel less lonely. 

But, I'm really struggling to navigate the situation. 

1) I've struggled to change this behaviour before, having alone time isn't a nice luxury for me but feels like a necessity. I can feel frustrated, panicky and irritable if I don't get enough alone time. I dread days that are completely filled, knowing that I won't have my own space, even if the day planned is filled with things I enjoy. 

2) This behaviour feels so central to who I am and linked with what I find worthwhile (most of the things I enjoy doing I prefer to do alone/can only be done alone) 

3) If I actively try and change this behaviour it seems to only make it feel worse. I feel more frustrated and irritable. It feels forced and fake. 

4) She identified her feeling lonely at home as a big reason that has lead to this attempt and knowing that that is my fault is so awful and I feel guilty and despairing but also frustrated and angry. 

5) I have no one I can really talk to about this. I don't feel safe talking to her while she's in recovery, my family will be too defensive and feel angry that she's said that I'm partly responsible. 

6) Sometimes I don't want to be around her. I love her so much, but she can be difficult and cynical and, considering she's the person I spend the most time with, I need a break sometimes. And because she's ill and I know I need to be supportive, I don't feel like I can communicate this in a healthy way. 

7) I feel frustrated that she feels like I'm not doing enough. Of course, I know that there are always things that can be better. But knowing how much I've sacrificed, how much I look after her. The house work, food shops, cooking, walking the dog, sorting out bills, managing her medication etc. is left to me because she is far too ill atm. And I have to fit this with my work for my degree. But when I write this out I feel like such a lazy shit, and I hate myself for complaining because I know how ill she is and she's clearly suffering more than me. 

I'm definitely going to see a professional, I just need to wait for doctors apppintments etc and that might take time. I'm just freaking out a bit. 

Any advice will be greately appreciated, I probably won't be able to reply to any comments, everything is just so hectic atm. But I'll thank you in advance. X",17Dec2018,1
143,"(i’m on mobile so sorry for formatting)
whenever my room isn’t the way i left it, i have a severe panic attack. hyperventilating, tears, the works. i also tend to get overwhelmingly interested in self harm
i was diagnosed with major depression a while back and am currently on zoloft. i’m generally happy as can be, but fuck man, does this make me angry. 
i don’t even know what comes over me; it’s happened for years and i’m afraid it’ll follow me when i go off to college.
would there be a med for this? or should i go back to CBT?",17Dec2018,1
144,"Recently I've had a short stint of anxiety and depression in constantly reading negative news (primary news sources for me are r/news and r/worldnews), and the gloomy news puts me down. Recently I've tried waning off of it, but to feel a really strong, intrusive compulsion to read the news everyday, even when I know I'll come out of it feeling bad.",17Dec2018,1
