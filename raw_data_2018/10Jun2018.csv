Unfortunately I have not been a good employee due to my suicidal ideation and severe issues with body dysmorphia. I've been showing up late, unkempt, and unwell. I just stare into space throughout my shift and feel guilty about it. 

I need help, I need help, I need help. My lease is up in two months and for better or worse the only solution seems to move back to my hometown as nobody cares about me out here and I'm languishing.

I've been hiding it for years, I've attempted on my own life twice. Today I finally broke down and told my Mom everything, about the stress of moving away and coming home a failure, the brainwashing my ex put me through so i wouldn't get help and eventually leave, watching my friends pass away around me and wishing I could have gone first, all of it. 

I'm getting help, she's taking me to our family doc for some light antidepressants until I can find a regular shrink/psych. I've been keeping a Daylio journal for a couple days, so hopefully that'll help even more later on. 

*Point of this post:* I uuuh. I don't really know what to expect. I've been broken for so long. My mom said when she started her medications, it was like she never really knew just how bad it was until she experienced normality. I'm worried that I'll get a taste of that, and like my ex said before, I'm gonna run out of funds one day and I won't be able to get a refill and I'll be worse than before, having seen Heaven through the gates and all. Can you relapse on health the way drug addicts do? Any advice about coping, readjusting, just how to be normal, is welcome.",10Jun2018,1

Everytime I hear someone smart and wealthy with smart friends kill himself, I am hit by misunderstanding. The 3 treatments saving the most desperate people with the highest and quickest probabilities of success are #Ayahuasca, #Iboga, #Vipassana. #SpreadTheWord
If they are too lazy for Vipassana. What do they have to lose taking the most powerful #Psychedelics ? lose their life? If they don't take them they kill themselves anyway ... I'm shocked how, still today the ""so-called doctors"" or ""health practitioners AKA businessmen"" are so incompetent on this topic and reduced to #Obscurantism by the #Government and #BigPharma, forbidding them, to study or even talk about it under threat to revoke their license. Forbidden to do their job. Forbidden to #HelpPeople. These 3 #treatments don't finance Big Pharma so once again the financial incentives are not there to help people. Anyone supporting this policy kills and torture thousands of #Veterans, #Americans or #Allies and millions of people all over the world. Customs stealing their medicines and policemen putting in jail their medicines suppliers. While these people are desperately trying to get their human right for treatment to get back to #society, #jobs, #taxes . The system is fighting against them and their recovery. #Sickening  If you need help or know someone who needs help. Message me. All drugs/medicines made illegal by #WarOnDrugs #Nixon #Politics #BigPharma were not made illegal by medical research. We still have not enough scientific data to conclude much since 1980 because getting more scientific data on these medicines is #illegal #Worldwide ! As we keep seeing people taking Big Pharma drugs with very low probabilities of success for years (backed by studies showing low success rate) while losing their mind and hurting themselves and their families... Locking up these people in a system which is their cell until they hang themselves ! #FeelingProud #StoneAge #AnthonyBourdain #RobinWilliams #ChesterBennington #Avicii #Depression #PTSD #Trauma #FuckMorons Preaching #Hate #Suicide

6,"I'm going to use the pseudonym ""Max""

I will start off by saying I know Max is not a psychopath. In most situations, he's very empathetic. He's really sensitive to embarrassment himself and whenever he sees another person in an embarrassing situation, he gets really upset and sometimes defensive for the other person. He also has always talked about wanting to grow up to be a doctor or minister or some other field that involves helping people. He doesn't steal, he's as honest as the next kid, really doesn't like getting in trouble, etc.

Max always has seemed to be on an emotional rollercoaster. He had terrible separation anxiety in early childhood and had tantrums and meltdowns beyond the typical age. Around 8 years old, he got so upset, he attempted to strangle himself with a belt. His mother heard him crying in the bathroom and walked in and he admitted to what he was doing.

Around 9 or 10 years old, he started getting aggressive. He used to repeatedly hit his dog with sticks for no apparent reason. He'd squeeze, shake, and throw his pet hamster. He has stopped doing it and later expressed a lot of remorse but never gave any explanation. Around this time, he was also very bossy and controlling with his friends. He didn't have very great social skills and often would become physically aggressive with his friends when he was frustrated with them. Not sure where he learned any of this from. His parents never punished him physically. There is no history of abuse.

He's now 12 years old and his social skills have improved a bit. He's less aggressive towards his peers. However, it's come to light that he's been burning himself with the tip of a hot glue gun and cutting himself with broken disposable razor blades for at least a year. He has far fewer tantrums but he still cries kind of easily.

What is going on? Anything I see online about children harming animals has to do with Conduct Disorder or being a psychopath. That description really doesn't fit him. He just seems like such an emotional rollercoaster.

7,"I'm about to actually commit to therapy. (I've said this before and not  followed through but anyway...) Just here to vent. I've had 2 intense mental breakdowns within the last month or so... I typically have mild ones every once in a while, it goes like this: New Low &gt; Rude Awakening &gt; Attempt at Recovery &gt; Loss of Motivation &gt; Rinse and Repeat. These last two involved being physically ill and manic emotional instability so it's scaring me more than usual. My deal is social anxiety/ inexplicable emotional instability that resulted in years of self-isolation and emotional repression that is finally coming out into the open.  I am deprived of and addicted to romantic human connection. I never seem to get enough sleep. My thoughts run wild and turn to a gun to my head more often than I can count. (Never attempted suicide just anxiety about the fact that I might, or might secretly want to.) I take every slight as a personal insult to my character. I'm ashamed that I feel this way after such a comparatively easy life. I abuse alcohol for social/emotional reasons (who doesn't though??). I lean too hard on my friends for support.

I am hoping it is cancer and I can turn down treatment. I don't really want to be here and am not actively suicidal but if I have a potentially terminal illness I want to embrace it. I am tired. I am so tired. Life has been exhausting and the joys - like my husband - have been violently torn from me. ",10Jun2018,2
9,"Just wondering because it seems that many mental health problems (such as depression in my case) are diagnosed and prescribed medication mostly based on behavioral symptoms and history rather than with physical tests. I can understand that once doctors see enough patients with it they can probably make guesses and diagnosis based on similar patterns in behaviors and symptoms.... but at the same time I don't believe I'm the only person with a mild bit of hesitation towards medication like antidepressants who would feel a bit ""better"" if there was a physical test involved to give positive assurance that I actually do need the medication.  Also because there are sometimes other physical things that can cause depression like symptoms, so it would also clarify that, too.  


I'm Googling for things and not really finding anything. I see that there are neurotransmitter tests for measuring serotonin and such but this is taken from the blood, saliva, or pee and some researchers have seen that sometimes that doesn't correlate with the levels in your brain and therefore is inaccurate.  


Obviously I'm no doctor, and probably sound like a smart ass for bringing this up at all...but if anyone has any knowledge in this I'd really like to know.    


Thanks in advance.

10,"I am posting to see if there are other people who have my same behavior and to seek advice on how to overcome it.

So as the title say I am literally paranoid of everything in this life but in particularly diseases and catching things that can affect my health or living situation.

I am paranoid in a way that i would even skip handshaking with someone if ill believe i can catch something from him/her or even to stand in front of him/her and breath the air they release.

Earlier in my life I even was afraid to be in a relationship cuz i was already predicting the future and what will happen between us since it can make me catch some diseases like hepatitis, herpes or any other kind of disease or STD. (This got changed by now since I got married)

The problem that I am thirsty for information related to everything of the human body and the diseases we can catch so I continuously read and learn about a lot of diseases and HOW they can make their way into our body and that's what keep making my stat worse, the more i know the more I am paranoid of people.

I avoid drinking from the same cup after anyone even my family neither eat from the same plate or even to taste something after them (I know they are clean and i trust them but they can get things from peoples around them and like that its gonna be like if i trust peoples around them and the peoples around the peoples around them which will not be possible)

I know all what I am doing is wrong as it's making my life hard as hell but if I don't do so i don't feel calm and I can even spend a month thinking if I caught something for just drinking water after someone.

My main fear is about to things related to skin diseases, diseases that will deprive me of dopamine giving by my mind (as sex or drinking) and things that leads to certain death within a limited time.

My worse fear are : 1\- HIV (as it will lead to certain death knowing that i can't afford living on treatment as it is very expensive) 2\- All kind of hepatitis (as it will deprive me of drinking from time to time which is something i really enjoy) 3\- Virtiligo and warts (I have a huge fear of those two)

Bonus: I am dying of paranoia of cancer ( its very common in my family, a lot of member in it died and keep dying cause of it) and I am almost sure if I won't catch HIV or died in an accident i will die from Cancer.

Feel free to tell me if you have one or all those fears as me, Ill be so thankful for and advice on how to live safely without this paranoia cuz it is tiring me so much and finally I apologize cuz of my bad English.",10Jun2018,2

12,"Hi everyone, 
So I had been doing well for a while, most likely had a manic episode as I was wired all the time and euphoric and motivated to do a million things but now I think I’ve crashed. 
I’m diagnosed bipolar, ocd and have generalized and social anxiety. 
I take 5mg of Abilify, 150mg of Lamictal and Klonopin to manage anxiety. I feel like my medicine isn’t working anymore and I’m scared because I don’t want to spiral. 

I’m currently applying for a job and waiting on a call back after my interview. I was really excited about this opportunity but now I’m so depressed and anxious about it. I don’t know how I’m going to manage a full time job, full time school and keep my bipolar from preventing me from it. I’m afraid I’ll crash and hit a depression and not be able to function or perform correctly. I catch myself slightly hoping they’ll just reject me. I need the job bad and it’s great experience for my career field (psychology). I just don’t have the motivation to do it for a long term period, and I’m so scared it’ll interfere with my mental health. I guess I’m kinda just ranting, but this depression and anxiety is really getting to me. I don’t know if anyone else feels this way, but I just feel like my illnesses won’t let me succeed or live a proper life. I’m not suicidal for once, but I don’t want to get out of bed or talk to my friends or eat. I can’t stop crying and my OCD won’t let me stop thinking about things over and over and over again I feel like I’m going insane. 
I feel like I have no one to be here for me and that I’m just annoying with my constant need to talk about the same thing over and over and have panic attack after panic attack. 
I really don’t know where I’m going with this, but I just wanted to get this all out there somewhere. I just feel like I’m losing it and nothing can fix me. ",10Jun2018,1

**Bizarre Dream Phenomena**

As a child, around the age of like 8 (so about 2006ish) I used to have nonsensical nightmare occasionally and I would wake up either crying or really disturbed/mentally-drained. And they happened less frequently for a few years until I eventually moved houses at the age of 13. I'd say this happened like 8 times maybe in my life but I never figured out why.

Examples:

- A circle infinitely falling down a page with two closing in on it but doomed to never meet it and I felt like I desperately had to escape the dream before the lines met it.

- Furniture or something spiralling into the centre of a bowl-shaped plate. We had some when I was a kid with plaited light red colours on the corners.

- I'm in a white space and a mysterious not so pleasant figure has asked me to do deliveries to different lines with houses in the end but it feels like the house numbers will never stop and I can't keep track of them and it's mentally draining.

*Can I induce these bizarre dreams:* **No.**

**Visual Hallucinations**

Also I remember feeling like everything was bigger and closer to me in the room as if the room had somehow become smaller for this effect to occur (this still happens to me but very rarily).

*Can I induce these visual hallucinations:* They often accompany the auditory ones but no, and they usually happened close to bed time.

**Auditory Hallucinations**

And as a child I would hear voices. The voices were incoherent and they were usually shouting at each other it seemed and it felt like they were distant/in the background so I couldn't make sense of them or maybe I was purposefully tuning them out. 

*Can I induce these auditory hallucinations:* Not anymore. But as a kid if I listened to a recording of voices on 2X speed even if only for a few seconds, I can hear similar voices in my head but they're not necessarily angry, it's just more like they're talking in slow motion so their voices are distorted.

**Current status:**

This had all definitely stopped when my family moved houses when I was 13, except the visual thing which came back here and there and I think maybe the auditory stuff came back once or twice too. I'm not sure if moving houses is related to it.

**Questions**

Was I mentally ill as a child but now I'm miraculously cured and have magically grown out of it? Or is this stuff normal and I'm thinking too much about it? I've never really told anyone about this so I'm curious.",10Jun2018,1
16,"Depression.It’s heavy, but you know that. I mean, you’ve been told that at least. They’re not wrong though \- the royal they. Depression feels like you’ve been swallowing one penny each day throughout the past 13 years with the inability to digest the copper or zinc pieces. They’ve piled up over the years in the most sublte way. They’ve collected in every corner of every organ. The weight grew slowly enough to go unnoticed, until you became so heavy that you couldn’t get out of bed. The worst part being the realization that it’s the thousands of pennies limiting your movement, pressing against your lungs, immobilizing your legs, yet you continue to ingest your daily dose. You begin to understand that this is slowly killing you, but each morning, you simply swallow. It’s a cycle, really. One that people who have never eaten pennies can never truly understand. It’s not that I want people to know what this kind of heavy feels like. No one should have to feel the weight of the world crushing their chest 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It’s just nice to talk to someone, anyone, who might be willing to acknowlege the invisible mass that you carry.    

And I don’t know what’s worse \- the crippling physical pain, chronic exhaustion, and constant discomfort, or the terrifying images, the mental fog, the nonexistent attention span, and the normalization of unceasing suicidal ideation. Maybe the physical isn’t worse than the mental. Maybe they both just fucking suck.    

When people talk about not being able to “see” mental illness, they often forget about the physical toll that is can take on one’s body. From sore nailbeds due to unconscious nailbiting to ongoing, seemingly unexplicable back pain. From a nagging headache to throbbing wounds painted on the surface of what was once untouched, untainted skin. And what happens when a person loses their appetite? Their body ceases to remind them that it requires nourishment to function, resulting in lower energy, decreased concentration, and the elimination of whatever motivation may have remained.    

When people think about the big, bad, scary D word, I think they try to find similar states or feelings that they have experienced in order to relate, which is okay. Depression isn’t sadness though. Here’s what’s scary \- sadness is normal, depression is not. Sadness is an emotion that all humans experience. Typically, a person feels sad about somthing. And just as the pain of a skinned knee fades, so can the feeling of sadness that comes with it. While depression may ebb and flow, it does not naturally disappate as the bruises do. Depression sits with you and affects many, if not all, aspects of your life. When a person feels sad, they may not be hungry in the moment, but their appetite will lead them to a meal eventually. When a person is depressed, that hunger, and basic desire for nutrients may never surface. When a person is sad, a good joke, a hug from a friend, or the passing of time may turn their mood. When a person is depressed, those aforementioned things appear petrifying. When a person is sad, participating in a menial task may take their mind off of the feeling. When a person is depressed, their mind feels broken. When a person is sad, they may think, “this is hard,” while unconsciously wondering what they will be doing later in the evening. When a person is depressed, it feels impossible to imagine any semblance of a future.    

I think the hardest part to explain to people is the following thought, “I can just kill myself.” This has always been my alternate, my Plan B, my on deck, my just in case. I’ve kept this option in my back pocket, comforted by its presence. In my mind, this was normal. I thought suicide was everyone’s back\-up plan. When the world got too brutal, pull the rip cord. I recently learned, after asking a friend, that this thought process is indeed abnormal. Taking her own life has literally never crossed her mind. It has not been a fleeting thought in a time of great pain. It has not been a sense of relief during her darkest momenet. It has never been an option for her. She can’t understand why I would physically hurt myself and enjoy it, thirst for it even, just like I can’t understand why she wouldn’t.       

That same friend doesn’t like when I talk about depression as if it’s not a big deal. “It’s not funny.” I know. I know that it’s serious. I know that it is not a laughing matter. I know that it makes people scared and uncomfortable. I also know that making fun of it provides a sense of detachment, if only for a second. Joking about depression personifies the beast into something that can be laughed at, rather than feared. Discussing it sarcastically opens up a conversation in a way that feels like wearing a pair of sweatpants instead of jeans.",10Jun2018,2
17,"Hello Reddit,

To put it simply, I obsess over my weight. I’m not OVERweight, nor have I ever been, but I obsess over gaining even a pound. All I can think about is how I look and disliking my body...comparing myself to others around me. I can remember being eight years old and thinking I weighed too much, so this has been going on for a very long time. I cannot shake this feeling even though I want to. I want to just be able to accept myself as I am, but my brain won’t stop with these negative thoughts. :( 

It sounds stupid typing it out, but this is genuinely the thought process that my brain goes through every day.

Does anyone else experience this? How do you make it better?",10Jun2018,1
18,"I don’t know if anybody will read all of this but it’s worth a try even if it helps me to get it out in words because it’s a mess inside my head. 

In October I went to a Thanksgiving dinner 30 minutes away from home to my dad’s friends house. The people that were there were me, my sisters, my dad, my aunt and uncle (whom I don’t see very often) and my dad’s friend. I remember saying to myself that I didn’t want to go. At all. With my anxiety currently, being that far away from home without a quick escape (as it was 30 minutes away) then it made it harder. I wanted to make my dad proud and actually go to a family gathering for once so I sucked it up. 

The drive I was anxious but still able to be calm. I didn’t eat before going and I didn’t get a good amount of sleep the night before which is a precursor to trigger my anxiety. I should have stayed home. It was too much too soon. When we go there is when the anxiety kicked in. I knew I would get asked about my mom and how were getting along and I’d have to talk about it. She left the house in the summer of 2015 after her and my dad weren’t getting along and we thought it was best she leave due to her emotional abuse and narcissistic tendencies. It did not go well. She accused us of kicking her out when her father was the one who took her out of the house. Anyways I think talking about my mom just made my anxiety worse. 

I could FEEL the anxiety rising and the thoughts start. “What if I get sick here in front of all these people?” “What if they think I’m weird for having a panic attack?” Only a hour there and I wanted to tell my dad to drive me home. I didn’t because I couldn’t be weak again and just go home. I also didn’t want my dad to get mad and to ruin his time like I’ve done before. I sat on the couch and had a full panic attack. People know to leave my alone when I get like this. When i'm anxious I freeze up and can’t talk. I can only focus on one thing like a tv show. My sisters would come up and talk to me but another thing when I get anxious is my throat feels like its’ closing and I gag. I didn’t want them to see me do this. I would just nod and pretend I was okay. 

I couldn’t even think of dinner and having to eat in front of everyone. I just sucked it up while I could feel myself having what felt like a panic attack then it would subside then start up and then subside then start up. Like hills or mountains. Peaks and valleys. The best way I can describe it. Absolute hell. I felt trapped with no way out and so far away from home. 

I remember going to the bathroom even though I hate going in other people’s houses. Praying it wasn’t a bad poop (which would lead me to think I was sick and trigger my emetophobia) It was fine so that eased my mind. 

I ate what I could. Some turkey and potatoes with a fake smile on my face, nodding and trying to converse all while feeling like my body was exploding on the inside from all the anxiety and adrenaline. Again I’d be okay for a short while then it would spike. Peaks and valleys. Again, best way to describe it. 

It was finally winding down and my dad wanted to stay longer but I said “fuck no. I need to go home now.” On the drive home all I could think about was the anxiety. I’m literally having anxiety right now typing this just THINKING about it. I was scared I was gonna throw up or faint or have a heart attack. Dad was talking to me but all I was focused on was my anxiety and my body. I just wanted to get home to my room. I gagged violently in the car as my throat felt tight and my mouth dry. This would happen whenever my anxiety gets so intense. It was pretty bad when I was a kid. 

When we got home I had the worse depersonalization ever. My room looked foreign. I felt like I was in a daze. I assume my brain was overloading from all the anxiety. This only made it worse. I went to the bathroom and changed into my pyjamas and I laid down, put my computer and tv on and rode it out. That night was when it all started. 

The next day I had what I call a “panic attack hangover” I felt so tired, my muscles were tense. I slept horrible. Waking up every so often with my heart racing in the middle of a anxiety attack. It’s like my body was FULL of adrenaline still. I was happy to be in my bed and my comfort zone when this was happening. My bedroom has been my safe haven for the past couple of years where I felt safe when I was anxious. 

My dad made food for dinner and even though anxiety, which depletes my appetite, was still present, I ate. I was still anxious. Just wanted my bed and to lay down and watch tv on my laptop with all my comfort. A few hours later I had diarrhea. Cue my brain into thinking I had a stomach virus that I caught or got sick from the food the night before. I rationally knew it was from all the anxiety as the anxiety puts my digestive tract into overdrive. I knew that but my irrational brain as I like to call it, didn’t. I was convinced I was sick which then put my anxiety into overdrive once again. All I felt for the next couple days was anxiety. I was scared to eat as maybe I was sick and food would make me throw up. I stuck to my bland diet which I do when I think I’m sick when really it’s anxiety fucking with my head. 

Slowly the anxiety passed after a week. Moments like that typically do even though this particular time what with Thanksgiving and how bad that experience was, usually last about a week. 

I had my first therapist appointment on the 26th of October. The anxiety from Thanksgiving was gone. I still had the thoughts of “what if” but those were always with my when I left the house. I was excited to start therapy again. The session went good. It was really just to get to know me. What meds i'm on ect. I told her about Thanksgiving and how awful it was. She told me that it was good that I got through it. I agreed but I also thought to myself that I never want to feel that way again.

I stopped to get a bagel after and went home. Went on the internet and read a book. My sister got home and offered to make us some pasta. I was so tired so I told her if I fall asleep, wake me when it’s ready. I feel asleep so fast without even realizing it. What felt like 2 seconds later my sister woke up me up and told me dinner was ready. 

I started to feel that anxiety dread again. Usually when I take naps in the daytime I wake up a little anxious and groggy. Apparently my brain thought it was time to freak out to the extreme because I felt the daze feeling and the depersonalization again. I walked down and got myself some pasta even though it look revolting because once again, my anxiety gets rid of any appetite I have when it rears it’s ugly head. I ate the pasta and turned on Netflix and Grey’s Anatomy. I put on something I’m familiar with when I’m anxious. It’ sort of a weird coping mechanism. I don’t know. This is when it allll started.

I spent the night convinced that I woke up feeling like that because I was sick. Always go to that conclusion. I hate my brain. I spent all night in and out of panic attacks just like I did during Thanksgiving. I thought “oh hell no. I’m not feeling like this again.” And it sort of spiralled from there. I felt everything. Afraid to eat because I might get sick which caused more anxiety. Loose stools from anxiety even though I KNOW anxiety caused it but more convincing to my irrational brain that I was sick. It wasn’t anxiety. This kept happening. It all snowballed and I wanted it to stop. 

For some reason I started to feel like I did when I was 13. There was this one point where something like this happened that was similar. I would gag and get afraid to eat. I dry heaved over the sink. My anxiety was awful. My mom was there and she would help and cut me up apples to get me to eat. I would lay on the couch next to her. I started to say “I want my mom.” I thought she would know how to make it better. Like she did when I was 13. I do not know where this thought came from. My mom hadn’t lived with us for over year and we barely saw each other. I don’t know why my brain thought that she would fix this. I do remember that when I would say something like “If I eat this I’ll probably throw up or it will come out of me and make me think i'm sick.” And she would always say “no you’re fine.” And that would help. I ended up fine. My dad and sisters would tell me everything is okay as well but it wasn’t the same. 

I’m not sure why I felt like my mom would make this better but I did.   I literally felt like I was 13 again and back in that episode I went through. I no longer had control over my thoughts and my body. I was anxious as hell and hated the physical symptoms that came form that and I wanted it all to stop. I think I broke. 

I was gagging while trying to eat which made me think I was sick. I got scared I was going to get malnourished and have to be tube fed. I would text my mom and she would tell me no, that’s not possible. I would get heart palpitations and think I was having a heart attack. I had a palpitation on the toilet and I was scared of going on the toilet. My stomach was a mess with loose stools due to anxiety BUT convinced I was sick and then fed on that I wasn’t absorbing my food and I would end up, once again as I mentioned, malnourished and have to be tube fed. I was texting my mom with every symptom I felt. 

The anxiety  felt like I was losing control of my mind and the symptoms of the anxiety made me feel like I was losing control of my body. I was afraid I was dying or had some sort of disease. I started looking up all these symptoms on Google and asking my mom if I had this disease or this condition. I was afraid I was gonna have a heart attack or faint. I couldn’t eat or sleep. It’s like my brain stopped working. I cried. I would try to tell my sisters and dad that I needed my mom. I wanted her back home. All of us together again. 

They told me no. It’s not healthy. Mom and dad don’t get alone anymore. Were here and we can help you. Mom’s not far away. I told them they don’t help like my mom does. They took offence to that. I got mad and stopped talking to them because they wouldn’t let my mom come home. I felt like a CHILD. I felt out of control. Why was I acting like this? I was still feeling all the symptoms of anxiety. Still worried I was dying. This never stopped. This scared me. Why was I acting like this? Was I going crazy? Was I having a mental breakdown? 

I started to do things to get my dad’s attention to see how bad I was without my mom. I remembered I cut myself after being self harm free for over 2 years. At that time I didn’t care. I just wanted to stop this anxiety. My mom suggested that I go to the hospital. I agreed even though I knew I would get traumatized. I went through this when I was 12. I had to go to the hospital and I remember sitting in the waiting room. This was back in 2002 and there was a breakout of some virus that caused vomiting. The Norwalk virus I think. I remember my dad took me and while in the waiting room I kept telling him while sobbing that I had to go home. I was gonna catch something here. 

Being at the hospital again this time brought all that back and it was like I was reliving it all again. I felt 12 again. Not 27. Why? It scared me. 

At the hospital they gave me 1mg of Ativan. Explained to them about what was happening what with my anxiety and me thinking I was dying or had a disease. I stayed until the morning and saw the crisis councillor. She explained that parents spilt up and it’s hard and that my mom wasn’t far and I could talk to her or call her on the phone. I felt good hearing that. I felt better. I went home and felt good. I hated that I self harmed though. I hate that I put my dad and sisters through that. I went to sleep feeling good. I can move ahead. Nope.

I woke up in a panic attack and all the thoughts came back. The health anxiety. The symptoms of anxiety. My thoughts went back to needing my mom again. I started acting out and throwing things to get my dad to see I wasn’t okay and needed my mom. Why was I acting like this? I felt confused and scared and my thoughts made no sense. I couldn’t think or make decisions. I couldn’t calm down. I was having panic attack and I couldn’t eat or sleep. I was Googling all my symptoms from anxiety and diagnosing myself with everything.

I needed my mom like I had when I was 13 and this would stop. My mom decided to come over and stay a few nights. It was awful. I was till asking her about every symptom. I was gagging at food and scared of malnutrition and she kept saying no. It’s just your anxiety. This time my mom’s words weren’t helping. I’d lost control and I was going to feel like this the rest of my life. I was terrified. I stopped talking to my friends or going on social media. All I thought 24/7 was anxiety, anxiety, anxiety. What illness or disease I could have. The heart palpitations, gagging, not being able to eat, or sleep, diarrhea, sweating, shaking, scared I would faint. It was all I was focused on. I couldn’t focus on TV or movies. I couldn’t read. I couldn’t sit still. The only relief I got was when I went to sleep with the help of my Seroquel. 

While my mom was there it was hell. I wanted to convinced my dad and sisters she could come home. She could sleep on the couch or back in her bed with dad. Have it all like it was before. I don't know why I was saying this. My sisters and my dad don’t talk to my mom and her being in the house was tense for all of them. My mom felt uncomfortable there and my sisters didn’t want her there either. 

My mom had to go back to her parents house where she had been living since she left home and I thought “oh hell no.” She’s staying. I stopped talking and stared at the wall in hopes that my dad and sisters would see that I was bad off and needed my mom. I don’t know why I was doing this but like I said I had lost control of my mind. 

She had to go and I just laid there begging for them to see. I just cried. My grandparents came to pick her up and my grandfather and my dad don’t get along. They got into a physical altercation a few years prior. I heard yelling and screaming downstairs. My little sister was pissing me off. She kept telling me my mom couldn’t come home and I was being stupid. She called my crazy and all. She was yelling at my mom telling her to leave. I remember getting up and walking downstairs and I punched her in the face. I hate that I did this. We’ve gotten in fights before. We ended up fighting and my dad tore us apart. I remember just flinging myself on the hardwood floor. I felt like I didn’t know why this was happening. 

My mom left. I went back to my room and cried and still felt the anxiety. I started Googling again. I’d post on reddit looking for reassurance that I wasn’t dying. All the while my sisters and dad distances themselves from me. I told them to leave me alone and I hated them when inside I wanted help and I just didn’t know what was wrong with me. I was scared. Why was I acting like this? Why was I feeling like this? Was this is it? Was I going crazy? I would look up the symptoms of going crazy. 

That night I went downstairs and told my dad I was leaving. I wanted my mom and they wouldn’t let me so bye! I DIDN’T WANT THIS I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME. I put on clothes and packed a bag and I hid in the woods hoping that would get their attention. I sat there for 20 minutes and nobody cared. I remember walking back home and I had a heart palpitation and I thought “NO” I can’t have a heart attack and then my anxiety skyrocketed again. It wouldn’t stop. I was in a constant state of fear and anxiety. I felt my body and mind were on high alert. 

When I got home. I just laid on the floor in the living room. I called my mom over and over and told her nobody was seeing how bad I was. I was calling my grandfather to pick me up so I could go stay with them. My mom kept telling me to wake my dad up and ask him for help. I said no he doesn’t get it. My mind was set that only my mom could fix this. I went upstairs and slammed my door and self harmed again. My dad came in and shook me and screamed at me asking me why I was doing this. I didn’t know. I didn’t know what was happening to me. I just wanted the anxiety to stop. I refused to go to the hospital again and re-traumatize myself for the 3rd time. 

After that I knew that my mom wasn’t coming home. Just wasn’t happening. I was still feeling anxious as hell and Googling everything. I was not sleeping well and not eating. The anxiety was AWFUL. I had never felt this anxiety in my life ever. Maybe when I was 13 but not as bad. I felt like I was back there again. Everyday I was terrified I would throw up or have a heart attack. I was having multiple panic attacks a day. I kept telling my mom I had to get out of this shit hole where nobody cared about me. (THEY DID.) I told my dad he wasn't gonna get my rent. (I’m on disability and I do pay my rent) He got mad. I said fuck this I’m moving out with mom. 

She looked into it and got us appointment to sign the lease. I thought “okay, mom’s gonna fix me. I’ll feel better.” Nope. While waiting for the process, my sisters and dad barely talked to me. I was still scared of throwing up or having a heart attack. I was scared that not eating much would lead me to malnutrition. I was afraid to get up and go to the bathroom or take a bath because I didn’t want to get my heart rate up or faint due to not eating much. I was constantly aware of every physical sensation due to the anxiety. I was in a constant state of it and hyper sensitive. 

I saw my doctor and I was gagging so hard in the office and I thought “fuck fuck WHY WONT THIS STOP.” He prescribed a antacid to take because the anxiety was causing this. I thought it wasn’t and I had some disease. I noticed I’d lost 10 pounds since I was there last in April. This was November. First through was “FUCK IM MALNOURISHED AND IM GONNA END UP ON A FEEDING TUBE” I couldn’t even hold a conversation with him because all I felt was anxiety and I wanted to get out of there.

Going on social media made me anxious. Watching a show I didn’t see before made me anxious. I started getting anxious seeing pictures of people I was friends with and pictured being in public with them and having a anxiety attack. EVERYTHING was causing a panic attack. 

The day came to sign the lease. I was focused on living with my mom and not feeling this anxiety hell again. My mom and grandfather were coming to pick me up and the only thing I was thinking of was my anxiety. Would I faint because Im actively walking and I haven’t eaten? What if I have a heart attack? What if I have palpations? In the car I was focused on my chest and how it was beating. My mom trying to talk to me and me just saying things back. Sitting in the lease office only thinking about if I was gonna have a heart attack in front of these people. I was not in the right mindset to be making this huge life change. I signed the lease and only cared about getting home.

Then something happened. I hoped that the lease wouldn’t go through because the anxiety was starting to lift. I slowly got back to eating. I could sleep. I started talking to my dad again. I felt better. It had passed.

My mom texted me and told me we got approved. I wanted to tell her that its okay now. I’m fine. I didn’t. I was scared she would get mad and think that I didn’t want to move in with her. I had dug this hole while anxious and not thinking straight. What did I do? It all became clear to me that my mom is emotionally abusive and anything she does it had to benefit her. It was better we lived apart. I could think properly now. BUT now I couldn’t let my mom down and do what’ best for me. I told her I was excited. 

Now I’m here. It’s been almost 6 months living with my mom in our two bedroom apartment. I walk on eggshells around her to make sure I don’t do anything wrong to piss her off. She constantly tells me that her kids don’t talk to her and my sisters are bad humans. She asks my dad to help her with money and to bring her things. She’s always asking who I’m talking to and If I’m talking shit about her to my sisters. She yells at me because they don’t talk to her and I being me, have to try to fix it. I just want everyone to get along. She gets mad if I put something back in the fridge the wrong way. Her moods can be up and down. Im starting to remember why she had to move out in the first place. 

She can’t be there for me like she was when I was 13. I didn’t realize until now that she was only there so she could look good. That she was the caring mother. When in reality she tells me to stop worrying and get over it. 

Now I’m in this mess and worse then ever. I miss my old home. I went back there and it’s not the same. My dad has a roommate with him. The house looks different and it’s not my home anymore. The day I moved out nobody was home because they didn’t want to see my mom so I never had a proper goodbye to the house or my sisters and dad. I just left. 

I followed up with my doctor and EKG’s and blood tests and all normal. My health anxiety still hasn’t gone away since that time despite the doctor saying I’m fine.

Nothing in my life is the same anymore. I feel like a new person. Somebody I don't know. I feel like I was just placed here and now I have to learn how to function. My agoraphobia has flared up again. After all the worrying about something being wrong with me is still there. I worry I still have a disease or I’m gonna faint or anything if I leave my room. My surrounding feel foreign. I feel like my world has turned on it’s axis. I don’t see my sisters because they do not get along with my mom so they don’t come over. I can’t leave the house to see them cause of my issues. I miss my dad and how much we got along. He only comes over if I need something but I hate bothering him. We barely talk. He told me that I can call him anytime and he would pick me up. My anxiety is still high when out of my room.

 I also get flashbacks of that time when I see my sisters or my dad. I associate them with what happened. My anxiety then spikes.

I don’t know how to get past this. How did I get here? How do I move forward? I feel like I can’t move from what happened. Why did I act like that? What happened? What triggered it? Am I crazy? Was I crazy? I miss my old life. It wasn’t perfect but now I don’t know who I am anymore. I don’t know what to do. I have good days when my mom’s at work and I’m home alone and I could take a walk or sit on the balcony but I don't because the fear of that anxiety or those anxiety symptoms will come back. I’ve become a recluse in my room. I sit on my bed and watch tv and go on my computer. I only leave my room to eat and bathe. The eating this is still scary. Will I gag like I did during that time? Am I eating enough so I don’t get malnourished? It’s like all my life is now is what happened in November. I have flashbacks like PTSD. I can’t move on. I’m afraid a panic attack will trigger it all over again so I have avoided doing anything that might cause anxiety or those symptoms because I can’t feel like I did then. I can’t.

If somebody took the time to read all this and make me understand exactly what happened, that would help. I’m on waiting list for therapy. I went back to my dads house two weeks ago because I told my mom I wanted to move back. I spent the weekend there. My mom hated me. She told me I was a terrible daughter for abandoning her with the rent and bills. When I was at my dads I was back to feeling like I did back in November. All the feelings came back. All that happened. It also just wasn’t the same. My sisters moved out and it was my dad and some stranger. This wasn’t home anymore. I couldn’t live there. I went back to my apartment with my mom. I feel like I have no control. I feel stuck.

I feel depressed most days. I feel like I’m almost 30 and I haven’t done anything with my life and anxiety will always prevent me from having a life. The days pass me by. I worry that sooner or later my body will fail because I do nothing but spend time on my bed. You’d think this would motivate me to exercise and eat properly but anxiety prevents me from that. It prevents me from doing anything.

Thank you for reading this if you did. I really want to move past this but I’m scared I never will.",10Jun2018,3
19,"Hi there, if this is the wrong place please feel free to let me know where I should direct this to.  
My brother made an attempted suicide a couple days ago. He's in a state facility under an involuntary basis until they deem him no longer a threat to himself. We live in Ohio  
We have talked, and he agrees he needs help, and agrees it's possible to feel better than he's been feeling for a long time. In the past I've made lots of non\-pushy offers for him to come live with me, or suggestions that he get into therapy, but when it comes time for him to take action, he tends to freeze up and do nothing (which he admits). I know that you have to be your own biggest advocate if you want to improve your mental health, but I truly believe that in this case the right thing for my brother is for somebody to reach out and hold his hand and really give him some guidance and support  
I would like to try to take him into my home upon release of where he's at so I can give him some space to breathe, get thinking straight, help him get his finances in order, help motivate him to do the things he wants to do to improve his life, etc. I know this is a major burden on myself and my household so I'm not really asking for advice there.  
Here are some problems we will need to solve if he agrees to live with me:  


* Paying for ongoing drugs and therapy. I think the drugs are doable, things like zoloft can be found very cheap with a coupon. But he currently has no insurance and there's no qualifying event to be able to add him to my insurance or sign up with the ACA marketplace. And if he lives with me, I fear that my income would count toward his ""household income"" and disqualify him for most financial aid / sliding fee programs. How can we pay for therapy? I cannot afford hundreds of dollars per visit and I know he can't, and will absolutely just stop with the therapy if the financial aspect puts too much pressure on. Will they consider a sliding fee program based on his income alone despite living with me?
* How should we move forward from here? I have struggled with some depression throughout my life but never this degree of hopelessness. I don't know what is reasonable to ask of him and how much I should push him to try to get back to some semblance of a normal life, or if I should be aiming to give him space to get things in order and let him move at his own pace. My thinking is, help him to seek out things he enjoys doing, and offer to do them with him as motivation to keep at it. Include him in family activities as much as possible, but give him space in his own room if he needs. Be open to talking to him and make it clear that anything he wants to talk about is on the table. What other advice do you have?
* A lot of his stress focuses around humanity in general. He largely believes in communal type living and hates the societal pressures to have a job and buy a house. Frankly I don't disagree with him, but we take a different approach. So my idea is that we work on his mental health in the short term, and then start talking about the future, plans to become more self\-sufficient. I would like to see if he would be interested in gardening with me, or learning how to do DIY tasks around the house. If self\-sufficiency is truly what he wants, I'm all for it, and maybe we can use that long\-term goal as a way to keep moving forward and onward.

Am I crazy? Am I being too heavy\-handed here? Something has to change, I've been trying the passive approach for the last 2 years and he's only been getting worse and worse. Is it wrong to think sometimes somebody just has to reach out and kick you in the butt and hold your hand to get you back on the path to happiness? That's truly all I want for him, I have no expectations of my own for his life, I am just ready for him to feel contentment about his life for once.",10Jun2018,1

Like it doesn’t really feel like I’m another person but it almost feels like I’m not controlling what I’m saying and I start feeling kind of dizzy. Something like this has happened since I was a kid, like when there was a lot of people I would almost feel dizzy but not really, like I would again feel like I’m not me and everyone’s voices are just kind of saying stuff but I can’t comprehend it easily?

For most of my life, my friends became my friends by just hanging around me—I didn’t have to do anything, they just stuck around.

Why do I hate talking to people so much but feel so sad that I don’t?

It feels like I’ve been called awkward almost every day since I started 7th grade. I was awkward, and I still am. I’m always stuck in my head. I used to want to live alone in cabin out in a pine forest somewhere other than here but I remembered that I can’t stand myself.

25,"Mental illness runs in my family. My Mom has Borderline personality disorder and my grandma is Bipolar. Ever since I was 15 I go through phases where I see, hear and feel things that I know can't be there. When it's something I see it usually goes away quickly. But a voice, sound or physically sensation (such as someone breathing on my neck) it can last all day or days. When this happens I get paranoid and can't sleep. When I mean can't sleep I am usually awake for 2 days, sometimes 3 than finally sleep. My anxiety goes through the roof also. It lasts for a week to a month. It used to just happen about once or twice a year with long times of nothing. But now it happens often. A few days here and a few days there but it's about 3-5 times a month. I am a 24 year old male.

My heart feels like it's going to beat out of it's chest despite only being at 57bpm. I simply have so much energy, I started daydreaming about become a chef, and how I'll cook my siblings a pastry in the morning and how I'll build a chair like a craftsman and so many things. This always seems to happen, like a sine line. Yes, my life is like a sine line but the highs and lows are much more for me, they feel much heavier in terms of the way I experience them as if magnified. I think I might be bipolar. I do my best to control things like these when they happen by sleeping well, eating well, etc. but at times I feel like they simply can't be controlled by me. There has got to be something going on neurologically for me to behave the way that I do, and it's a shame that I do because the reality of the low's are not very so happy and gay and they really do weigh heavily on my life and others (my family namely as I never had the opportunity to build close and intimate friendships).

29,"Hi guys. Need some advice.

My boyfriend (19 M) had his Citalopram/ celexa dose upped in October/november last due to him asking for some help from the Drs when be stopped smoking weed. Slowly over the last few months his libido completely vanished. He went to the Drs last week because since he's been on the 40mg he is just  lifeless.... more depressed and generally just wanting to sleep whenever he can.
He didn't mention the sexual side because he felt embarrassed but with all that said the Dr basically said come back in a month and we will see if you feel better...

My question is.. has anyone else been in on citalopram/ celexa and found when increasing the dose they felt worse... lost their libido ect and how did they combat that?

I'm desperate to help him as he's never felt more depressed than he has recently and 40 is the maximum dose they can give him.

Thanks in advance x",10Jun2018,2
30,"So today I had a fight with my girlfriend (actually she had a fight with me). All the time she was venting and crying I was thinking maybe I do have a mental illness.

(I want get out of the way that I'm not trying to use my mental health to justify being a bad boyfriend.)

So her complaints are: I don't seem to care about anything, I don't like doing anything, everytime we're out together I only want to go home, one instant I'm ok the other I'm not, I don't like to socialize with her family, and the thing that impacted me the most, it feels like I don't have emotions.

All of that hit me really hard and I really going to try to improve myself, but the thing I can't stop thinking is maybe I have some kind of mental illness that makes harder to function like most people do. Every time I read about someone with depression or anxiety I think ""I relate to that"" but I never went as far as thinking ""that's exactly like me"" and because of that I never really consider having a mental illness. But hearing my girlfriend saying all that made me think. 

I don't really know why I'm posting this here, maybe I want someone to tell me I don't have a mental illness and I was just a bad boyfriend and I can improve. Or maybe I want someone to say all those behavior were from someone that needs professional help. I really don't know.

31,"(TW self harm, hospitalization, suicide)  


hello! i want to explain my situation to you a bit.  


i don't want to get too deep into my history, but i can tell you that my official diagnosis is: major depression with psychotic features, anxiety, BPD, PTSD.  


i was diagnosed with anxiety as a child, depression (officially) when i was 13, BPD when i was 16, PTSD at 18. a lot of people don't believe me when i say i was dx'd with BPD at 16, but it was under very special circumstances.  


the reason i was diagnosed as a minor is because i was constantly in and out of hospitals from self harm gone too far and suicide attempts. i honestly can't remember how many times i've been hospitalized because it's been a lot. i know this will sound fake as well lol but when i was inpatient at 15 years old, i started ECT. i had tried a lot of medications before that and they just didn't help. ECT did help, temporarily. within a year i was again so depressed that i was at risk for killing myself, and so they tried ECT again when i was 17. it didn't help at all. i tried both unilateral and bilateral. i gave up on trying to continue it.   


i'm 19 now. last september, about a week before my birthday, i tried to kill myself again. this time it resulted in me having multiple seizures.   


because of this, i don't qualify for TMS, which is why i haven't tried that option yet. i had actually gone to a consult for it about 3 months ago, but near the end of the appointment i told him about the seizures and he informed me i can't do TMS because of it. i was devastated, because i felt and still feel at the end of my rope again.   


i was told to try ECT once more. i was so desperate that i was going to, but i was denied by the hospital closest to me because the head doctor was concerned about his success rates. he told me to try ECT at a different hospital, but there aren't any other ones close.  


during this last 6 months i've been in a partial hospitalization program. i've tried several other medications with the psychiatrist there. right now i'm on: lithium, vistiril, buspar, trazodone, and saphris. but it's not helping me. she suggested ketamine treatment to me, and we spent days looking for clinics near me that offer it. we finally found one.... but then i found out that my insurance doesn't pay for it.   


i come from a low income family, and i have no income of my own. i have applied for disability but i will probably get denied. i find that out sometime around august. but for now..... there's absolutely no way we could afford it.   


i've been looking into clinical trials and i'm going to apply for a grant but they don't cover the full treatment.   


SO my question is: if i posted a fundraiser, do you think it might get attention? would anyone donate? do you have any website recommendations for this? (i know about gofundme and i think that might be a good option but idk?)   


i feel so pathetic, but i'm so desperate to alleviate my symptoms. if you have any suggestions on how to cope in the meantime i would really appreciate it. (but please don't suggest obvious stuff like ""listen to music!"")   


much love.  ♡ ",10Jun2018,2
32,"So I just want to make it clear that I’m already seeing a therapist and my next appointment is Wednesday! I just felt like I had to let it out.
So I used to self-harm almost daily when I was around 17-18, and after seeing a counselor behind my parents’ back and getting out of a triggering environment, I managed to stop self-harming and was doing much better. Now I’m 21.

Something big happened to me last July (relating to my health), and it has been going downhill since then. I started on antidepressants in December because my symptoms were too obvious even to my family who don’t necessarily “get” depression. But still, there was no self-harm.

The last couple of weeks have been by far the most mentally draining. I’ve broken down everyday for the last week and it’s been emotionally exhausting. Last night (Friday night) I couldn’t sleep or think or do anything but think of cutting. I was really good at controlling it but I slipped. The disappointment I feel in myself is so overwhelming I don’t know what to do. It also hurts more than it did in my head and I have a big problem of covering them up because I’m at the beach with my mother who doesn’t know. Thankfully today I was there alone so she didn’t see but tomorrow we will both be there in just swimsuits with nothing for me to hide the evidence behind. She doesn’t understand self-harm and she didn’t know about it last time, I’m not sure what to do if she notices nor how to deal with it. I’ve always tried to be honest with her because we’re pretty close otherwise, but I’m scared her reaction might act as a trigger.
As a side note, in some twisted way I’m glad it hurt more and that it’s so hard to cover up, I’m hoping this will make it easier not to give in next time.

I’m sorry this was long but I needed to talk about it and ask for help from people who understand.

Does anyone have experience with telling a parent about their self-harm?",10Jun2018,1
33,"Hi im Ben and i really dont know whats wrong with me anymore,

Since being a kid i have always felt abnormal or weird, i have never really fit in and i never got on with the popular kids at school, my thoughts have always been different and i have always seen things differently to others,

When i was a kid i went through a pretty rough time, my mum and dad used to fight all time and then my dad moved out and took me with him, i proceeded to live with my dad, my aunt and my grandy (grandma) all under one roof, 

Then the court battles started from me being about 4 to 7 and a half, weekend visits with my mum, some shit happened while i was down there, then back to my home and then back again repeat cycle for 3 years, i eventually ended up having to see her from a social services office every week, eventually my dad bribed me with a mountain bike if i said i didnt want to see her anymore,

So that was that, i then spent seven years of being locked in the house, no friends were allowed to come over, i had to sleep in a bed with my grandy until i was 14, i wasnt allowed out unless it was too play in the garden and someone was always stood looking out a window watching over me, 

Then when i was 12 i found skateboarding, i used to live on a main road that our house was on one end of a row of shops and that had a stretch of smooth concrete, so i asked for a boaard and started using that to not be in the house, while i was doing this, there were other situations going on, dad coming home drunk and fighting and arguing with everyone, dad and aunt trying to kill each other, my mum running up to my dad parked car while i was in it and sneaking a look at me, eventually i was allowed to leave the front of the house to go skate elsewhere and i found a bit of freedom, by the time this happened i was 15, i was then struggling with usual puberty issues and trying to deal with my own sexual experiences, no one had ever taught me so i was winging it, lets face it i didnt touch myself until i was 14, 

eventually i met a girl (had plenty of other girlfriends before this) started a relationship, we did the thing all kids do at 16 which was spend everyday together and screw when we could, eventually her mum caught us in bed and she run away, so that started a two conflict of living together and her getting pregnant (dont know to this day if the baby is mine), she cheated all the time and i eventually started cheating and then i left, for an ex girlfriend, liver with her a bit and then left her (she cheated too), 

Found another girlfriend but this one was wanting to be all princess about life and i had to bow and scrape to her command as she saw fit,  eventually we split,

In this time though i bumped into a girl who was far older than me, Kelly (27), she had long brown hair and was a curvy girl and my heart skipped beats eveytime i used to see her on a night out,

Well lo and behold we ended up together, when i started the relationship with her i was pretty messed up, i was drinking and getting angry and used to smash the house up and throw things, there were even a few incidents of me grabbing hold of her, 

Well eventually it all calmed down, i started to feel peace for this fire that was inside my brain, it always felt like i was battling some demon i couldnt get rid of, i felt this way since being a kid, 

So by now im twenty one (met kel at 19) then my dad dies, i got a disturbing phonecall from my aunt saying they hadnt seen him all day and his car was parked out back,

So me and kelly go over and i go to his bedroom, doors feels like it has had something pushed behind it, so with all my strength i push it open, thinking this is boxes and he is sleeping, i fumble ofor the light switch and i get it on,

To my horror he is facedown, skin is blue and mottled, i stepped over him and sat on the bed, i place my hand on his back, tried shaking him and nothing, i asked him to wake up and still nothing, by now im having a full breakdown and this demon in my head isnt even registering whats going on, 

I made my way downstairs and broke the news, kelly run up and checked his pulse but she knew anyway,

So chaos ensued with that, all funerals and selling stuff, now here is the bit where i really started fucking up, five weeks after his death i had sold some of his assets and netted a wad of cash, i stopped off in my local town to pick up some xbox games for me and kel, i ended up in the pub, well not only did i end up in the pub but i ended up blowing £480 and sleeping with some old whore,

Well here ensues the start of a bigger problem, i tried hiding it from kel and it didnt work, someone told her and that caused a shit storm, well here is the first moment in my life of feeling truly down, it was like a tidel wave and that demon up there in the old cranium really kicked off, we worked together to get through it, but kkthe drinking continued because i didnt know how to deal with what i had done and the grief inside of me,

Fast forward a year of me and kel taking care of my grandy and she dies, so thats my grandy dead now, a woman at 90 years old who had nothing but unconditional love for me, so she is gone, me and kel have worked things through but the drinking hadnt stopped, it was a weekly occurence, anyway a month later kel tells me she is pregnant with our first daughter, she already had three boys when i met her,

So mollie is born after another traumatic experience, she was born 9 weeks early through a cord prolapse (the uterus had expanded and cord was hanging out of kelly)

Emergency c\-section and my princess was in the world, well into scubu she went, which is basically a special care unit for premature babies, well that was a month of hell, kelly lived at the hospital for a month and i lived at home with her kids and her mum, she eventually come home with mollie and this should have been the start of a good life,

Now inbetween all this i am dealing with an aunt who has cancer (had it since i was 15), she used to come and visit mollie and always tried making sure we had enough money between making arguments with kelly about everything,

Well we got on with our lives and the drinking quietened down, but it ended up instead in periods of me basically walking out the house and going on 12 hour benders and coming home in a state, 

We move houses a couple of times until eventually we ended up at a house we were renting from a friend,

Well shit hits the fan #3, aunt dies, she is laid in hospital hooked up on machines and she asked to see me before she went, i went up with kelly and she was there and trying to put a brave face on, but the hospital chaplain basically said that she wouldnt last long, they asked if i wanted to ressuss and said no, 

Next day kelly went up on her own while i stayed at home distraught, 

Well later that night at about 9:40 she passed and kelly was with her, kelly didnt wasnt me there as she thought it would finally break me, 

Well  after this the disappearing out continued, coming back drunk and messed up, no more cheating though, i just didnt have it in me to hurt her like that again.

Well we went through a year of selling my family property and it eventually sold and we bought as kelly said our forever home,

Well this was late 2015, ill backtrack right quick and say that at near the start of 2015 kelly said she was pregnant again,

Well Nova arrived in november 2015 after another experience and another c\-section, well this should have been it,

Should have been the start of a new future for me to change everything i had done before and make things different,

Well we moved into our forever home November 21 2015, and that beast in my head really started, 

I had bought the house outright in cash and made some security for me and my family,

come christmas of that year the drink and whatever was going on in my head really kicked in, all i could think of was suicide and not wanting to do anything, also there were irrational fears of loising my family and losing kelly, 

Always thinking that kelly was going to walk away, scared the life out of me and the more it scared me the more i drank and disappeared out, 

So we went through 2016 with me in and out of my job at the time, on and off the sick and all this time im not only beating myself up mentally im beating kelly upo mentally too, but i cant seem to stop this, everytime i disappear out i am taking a piece away from her and im not realising what i am doing, 

come 2017 and it was march, we went out together for a night out, i ended up fucking up the night due to some lad i slapped, at this point i wasnt even myself anymore, just some horrible dr jekyll and mr hyde creature that seemed intent on ruining everyones life,

Next morning i woke up with alcohol flowing through my veins and i just didnt have the headspace to carry on, 

I went downstairs and i grabbed a bottle of liqour and all my anti depressants (all 56 tablets) and threw them back, i posted out messages to everyone i loved telling them sorry and sorry for ruining eveything,

Off to hospital i went, 24 hours in there and they released me, back home i go,

Well kelly is beyond pissed and ended it, social services were in contact about the childrens safety too,

I then try for the best part of a year to maake things up and all in the meanwhile still disappearing out because this monster in my head wont go away, effectively its just getting worse,

come august 2017 i have landed a dream job, i have gone from customer service adviser at a bank to a support analyst at one of britains biggest bespoke it firms,

Well eveything should be good, should be enough motivation here get better and make a new start, well the job insecurity started, beast in my head telling me im not only losing my family but my job too because i am not good enough, 

eventually me and kelly made up and tried again, we had been living in the same house all this time, so it had been tough, seeing her and not being able to touch her or cuddle,

Well we got through things without an event i think, cant really remember at this point, i got offered a junior developer role at work, i snapped that up and here is the start of a new life,

Well come january 2018 and this shit has happened again, out i have disappeared, come back at like 8:30 in the morning,

Well this has not been as frequent but its still happening,

Well roll onto three weeks ago and it happened again and kelly gave me a another chance said it was final,

Well here is the huge fuck up, it happened again last week, but this time in my head it was far worse, 

all i can think is im going to lose her and the fear is paramount, its so bad i want to run far away so i dont hurt anyone, 

i end up going on the worst bender i have ever had, obviously kelly has now called it a day, she wants to try but she cant trust me,

I am commited to going to AA, but i cant shake this beast in my head, i dont know if its depression or anxiety or something else,

To be honest i am at a point where i am thinking that if i am out of this world i cant hurt anyone else, but i dont want to leave all the good stuffd behind,

I want kelly to love me and be happy but this fucking thing in my head doesnt want to seem to let me rest, 

Its like i have watched ten years of hurting that woman through someone elses eyes, i finally feel awake and i seen eveything i have done wrong but i dont know how to fix this, i dont know how to fix me, i know the alcohol is a problem i admit to that

but i cant help but feel like something else is a miss here.

Sorry to put such a long post but i dont know what else to do.",10Jun2018,1

35,"I have suffered with mental health for as long as I remember. I used to have friends in school though. I was never bullied. I had many large circles of friends. At 16 found a boyfriend. Did drugs. Lost friends. That relationship didn't last obviously. 

Here i am at 30. I have a 10 year old. My focus has been on her and work. I have been selfish to cope with being alone; drinking for company and to quiet the thoughts. 

I try to form relationships at work, but ive found im not able to keep these ""friendships"". I say things which are out of line sometimes. Speak my thoughts without a filter. I offend people easily apparently, or say things which i shouldn't. As such, i tend to overthink things, which may come off as socially awkward. Then in turn i automatically think people don't like me or want to be around someone like me. And so the vicious cycle continues.

The hospital neurologist said it was just stress related and she needed to see a psychologist. She has not yet been but she’s faxed documents to one and is waiting for an appointment, I think.

I don’t spend too much time at home, but she doesn’t move from the couch much. Sometimes she mumbles something incoherent as if she were talking in her sleep, though she’s awake. She knows it doesn’t make sense. She’s posting similarly on social media.

40,"Hello. I'm a 26 year old female living the States. I've been on antidepressants for about six-and-a-half years now and started taking 2.5 mg of Abilify June 5 as a trial run because I ""tested positive"" for being bipolar. I don't want to know the side effects (I'll convince myself that I have all of them), but I would like to hear from anyone who has taken this drug before. 

Since it's been less than a week, and I'm taking half of the lowest dose that can be prescribed, I don't know if it's working as intended. I'm still unsure about how it's supposed to work in the first place, other than being told it's a mood stabilizer. It could just be that it's not strong enough for me to see any real change. Either way, I feel scatterbrained but able to focus, tired but full of energy, relatively ok but depressed. I've felt like this for a while, which is why my doctor started me on the Abilify, but it feels stronger. Maybe I'm just more aware of it?

My point is, I'd like to hear from other people that have taken Abilify and how long it took you to adjust to it. What was your adjustment period like, and how long did it take for you to notice you were feeling better?

41,"*First, I want to make sure my question comes across with the best of intentions. I truly mean no ill will and I do not want to upset anyone.*

It seems that after a celebrity suicide, the message is to reach out to let your friends and family know and/or call the National Suicide line. What are your thoughts on this? Is there anything you would change about the message? 

I'd like to think there should be a message on how to help someone that has expressed suicidal ideation. I bet a lot of people don't know what to do so might not be as supportive as they could be.

I remember disclosing some dark thoughts and deep frustrations to my mom about 15 years ago. While she was sympathetic, I felt no closer to her and felt even more misunderstood. It was quite an invalidating experience. I knew she loved me and only wanted the best but she just didn't have the tools to understand.

53,"Hi I’m Ofir, and I could really use a place to vent, or even some ways to deal with what I’m going through. 
For the past year and a half, I have been suffering from depression, social anxiety, and insomnia.
As a kid I've have always been kind of different, didn't really have close friends, and I didn't really know how to make social contacts at all. Most of my interaction with new people I didn’t know with, were mostly some weird sounds I made.
At high-school I used to get into a lot of fights, and was ignored by most people because of being weird (at least that’s how I always felt). During that time I also started taking acne pills, which led me into my first period of depression (for some reason my doctor forgot to mention it was a very common side effect). I was in pretty bad shape, and didn’t leave the house most days, which eventually led into me flunking high-school.
During that time period, I played Starcraft II most of the day, which eventually ended up with me being semi-pro at the game, and I started making some decent money, the fact that I was good at the game, was the only reason I found at the time to not end my life.
When I finished high-school at 2011 I was drafted to the army (It is mandatory where I live) for 3 years as a combat soldier, and my shot at becoming a pro gamer full time ended, without me ever wanting it to. In the begging I really did feel like my life is over, and that now I have really have nothing to live for, and having a gun in my hand made it ever easier for me to think about that.
After about 2 weeks in boot camp, we had tests for Special Forces units, which my commander really pushed me to take, because he thought that I will fit well. I passed the test, and got accepted into a pretty good unit, and for the first time in my life I felt like I might actually be able to do something with my life, and also make some actual connections with people.
I started working on my social skills, read books, interact with people, made actual friends who accepted me for who I was, and made me realize that being different is a good thing, and that I should be thankful for that.
After 3 years, I got released from the army at 2014, and went to work in a different country so I could improve my social skill set, and to clean my head. The experience was incredible and I started to feel even more accepted as who I am.
After about 6 months, I came back to my home country, and that when stuff started going south again. My parents started pushing me into getting my high-school diploma, and go study at the university, which seemed like the right thing to do, because that was something that I always thought about, and I have already given up on going a full time gamer.
I studied for a year and a half to get my diploma, and failed, miserably. I never told my parents that I failed so many tests, because I didn’t want to disappoint them (think I passed the ones I took), and was afraid of their reaction. To be clear, my family is pretty cold, they never backed me up on anything, trusted me, or believed in me. My dad always saw me as the black sheep of the family, even after I did well in the army (I don’t think I can blame him from his perspective, because I was doing so poor in school, and all I did was play video games, which he saw and still sees as a waste of time), which is why I was so afraid to tell them that I’m doing so poor with my studies, during that whole time I was extremely depressed and under a lot of pressure.
At 2016 I went to a university counselor, who suggested that I would do 1 year of pre academic courses, and if I do well there, I could get into the university. I took his advice, decided to move away from home, and take the courses for a year. I met new friends (which was extremely hard), and for the first time in my life, I felt like I did not need my family approval, although I still felt a lot of pressure and was still depressed, but at least I was able to get up in the morning.
A year passed by, but I didn’t make it into the university because my grades weren’t good enough, even though I put all my heart into it, which made me feel like even more of a failure.  I got accepted into another place, and I decided to start studying there. The problem was that the university I started at, is pretty much all self-study at home, which meant no new people to make friends with.
All the friends I made during 2016 got accepted to where they wanted, and pretty much broke all contact with me, and I was ended up alone, because I had nowhere to make a new social group.
A month into the my studies I started feeling anxious all the time, couldn’t sleep and my depression got a lot worse, I didn’t get out of bed, couldn’t get myself to do anything, and only got up for work so I could afford a place to live at, which was extremely hard for me to do every time.
After about 6 months, I decided I need to do something, with myself, and started working at a bar to meet new people, which leads me to today. I feel really awkward with all the people there, who seem to better than me in every way, and I can’t seem to bond with any one there, all I feel is them looking at me like a weirdo, which just made my self-confidence go down even more.
Right now, I feel like there is nothing else for me to do to make things better, I have never had a girlfriend, anyone which I ever considered as a good friend left me, I’m doing bad at school, and I can barely get out of bed in the morning. I don’t see any reason to anything, and really can’t understand why I’m forcing myself to make things better, because it’s all meaning less, and everything I do ends up with failure, or me getting hurt even more. I don’t feel like I can talk to any of my family members about it, and telling them will probably make things worse, I have no friends who are willing to hear about what I’m feeling, and I also can’t afford a therapist.
I’m lost right now, I have no idea what’s my direction in life, I can’t sleep, I stopped doing almost any activity to try and make things better, I don’t see myself doing anything important with my life, and don’t feel like I’m ever going to find someone who could actually really feel love towards me.

56,"*Society tames the wolf into a dog. And man is the most domesticated animal of all.”  \-Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Friedrich Nietzsche*

The following ideas are a piece of ancient Toltec (a long\-gone society from Mexico) wisdom, brought to us by the author Don Miguel Ruiz. As a Toltec nagual (a healer), he wrote The Four Agreements, which you could read in just a few hours. It’s one of those books that has the ability to bring you a rush of peace as you turn every page.

There are hundreds of five\-star Amazon reviews for this book, and a few well\-written negative reviews that say, “This is all just common sense.” Well, our world might need a little more common sense right now. We strongly encourage you to pick up a copy of this book, because you’ll end up lending it out to your friends and family as soon as you finish it.

## WHY WE HAVE AN INNER CRITIC

Day one, you are born. Nice job, you nailed it. But you are now helpless, and so begins the process of domestication. For the next six to eight years, you are like a sponge. You are using your five senses to absorb everything from the world around you. Your parents and society do their best to reward and punish you to help mold your behavior so you don’t become a wild animal.

Who raised you, what lessons you were told, what behavior you actually observed, and how you were taught all have a massive influence on your programming. Sometimes (most of the time?) parents and society don’t do a perfect job. Once you’ve taken in enough information, and practiced enough behavior that makes you feel safe and makes your family proud, your process of domestication is almost complete. You begin to police yourself internally.

There’s nothing wrong with following the rules that help you live a good life within society. But that’s not all we do. We beat ourselves up. We constantly criticize ourselves. Don Miquel Ruiz calls this incessant nagging, accusing, internal voice we all have the Judge. Capital J.

## UNRAVELING YOUR RULES

Take a moment to recognize your own personal Judge. It will attack you at every weak point. It will try to break down your confidence and your contentment. It’s made to keep you in line. Who knows if that is good or bad for you specifically. But I think we can all agree that it would feel so good to be free from the Judge.

Most of us are insecure. Don’t let anyone’s bravado convince you differently. We judge ourselves more harshly than we ever would our friends. Before you can start to make positive changes in your thinking, you need to realize everything you believe down to your core is from this process of domestication and experience. That has nothing to do with what is ultimately true, just what is true for you.

Your views on money, good living, relationships, health, sexuality, spirituality, and yourself are all products of your environment. It seems quite overconfident to believe that you just happened to receive all the right answers, if there even are any. But once you realize this, you’re left feeling very lost. What are you supposed to believe? How are you supposed to guide your life? Enter religion, government, community, or articles like this. It’s all just our attempt to make sense of it all. We place no judgement here on any of those things. All of our views on these subjects change and solidify through time (based on our personal experience with them, of course). If all of this is so manipulatable, why don’t we start over from the beginning?

## WHY THE FOUR AGREEMENTS ARE SO POWERFUL

The four agreements are an attempt to bring you inner peace. They are an attempt at reprogramming. There have been thousands of attempts over the years, so don’t feel too bad if these don’t resonate with you. Look for another path that makes you feel good. But the power of the four agreements is undeniable. You can use them every day in every situation. They transcend “rules”, so you don’t have to toss out any old beliefs if you don’t want to do that yet. If you “agree” with them, and “do your best” to follow them, you can go to sleep every night with a clean conscience.

## THE FOUR AGREEMENTS

Here are the four agreements, taken directly from the book. Let’s go through them together.

**1. Be Impeccable With Your Word.**  
Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.

**2. Don’t Take Anything Personally.**  
Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.

**3. Don’t Make Assumptions.**  
Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.

**4. Always Do Your Best.**  
Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self\-judgment, self\-abuse, and regret.

## MOVING FORWARD

If you guys want, I founded Conquer Today, a platform that helps people with mental and lifestyle health. We support MHFA where I first got certified in mental health first aid. A while ago I wrote a full book I never released with 27 habits that can help you build what I call a ""stainless\-steel mind"" :P There's a [page where you can download that](https://conquer.today/kaizen-habits-27-skills-master-powerful-mind-body-life/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=kaizen+habits&amp;utm_content=kaizen+habits&amp;utm_term=mental+health) for free if you are into this kind of stuff.

As examples, the agreements are applicable from work to family. “Always do your best” helps you recover after a failed sales pitch you practiced for days. “Don’t make assumptions” will help you communicate and ask better questions before you destroy your relationship from insecurity. “Don’t take anything personally” will help you see the world more clearly over time.",10Jun2018,1
57,"I have been diagnosed as bipolar when I was a teen but never received regular care or stayed on meds for more than a couple months. I’ve had issues with chemicals in the past (alcohol mostly, dabbled in opioids) but I’ve been clean a while. I graduated college without any real direction, my major was elective studies... but I managed to maintain a 3.68 GPA.

I’m facing some problems though, chief among them is that I can’t afford treatment (last time I went it was 250$ 2x a month plus meds... my insurance doesn’t cover anything until I’ve spent over 6k out of pocket). Because I’m not being treated I’m not dealing with stress  well which is leading to recurring thoughts of suicide (I’ve attempted three times and had to be revived that last one).

To top it of my job is routinely a 60hr a week gig not counting the two hours of drive time a day. This is a huge source of my stress, I have always done better when I can be home with my kids and wife but being gone 72+ hours a week (there are regular 20+ hour days and my days off are split) means I feel like I’m never home. I’ve been tracking my sleep and average 5 hours on a work day.

I can’t leave my position because I can’t afford a massive pay cut of about 40% and I feel like most positions that pay over 50k are going to be either unavailable to me due to my lack of specific degree or require just as much or more of my time.

To make matters worse I work in an industry going through a lot of upheaval and change. Much of which is actively withheld from us until the day it’s implemented. I’ve heard rumblings my job may be on the chopping block and my sources have been 100% correct thus far. Doesn’t mean I’ll be out of a job necessarily but it would be much more competitive to stay in position and rather or not I stayed in role would be re-evaluated quarterly compared to all others in the same role. I’m just not built for the constant stress of that.

I’m afraid, afraid that I’m not going to be able to handle it anymore and just end it to gain peace. I hate my job, not what I do but the sacrifice required for what is really not great pay. 

TL:DR job is pushing my bipolar over the edge but feel stuck in a position that might not exist next year and can not afford treatment for my illness.",10Jun2018,1
58,"I am an empty person and honestly I'm getting sick of myself.  I still act like a teenager or immature early 20-something.  I have ideas, and things that sort of interest me, but none of these things are developed.  I'm not even sure what really interests me.

I'm a grown man and I'm still putting on a show all of the time.  I'm a dancing monkey.  Even in the developed intimate relationships I've had with people, where I've shared ideas, thoughts and feelings, I'm still very undeveloped and I know I'm always over compensating.  It's like an escape from my emptiness.  I'm also not a very funny person, and I'm too stupid to get some jokes.  I've never been able to connect with people.  My ex-friend, I hated him, and I could never connect, pretended to like him and be nice all the time just to fill a void.  I have had good friends in the past...this guy I don't know why.

I'm really sick of myself and I don't blame other people for being sick of me, or being uninterested in me.  I'm a terrible person.  I just don't know what I'm living for.  At best, it looks like I'm going to be in a marriage with someone I can't connect with (not that there's much to connect on...you see what I mean)...and I'm just going to work and eat and sleep until I die.  At worst, it'll be that, minus the unhappy marriage.",10Jun2018,3
59,"I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, PTSD, add, major clinical depression, and anxiety, I started my mental health journey after a suicide attempt at 18 and bounced between medications trying to find a combination that worked for about five years before deciding I wanted to try to fix myself without pharmaceutical drugs. I am in a wonderful relationship and my life is generally going well outside of money problems so I have been doing decently well controlling my issues until lately. The last maybe two months my depression and anxiety have been getting out of control. I’ve finally worked through it enough that I know it revolves around the feelings I have towards the state of society today. It sounds childish even to me but the fact that people are really mean to each other bothers me so deeply that I can’t figure out how to move past it. I don’t watch the news and I try to shelter myself from it as much as possible but even driving to the store and seeing how impatient other drivers are or how little they care for the other people on the road makes me feel physically ill. I don’t know really what I’m asking of you guys, I don’t have insurance so seeing a therapist isn’t really an option, maybe some tips on not being so sensitive to it all? I’ve always been an overly sensitive person but I’ve never really learned to cut it off. If I was to be able to afford therapy I don’t even know how I would explain this to a professional. Sorry that this is so jumbled I’m new to reddit plus thinking on the topic makes my brain work a lot faster than my fingers. ",10Jun2018,1
60,"Basically I’ve felt for a while that I may have an anxiety problem of some sort, but I can’t say for sure. Since the end of 2016, where I had a bout of depression, I feel I’ve never gotten back to my chipper, lively, motivated, productive self. I feel my base personality is to be worried about everything which gets in the way of following through with tasks or goals but I can’t tell if this is normal.

My fear is that if I were to seek therapy or something of the sort I will just be told I’m lazy or that there’s really nothing medically wrong with me, which I feel will make me feel more guilty and useless. Like I’m just not made to amount to anything. 

I already posted something similar on r/offmychest but thought I should post here too. ",10Jun2018,2
61,"So I started a job six months ago, and my boss wants me to attend a conference next year. I enthusiastically said yes, count me in! I'd been to one at a similar job in the past that was fun. I got to listen to presentations and share ideas.

Two months later and now he says he wants me to sign up/apply to present at the conference. Basically I have to come up with something interesting to talk about, present it, and represent my company. Boss is really into this stuff for ""professional development"" and ""company representation"". He's very excited and tried to brainstorm ideas with me.

My social anxiety is pretty bad already and this job (which I'm contemplating quitting anyway due to mental health reasons) is very stressful for me. I also suffer from really bad ""stage fright"" that has to do with being in front of crowds, being looked at, etc. I have bad panic attacks in situations in which I have to be in front of people in such a way. I often get very ill.

This is like adding super stressful bacon bits onto the shit salad that is my life right now.

I don't know how to talk to my boss about it without revealing too much. Does anyone have any advice/suggestions? Thank you for reading.",10Jun2018,3
62,"I don't normally talk about this since most of the people around me try to shame me into feeoing bad about myself and always like playing the blame the victim card. I feel i must give a few years of detail to fully explain.
I am 24 years old, from the United States, and I am the victim of extreme helicopter parenting. Because of that, its been increasingly harder to try to become independent. My father is from the baby boomer generation and doesnt believe that mental problems really even exist and tries tell me all the time that I have no reason to be depressed despite a horribly traumatizing event happening to me as a child(that he knows about) and my mother suddenly leaving while i was still in school.
The traumatic event in my life caused me to develop a pretty bad case of what I believe to be agoraphobia(never could get diagnosed with anything because my dad thinks that its normal to stay locked in your room for 16 hours a day or more). Because of this, I receded into my room and lost a lot of friends during high school when it started developing. My mother left during my senior year, and thats when a lot of my problems really started happening, because until that year, my my mom did everything for me. I wasn't allowed to do much of anything in my house unless my mother did it for me, and her sudden disappearance basically caused me to shut down; it was what fully drove me into seclusion from society because I didn't know how to do anything a normal 18 year should know how to do, and i hadn't ever had a job, so i couldn't even adapt to society.
After failing to get jobs for a while, I tried to get into the military since it was my last resort for anything, but i failed even doing that, and after that happened, my dad started to seemingly take out his frustrations on me with constant verbal assaults, one of his favorites was comparing me to my brother, who he thinks of as a person that's a walking failure. So, using my own brother's unfortunate life as a way to try to manipulate me into being someone he saw as a success, but even that failed and he took me off of insurance so I couldn't even go to the doctor anymore unless it costed less than 50$.
My mother eventually stepped into my life again, but she's barely better than my dad. My mother and my brother both think that depression is a state of mind rather than something debilitating for some.
Over the years, I've gotten only slightly better about leaving the house, but I'm only able to leave with someone I know, and even then, my body shakes a lot from my nerves in public. I can't manage to keep a job when I eventually get one because my dad constantly verbslly abuses me and guilt trips me until I quit. I eventually developed something similar to an eating sisorder because I experienced something scary when I had a bad strep throat and now I can't even eat unless someome is in the house with me.
Now we reach the main problem with my household: my dad got a girlfriend 2 years ago and starts acting like he's the cock of the walk whenever she's around, trying to assert his dominance over his own son because he seems threatened by me for some reason and acts like the alpha male when she is around, despite the fact that he knows I have no interest in women. During these past 2 years, I've been forced to listen to my dad and his girlfriend have loud sex for 8 hours a day every weekend since January 2016. I vehemently hate my dad's girlfriend because of this and he wont soundproof his bedroom, gag her, or even get me something to drown out the noise since I dont own noise cancelling headphones.
Because or being forced to listen to them every weekend for 2+ years, I fear i might actually be developing something and ig worries me because i don't harbor any positive feeling about my father anymore. Im starting to have large panic attacks whenever i hear them having sex and my depression has gotten even worser because of it and i have no where to go or get help from.

I dont know what to do anymore and it makes me feel awful.",10Jun2018,3
63,I’m a 17 year old girl. This is the summer before my senior year. I’m in a really really bad place right now and I don’t know if I can get out and I just really need help. Every day I wake up and just wait in my bed until nighttime so I can go back to sleep. Recently all of my friends shut me out and I tried to reconcile with them but they didn’t want to. I’ve lost all motivation and happiness and every night I just sit on the floor of my bedroom and smoke and drink a bottle of whiskey my sister gave me until I cry and eventually pass out.

65,"I've been thinking about something lately.

Whenever I meet someone for the first time, if I get a bad vibe from them or have a sketchy feeling in my stomach, I immediately know I'm not going to click with them. Or if I enter a work place, a room or something I immediately feel if it's hostile or friendly.

And then I end up being right. This has happened to me a couple of times already and I don't think it's a coincidence. I recently had a falling out with a colleague at work and I was reminded how uneasy I felt meeting her the first time. She wasn't doing anything wrong, she was being really nice and likable and we got along well. But I had this weird feeling in my stomach that I couldn't pinpoint what it was. She was nice and reasonable, so why was I feeling like this? I didn't know much about her either, so it's not like there was something previously I could attach to this weird feeling.

Watch and behold, I was told by three other work colleagues that she told them she finds me insecure and that I'm trying to be funny when I'm not. Obviously it hurt to hear this since I'm an insecure 22 yo trying to make the best of life and she is 29 and have lots of experience so obviously her words carry some weight. They assured me they don't see me like that at all, and that they find me funny as hell. It encouraged me but I still think about this, it's going to stay with me for a longer period of time. I try to stay away from her. I'm still polite and I say hi and talk just like usual but I'm trying not to interact with her much more than I need to.

And now it seems relevant to think back to when I first met her and felt odd and weird. Was that my intuition telling me I'm not going to click with her and that she doesn't have friendly motives at heart?

This has happened a couple of times already and I'm not sure if I'm making it up or if I could really tell just by meeting someone for the first time how it's going to develop. I was at an internship for three weeks last month and the first day I started there I could tell there was some sort of animosity ingrained into the place, and after those three weeks were finished me and my study mate who also had her internship there felt like shit because of how our advisors treated us.

Does anyone recognize this? Do you think it's possible to tell how a friendship or work related relationship is going to develop just by meeting and interacting with someone for the first time? And I don't mean in terms of making a good or bad impression. It's more like a fleeting feeling you have in the back of your mind.

I've also had one instance where I didn't get this correct but it was more situational and we both acknowledged we felt the same thing. We are now close friends. She said it was kind of amazing that I could tell and pinpoint exactly how she felt, like I could read her mind or something.

I feel abnormal about this, I'm sucking up everyones emotions and I feel like a fungus. I get intense anxiety by all of this. Could it be a mental illness or something? ",10Jun2018,1

69,"Ever since I was maybe 11 I have believed that my father put cameras around my house and sewed microphones into my jackets and my backpack. I've thought that he hires people to follow me around and give him information on what I'm doing. There's only a few places where I know there aren't cameras, and those are really the only few places I feel safe. 

I've also been convinced for a long time that certain people have wanted to kill me, mainly my boyfriend's best friend. He works at a Chipotle, which I will refuse to go into on days he is working out of fear that he will poison my food. Once I attempted suicide because I thought it would make him happy. There's a few other people who I think want to kill me but at the moment, it's mainly my boyfriend's friend. 

I've never brought any of these fears up to anybody else before, but a couple days ago, I spoke to my boyfriend about it. He said I sounded delusional and I should go to a doctor. He said he loves me and that he's worried about me now that he knows how ""paranoid"" I am. I told him that I don't plan on seeing a doctor, because I don't think that my fears are irrational at all. Honestly, I am just rather hurt that he didn't believe me when I said that these things are all true. He said I must have some sort of disorder and I should consider therapy. I'm sure he's talking about PPD. I can't have some sort of paranoid personality disorder, though, because I have an active social life.

71,"I'm 19 Ok, I have generalized anxiety disorder. I haven't been taking any medication or therapy for it, I've just been dealing with it. But I also have problems with memory, reading comprehension and attention. Reading a book for class is so hard, after every few sentences my head feels like I'm studying calculus or something it feels heavy. It takes me a long time to read a book, which is weird because just last year I was reading 2 books a week in High School with perfect recollection of the story. But now that I'm in College I can't even read a paragraph without feeling overwhelmed or forgetting 90% of what I read. I know you may think ""that's because college is harder, silly!"" But the books I've been reading in college aren't hard at all, in fact they are barely AP Highschool level in some subjects. It's just so hard to think even at home when I'm not doing college work. I don't know what's wrong with me.

ALSO, I lose interest very quickly..whether it be hobbies, tv shows, movies or whatever. I get bored too easily and I often find myself multi tasking. I have no idea what I wanna do with my life and I am testing out various passions and interests but they all seem to bore me eventually. So do I also have ADHD? Or is this and the reading problems a symptom of anxiety also? I also have been deeply depressed since early High School (had a bad concussion around same time), don't know why. Maybe my depression sprouted from my anxiety and being a loner and having to move around every 3 years.  I haven't actually attempted suicide I just wish I could die. And the days I wish I could die greatly outnumber the days I am happy (I am happy when I'm hanging with friends swimming or playing sports)

So I tried fixing all of these problems with marijuana. It made me drowsy and fix my depression and anxiety. But it just made my focus and reading problem worse (until the weed wore off). How do I fix anxiety, which is fixed with like a sedative, when I also need  a fix for my adhd which needs a stimulant? How do I fix my life? I don't know much longer I can take this shit.

My older sister died when I was 6 I can remember crying at school.

My dad raised me he was quite harsh on me growing up he would beat me, call me names and spit on me in anger. He was a good man and a good dad though. I was also bullied at school.

My dad got cancer when I was 13 which was very tough. I became extremely depressed with extreme anxiety, I used to masturbatr 5-10 times a day and I started smoking. 

When I was 14 my sister who was drunk decided to tell me that her and my other sister were sexually abused when they were 3 years old by our mums ex boyfriend. She was that drunk she even went into detail. I felt sick.

When I was masturbating my dog kept trying to lick my penis. Every night I would push him away but one day he managed to lick it and as sick as it sounds it must have felt nice. I let him do it whilst thinking of a girl and it went from that to me pushing my penis in his mouth. I did this on 3 spectate occasions and stopped due to guilt. He WAS NOT in pain but was definitely uncomfortable. 

My dad died when I was 15 and I went into care.

I am now 22 and I feel physically ill knowing I did that. I would never hurt an animal and hate sexual abuse with a passion. I just can’t believe I did that. I feel like I should be hanged.

79,"Hey guys! I’m on a throwaway to use this thread just in case someone I know finds my main. So I kinda need your advice on something. A while back, when I was at the doctor’s, they told me that I should probably see a therapist or counselor soon because I’m showing some worrying symptoms (consistently low self esteem, thoughts of self harm, etc.) but they said it wasn’t quite a huge problem yet. We got a list of local therapists, along with some recommendations, and that was pretty much it. 

I know my parents now are more okay with the idea of me getting help than they were a couple years ago (mom’s pressing me to accept the idea that I should get therapy- quite a change from her yelling at me for a full hour last time the doctor said I needed help) but they’re not really talking about it the way they talk about orthodontist or dermatologist appointments, so I’m fairly certain they’ve forgotten, or it’s not very important to them/as high a priority.

They don’t know the full extent of my thoughts/problems/whatever you want to call it though. I minimized some stuff on a technicality at the doctor’s when they did the mental health screen (I technically haven’t attempted suicide- I just came very close to trying but never actually did, and I’m probably always tired and apathetic because of school stress so I wrote down “none at all”, etc.). My parents know of one (mom suspects another) instance of self harm but they don’t know that it was actually way more than twice, and they know I very much dislike myself and think the world would be better off without me but they don’t know how often I daydream of killing myself (usually a few times a week, and with fairly detailed plans). I also lied to the doctor and said that I would try to approach somebody for help if I was feeling suicidal- obviously, that’s not gonna happen. 

Other things they don’t know is that 1) their support really isn’t helping because they’re saying they love me and care about me, but I know for a fact that they’re homophobic and will likely cut me off or harass me if I come out, so I can’t believe them when they offer their support, 2) I literally broke down crying in all three periods one day last week and had to leave class for about an hour because I was hyperventilating and couldn’t form a coherent sentence, 3) nothing is very fun anymore, save for a handful of internet/game things because of the distraction, and 4) there’s all of maybe 2-4 people keeping me alive because I don’t want to hurt them, but at this point I think they’d get over it anyways. 

And that’s where we stand. They know I’m bad at academic pressures (I go to a fairly prestigious program for STEM/scientific research so I can’t get a tutor to help in my trouble subject, and my teacher for said subject usually yells at me if I ask for clarification because “I should know it”) and they know I have some history of self harm and a very strong history of low self esteem, but they don’t know how extensive the self harm is and just how much I think about suicide. My question to you guys is this: do you think I should get help? I can provide more details if needed, but I feel like this is plenty. The second question is: if you do think I need help, how on earth am I going to bring this up to my parents? 


If you got this far, thank you so much for reading this. It means a lot that some random person on the internet would care enough to read my long, pointless rant. ",10Jun2018,1

Bit of back story, I’m 31. Grew up with a lovely mum and dad. Holidays galore. Mum got sick. Died 5 years later horrifically. I was 18 and had just had my first child. 
My son was diagnosed with 1p36 Deletion Syndrome. I coped mostly alone until I met my husband. I had my beautiful daughter then fell pregnant with my second son. 
At 16 weeks pregnant I went to get my son up for school (he was 9) and he was dead.
It’s been four years and my to remaining children are wonderful and healthy. 
Now to the noise. 
For years I have heard what I thought was a TV from a neighbors house. Until I moved to a detached bungalow. There it was every night, the same newscaster type voice (varies between male and female or both) but always that same monotone voice. It’s always muffled so I can’t hear what they are saying. I put it all down tinnitus or some shit. Until now. 
Three days ago I heard an air raid siren, it woke me at 6am and eventually stopped after 12:30 pm. Thing is no one else heard it! I asked neighbors, Facebook, tweeted the local news and even contacted the non emergency police number. No one heard it, there was no such thing. But to me it was as real as anything I’ve ever heard. 
Is this auditory hallucinations or what is happening.
I feel like I’m losing my mind here ",10Jun2018,1
81,"So I want to be traumatised, mentally ill, full of despair basically, events have took place in my past that should be enough to scar someone but unfortunately not me, I don't really know how to get it cause all of the searches are just how to fix them. So gimme some ways on how to destroy myself. I'll be willing to sacrifice a lot

(PS. I have gone to therapists in the past and they didn't understand so I gave up on that and decided to embrace it doesn't matter what people say)",10Jun2018,1
82,"It's very difficult for me to get what im trying to say in writing so please, bear with me. I've noticed that in conversation, I always say what the other person wants to hear, not what Im really thinking. Im 21 and I have done this for as long as I can remember. Im not really sure of what kind of person I am or what my true opinions are. I've molded myself to be what I think others want me to be and what they would find acceptable. If people ask me what kind of person I am, I dont really have a clear answer, as Im not really sure myself. I have always been shy and have always struggled with social interaction and making friends. I dont really have a normal attitude/ personality. Some days im either a jokey fun guy, or im incredibly shy and quiet. It bothers me to end. Im not sure what to do at this point, it's almost like im living my life for everyone else. I have no goals or motivation to better myself and Im at my wits end. Im sorry I type like a child but Im very distraught and lost.",10Jun2018,1
83,"She doesn't write anything down during the sessions and has never mentioned anything about recording it. Also, after our very first appointment she had a client immediately after me. She walked me to the front and brought her second client back. There was no way she could have written anything down before seeing her next client. I really unloaded on her too. It was a lot of information so I'm just wondering how she remembers it? Ive seen her 4 times now and she has never written anything down or mentioned recording a single time.",10Jun2018,8
84,"Yesterday (Saturday) I sent the text to about 5 friends of 'I'm so sorry'. 

I was 100 feet away from the bridge I planned to jump from. Alcohol-fuelled I called a helpline which broke the mental trance I seem to find myself in these days. Never have I came so close... 

It was only a few hours before that I told my friends I'm suicidal and self-harming. Years of an eating disorder, anxiety, depression, and slight alcoholism have taken its toll. I need help.

I've sought help from my GP before but walked away with a few pills and a 6-month waiting list for therapy. I know now that in the next 3 months I'll be 6ft under or on the road to recovery.

I've just started my dream job, for once I like where I am! How do I speak to work about taking time off? How do I go to my GP again without having the same brush off? How do I tell my friends and family that I've planned my death in about 10 different scenarios? 

I'm not at rock bottom... That only has two outcomes with a 50/50 survival rate.

What shall I do? I don't want to lose my job, and yet my friends or family aren't the most sharing of characters. I don't want to seem like a failer.

85,"I've spent so long battling with my shit. I've been told I've inherited my mental health from my dad who had schizophrenia. He mentions how he wishes he got help sooner and I'm so scared my fate is sealed. 

I attempted last year but my boyfriend got to me before I was dead. I told the doctors, they told me to self refer myself to a mental health service. I did. 8 months later I am told I can have group therapy. I couldn't afford to go to it, to be honest I couldn't afford to get to any therapy I would have been offered. My doctors have offered me medication but I don't want to be on it my whole life and what if it doesn't work either ? I'm already on birth control for the foreseeable future. I'm not happy about that. 

I don't know what options I have left right now. I'm spending every day fighting for something I don't want any more. Please tell me there's another option. ",10Jun2018,1
86,"one of my friends recently told me while drunk, that he had had uncontrolable anger for a longer period of time when he was in his early teens. he said that he had thrown his head into doors and walls repeatably and threatened his mother. he was still experiencing symptoms but they were weak enough to be controlable. does anyone know what this could be? Sounds like a mental illness.
thought of IED but im not sure, anyone recognise something like this?",10Jun2018,1
