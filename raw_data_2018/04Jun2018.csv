0,"Okay, sometimes I have a grass is greener mentality. So I need a little outside perspective.

Here's a little background: 
I'm a college student dealing with postpartum depression.
My husband and I lost our baby at 6 months of pregnancy.
We live in a very small basement apartment that is a little dingy, not well lit, no carpet, all white walls, kind of stinky, a tiny bit infested, but half the price of rent that you can find on average in my area.
 
So here's what I'm thinking about that I need a little input on.

I really want to move to a nicer, carpeted apartment. Hell, maybe something with a dishwasher and/or a washer and drier. I've always been someone who enjoys having my space be neat and cleanly, and I never feel like this place is clean. There's this part of me that honestly believes that moving would help me be happier. 

On the other hand, it is so wonderful to have such affordable rent. I feel like rent is throwing money away, and it's nice to only have to throw away half as much and we thought we'd have to before finding this place. It's a huge stress reducer. It's hard to justify paying more because I don't know if moving would really help me cope with my depression or not.

TLDR: do you think moving to a slightly nicer apartment would have real positive effects on my ability to deal with depression? Or am I just seeing the grass as greener on the other side?",04Jun2018,2,

How to win an argument for people who claim mental illness exists
u/IConqueredLife
Just ask them, is homosexuality a mental illness? They normally respond with no it isn’t, because. Errr because.. because there was historical prejudice against homosexuality back then!

Then you respond with well there’s a clear behavioural difference, between a homosexual and heterosexual, they talk differently, they dress differently, they have less socially constructured. mannerisms, assiocated with being masculine, and manly. And look demographically, they’re an anomaly they only make up 7% of sexuality in the world, see they’re “abnormal” you then tell them it was voted out of existence of the dsm, because of social and political change of acceptance of “homosexuality” thus proving that social behaviour does not consistute an “illness” of the mind.",04Jun2018,0,

I'll update more later today on how hes feeling. All he has told me so far is that he feels his mind has been quite muggy lately and that he feels detached. 
I have a history of dissociating. I was emotionally abused until I was 17 years old when I moved out. I go to a therapist regularly and take Prozac for my anxiety and depression. Its very hard for me to be open emotionally but I've been working hard for years now and have become more and more successful.
Currently, I am in the most serious relationship I've ever been in. We've been dating nearly 6 months now and I find myself dissociating more and more. 
I believe its because I'm getting closer to him thats making it difficult for me. My mind will take anything slightly negative he says slightly out of context and bounce around in my head for hours. I have to walk myself through that conversation and everything that he means to me to convince myself he isn't going to hurt me or that he hates me. 
I'm very controlled emotionally. If I am attacking him in my head I never voice that to him. Because I know in that frantic moment all my thoughts are not how I really feel and I never want to make him feel less. 
He's a very supportive and loving boyfriend and I just want the best for us. 
Any help to get out of this loop would much appreciated. ",04Jun2018,0,

6,"I keep having these thoughts that I want to hurt people and kill people but I don't genuinely want to do it.

7,"For a few months I've been supporting my brother through some serious depression.  We talk about an hour a day, text, and sometimes I drive the four hours to visit him for the weekend.  In my heart, I feel like it's my responsibility to do anything I can to make him healthy, but this puts me at edge at all times.  I am always on call and my own anxiety is starting to come back despite the exercise that usually keeps it in check.  

Most importantly, whenever he mentions that he's not taking his medication, not going to appointments, or not exercising or something like that I get furious.  I feel like I'm putting so much of myself into helping him to the point that my mental health and personal life is suffering and he isn't trying.  I know maybe he can't do more, but that is how I feel in the moment. 

How do you handle this, people who have been through it?  The only alternate perspective I can think of to ""if I don't get him to do healthy things I basically killed him"" is ""he's killing himself by not doing these things and I can't help"", which seems like an awful belief to have.",04Jun2018,1,

9,"Finally graduating High school I would like to take this time to thank you. With you as principal for three years I can honestly say that you are a very reasonable and understanding man who does his job the right way. Talking to anyone in the school no one ever has anything negative to say about you, and as a principal, that isn’t easy. As a student it was always supportive to see you at my basketball games and honor society inductions and although I’ve never really had any extended conversations with you, \(Just casual hellos and small talk\) it’s because of your reputation that I feel comfortable to reach out to you now. 

I’m not quite sure if you know me by name but incase you don’t I’ll just give you my background. Since I started school two things have always been important to me: Academics and sports \(And in that order\). Throughout my four years at School I’ve accumulated a 96.89 average, placing me in the top 10&amp;#37; of the class, and scored in the 99th percentile of the math section of the SAT with a 780. I’ve taken 7 Honors classes and 6 APs and will be attending Northeastern University next school\-year. From these four years of classes at School the most unique experience has been the new friendships I have been able to make through these more challenging classes that my original friends don’t take. You see, my interest in sports at a young age was fundamental in the building of these “original friendships”, many of which are still intact. While I don’t mean to generalize these friends of mine, they definitely have more of a focus on sports and their personal social life \(I think you know what I mean\). So What I’m trying to say is that I believe the people I talk to on a daily basis at School is far more diverse \(In Regards to personality &amp; interests\) than your ordinary Student.

The reason I tell you my background is so you see how many would envision my overall experience at MHHS. I’ve managed to thrive academically while being athletic enough to play three varsity sports \(choosing to play only one in order to balance my heavy school work\). I’ve got a great supportive family that has given me the comfort and flexibility to keep focussed on school/sports without ever having to worry financially. From an outsider's perspective my life seems great but the reason I tell you all this is because no matter how fortunate I’ve been my entire life, there is one obstacle that I, like many others, kept to myself: **Mental Health/Illness**

Mental Health has been all over the news this year. With the many school shootings that have occured this year, every school, including MHHS has been forced to respond. From what I have noticed, measures include locked doors, supervised car visits, and the staff directly in front of the main door. While I can’t give MHHS the straight up solution given the fact that it is a national debate with no one solution, I do believe much of this issue begins with mental health. Mental health has always been somewhat a taboo, and from what I’ve noticed in high school this is still true. No one likes to admit that they have a problem, especially when it could result in a change in how others think about you. There have been times where I wished I could have talked to a school counselor, but first I wasn’t even sure if there was such a counselor and second, I would have had a hard time bringing myself to that door. As a result I’ve tried self medicating and coping with my with my difficulties individually, and from what I can tell you this is rarely effective. 

Mental health is nothing new but I believe so much about it is changing. First it is becoming a larger issue than ever. Between 2007\-2015 the suicide rate between 15\-19 year olds has shot up 31&amp;#37; in males and more than doubled in females after years of decreasing. I know you’ve seen many students, myself included, wearing a blue wristband this year that never should have been worn. This terrible incident that happened at the middle school level is filled with kids that will be attending MHHS, replacing my graduating class. I’d say students have had a constant access and addiction to smartphones that contain social media and so much more for six or so years. That makes the class of 18’ one of two or three classes that have gone through high school with the addiction that is the smartphone. And from now on each class that enters MHHS will become more addicted to these, resulting from phone usage at younger ages with only more social media platforms. From my own experience, I know for a fact that these phones are the root cause and in the coming years these statistics are only going to get worse. The second change you are going to see, if you haven’t already, is a more open acceptance to mental illness. In fact the most influential reason I’m reaching out to you, besides the possibility of it helping others, is the openness of the issue from two NBA players Kevin Love and Demar Derozan. Both of these athletes seem to  live extremely comfortable lives, making millions annually while being idolized by people around the globe. Yet this struggle has never left their life and by being open about their own problems they are  loosening this taboo and stigma around the issue that is mental illness. Another, more obvious, example of this is the creation of mental health week in gym class which was created maybe two years ago. My main point that I would like to get across to you is that mental health and illness are becoming more of an issue that can affect anyone and  your actions can improve Morris knolls in a number of ways.

First, and as I’m sure you know, more help in regards to mental illness would make MHHS a safer place. In addition, I truly believe that it would result in stronger grades from many students. I know from my experience that when experiencing any swing of depression my grades immediately took a hit. Thank You for taking the time to read this and if you’d like to talk I’m willing to. Below I’ll bullet some possible actions that can be taken as well as the three articles regarding the statistics and Love/Derozan. 

\-More open discussion from teachers

\-Assemblies

\-Let students know where to go

\-Mental health/illness awareness class \(more than a few health blocks\)

\-Have counselors check up \(look for dips in grades\)",04Jun2018,7,
10,"Hi there. I’m currently an undergrad student at a well known (to be stressful) business school. Every year they put on a mental health awareness week around the time of fall finals. It has consistently had low attendance, not surprisingly as it isn’t very entertaining, interesting, or adding much value. I have a passion for the topic and give it the upmost importance. Consequently, I would really like to revamp the program. 

If you have any ideas:
To draw students to the events
What kind of events should be put on
Advice on what should be taught
Handouts available at the events
General experiences with mental health that you feel comfortable sharing and wish more people were aware of, such as factors or signs of stress, that are often overlooked 
Truly any “value add” comments/ideas/criticism would be greatly appreciated

I’d love to help people enjoy every part of college, including the work, and love themselves in the process. I have been so extensive research and have put on many similar, smaller scale programs, however this topic is so vast I really wanted to open this up to as many people I could come in contact with. Thank you so much, everything is much appreciated.

Have a lovely day!

11,"I have been on this roller coaster for over 10 years now.  It started with anxiety. Fair enough I had a stressful childhood, screwed me up, but who hasn’t?

Eventually my counselor and psychiatrist say I am depressed.  I was chronically tired, foggy, but I was also taking pills for anxiety...

So began my SSRI journey.  Now I have depression so the experts say, but the pills eventually stop working.  My moods did not seem normal...

So I was labeled with a mood disorder, and without being properly diagnosed as bipolar, they added now a mood stabilizer to my diet.  I now needed to get blood work.  Now my only emotion was anger.

Anger which is a side affect of several of the pills I was one. But no I may be bipolar, so instead of taking away they add an anti psychotic. And my psychiatrist officially says I’m bipolar, rapid cycling and or mixed effective... whatever F code they need to enter to spill more drugs down my throat.

I gained over 50 pounds.  I fell asleep at the wheel. I went 2 seperate Times unemployed for 6 months for my mental health.

Today I finally weined off my SSRI ( took 6 months) I’ve been off my stabilizers and antipsychotics. I’m still on benzos but I’m addicted to them. A long battle will pursue.

I look back and i had a stressful childhood. I needed to talk. But they diagnosed and drugged me. They took away all my emotions.

The other day I stood in the rain and just enjoyed being alive, I have wasted so much of my life.  My emotions are scary because I haven’t felt them in so long. But I’m so happy. And sad, and angry, and all the other feelings I missed. My diagnosis is alive. ",04Jun2018,4,
12,"Long story short I am just always so angry, unhappy, apathetic, worried, and jealous. I feel like I am living in a tailspin right now. I know that I suffer from some bad social anxiety but could I also be depressed? Nothing seems to bring joy to my life anymore and it is so frustrating. I'm 21 and in college and everyone I know is living their lives and thriving socially, yet I dread having to wake up the next day to work/go to school/ or to social gatherings. I can even dread these things weeks in advance. At the same time I want to have a more fulfilling life. Recently one of my roommates moved out to go live with his gf and I got so angry and envious inside. I felt like the bond they have is something I'll never have and it made me mad and unhappy. I have have made no lasting and meaningful friendships since coming to college and all of my relationships outside of my family feel very surface level. I do want to see either a psychiatrist or a therapist but it really intimidates me and I have a lot of traumatic things that I need to unpack. I just know that I am SO unhappy and miserable and I realize that I have not been happy in a very very long time. 

Does anyone know what I should do? Sorry if this kind of jumbled or unclear. I can clarify anything to anyone that has advice to offer. ",04Jun2018,1,

I had nightmares and wouldn’t go to friends’ houses because I was scared that they’d have it at their house.

I avoid things that might be potentially scary for me (including medical things, dystopian movies, etc.) Currently I’m terrified of climate change and it’s caused me to back up photos onto many platforms and create an emergency backpack among other things in fear that my house will be affected. I’m terrified of losing important things like memorabilia and whatnot. The fear comes and goes, but it becomes triggered usually when someone talks about climate change or if I see stuff about it on the news.

Tonight my brother called me and told me he cut himself with a kitchen knife. At first I thought he meant he cut himself cooking but when I went to his house I saw five very deep cuts on his arm and an slash in the middle running through all of them. There was blood everywhere, on the floor, on the knife, in the kitchen, and in the bathroom. 

He was crying so I gave him a hug and he thanked me over and over again for coming over. I tried to convince him to go to the ER because he should get stitches but he refused. He doesn’t want anyone one to question how he got the cuts. I helped him clean up the cuts and wrapped his arm up. He told me not to tell anyone especially our parents. I wanted to spend the night at his place but he wanted to go to bed since he has to go to work tomorrow. I told him I’d call him first thing in the morning.

I really don’t know what to do. He’s 23, living on his own, having relationship issues, and drinking issues. He’s going through a lot and it breaks my heart.

21,"I've had this weird emotion in my chest/head coming and going for literally as long as I can remember. It's like how we all get sad sometimes, sometimes I have this indescribable feeling that I don't have a name for. 


I am a young adult female with mild depression and anxiety. When I am alone at night I sometimes get this deep emotional pain in my chest and I don't know what it is or why it's there. It's not anxiety/depression feels (I know how they feel). I literally just feel like my chest is heavy and like I am reaching mentally for something but I don't know what it is. Sometimes the feeling spreads to my wrists, too, and I feel it stronger. It's like a mental itch I can't scratch in a way because I know I am reaching for something/longing for something but I have no clue what it is that I actually want. Or how to figure this out. 


When it hits I can still continue on with whatever I was doing normally, like browsing reddit/watching TV, but I will just now have the feeling in my chest. I think it's bad and I think I want to get rid of it.


When I feel like this, or rather when I feel this ""pain"", I usually try to write some fiction. It feels like I can reach whatever it is I'm reaching for when I write but I never do. I also eat usually, and it can numb the emotion. Sometimes instead of writing this weird feeling pulls me to walk in the woods alone and think deeply about life. I almost feel like I am being pulled at these times (though I am still in control) to write something or walk or lay in bed or eat.

Anyways, I initially started going to see him for my depression, and since we just focused on that, I realized I have neglected to bring up other mental abnormalities I have experienced my whole life. I just feel like it’s too late in the process to bring it up now. I’m scared he won’t believe me. 

I’ve recently become aware that I have had some delusions and strange ways of thinking. It’s gotten worse since I finished high school a few years ago. For example, I frequently forget where or who I am and what year it is. It only lasts for a few seconds, but it’s still scary. I’ll see a stranger in public and think they look like someone I know, but then as I see their face several more times, I can’t tell if it’s really the specific person or not. I just feel like I’m kinda losing touch with reality. I have imaginary friends, a newly developed stutter, and disorganized speech. 

I’m worried to bring this up in my next appointment because not only do I fear it’s too late to mention, but I’m also very embarrassed of these issues. What if he thinks I’m just making it up since I never mentioned it before? I think part of me doesn’t want to be diagnosed with something horrible. I don’t want to be seen as stupid or whatever.

I suffer from clinical depression and multiple kinds of anxiety disorders so struggling with sleep is nothing new to me, but most of the time it's just because I'm sad about my own life, stressed, or afraid.

But now I've found that at night instead of that stuff, I instead get swept up with things I hear stupid people say and believe on the internet, or just things that are happening in the world of the internet in general. And at night I'll find myself staring at my ceiling in bed mumbling to myself how stupid those things are and why people can't just be more open minded and smarter. Unlike soms people, I really don't like feeling angry. Especially if it's over something that doesn't even really matter (since it's the internet lol) and it's only hurting me in the process. I can feel it drain me away even though I know it's dumb to do in the first place. I guess I've always been just kind of a sensitive person in general which can make things harder to let go, not to mention my parents (yeah I'm a teen btw) don't let me leave the house almost ever, so the internet is the only thing I can do during the day to connect with anyone at all, but even when I try to cut how much I go on it, no matter what, I always seem to come across something that makes me go to bed upset.

29,"Here's my problem, I don't really know where to start with all this. I have bipolar disorder type 2 and pretty bad anxiety. I thought I had it all together last year, and that my previous treatments had gone well. My last hypo mania phase was from about May 2017\-October 2017. I signed up for all these leadership rolls at my college, and had a full course load. I'm a decent student, so I knew it would only be a bit of a challenge for me. I had this group of friends, i love them all to death but one person in particular started to really get to me. we all would hang out and smoke pot together, but for some reason this one girl \(who has her own serious mental health problems\) basically made sure my hypo mania phase had ended and i was going back into a depressive state. since this was during a difficult semester for me, i ended up finishing all my roles and classes at a sub par level. me and this girl, we have so much in common, and i think i was really scared of becoming like her that i slightly did. I had a really really bad trip one night while smoking weed alone, and I've honestly been changed person since then.

 this last semester started off fine, I had A's in all my classes but then in the middle something really changed with me. I was no longer able to sit down and write a paper like i had before. I still really can't, and my university work from last semester is sitting idly by. I have a 10 page research paper i have to do soon or risk failing the class, and i have 2 reporting assignments due. I sought out medication thinking that it was just from me being off depressants during a depressive phase but even then i couldn't do the work. I lied to my teachers saying i was getting therapy and had gone to the hospital, but really i was just sitting at home blatantly ignoring my work and making my life so much harder for me. breakdowns at this point happened almost daily. like full fledged panic attacks, mostly about my future and how utterly lost i feel in my chosen major and any and all career paths related.

I tried to talk with my mom about my problems, but she kinda just ignored it all and said ""want to go to Hawaii?"" and of course I said okay. I was honestly really happy, and relaxed there. the second i got back to reality i almost threw up on the subway cause of how much i didn't want to be back. tomorrow i start another class, while still having a backlog from the previous semester. oh it's also 3:30am and my class is at 10:45am. 

 I know i have to go to therapy or something, but i'm so over that stuff. honestly, i really feel the need to go to an inpatient facility or something that's not once a week meetings. it's getting really bad, like everything is. I need a live re\-haul of my priorities or else i feel like i'll never be able to get over this stuff in my head. i don't want to die but sometimes it feels like it's the only option for a reset that i need. i'm scared. it's all in my head but i can't get over anything. i really don't know what to do. i could really use some advice.

It’s kind of hard to describe exactly how my behavior differs from most people but like for example I’ve never understood platonic love the only people I’ve ever had any sort of affection for were sexual partners -even that I never stick with it because I find something I dislike about them eventually or I get bored of them -like my family which are by all measureable accounts fine they help me out and go out of their way to do so etc I don’t care about anymore then I care about someone I’ve just met on the street and I do have empathy and compassion for other human beings in general I even feel not really guilty but still bad that I can’t bring myself to care about my family even after they’ve made it clear they care for me I think it’s very similar to sociopathy but not exactly the same I’m not a professional so fuck if I know 

I’m always pretending every time I’m around another person im putting on an act to make them think I’m no different then they are because all I really want is to be left alone and I know the more different someone is the more attention that garners and I fear that if other people figure out I’m a little off that they’ll try and make me change to fit with the norm 

I guess it boils down to while humans are supposed to be social animals I for some reason have never enjoyed in fact I despise a ton of things most people really enjoy like
- talking to people
- being touched 
- spending time around other people
(Oh one thing that’s more abstract is other people making noise like if I hear someone talking off in the distance the sound of it gets under my skin like nails on a chalk board)
The exceptions to this being someone I’m attracted to 

Oh and one thing I forgot to touch on is I have horrible social skills like I always accidentally make people angry because I say things that to me seem fine but are apparently very rude idk much about how other people think it’s always confused me why people do or say the things they do which is why while writing all this I’m not even sure how much is normal and how much isn’t 

I’d be curious to know if anyone reading this has a similar situation and if they’ve got any tips on coping and also how much of this is just stuff everyone experiences that I didn’t realize? What does this sound like to you all?

38,"Hi. Long story short, I have OCD. As a kid, I had an OCD panic attack in my psychiatrist's office where I said I wanted to die. I recovered voluntarily in like 5 minutes but she still hospitalized me and dxed me as bipolar, put me on risperidone. It didn't help, but I felt really meh so she put me on lamictal to ""balance it out."" Then on lithium for my ""depression"". (The things that were going on in my environment were making me depressed.) I was 13.

I'm 19 now and getting the diagnosis changed. I'm almost off lithium, far below a therapeutic dose, with no symptoms despite stress/changes/lack of sleep during to travel and jet lag. I'm slowly working through my anxieties and fear of myself. However, I still struggle with some things:

1. Anger at my psychiatrist who never sought my insight, opinion, or approval for the diagnosis and treatment, and was intentionally evasive when I asked her point blank questions. Took my awful childhood and turned it into an awful adolescence, gave me lifelong baggage at thirteen, and was smug about it the whole time.

2. The anxieties I have about the meds. What was the long term effect of that cocktail for my whole adolescence? I talked to a Scottish doctor who asked if my disorder was ""that bad"" and if I ""tried to kill someone"" due to how much medication I was on. My psychiatrist just told us the lamictal and lithium were supposed to make me happy. I have no idea what it did to my developing mind.

I want to be happy. I want to hope and dream again. I had my adolescence taken from me. I want to salvage my youth, be open to new things. But instead, I can't stop being afraid.",04Jun2018,2,
39,"I’m going to try to explain what’s going on to me as best as I can. 

Occasionally, I will experience these panic attacks in which I’ll have flash backs of memories that may or may not be real, if that made sense. Sometimes, there are ‘triggers’ on TV or in conversation but sometimes they come out of nowhere. The worst part is that I can’t pinpoint what the triggers are.  For example: I’m at work right now and overheard my co workers talk about emailing their supervisors over something and it kickstarted an episode. 

The attacks are only a minute or two long, but I can barely speak or even look at people when I have them. It’s like I’m trying to remember something and it’s on the tip of my tongue but I just can’t remember it exactly or make sense of it.  Certain phrases or situations will repeat in my head through out the whole attack. I’ve tried to write them down during my attacks but can’t seem to bring myself to do anything but hyperventilate. Then, after the attack is over, I can’t remember what the phrase was even about! It’s so frustrating!

I’m not a generally anxious person and nothing particularly traumatic has ever happened to me. I have no idea what the hell it is or even how to properly explain myself.

41,"As per rule 3 of the sidebar, we're in the UK. And I know the title may sound selfish or something at first glance - I really don't mean it to I'm just struggling to find a way to phrase it which conveys the point properly. Please read the whole post.

As a background, my girlfriend (GF) has some long-term and strong anxiety. She manages it well, so most days are good, barring not being great at social interactions, but there are a few bad moments or bad days when she just wants to give up. Her roommate (RM) most likely has some variety of depression and anxiety, but she's not told me specific details and I don't want to push her for them. She was fine for most of the time I've known her but finals are coming and the increased stress has really brought it on to the point where she routinely tells us she wants to give up. We (GF, me, and her friends) managed to persuade her to seek help but she's only had one session so far so it's not providing too much right now. Also in this are her friends, some of which I suspect have very mild cases of anxiety but they've never sought help and we all, rather unfortunately, have bigger fish to fry right now.

Now onto the main story. GF, RM, and friends all have finals in the  next couple of weeks so stress is running high all around. GF has gone home to study to help reduce distractions but still communicates with everyone through group chats and messaging. RM's issues are flaring up really bad, to the point that she will spiral downwards, say she's giving up on life, that she should never have been born, and starts talking about suicide several times a day, to GF and all her friends. GF and friends then spend the next hour or so consoling her and talking her back up, and RM's boyfriend does what he can to be with her as much as possible to help keep her stable but he also has finals and can't be there 24/7. Then a few hours later, RM goes into another downwards spiral and we repeat. I have every sympathy for RM as I have been through a similar situation myself a few years ago, and want to do everything I can to fix it, however as the boyfriend of her roommate I'm so far removed from the situation that I only tend to be there if GF needs support and I'm not a close friend, so my options are limited. 

The part which makes this complicated is the effect it's having on GF. Not only is she unable to study as she has to dedicate several hours per day to consoling and helping RM, but issues that RM is having are resonating with her to the point that her own mental state is going downhill and her anxiety is really flaring up. Most days are becoming bad days for her anxiety because she has to carry both her and RM's burdens, and the stress from not being able to study keeps building up on top. It's reached the point that she told me she is the closest to suicide she has ever been, and she doesn't want to come back to university because she doesn't think her friends care about her. She doesn't want to ignore RM because she doesn't know how serious RM's suicide threats are and will never forgive herself if she just ignores RM and something happens, but she also doesn't want to always have to talk to RM because it's making her own case worse and worse, and RM is showing no signs of improving any time soon. We've tried telling RM to cycle around and talk to people who don't have as pressing matters, or take it in turns talking her down but she just puts everything into the group chat with them all anyway so they keep getting bothered. RM's bf is a physical wreck from having to keep an eye on her all the time - credit to the guy because he's pretty much completely unable to study for finals and only leaves her side when he's about to collapse of exhaustion, but it's taking a big toll. The therapist RM saw did tell her that she's having a negative impact on the people around her, but RM immediately went into the group chat about it and everyone had to console her because we're all afraid that if we pushed her away then she'd just stop talking to us might do something terrible.

So basically, I don't know what to do here. The girl I love says she's never been closer to suicide and her roommate is spiraling out of control every day. I know the only solution to RM's issues is long-term therapy, and we're going to make sure that happens, but in the short-term I don't know what to do. I want to make sure we treat RM well, that we're there for her and make sure she doesn't do anything, but I can't ignore the effect it's having on GF or push her into taking on any more burdens or stress. Keeping talking her down isn't sustainable, but not doing so could have terrible consequences. Does anyone have any ideas about the best way to go about this?",04Jun2018,6,
42,"Hi, just wondering if anyone else has problems with emotional obsession and might offer any strategies for dealing with it?

It has happened in relationships, friendships and even movies/TV/books (becoming attached to fictional characters.)

When it happens IRL it is obviously quite destructive and I have gotten used to catching it before it gets out of control and I usually just withdraw myself from the person until I have cooled off, however with media it often catches me unaware as I don't really have my guard up. My latest obsession is with a specific VOD from a Twitch streamer. This is the weirdest manifestation of obsession that I have yet experienced - a VOD. It's not even with the streamer or the game being streamed, but something to do with all of it combined has my mind coiling around it like some ravenous boa constrictor. I have now watched the VOD (its 9 hours long) 6 times since it was recorded last week. This has never happened to me before and I'm obviously a little concerned about my behavior. 

When I was a kid I would become intensely infatuated with specific movies/characters until the phase passed but I haven't experienced that in a long time. I'm just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on where these obsessions come from and why? I'm hoping my interest in this particular VOD will pass soon.

My sister died when I was 5 I can remember how painfull that was to take in. My dad was very harsh on me growing up and would beat me for silly reasons but I respect him and he was a good man. I was bullied in school got into loads of fights. When I was 11 I found myself in quite a good place for once, I had friends I was happy but then when I was 13 my dad got cancer. I became depressed, sad, anxious, addicted to porn masturabting 5-10 times a day and I started smoking. When I was 14 me and my dad relationship turned very sour. I started neglecting my dog not showing him any love or affection who I used to absaloutley adore when I was younger. When I was 14 I was masturbating and my dog kept trying it lick my penis. I stopped him but night after night he would try again. One night he managed to lick it and as sick as it sounds it just have felt good. I then forced my penis in his mouth, he wasn’t in pain but he looked uncomfortable. I done this about 3 times after that but then I must have realised how wrong it was. My dad died when I was 15 and I went into care which changed me completely and took me from the dark place I was in. Now I’m 22 it turns my stomach what I did.

46,"Hi everyone, sorry if this is a bit on the lighter side for this subreddit but I just really need some help.

Let me start by saying that I’ve been very fortunate to avoid any mental health issues throughout my life, and I don’t know if that’s why I’m even more scared about this situation or not; it came out of nowhere.

So I was out at a bar with my girlfriend and friends this weekend. Normally I would be fine, but this bar was extremely crowded—more than I’ve ever dealt with in my life. We walked in and weaved our way through the crowd and that’s when I started feeling lightheaded. Let me also point out that I was not drunk at this point, I had planned to drink at the bar. So I turned to my girlfriend for some comfort, and tried kissing her and dancing but she somewhat nodded me off (one of her guy friends was with us and I don’t know if it would have made her uncomfortable or not...either way). So on top of the lightheaded-ness, the feeling of isolation and loneliness set in quick, with a lot of dizziness and confusion to follow. I felt so vulnerable and so disoriented, but I tried to hang around. We walked through the crowd to go outside, which was just as crowded, and I tried to dance with and kiss my girlfriend again. At this point her guy friend wasn’t with us, and some girl was trying to dance around and rub up on me, which made me feel even worse and I just wanted the comfort of my girlfriend. She nodded me off once again, and then it just hit even worse. I couldn’t breathe; I felt like I was going to pass out. So I told her I needed to leave. She immediately got upset with me and said something along the lines of “Fine, whatever” and I left, alone while she hung back with her friends at the bar. When I finally got out of the bar I sat on the side of the road, shaking. After about 10 minutes I went home and started to feel better. 

I have never felt so awful in my life about anything, and I have never had an issue with crowds, so I just don’t know what to feel about this whole thing. My girlfriend and I talked it out and she apologized. We love each other very much, so everything between us is okay, but as far as my own health goes I don’t know what to say. Should I see a psychologist/psychiatrist to help get an answer and talk through it? Will this happen again? I haven’t stopped thinking about it since it happened, two nights ago.

My family has no mental health problems so I’ve never really experienced anything like it before. I was raised as a “bottle up my emotions and deal with them alone type of guy,” like a lot of men. 

She is always so nice and optimistic when I’m around her, but when she went into the doctor for help with anxiety they had her take an exam and she was diagnosed with depression. 

She doesn’t like taking medication and we’re both of the mindset of “take care of your body before you take pills” but I know that depression is a BIG real thing. 

Basically as a man I have trouble responding to her moods or talking to her about this stuff. She gets slightly defensive when I ask questions and suggest solutions.

55,"**Important Note:** I am *not* schizophrenic, nor do I have multiple personalities. These are different disorders entirely.

Anyone else here a maladaptive daydreamer? 

An adult survivor of physical, mental, emotional and even lowkey verbal-sexual assault as a child, I can only assume that it was a coping mechanism. I've spent a lot of my life quite detached and lonely due to a lack of family love and as a result a hard time making or keeping friends as a child. I was also the ""scruffy"" kid at school

Being an MD can be... distracting. If I am alone and not completely focused on something 100%, my mind it is a whirlin'. The characters, settings, storylines and whatnot will vary. Sometimes it's short and related to an immediate trigger and other times it's long-winded and goes on for weeks before the ""story"" fizzles out and a new one begins.

It's hard to explain the difference between regular over-active imaginations and MD. Here are some things I might do whilst daydreaming:

- Rock back and forth mildly   
- Pace up and down  
- Making facial expressions to go with the conversation that is happening  
- Zoning out from the ""here and now"" when deep in a daydream  
- Sometimes struggling to be social because my brain wants to daydream instead (toilet breaks make for the ""crack snorting"" moments where you get a quick daydream in - on those days, much like an addict, you have to 'recompose' yourself to go back into the group and act normal)
- Unable to focus on anything else or, if I do, the daydream coincides with what I'm doing

 If in **public**, I don't ""act out"" the daydream, but I find it tough not to make facial expressions that go along with the dialogue in my head if I start to zone out or find myself alone for a moment. I try to control it, I get very paranoid if I see a passer by just happen to look over at me, and sometimes wonder if I've accidentally spoken out loud, lol  

In **private**, there are no bars. I talk out loud, make full facial expressions, hand gestures, walking around, etc.

**Now here's the interesting thing, and also the hardest part to explain**.

Can I ""control"" it? Yes.   
The daydreams are always within my full control; I do not 'hear voices', I am the voices. I do not have multiple personalities, I have one and this is it. I do not feel scared, threatened or like something may happen. Even when the daydreams are scary or dangerous, it's just another storyline, like playing out a horror movie I guess. It's just a ""movie"", it isn't real.

Can I ""control"" it? No.  
I can't stop the daydreams happening. Even if I try to do so, I just zone out and wind up accidentally in another one. 

The simple version: I can control what happens when I daydream, I just can't control THAT I daydream. Imagine a form of ADHD where you can't sit still or focus on what a teacher is saying. It's like that, except your body isn't hyper, it's your imagination.

I am eager to hear from anyone else with MD or your thoughts in general if you've never even heard of MD!

61,"Hi Reddit. So, I'm on here because any insight/information or any stories from y'alls experience would be appreciated greatly here. I am not the one suffering from severe anxiety, my new boyfriend is.

Here's what's going on. He's had anxiety almost most of his adult life, after the traumatic loss of his parents and grandfather. It seems like he's had years and months where everything was under control though and he was able to live a normal life. As of recently (the past few years and now since we've met) it's gotten very bad. He can't even eat without puking. He tries to drink protein shakes but has lost a lot of weight.

Since we started dating he started going to a doctor, for therapy and medicine, because he knows when he gets in new relationships his anxiety kicks in. He said he wants to live a normal life with me he wants to take care of this fully now for the first time. Which is great. And I want to support and help in any way I can. It's not the anxiety that worries me, however, it's the puking from the anxiety. There are times where he is slightly anxious and doesn't puke but more times than not he's getting physically ill.

I myself suffer from mild anxiety and have depression so I'm aware of mental issues etc. But.. his doctor put him on new meds (Librax) which seemed to work for like 2 weeks but recently he started throwing up again.

I'm worried about his puking. He cannot eat. I can't remember the last time he was eating normally. Obviously this is a huge concern for health. In the past, in HS, he was admitted to the hospital because of this and they ran tests on his stomach etc and he was fine.

Anyone experience anything like this? Any medication you recommend?

Thank you..",04Jun2018,2,
62,"I was very anxious and down so I decided to take a nap. When I woke up for about 25-30min I felt like there were 2 more people inside my mind, they were not talking or making me do stuff but I felt controlled by them, as if every thought and every action had to be runned by them. I panicked and started crying.

63,"I'm a 17 y/o girl. I've been battling w/ depression since freshman year of high school (at least when I knew being sad and fatigue all the time wasn't normal). I'm also a hypochondriac which is also ruining all my days.

I also get these crazy weird, obsessive thoughts sometimes - don't laugh please - like 2 yrs ago when i worried is my 50 y/o mom accidentally pregnant (wtf is wrong w/ me, I hate myself) and the thoughts disappeared after a few months. Now the situation which made me write here is why the hell am i suddenly feeling weird when i think of me being pregnant when I've always felt like I'll never have kids, kinda like I ""crave"" kids, but not really at the same time (I never even kissed anyone, I'm pretty socially awkward). These thoughts really bother me because I just want to forget them and go back to being a child free woman for the rest of my life.

Is thia hormones and are these thoughts goong to disappear? Please don't laugh at this, ik it's weird. That's why I'm writing here.",04Jun2018,3,
64,"I just saw another post in this thread that made me think this would be a good place to ask this question. So I don't have an eating disorder or anything. I'm not scared of getting fat, but sometimes the thought of eating makes me so anxious. Like I hate the way the food feels in my body. It's hard to explain other than that it makes me feel so anxious that I rarely eat more than like 800 calories a day, usually less. I've noticed it's affecting my memory and my energy levels throughout the day. I do have C-PTSD, although I don't know if that could be related. 

Does anyone else have thoughts or experience anything similar to this?",04Jun2018,3,
65,"About two years ago, I was experiencing wild mood swings. I would go from depressed and unmotivated, to full of energy and drive, in the span of a couple hours. This happened at least twice a day. To me, these symptoms sounded like Bipolar Disorder (bear in mind I don’t have a psychology training, and was basically basing this initial “diagnosis” off pop culture.) As I did more research, I began to see more and more symptoms that fit how I was feeling. (Looking back, they were probably common symptoms of other disorders. And I was probably self-fulfilling some of the symptoms as well.) As I researched, I saw more and more symptoms that I “had.” So I took this list of symptoms to my psychiatrist and, after some further discussions where he asked more questions about the symptoms I had told him about, I was put on Lamictal.

Flash forward 2 years of taking a good-sized dosage every morning alongside Concerta for ADD, and Prozac. I start having really bad memory loss issues, outside the normal ADD symptoms of getting distracted. I began forgetting words, and things I had been told an hour earlier. So I slowly stopped taking Lamictal.

6 months later, I was hospitalized for homicidal and suicidal ideation. After the doctors determined I wasn’t an threat to myself or others, I was discharged, but put in an outpatient program for Adolescents with Mood Disorders. After speaking with the three doctors there, they determined that I didn’t have Bipolar Disorder, or Chronic Depression. Instead, they gave me the diagnosis of High Functioning Autism and Social Anxiety. The ADD diagnosis didn’t change. Needless to say, we didn’t go back to the first doctor 

The moral of the story: even if you haven’t “self-diagnosed,” and you’re going to a professional with a list of symptoms you’re concerned about, be careful. You may end up misdiagnosed, purely from an unconscious confirmation bias that means you only mention the symptoms that confirm what you’re thinking: 

TL;DR: I had some symptoms of Bipolar Disorder. I went to my psychiatrist with the symptoms, and he diagnosed me with BD. After 2 years of medication and memory loss, other doctors determine that I am not. ",04Jun2018,75,

She talks gibberish and does weird things like throw random things away, hide stuff, talk about people talking about her, saying cameras are watching her, etc. sometimes she prone to being violent and ive had to press charges on her before as a last resort to resolve a situation. From what i know her mom dosent really have these symptoms, her dads kind of nutty, her brother is also but he was a drug abuser, but i cant recall any other family member going through this. im currently going through another case with her and shes in the hospital awaiting evaluation and transfer to a mental hospital to get her back on her meds. Im a 22 year old male, i have 2 older sisters. I just came to the hard realization that i could develop her conditions if it is genetic even though im the farthest thing from a drug abuser.

**Symptoms**

\- Difficulty Focusing

\- Often unable to get up and complete tasks even on adderall. As if i'm paralyzed

\- Ocassional night paranoia

\- Idk if this is important but people in my personal space makes me nauseous and when tickled I go straight into a full on panic attack then pass out.

\- My interests change often, usually shifting between the same things. Some days I want a career in science, the next in business, or fashion. Sometimes when I read or watch movies I connect to the main character and take on their personality for a few days.

\- I have serious trust issues and haven't had any romantic relationships or even kissed a guy 

\- I often feel alone, and have always told myself no one thinks like me and something is wrong with everyone else. \(Part of me thinks I try to convince myself I'm different because so many individuals have disappointed me, and I try to make sure that no one, including myself, puts me in the same group as them.\)

\- I'm not sure if it's dissociating but I look at the world so confused all the time, that every single time I wake up I think to myself ""what the hell? this is still happening?"" Almost like life is so bizarre to me that sleeping is normal but waking confusing.",04Jun2018,2,

79,"Ever since middle school I have been very insecure and have dealt with a lack of confidence in myself. This has led me to be afraid to ever give myself a label that I feel I might associate myself with because I feel like I could never actually be good or qualified enough to fit in with that group of people. This included calling myself a gamer (even though I love watching and playing video games), labeling myself as queer, even labeling myself as a singer (even though I literally am a vocal music major currently).
I get so much anxiety when people ask me to tell them about myself because I am consistently afraid they will find out I’m a fraud. (I know this is called imposter syndrome)
Anyone feel the same way/could anyone give me some advice for this identification crisis I’ve been experiencing for forever because I really do think it impacts my self image and mental health quite a lot. ",04Jun2018,1,
80,"Due to health issues, mental and, in turn, also physical, I am somewhat housebound. I am unable to leave the house due to people fearing that I may collapse (which happened numerous times before, which ended up in me being admitted to a private hospital on the basis of emergency as my electrolytes were so unbalanced) and I am constantly told to stay resting at all times. My therapist won't even let me walk up to the building where our appointments usually are - despite it being literally 2 minutes of a walk away from my house - because she's scared I might collapse, so she has to come and see me at home. 

Due to the fact that I am home all day and I don't currently study, you can imagine I'm bored as hell. I get to the point where I can't even concentrate during the day - I can't distract myself with television because I can't concentrate on watching it. The minutes feel like hours and it's just like I'm waiting for the days to pass. 

I look forward to when the sun goes down and it gets dark because I find it so much easier to cope? Whilst in the day I feel like the hours are drawn out, at night I feel like I can be more productive. I can write, I'm more able to just chill and watch an episode of a show I like. I can relax and play video games without checking the clock every minute to see how much time has passed, or I can get lost into a book for hours without even thinking about the time. 

I've always preferred to work at night and there's no reason for me to have to stick to an early sleep schedule as I'm literally home all day with nothing that needs done during daylight hours. I can do my writing whenever, I don't have any responsibilities that require me to be up during the day (unless it's an appointment, but even then it's like I can just go to sleep when I get home). 

For me, it feels like being ALIVE in general is so much more easier at night. Why is this? Does anybody else relate? The days dreg on and on and I just always look forward to being able to just take a breather when the sun goes down and it's easier to be awake and keep myself distracted.

Anyway I got healthcare and have a doctors appointment set up for June 22nd. 
I don't know how to approach this. I guess I should start by writing down everything I want to talk to her about, but she probably only has like ten minutes.. I don't want to get predictive a generic antidepressant, I really want someone to ask me the real questions and get a real assessment. Last time I tried to get help she listened to me for one minute and wrote me a prescription for Wellbutrin that I was too afraid to take. I kind of got talked out of it by a friend who told me it made her worse. 
I took one step. Now how do I handle this next step?

82,"Hey,

I've always been very stable (mentally) throughout my life  despite my mental health being tested by the death and/or mentioned state of multiple family members and seeing one of them bleeding out in front of me. This led me to believe I would ""make it"" in this world and not fall apart (mentally) like some of my relatives did. I have a reliable and safe home and my parents both work hard so I have not had to deal with financial issues or any other difficult things. Always had friends, a nice school close to home etc. 
Then last August, I started University. Throughout this year, I completely fell apart. It started slowly, sometimes giving me bad sleep, not really being motivated for anything and in general making me a bit worried. 
All of these feelings got more severe to the point where I am now completely hopeless and feel like I don't know what or who I am, why I am doing things and am in doubt about almost everything; religion, my relationship with my girlfriend, school, work. I've tried identifying what is going on with me but i only recognize fragments of different mental health issues. I'm not suicidal but I do have a lot in common with a depressed person. I also get heavy chest pains while laying in bed completely still very frequently and sometimes feel like everything is fake in my life.

As i learned more about myself and the things i do that i find normal, but are really not(like over sexualizing everything to gain the attention of people, distance from my real feelings and difficulty feeling the properly, i also manipulate my feel to please others so they can like me or if i want something from them). 

I am not a sociopath nor anything. I do feel, a lot, but sometimes i realize how many few feelings are really mine and not a automatic reaction to somebody else's close to me. It's hard for me not to try to  be accepted or receive attention. But im doing my best to improve. I just feel unbearably annoyed by the fact that that person is not caring about me in the slightest. So i may try to talk about something sad that might have been causing them, i will talk cute, empathic and beautiful things until the person opens up and hopefully cry a little, than i hug them and start crying as well so that the other person see how i empathize with her, and then we are closer.
