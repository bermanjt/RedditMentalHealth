Im on 75mg of effexor but my depression came back hard and I feel as horrible as I did before I started treatment, even possibly worse because I have new symptoms that kinda scare me. My mood is constantly changing and I've been getting horrible fatigue and sleeping for abnormally long hours, it sometimes feels like something is weighing me down and im going to pass out and this gives me trouble walking sometimes. I feel really empty, spacy and disconnected from reality right now and I don't know what to do.",06Mar2018,2,

6,"I work at a school. And there is a ton of kids who say they suffer from mental health issues, and their parents do everything for them, fight for them, help them, seek every resource and accommodation available. Everything. And teachers are willing and so caring. There are even on campus emotional support counselors. And it makes me think about myself, how no one cared. It almost makes me feel jelous. How I came to school and came home and no one noticed something was wrong. That I was too quiet. That I was hurting myself. That it didn't matter even when I tried to kill myself. It was nothing after two weeks, everyone forgot, no one asked if I was ok, when I wasn't. Even when I dropped out of school, no one noticed that I was gone or if there was any connection. I know it's selfish, but I can't help but think, that even the slightest feeling of being sad is from these kids is taken so seriously, even if it was caused by an outside factor. It fucks me up, why no one cared. But, I guess why even expect anyone to care about me? I'm sorry. I just need to let this out. ",06Mar2018,6,

My hours were cut to the point it isn't worth anything and I'm criticized for things that are not even in my control. Today was my breaking point since the coworkers were taking it out on me because of the fact that things are falling apart and the department is hardly filled, etc. (even though my job is in the back and has nothing to do with filling the department.) I've had a case where I was sexually harassed though I never reported it (can't now since the old manager left.)

10,"I woke up last night my husband sitting up in bed saying that he couldn’t sleep. He was staring at his phone and said he wanted to go grocery shopping. It was around 1 am and he had work in the morning. 

We have a one year old son. My husband was up researching foods for one year olds and was getting worried that we weren’t doing enough for him. I calmed him and told him it was all ok, our son is very healthy and happy and we will look into it in the morning. 

When I woke up, I started thinking about some of the patterns I’ve seen that have gotten stronger since having a child. He has yelled at me for doing things the “wrong” way - laying a towel down in the wrong direction, not washing a baby blanket separate from the rest of the clothes, leaving our sons socks on for too long after he gets home, feeding him too many snacks at a time (admittedly a mistake on my part), using a hand towel to give our son a bath, picking out the wrong onesie for bed, fastening his diaper differently than he does, not letting him “air dry” after a bath for a while before putting on lotion and clothes. The list is endless. 

Conversely, he tells me thinks I worry about aren’t important. I brought up a choking hazard and he told me it’s fine, he lets him do it all the time. I told him months ago about bringing more variety into our sons diet and he kinda shrugged and kept doing what he was doing. It came to a head last night, and he felt bad, but I kinda felt annoyed at the same time...

My voice doesn’t seem to count unless it’s quelling some beyond irrational fear or anxiety. Even mild anxieties are more trustworthy to him than my opinion. 

When I bring this up to him tonight, he flips out on me and says I’m insecure, paranoid, and making things up in my head. Am I? I think I see it clearly but I don’t know. I think he’s maybe going off the deep end a bit and it’s starting to scare me. He’s always been particular and eccentric but I’m getting nervous. 

He loves our son more than anything in this world. I do think he’d be capable of anything if it meant saving his kid - even if it meant hurting me. ",06Mar2018,4,
11,"Hi there. I am  a 21 F in America and I am absolutely sick of being sick. I have totally changed my life since my major depressive disorder peaked 3 years ago. I am productive, positive and work a full time job. I eat healthy. I am on Vitamin D3 for a deficiency and I get health check-ups a lot due to physical health problems, so all good nutrients wise. But I’m still depressed. I still, no matter what the circumstances, go through hours of sadness and unmotivation. I always get back up again and I haven’t been in an unsafe place for a while. But I am sick of feeling sad for no reason and having my head tell me to die all the time. I’d say I have depressive thoughts/moments/episodes several times a day. And I’m definitely glad I’ve come so far, but I’m done with feeling this way. Also, I am on Cymbalta and it’s done a number on my sex drive. I’d really like to not be basically asexual anymore. I am seeing a therapist, which helps with the deep issues and problems from my past, but not really anything day to day, as I lead a pretty healthy life. Does anyone have any recommendations? I’m looking into ECT. I am basically willing to do anything. Thank you for helping. ",06Mar2018,3,

As if any idea you have about a possible future for yourself gets shot down, or if you're trying to vent and talk about your experience(s) with mental health, they don't know how to respond.

14,"I have this idea that whispers itself into existence quite often when i interact with people in different social settings. Even the prospect of it can induce thought loops that are difficult to escape. Simply put, you could call this affliction anxiety or paranoia... But its something more. 
I feel like most people i run into have access to knowledge of living that i should also have insight into. It is a very simple understanding of self and others that allows them to live without over analyzing absolutely everything. It is the ability to forgive oneself. It is being able to laugh without wanting to cry; the ability to let laughter burst out of you. Reacting to other people's emotions without thinking about how i should react in case i don't react at all.

It is becoming increasingly more and more difficult for me to connect with people naturally and genuinely. I don't know how to be myself or even know who i am when i'm around most people. Even the people i feel most comfortable with. When i meet new people or even people i don't know very well, i feel like they can see right through me. Like im a phoney. I dont know that anything i do or any way that i react is genuine. When i feel happy and loud am i just overcompensating? I feel like i'm always trying to collect bits and pieces of other peoples identities which i deem admirable and put them together and end up with nothing. 

I don't know whats wrong with me. Whatever it is, it runs deeper now than it ever has. I feel like sometimes its okay, and it might just be depression or anxiety. but other times i feel like im on the brink of psychosis or delusional thinking. 

I feel like i'm mentally decaying. I cant focus on anything. I'm not very good at constructing cohesive ideas or thoughts. The only way i can explain myself is by rambling or erasing and rewriting over and over again.

A week ago, he had walked to a mountain near his house and hid in a cave thinking the world will end, and so he needs to find a female partner to recreate life on earth. He'd stripped down to his underwear and admitted he had eaten mud and even his own feces. He believes that he is always being watched by someone, wiped out his mobile phone's memory, and tossed couple of thousands of dollar into a toilette claiming they asked him to. A couple of times he claimed that he has become the character in the movie Limitless, and used powers to control others. I drove him outside one day, and suddenly he panicked and said they are out to get him with guns and we need to go home.

34,"I’m not even motivated to write this post but I know doing so is going to be one of the few things that may help me make ends meet you could say. For the last two months I’ve felt rather depressed, however, over the last two weeks it’s gotten so much worse. I’ll begin with a little insight to my life :

I’m 18 turning 19 in 2 months, I live in Canada and I come from a middle class family so I have a rather average home life. Granted being surrounded by alcoholics is what I consider average now but anyhow, my friend circle is rather tightly knit consisting of roughly 3 people. My “best-friend” from highschool whom I’ve realized treats me with little to no respect, and just takes advantage of me. I believe her life is going down a very bad path and every time I’ve tried to stop it, I am just bitched at and have realized there is nothing I can do to change her. 

Then there is my other best friend, whom I was introduced to by the aforementioned friend roughly 2 years ago. This girl on the other hand, treats me with more respect than even my own mother does. She always is making sure I am picking what is best for myself and trying to keep me looking in the right direction. I can’t help but to be given happiness by her, however, she is the only thing I currently find can make me happy. This has caused a predicament although - I’ve caught feelings for her, and I can’t shake them no matter how hard I try. I know she’s the one pillar of stability I have in my life at the moment. The reason I’m clinging onto life, why I am still going to school, she’s why I haven’t quit my job, hell the reason I am trying to quit smoking cigarettes. Alas, I know the feelings aren’t mutual. I know I mean a hell of a lot to her, i just know I don’t mean the same to her that she does to me. I’m aware she has interest in another guy and it literally kills me on the inside. I haven’t told her how I feel because she describes our friendship as exactly what she needs in her life right now, and I am content with sacrificing my personal wants if it means I am giving her happiness. 

However, this all comes back to the problem I am currently facing. I am now feeling an extreme sadness. I am barely sleeping (getting 4 or less hours of sleep a night) and maybe eating once a day. I have little to no emotions, despite feeling rather upset constantly. As I said, being around my best friend is the only thing providing me with happiness and I’m aware suppressing my feelings is definitely a cause of this sadness, yet i can’t help but to think the rude treatment I am getting from others is a large contribution. But I’ve been around that person for years, and I know I’m one of the few things that keeps them happy. This all sounds like a vicious cycle as I write. But I’ve realized I have constantly put others first throughout my life and I am unsure of how to handle the hole that I’ve dug myself into. I don’t know what im expecting out of posting this, but hopefully somebody can help or just state what they had done in a similar situation. 

TL;DR : im really upset, have one mentally abusive friend, and another Iong to be with but have little to no chance to actually make it happen. I never put myself and my happiness first and am unsure of what to do about this. Any advice is appreciated. ",06Mar2018,0,
35,"I (17F) have been preoccupied by my weight since I was about 13, and I’ve been counting my calories on and off since I was 14. For the past 8 months or so I’ve been consuming &lt;1300 calories per day, usually much less. Since June, I’ve lost just over 20 lbs. I’m now about 108 lbs and 5’2”, which is a healthy BMI, but my friends have told me I don’t eat enough and that they are concerned.

When I get nervous I completely lose my appetite and can go several days without feeling hungry. Most of the time I’m not hungry, I only eat because I know it’s the healthy thing to do (I set myself alarms to remind me to eat).

My first boyfriend broke up with me two days ago, and it’s hit me surprisingly hard. I have not eaten in over 48 hours and I have no appetite. In the back of my head I think I’m treating it like a competition with myself. It’s like I’m trying to see how long i can go, how much weight I can lose, or how much I can shrink my waist size. I also went on a 13 mile run/jog a few days ago even though i usually struggle to go over 3 miles at one time.

I know that this isn’t healthy, but is it anorexia? I know I should talk to a doctor, but I’m scared of sounding overdramatic and making a fuss over nothing. I’ve read sometimes anorexia is used to give someone a sense of control. Is it possible to restrict yourself to get that sense of control while still being mentally and physically healthy? How do I bring this up to a doctor? Can I fix this unhealthy state of mind on my own?",06Mar2018,3,
36,"So yeah, im from germany and i already told alot about what happened the last year in other posts, so im not going to talk about it again. but the main thing you need to know is that i am depressed, to the point that i feel numb almost all the time and only had few moments where that changed. ive got social anxiety too, but i dont think that matters too much.

so, as of maybe the last 2-3 months, i started getting frustrated and angry/aggressive alot. mostly caused by little things not working or something along the lines. but i got so angry that i broke stuff, hurt myself, hit things and banged on a lot of tables. soon after those breakouts, i also started having a lot of episodes of just pure disgust and hatred for myself, mostly caused by looking in the mirror or relationship stuff. when those happened i always got drunk, not like totally wasted, but you know, i couldnt really walk anymore and didnt remember anything. made it worse by smoking too, but thats not the point. 

so now im at a point where i just randomly start getting angry. for example, just now i wanted to write something in my notebook, didnt like it or something, so i broke my pen. no real reason for that. 
and those self hatred phases also just come and go. 

i do have some fun here and there, when i enjoy watching a show or something, but i still feel pretty numb and uncaring about everything.

my quieston is if that is just the depression, or maybe i started developing something else?

I have a lot going on in my life. It’s not that this heavy feeling I get in my gut comes out of nowhere- it always has a source, like the slightest thing that someone says that bogs me down, or the recurring memory of my mom’s attempted suicide. 

I don’t feel like I need pills, but I’ve always wanted to have a therapist to talk to. Especially now that I have moved away from and begun to leave all that I had for friends/family/support. My social circle is very tiny. I am leaving the religion that had a vice grip on my life, something I thought would never end. And it has made me a lot happier, but I still get these recurring feelings.

I am enrolled in online school but all I want to do is nothing. It feels to difficult to sit down and actually start an assignment. I’m close to 2 months behind, it makes me feel worse but then I feel too bad to do anything.

I don’t think my parents would let me get a therapist. Considering I’m only 16. and they can’t afford it, and they’d think that something is wrong with me. Which, there is... but they wouldn’t want to admit it. My mom has much more serious issues than me but doesn’t go anymore because it’s too expensive.

I don’t know what to do. I feel sort of like I’m floating along. trying to get a grip on myself but I can’t, time’s moving too fast

Every night she would call me crying and i would try to comfort her. She cuts and talks about suicide, she asked me what would happen if she died. I would go into a really bad mood and breakdown cause i feel extremely bad for her and honestly i feel its so f'ed up. I would try to console her the whole night leaving me sleep deprived. She said she wanted to end her life and i was so stressed trying to convince her not to. She would get mad at me for the simplest reasons. She is really clingy but would push me away whenever she's mad. She would keep on saying that i don't care but i really do. She did told me that she may have bdp as she did a quiz online. I did a ton of research on bdp and I really don't know what to do. Ive read threads on ither guys dealing with their bdp gfs and all the advice is to just leave her. I also watched some videos and read articles and i kinda understand why she has bdp, probably due to her parents neglecting her. I talked her to going to see a doctor and shes going to make an appointment soon. After reading articles and threads on gf with bdps has made me show less care towards her. I try to not care as much as last time whenever she gets upset and i don't want to hurt myself anymore.

45,"Hello all,

I would appreciate any sort of feedback or help.
My fiance feels stuck at a job she hates. She's been there for a little under one and a half years. 

Both she and I are in the same industry (stationary/building/operating engineering) working in different locations and it's a rather physically demanding job.

The project she was initially hired for (a little bit outside of our job description) was scrapped due to poor financial management so when she was introduced into doing the physically demanding aspects of our work, she is constantly getting undermined because a) she is training some one with less seniority and exposure at their location but has more experience in the field overall, b) due to her small size, she physically can't do certain things without asking someone for help otherwise putting herself in a dangerous situation. Also, there was a recent shift in leadership and her new boss may be a good engineer is a pretty lousy chief engineer; he doesn't address issues brought up by other employees whether it be issues between one another or work related issues. 

This past weekend it seemed like she hit a new low in her mental health and how frustrating it is for her to even go to work. I'm trying my best to support her by keeping her spirits lifted and helping her find new jobs but she seems like she's being swallowed up by her own frustration and depression. She wants to leave this job but says she can't because the money is too good to give up (to pay off car and student loans).

51,"This is a very personal story which I am sharing in some detail, I hope someone here can help me. Thanks in advance, TL;DR at the bottom.

**4 years ago**, my girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me for good. She was my first real girlfriend, we started dating when I was 19. I was naive, as most people are in their first relationship. In retrospect (I didn't realise it then, blinded by love or some shit like that), she was abusive for most part of our last 3 years together. She condescended me, demanded access to all my passwords, had double standards (she was allowed to party with other guys but I couldn't even have a coffee with another girl without a big meltdown) and cheated on me multiple times.

I just took it through that period. Like I said, I was naive. I should have ended it much much earlier but I let it drag on and hurt me for months and then years. After we finally split, I was in a deep well of depression for months. I took up a job that kept me working 17 hours a day just to get myself out of the pain. In the process of coping, I found that numbing myself to emotions was an easy way out. I did that, and then slowly it turned me into an emotionally vacant person.

*Here's what I mean by emotionally vacant*: I feel little or no emotion. I do feel joy from time to time, but I rarely, if ever, feel pain or suffering. I just became immune to it.


**Fast forward to 2016**: I met this wonderful girl who became my girlfriend. For 2 years we were together (we broke up recently). Our reason for splitting was incompatibility: I was emotionally vacant and she was a very emotional person. You might be wondering how we lasted 2 years. We really loved each other, that's why. And more importantly, she was an amazing, compassionate person and held us together.

I never intentionally tried to hurt her. Not once, but I ended up hurting her frequently because of my lack of empathy. In getting rid of my own pain, I'd somehow also gotten rid of my ability to feel others' pain. Whenever she was down or going through a rough patch, I was technically 'there for her', but emotionally couldn't relate and came off as disinterested and apathetic. She spoke about this openly with me, but I always brushed it aside. I cannot believe she stuck with me for 2 years. She was always empathetic and affectionate.

We departed on good terms, with love for each other still in our hearts. Now, in retrospect, I see what kind of a monster I must have been to her. In coping with the pain of losing her, I have started getting flashes of emotion, and I can see how hurt she must have been when she couldn't depend on me through all those tough times.

I want to be able to feel again. Be emotionally whole. How do I do that? I need to go back to who I was (emotionally) before my bad breakup years ago.

**TL;DR** - I had a catastrophic breakup 4 years ago that turned me emotionally vacant. This personality trait of mine destroyed my previous relationship. I need to find my way back to being emotionally whole again. Please help.",06Mar2018,5,

55,"I’ve been with him for nearly a year now. From the very beginning  he told me he’s been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I could care less because I really liked him. Something I found a bit off about him though was that he talked a lot! I mean like always dominating conversations to the point where I can hardly speak myself or he’ll interrupt if I do.  Sometimes me and him will be walking around and he’ll see someone he knows and he has go up to them and talk. And it’s not a quick hello. He will stay they’re talking for a good 15 minutes. The only reason the conversation ends is because the other person will say they have to go. I can see the awkwardness/annoyance in the other party. It happens often. The very first day I went out with him he was just talking about himself the whole time. That was a major red flag for me but then again I thought I’d give him a chance and maybe it won’t be like that all the time. I was so wrong lol he is also very repatative. He’ll say a joke and ya know sometimes they’re  funny and I do chuckle a little. But I don’t understand why he’ll immediately  repeat the same joke over, often more than twice. And he’ll proceed with saying “did you get it? Cause ..” and then goes on with explaining 
 the Joke. I hate this. I understand the joke. I laughed at it and the first time was funny and no I don’t need explanation because i get it. He doesn’t only repeat jokes, he’ll repeat his stories too. For example, He’ll be talking to me about this one kid in class, and then he’ll say a specific detail. Later on he repeat that same detail 2 or more times. Sometime he’ll repeat the exact same story and keep on going even after I told him I’ve heard it before. I often have to stop him. overtime, I have just been listening in with one ear. I’ll just say things like “oh yeah, that’s cool, oh that’s funny!” He also talks about himself a lot. Even things that are really uninteresting. The thing is, nobody cares. But he’ll continue talking about an uninteresting topic (most often about himself) for long time without changing the subject. It’s irritating because I can’t even talk about myself anymore or about something I like.

 I don’t think he understand social cues. He can’t read my expressions when I’m uninterested. Or maybe he can and he feels that rephrasing it will make it more appealing? He’s always looking for approval. “Oh they didn’t laugh as much as I wanted to, let me say it again!” “That’s not the reaction I expected, maybe if I add this they’ll be more interested”. He also always feels the need to show off his tattoo even if nobody asked him about it. He recently bought a motorcycle. And he’ll always mention his bike even when that’s not what me and a group of friends were talking about. II’m about done with this guy because of this specific behavior. Can I fix it? Or is it something that he sadly has to live his life with? Does it stem from his anxiety? Or could it be another disorder? Maybe if I become aware of where it comes from I can try and help him",06Mar2018,1,

58,"I am so numb that there are few events that I feel. This has lead to an obsession that so far I have failed to control.

 At night I sit at my desk In my home office. I will feel the lines or cracks in the sole of my left foot, Once I find a crack of flaw I must pick at it. If there is only a crease I will dig my fingernail into the crease until I can pick at the skin. I will pull at my flesh over and over again until my fingers get matted with blood. When I pull on the flesh I either feel nothing or shear ecstasy. When the pain starts the ecstasy begins. The deeper the flesh the more I feel the release of each fiber. The skin tares in long strips and will reach the side of my foot. The sensation changes as the tearing skin reaches the thin layers of the side of my foot. The thin skin is much weaker and I know it will give way soon so I slow down the process making each fiber of flesh matter. 

The sensation is outright orgasmic.  It eventually ends as the flesh gives way and tears off completely.  The sensation has me breathing.   I tend to the blood and clean the area of skin. I  apply a giant band-aid or bandage if needed.  I rub the area of the wound savoring the sensation. This sets me up for the next few days. Every time I step with my left foot I get a dose of the pain and smile.  

I try not to limp but my body sometimes out votes me and reacts to the pain the way it should.
My shoes are long overdue to be replaced and this only increases the sensation.  I know I need to stop doing this but right now I want nothing more to rip my shoes and socks off and tear at the flesh that remains.  This would be bad since I am at work and there are more than one hundred people around me.

I need help but I cannot survive another stay in the hospital

This may not be the right place for this but I just had to get this out somewhere rather than exploding.

63,"I'm sure anyone who deals with an intense mental illness has heard this at some point. I have one friend in particular who always asks me how I'm doing, and encourages me to vent if anything is bothering me. I talk to him, and then each time he proceeds to rant about how all my issues come down to a ""victim mentality"", and that if I simply changed my way of thinking all my issues would disappear. Many people say this to people suffering with mental illness, with only the best intentions. The issue is they are trying to solve an issue on which they have no authority or knowledge to do so.
Just a little backround info, I dealt with Selective Mutism from the time I could speak until I was about 13. I've overcome that, but now I deal with major depression, ptsd, general anxiety as well as major panic attacks. I find that the more encounters I have with people who are uneducated or simply ignorant, the more I revert back to my anxious tendencies and attacks. 
I'm all for personal responsibility and taking control of your life. I am also annoyed by the victim mentality many progressive millennials tend to have. However, mental illnesses are REAL, and not something you can suddenly rid yourself of by simply changing your mindset. These illnesses can be treated and sometimes even cured. But it takes years of therapy, medications, and practice. I'm also all for using psychedelics to treat/cure mental illnesses. 
Why are those of us with mental illnesses constantly thrown on the backburner? Why are our symptoms ignored? what makes people think we want to be this way, or that we want the often negative attention that comes with it? trust me, my life has always been an uphill battle of constantly searching for solutions and treatments. Would you tell a person with cancer to ""just cut the tumor out and get over it""? Would you tell a heroin addict to ""just stop using drugs""? probably not. Why does our society question the legitimacy of mental illnesses? Shame on us. I could be wrong, but it seems like an American thing. Our country shames negative emotions because it is all about instant gratification, chasing the american dream. In america its all about being happy and comfortable. So for some reason we discourage those who are unhappy. We discourage mental illness because it does not correlate with the one thing we as a country value the most. Happiness.
Mental illness is not a mindset. It is an illness and should be treated as such. However, ignorance IS a mindset.
I would love to hear your guys' stories of encounters you've had with people like this, whether it be parents, peers, or even doctors",06Mar2018,8,
64,"Ive posted this on nofap hope u guys can  give some insight too

When i was a kid and an early teenager i was so in tune with music, movies, surroundings, people everything had a certain atmosphere to it no matter if i was at a supermarket or in school, everything had music in the air. hope u guys understand me. i tried looking up what this means but could find it. Its like when u watch a show like breaking bad or something and it has this vibe that clings on after u watch it. Its like that except u feel this vibe everywhere around you, you create create the vibe of your life. I tried explaining this to people but they dont seem to get it i guess thats just how normal people feel and they should be thankful!! After spending some time watching porn, smoking weed, stimulating my brain too much. All of this was gone, empty, distant, episodes of derealization. So i do nofap quit porn quit weed,alcohol. These emotions or whatever they are have been coming back but slowly,unexpectedly. Ive been doing this for 3 plus months. Has anyone been on this for more than me and experienced something similar, do the emotions come back stronger like when i was younger, will i feel again Love u guys stay strong",06Mar2018,2,
65,"I get so mad, fear is override with purge rage and hostility, and seems to get worse over time, each time I have it. I recently lashed out at my step dad and he lashed back, but my mom got in his way. I almost threw glass at him, but resisted and just broke a chair. I could have easily went to jail, he yelled to me that I had one hour to get out before he called the cops. 

I left, called late that night and they let me back home, I wouldn’t come back until talking to him so I could make sure he was calm, which he was. He had no idea that I had such anger and hostility in me. 

What pushed me over the edge (you can’t expect me to be in my right mind when you wake me up prematurely, so you’re really playing with fire when you do so, and I still avoid looking into mirrors when I first wake up because I went through a period years ago where I thought I was demonically possessed and literally lost control of my body and even literally barked like a dog, and you guessed it, it happened right after I woke up, which was shortly after falling asleep that night, had A LOT of anxiety and stress at that time, I was in high school, and everyone tortured me mercilessly which was intensified by the medication I was on, looking into mirrors was looking at pure evil, the demon itself, I can’t explain the episodes/attacks I had, but even today I avoid looking into mirrors when I just wake up) was the fact that I gave the warning to leave me alone (because I knew what was coming) and my step dad decided to challenge that, and that’s when I yelled “I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU!!!!!!!” at the top of my lungs and ran at him. I stopped at the bar and almost threw a glass jar at him, thought about criminal charges and settled for breaking a chair. He dared to get as mad as me and come at me (well, I’m the one who would go as far as trying to summons demons to curse the house if any “consequences” were used on me, I’ll summon the dark forces to punish YOU if I can) but my mom got in his way.

Then I packed stuff, left the house, and later that night called my mom, said I could come home, but I refused to until talking to my step dad so I knew it was safe for me. I apologized (tried to before I even left the house but HE left) and explained that although I don’t think my behavior was acceptable, I really wasn’t in control of it. He said he was shocked I had that kind of anger and hostility in me, and said it’s all good.

I just want to get back to having a job so I can get to saving more and to getting a life, eventually moving out, but on GOOD TERMS, the PROPER WAY (not being kicked out or running away). 

I’m 22, that information is probably good to know.

I used to be the MOST SPINELESS PUSSY, I would most likely be in prison or dead if I snapped while still in school, there was even a time when this piece of shit made me have to hold myself back REALLY HARD from beating him mercilessly with a stapler, because he mouthed off to me saying I belonged in the state school. 

I’m thinking my current problems developed over my life and have been stewing deep down for a long time, until this one day, weirdly it all started with a series of nightmares and me waking up in an ocean of sweat, I still remember the dreams. That was the first time I recall having a rage outburst. I gave the warning to my family that I could feel something was off (I woke up FULL of hatred and felt bad about it, but was just full of nastiness and hatred, it was absolutely disgusting) and my dad (my real dad) pushed me anyway (it was so stupid too) and I had my first rage outburst, but my dad was smart enough to back down and walk away, the man may have been abusive a lot (sometimes not even drunk) but he was smart enough to not challenge me, instead backing down and walking away. 

That being the first time that happened to me, I cried hard afterwards, ashamed that I lost control of myself, and felt weak. 

I’ve never been quite the same, and it seems I cope less and less good over time, I can not handle my hardships, and when I feel really threatened I go psycho after a failed attempt to use what I think of as a “get out of non-literal jail free card” which doesn’t work in real life, you can’t just escape all of your problems and everything. My life problems can get worse, and I deal with them worse. 

I remember being told to deal with my dad instead of leaving the house (some years ago when it was my real dad) and all I could think was “But I don’t want to go to jail.” 

I’ve even been told be a man and deal with sh*t and don’t blow up? I thought that was being a little p*ssy and being a man was being assertive and not submitting to others, but doing what you want or need to do? I just don’t f*cking know. 

I don’t understand life, I already failed, I’m already 22, never crossed normal milestones for a man, or even a HUMAN.

I’ve planned on going to a famous bridge in my country and jumping. If I ever actually do become homeless and have no one, I probably will kill myself, because I don’t even have any drive for anything, if I have absolutely no one I feel no reason at all to be alive. Not even any passions to pursue in life. If I end up homeless and no friends or family, I will no longer have a single reason to NOT KILL MYSELF. Even the suicide hotline lady told me I have to find my own reason to stay alive, and kept trying to get me off the line and pushing to send EMS. Church people would be more helpful even if you’re Atheist or even Satanist!

*Sigh*

I’ve never even had a girlfriend or had sex, I have no friends, and haven’t even managed to keep a sh*tty retail job long-term. I never learned basic life skills or social skills apparently, been told I’m “ugly as fuck” too many times, Goddamit.",06Mar2018,0,

For some reason, the topic of death came about one day and it's been bothering me for a month now, I have constant anxiety, my throat and chest feel like they are about to be crushed, and I get throbbing headaches. I don't know how to get rid of this feeling at this point but it's been dragging me down and even the mention of death causes me to get this way.
