2,"I saw a nurse who seemed really harsh on me. I've seen professionals in the past, even a psychiatrist, and I've never been diagnosed with a 'personality' disorder. A professional has even called me ""well-balanced"" before, and professionals often compliment me on being aware of my feelings.

I want to get this provisional diagnosis sorted out, but at the same time, it seems lower priority than other things I want to focus on. 

Should I be concerned about this provisional diagnosis? Will it affect me in the future, like when seeing a doctor or stuff like job prospects?",09Jan2018,3,
3,"I'm not sure if this applies elsewhere, but anyone who has gone into the mental health care system through the NHS will know that in order to work out best methods of care, you go brought an initial screening.

I've been referred for another screening with a team of psychiatrists and psychologists as such, I've done a great deal of research into my own struggling and I'm curious, to get the best understanding from them, should I just regurgitate the pitiful list of struggles, or shall I explain what I've already learnt to understand about what I'm going through - or will it just get dismissed?",09Jan2018,1,
4,"I've always struggled with making and keeping friends. Looking back I'm certain that being undiagnosed, then misdiagnosed, and unmedicated made forming relationships difficult. Now I'm medicated and in therapy. I'm also married, but I really need some friends. I'm lonely and it's important to have people outside of spouses to talk to.

I'm disabled due to my illnesses. I have schiztoaffective disorder bipolar type, anxiety, ADHD, and in the winter I develop SAD. I haven't worked in two years so I don't really get out much. My paranoia makes going out alone kind of difficult. In person meeting is very difficult right now. I've tried meeting people online but once they find out I'm disabled (and because of mental illness) they disappear. I'm getting desperate. I'm just so lonely. It hurts to have no one to text and talk to. 

So, anyone else struggle with this? How do you overcome it and meet friends? Did you meet someone through a certain website or something? Please share! ",09Jan2018,1,

6,"Current semi-repetitive thoughts, often between photoshoots or during inactive periods in modelling:

I'm trying too hard to be a model. I'm too short, not the right shape, could do with hacking parts off (I guess this might be old creeping body dysmorphia, to a degree). Maybe I'm not meant to be a model, and I'm being humoured. I see pretty, talented and inspirational people around me and strive to meet even a fraction of their success. To prove to myself more so than others that I can succeed in something that I want to do. I'll never be sought out by people. I'll never be reached out to by designers (although this -has- happened, thanks brain). I'm oddly both confident in my posing abilities and 'try any shoot concept at least once' attitude, and full of not-quite crippling self-doubt. I did at one point want to go full-time and had people encouraging me, then realised that it was my friends suggesting this to me rather than others; so, maybe they were just blind encouragements. 

- Any suggestions as to how to get out of this funk?

7,"So I thought I was over this once I got married but its rearing its ugly head again 20 years latter. All my life growing up, I had a very hard time getting relationships going with women that weren't friend zoned immediately. I was intelligent, not totally fugly etc but later in life we have discovered I likely have had low testosterone all my life. Maybe that played into the issues. I found I had far more success dating with fix ups from friends or with women I talked to or met online first. Anyway..

The issue is my marriage is falling apart. She doesnt want to work on it so we are kind of drifting right now. A person I know barely professionally online(i.e. we share professions and discuss mainly that) but who has said some nice things to me, has suddenly become the focus of my wandering attention during the day. Now over the years I've developed a way to distance myself from my feelings somewhat and look at situations objectively, I learned to do this to gauge if I am supplementing too much testosterone and if its causing anger issues. I see how I am reacting now and go WTF. 

Does anyone else ever react this sill going gaga over someone they haven't met, have seen a pic of, have only talked to about professional things? Hell I dont even know if she is married or not. Do I react this way just because I sit in a house with my family and 5 pets and feel utterly alone, like I need to get a volley ball and paint a face on it level of alone? I sit here and hope she will message me, or comment on a post I have made or talk about something she has done. When I look at it makes me sick but when I am living it, its a lot like and addiction.

8,"I've been thinking the past month or so I might have a mental health disorder. I just want to know if anybody can relate. I've researched this before and thought I might have ADD-innatentive. I've always felt a little bit different in how I process life ever since I was a pre-teen. I feel like I don't experience life, instead I am experiencing myself analyzing life. Im always in my head. I don't feel like I hardly ever ""Let go"". People see something and they're eyes light up and they smile, wether that be a friend or something interesting on tv. I don't. For me its more like ""Oh hey there's my friend..."" and then I smile because its the ""correct"" thing to do. Or if someone goes ""Hey watch this video its funny"". My initial reaction is never excitement. First its a mental strain with just the thought of giving my attention to something, and then when I'm focusing on something wether its a person talking to me or a tv show I get a uncomfortable crippling ""frozen"" feeling. I am self-consious about looking like I am interested, but my natural instinct is to feel uncomfortable because I'm having to pause my brain. I don't get this if I'm by myself, unless I'm ""having"" to do something due to work.

 Eye contact is hard, I get social anxiety. If someone is talking for awhile, I cringe mentally every time they start a new sentence. You know when you can tell someone is going to keep talking for awhile. It makes me uncomfortable. Its like I'm using all my effort to listen, which makes the other parts hard like appearing interested.

And whenever stuff like this happens I feel it physically drowning my spirit/soul. Everyday I go through phases, that are hard to even pinpoint. If I feel ""content"" that is good enough for me. But then 5 minutes later, it feels like someone drains all the seratonin out of my body. I have a headache, I feel tired, I feel like I'm moving in slow motion, and I have no will. It feels like depression. And then it goes away. When its happening I feel like I can't ""Positive think"" my way out of it. Its either happening or not. Sometimes it lasts hours, I have bad days and okay days.

I might as well be walking through a snow storm whenever I'm asked to make the choice to go out and be active, or hang out with friends. It feels like a challenge. And this is not only related to social anxiety. It could be something like going out to eat with family, going on a walk, or especially watching a movie. I've been turning down movies since I was like 11 years old. Why? Because the thought of dedicating my attention to something for an hour and a half gives me anxiety. My father has never understood that.

I guess writing this out I'm realizing how much this has to do with being ""expected"" to do something. For example, I enjoy my job because I work for myself. There are definitly parts I don't like, but overall I like it. I also have a delivery job. I like that because they give me a list of what to do, and I go out and do it. The few times they've asked me to help out in the office, are always the worst days.

I've always been introspective, with a will to better my life since I was a teenager. But maybe to introspective. I felt I knew everybody better then they knew themselves. I felt disconnected growing up, because I didn't seem to have the impulsive emotion my friends had. I thought it was because I was more intelligent, but it could because how my brain works.

Its not all bad. I guess my lack of emotion can be a good thing. I rationalize everything. I don't allow something to affect me to much. If something negative happens, I accept it. I don't remember the last time I've cried over something thats happened to me, although I have empathy for other people. I'm not the most unsocial guy, I can have good conversations with people. Give me some drinks and I'm full of energy. Give me some pot and I think clearly about my life(not around people though, I'm 100% an actor trying to stay present around people on pot). 

I've felt different since a small child. I had surgeries as a young child that left scars on my face. I was definitely aware of this as a young kid. Very shy, did not feel like I related. Slowly and surely I made friends every year, so I never suffered with loneliness as a young child. Until I got into middle school and started facing realities of depression and fitting in to a ego-centered/insecure society of kids. However I haven't felt self consious about how I look since 14 years old.

Overall I want to conquer this on my own. Maybe I'm just slowly and surely learning how to be myself. Although I go through phases, overall I feel I've improved my happiness every year. It just frustrates me to think its something out of my control. The ""cloudy mind"" and the impromptu depression is what I don't like. To go from feeling alright to living in ""greyness"" multiple times in the span of a few hours is what scares me.

9,"- first time poster here, not sure if required but *trigger* warning, depression, suicide, self harm.

I (f21) have been good friends with a guy (m22) since high school- 6years. We've never been super close, as in sharing intimate details of our private lives, more so just chatting and joking about everyday stuff. We're both pretty serious athletes at college and hence why we see each other regularly and have become pretty good mates. Last night he told me over text he was extremely depressed. Whilst I knew he's been through bad patches and can be pretty pessimistic, this conversation really shocked me. When we see each other, we laugh and joke around and I never realised he was hurting so bad. He talked about how much he hated himself, how insignificant his life was, how everyone (including myself) would get over his death very quickly, nihilistic ideas about how life was meaningless, how life wasn't worth living anymore, how he desired death, how people who could kill themselves were courageous. I told him otherwise, that he meant a lot to me and he was significant, how life was worth living. I tried to say these things in a caring way, and not refute or ridicule him for thinking this way, just tried to remind him that the depression was causing him to see the world in this way. At this point I realised despite having gone through an anxiety disorder at the age of 12 and seeing a psychologist regularly up until this point, I really can't fully comprehend what he's going through. I don't know what to say to help, I think I'm being non judgmental and understanding, and listening to what he's saying, but I don't know what it's like to feel the way he does, it seems like his world is so clouded by the depression he can't see the truth. So that's my first question, some tips on caring for and supporting a depressed person? And things that I can say when he's really depressed that offer some support?

Secondly, he started going into depth about suicide. This scared me to the point I was crying reading these messages. He said he didn't have the courage to commit suidicide, and envied those who did. I said that I didn't think suicide was courageous, I think it's a way people deal with being really sick and hurting inside, and those people need help and love and care. Talk of suicide continued, described in a desirable, romantic way. He discussed various methods of how he would do it. I said I don't think that's a good idea, and asked him whether he was considering killing him self that night or in the near future. He said unlikely because I've felt this way for a long time but have never had the courage. So this is my second question, who should I tell about this? It has to Be taken seriously, but at the same time I don't want to go behind his back or humiliate him by telling someone who he doesn't want to know? 

After this conversation I recommended seeing a psychologist. He's on medications as of late last year, but has never seen a psychologist. We have a free local psychology organisation for youth that he could see. I told him I've seen a psychologist and it has really helped me. He really didn't seem very keen, and I didn't push it too hard as it's his choice but he needs to see someone. I'm sure his parents would pay for someone as he's fairly well off. How do I convince him without pushing? I'm more than happy to book it for him and come with him if that helps him get there.

Lastly, I think he's really lonely. Most of our friends including myself have a partner. He's never had a partner or had any sexual relationship (or interaction?)as far as I'm aware. He doesn't have a best friend he can really confide in, although he does have quite a few good friends myself included, and is well liked. He lives at home, and his parents are split up. Whilst his parents seem like lovely people, from what he says, his dad is overworked, burnt out and perhaps depressed himself and his mum is busy with 2 young siblings. He says he spends most time at his mums or his dads home byhimself, cooking his own meals and doing everything by himself, and he hates being alone. He's not Close with his parents so I don't think he gets much support from them. I don't think they know how bad his mental health is. The athlete part brings another element, and he is insanely perfectionistic and dedicated. I think he pushes himself really hard, almost like self-flaggilation, and guilts himself if he doesn't do everything right. 

The whole thing has taken a bit of a toll on me, I feel really stressed about him. I know I can't solve his issues for him, but I think he really needs someone there for him as at the moment he doesn't seem to have anyone. I'm going to try to message him more often and meet up with him to do more things. Any other suggestions would be more than welcome!

11,"So I wanted to relate with others and see if anyone else feels this way or sees this as normal. Like to start off by defining:

Empathy: The ability to sense/identify other’s feelings. 

Sympathy: Emotional response (pity/sadness) towards others. 

The best way I can explain this is my friends and family can be upset or have something emotionally drastic happen to them. One example given, my fathers aunt died a few months ago and he was very sad. I understood his sadness and why he was sad but I did not feel sad because he was sad. This doesn’t mean that I don’t care, but it can be conveyed that way when I am not showing sympathy.

More frequently, I also experience this feeling a lot when my wife (MDD) has (for a lack of a better term) depressive episodes. 

Anyone else get this feeling?

tldr; I recognize sadness and sorrow in others but do not feel sadness and sorrow in response. ",09Jan2018,3,

14,"I've always had trouble feeling like traumatic events in my life actually made an impact or accepting that these things aren't a normal part of growing up.

Lately, amongst other things, I've been struggling with serious suicidal thoughts (again). I've made some difficult albeit rational and hopefully positive decisions in this regard, but I can't really recognize any emotions surrounding these decisions.

I don't think I'm depressed, at least not in my usual way. I am not flat in general, I still enjoy things, I'm not oversleeping despite heavy sedatives, anxiety isn't higher than normal given the situation. I can obsess over the thoughts relating to my situation and suicidal tendencies and feel sad, angry, frustrated, claustrophobic, hopeless, overwhelmed. However, when push comes to shove and I need to make the decision I'm just detached. Not like derealization, just stoic, methodical, and (hopefully) logical.

No clue why, but I picked up a number of issues growing up. A slight unplaceable ""accent""(?), way more slang than I grew up with in the manner of a 'lower class' vernacular, too many curses, words I tend to mispronounce despite being corrected (...although often of French etymology), slipping into a mumble if I'm not 100% laser-focused on speaking, often speaking too quickly and, if stressed, too loudly without realizing it. I have a very hard time speaking concisely. I do better typing simply because I can revise. Clearer, more logical, easier to understand sentences are harder for me to speak on the fly than I've noticed it is for others.

17,"It began in the first semester of nursing school. I owned little of my time and felt smothered by scholastic obligations. I noticed my mood becoming less and less stable. My relationship with my mattress intensifying and I was crying frequently.

I voiced my health concerns with faculty and urged them to withdrawal me from an experimental course they drafted me into or to remove me from a scholarship they awarded me ( it required too many meetings, socializing, and general up keep) I didn’t want special treatment. I was doing fairly well in my classes all A’s and one B. I just felt it necessary to communicate my deteriorating health and shave off the extra stress from my program. 
I wasn’t taken serious and I ended up feeling really low. I was ready to kill myself. 

This is when I got hospitalized. They kept me in a behavioral health clinic for five days. I sat with a psychiatrist twice for 15 minutes each time, he handed me a prescription and a new diagnosis. He called it dysthemia. This along with my GAD were affecting my life. But he deemed me “stable” and released me. 

Things got worse after this. The nursing program wouldn’t  accept my medical clearance from the clinic and wanted a more thorough excuse. Without it I couldn’t return to clinicals and I would fail. I tried to fight them and just took a medical withdrawal 3/4 of the semester in. This pulled me into a deeper depression. 

This time I spent days crying and not sleeping well. I didn’t want to eat and nothing mattered. Nursing was all I was or wanted to be. How did I screw up my chance? 

I felt ( feel ) defeated. I wonder if I’m fit to be a nurse. I mean... I cracked. And the nursing faculty seemed less than sympathetic to my situation.  The field is also full of bullies. How can I make it?

Tried acid the first time at girls birthday party, super fun. Tried it again stupidly a couple days after. Same day I tried ecstasy. Should of researched first, drugs like those give you a come down. Drugs use up all the serotonin in your brain (happy receptors) come down is the period of recovery which you will be depressed as hell. 

I fucked up badly because I took the drugs before my family vacation to California. It ended up being the worst experience of my life. Anything fun we did, I was super out of it and boring. I felt so bad because the family had to deal with a sheep. I was worthless. Thinking back about it triggers me and makes me confused.

Now its lead to a more stable actual depression and anxiety after the week of recovering (3-7 days for a semi full recovery)

I don’t know whats wrong with me, I cant sleep, when I try I end up thinking about the trip or something in the past and I get mad and sad. Like just looking at old videos I watched 5 years ago made me so mad I almost cried, that doesn’t seem normal at all. I think i’m loosing my sanity due to drugs.

The other guys in the office all laugh and chat and have fun, and when I try to participate it feels like I’m just over talked and undervalued. I know age would play a role, im 19, and the other guys are in their late 35-early 50’s. I’m the young guy of the group, and I’m only there because I know what I’m doing. 

It feels like a lot of people at work undervalue me, and it’s hard, no one except my boss took the time to get to know me, and even at that I still feel left out. I play an important role just like the rest, and I shouldn’t need to feel left out, I would tell my boss how I feel but unfortunately I don’t feel like I’m able to, we’ve never had any drama etc in the office and he makes it clear he doesn’t want their to be any, and I feel like my voicing how I feel will get me in trouble. My last employer fired me for explaining how I feel, they fired me on the spot without notice.

26,"Here’s the story: In one of my first few psychotic episodes, I proclaimed loudly at an ice skating rink that I was a violent, perverted child rapist. Many skaters heard that and many of them believed that. I was later diagnosed with delusional guilt and some sort of messiah complex. 

After consulting a doctor and agreeing to hospitalization, medication was issued and a case manager / nurse was assigned to me to help clear my leftover deviant thoughts. The counseling, however, mostly focused on possible manifestations of symptoms. Scenarios that I actually encountered in daily life were dismissed. An unpleasant experience I raised was considered by the nurse as some type of delusion. 

The case manager was informed of the harassments that I faced after the incident but merely told me that no one was going to care about what I had done in the public space. People forget easily and no one cares. He advised me to keep on going to the rink and enjoy skating. When I told him that I was laughed at quite directly, he just wanted to put that topic aside, betting that the bizarre thought would fade as time goes by.

A rehabilitated patient also shared with me how her case manager absurdly jumped to conclusion that her bullies were just her hallucinations. Medical staff are supposed to help psychotic patients to build a connection with the reality but if they doubt everything their patients say, chances are they are not going to go very far. If patients really are buying that every problem they face is just their own hallucination or delusion, they are simply going to live in their own worlds. This is just going against the initiative.

-Lives in the US
-High functioning autistic (terrible in social situations, doesn't handle stress well, and is skilled in the IT industry)
-Lonely (Never had a Girlfriend)
-Extremely overweight (355 lbs)
- 6 foot 6 
-An introvert
-Lives with recently widowed mother

- My father died on December 23
- Our older brother is saying things to him like, ""You need move out.  Mom needs a smaller place and you need to get out so my kids and I can live here."" 
- He agreed to work on Christmas (2 days after dad's death) 
- He was accused of sexual harassment on Xmas; The stress of working on Xmas after dad's death got to him. So, he offered a piece of home made spice loaf to the pretty girl at work.  She graciously accepted, but once my brother stepped away, the pretty girl threw it on the community table without a second thought.

He and pretty girl get called into the office to explain the drama on Xmas. HE said he felt offended and that he was dealing with the stress of his father's recent death.  The pretty girl said, ""He sexually harasses me all the time, he stares at me and sent me a love letter.""   My bro and management asked her to produce the note. She couldn't and management said, ""Let's let this go and move his desk away from you.""    Pretty girl says, fine.  The next day pretty girl comes in says, ""I have a witness and I spoke to our government point of contact and they said you can't tell to provide proof of harassment in an uncomfortable environment.""    Pretty girl circumvent management structure and tried to get the gov't involved.  Gov't said, ""handle it or we want a whole new crew"".  The pretty girl is still making a stink about this.  My bro's supervisor told him, ""We don't know what to do, what to do about you.""  He is crushed and stressed.

All of this is becoming too much for him.  He keeps yelling out that he is lonely and wants a woman in his life.  

I am signing us all up for family therapy to help him out.  I don't think that is enough and I don't know enough about mental health to be able to help him.  

We've also taken the precaution of hiding the firearms and checking in with him a couple times a day. 

So, what should I do?

How do I find a balance of not coddling her, but being empathetic??  And I am writing this as someone who also has GAD and episodic depression so I relate to so much of what she’s experiencing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxt3i7JERX4

I was a Behavioral Health Technician in the Navy and I do it as a civilian now. I am not saying I know much about people’s behavior but I am passionate about helping people and believe that sometimes we need help and sometimes we can help. I hope this helps someone who may not realize that the hatred they feel for something is controllable. It takes practice and it is not easy but we can choose how we react to life. You are not obligated to react a certain way to anything, so why choose to react with hate? I have been able to gain a lot of different perspectives on how people work with their own emotions. I think learning to control our emotions is a good place to start in improving our lives and the lives of those around us.

So let's take the first step in trying to eliminate hate by addressing the hate that we create within ourselves! Hate hurts the person who has it the most and the world forces enough on us so why would you hurt yourself further? I just want this to help someone so if you know someone who could use this please share with them! Let's focus on LOVE this year!",09Jan2018,1,
40,"I have a friend from my highschool who is my one of my two roommates. He wasn't like this before, but recently he has changed.

After returning from university (Whenever he have time), he plays videos games all day, literally from 10 am to 2 am, every single day.

I've seen him running back home just to play video games, and he doesn't even have proper meals.

Even worse, he is speaking with other people on discord, and shouting things from time to time, again from 10 am to 2 am.

My other roommate is suffering from the noise, and asked me if I can silence him, but when I ask him to be quite, that only last 10 min max, and he starts yelling again.

Now, it is not only annoying me, but also makes me worry how he is having no communication with his real friends and so on.

42,"So the last month or 2, I've done more laying or slouching (not sitting upright) on the couch than anything else. Binge watching shows all day, sleeping 12+ hours... Hell, I even missed Christmas with my family. The only other time I've ever been this sedentary was in jail, and even then I think I was generally more active, as I worked out daily, played 21 in the yard and even learned yoga.

I can't stand my girlfriend I'm living with but I'm unemployed and have no motivation to get a job so I don't have the financial means to move out. I'm more out of shape than I've ever been as an adult with no motivation to exercise or do anything physical--in a way, that just makes me feel worse as it reminds me how weak I've become.

I've never in my life given less of a damn about anything and everything than I do now and I don't want to stop. The only time I'm active/functional is when I'm on a bender. Oh such fun. I don't even have the motivation to proofread/add all the relevant detail to this post so I'm done",09Jan2018,1,
43,"I was professionally diagnosed with clinical depression and GAD as a preteen and have had a long history of psychiatric help. With the help of therapy twice a week, I saw a large change in who I was and who I became. But then I started bringing my family into sessions in which they'd bring up events that.. I can't remember for the fucking life of me..
They would tell of times where I had imaginary friends (more then not, a small blue cat) that in my mind was very real. They noted that I would distance myself from my brothers so I could play with my imaginary friends. Moreover, they talked about my sleeping patterns as a child and how I'd wake up countless times in the night crying, saying there are people in my room or right outside of my window. But as I said, I cannot remember any of this what so ever. I remember having a great childhood for what little we had and I remember having bountiful friends in and outside of school. Yeah, I slept horribly, but we lived next to an airport, what's to expect? Sure, my home life was stressful because I could never live up to my step-dads expectations and he'd always let that be known; effectively murdering my self-esteem and any ego I may have ever built up for myself, but I've come to terms with that and have been working to better myself in ways I see redeemable. Regardless of the cons, I felt more normal then than I ever have, even now. But this little ""revelation"" spurred my long-time therapist to reffer me to another treatment center for ""further diagnosis"". I just thought everyone was fucking dumb and chalked everything up to a childs imagination and they where taking things to the absolute extreme. So because of this, I haven't contacted any mental-health clinic since then, I refused to answer the new treatment centers calls or emails until they stopped coming, and I have virtually no interaction with my physician what so ever despite many letters in the mail.. this was three years ago.
Now, I'm almost 21 and feel as if I've got a firm graps on normality. But I'm more depressed and stressed out then I can ever recall being before despite my strive for personal acceptance. But for the past three months, I've been seeing flashes of light from behind my fence (which i can see over while on the top step of deck) whenver I leave the house almost as if someone is taking pictures of me. I've talked to my neighbor's if they installed some sort of cameras or lights and obviously they told me ""no""; but not believing them and being the detremined son of a bitch I am, I did myself some snooping around the outside of their house and came up with absolutely nothing. 
I haven't thought about what my parents said durring my last therapy session at all until yesterday evening... but it really got me pondering the situations. My close friends and family have urged me to admit myself to a psychiatric hospital this past week but I don't see myself as any worse then I was last week or the week before. If thing do persist though I'm going to seek a professional diagnosis.
Is it a possiblity that my depression and GAD are just symptoms of something else? What do I do if I don't want to seek professional help after a diagnosis??

I have spent more than half my life (22yrs diagnosed) with mental illness.  For the longest time I was diagnosed with depression and had that modified to Bipolar Disorder II a couple years ago.

52,"Hey r/mentalhealth, I haven't posted in a while.

I feel like I've been able to narrow down my problem, and it's a conflict over a decision:

Option A: Just be myself. This means I'm more relaxed, less stressed and will be less (over-)ambitious. I will take things less serious in general but also feel like I'm dominated a lot more by my feelings and moods, and have less self control.

Option B: The serious way of life. I will overcome myself more often to step out of and expand my comfort zone, but doing this as much as possible stresses and fatiques me. I feel like I accomplish more but cannot enjoy these accomplishments at all. Everything becomes a chore/work.

My entire life boils down to this conflict, and I cannot seem to resolve it. Has anyone made similar experiences? How to deal with this choice?",09Jan2018,1,

immature
avoidant

63,"I need advice dealing with my husband who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago. Details are below, but things are really bad. He's a good man, and I love him very much and want things to work out but there's this ""Devil inside him"" that is hard on us both and I don't know how much more I can take.

Backstory:
December 2016, he collapsed and had a ""seizure"" at work. He was life flighted to the big city hospital where he was in the ICU for 5 days because they were almost constant and wouldn't stop. I say ""seizure"" because they were diagnosed as pseudoseizures, he would go blank and pass out then not remember anything, rapid fire. He started out super confused and scared and it turned into murderous rage at doctors, family, everyone so he was transferred to the psych ward after they concluded they couldn't do anything for him and they finally stopped. He was diagnosed with bipolar II, given a prescription for depakote twice a day and sent in his way.

Since then, he hasn't been himself. He always had a bit of a temper, but nothing too extreme. After the hospital stay he lost his job and was ""looking"" for 6 months but I had to push him to actually look and he just sat around all day. He'd fly into rages (still does) for the tiniest things (always directed at me for some perceived slight) that don't make any sense, yelling in my face, evil eyes, slamming doors, shaking, breaking things...this happens probably once a week and he'll call me from work and apologize but I'm always on my toes for the next explosion.

There have been a lot of changes lately, we had a baby (I found out I was pregnant when he was in the hospital), I quit working so finances are tight but that's a source of stress for him. We have enough money, but just need to keep spending under control, which is something he's not good at. He's not a bad person, I don't want anyone to think that, I just want to help him but it's at the point where I want to leave with our son until things get better because I can't live like this anymore and I can't have our son exposed to it either. Problem is that's logistically impossible and it would probably make things worse because of his destructive tendencies. Worst case scenario he might commit suicide and best case he sinks into ""depression"", spends all our money on beer and cigarettes, can't get to work, and loses his job and that's not helping anybody. 

It distresses him that he can't control this side of him but is also of the old school thinking that mental illness is ""something wrong with you"" and he won't see a therapist and I don't want to press the issue of a med adjustment because he is upset enough that he has to take it and I have to remind him and all that. That's my reasoning behind leaving until he gets it together, but like I said, I'm not sure that would be a positive thing. We're going to marital counseling at our church, which is better than nothing, but the pastor isn't qualified to deal with mental issues this deep. Is there a possibility that it's something else entirely that needs different treatment? I'm home all night with baby so I'll keep checking back to answer any questions or clarify anything that might help. 

Note: he is not physically abusive. If I felt my son or I were in danger of physical harm, we'd find a way to be gone in a heartbeat. We've come to the agreement that whenever this happens, I can gently put baby in his crib so ""neither of us"" are holding him angry but I'm just trying to avoid any impulsive carelessness/accidents on his part to be honest.

Edit: he has a family history of mental illness on his mothers side. She's bipolar as well but doesn't need meds anymore and you'd never know. ",09Jan2018,4,

Then there is the really strange one. I often feel like I've outlived the life I should have lived. Like I should have died years ago and I'm not living now because someone's going to tap me on the shoulder and say ""hop it""
