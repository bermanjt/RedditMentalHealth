A few examples are using ket and driving, stepping out into traffic on main roads without looking, going far over the regular dose of prescriptions whenever I get any etc.

3,"I moved to Sydney 8 months ago and then I caught a virus which I can’t completely overcome, and my anxiety and depression has become unmanageable. I only started antidepressants around a month ago and they aren’t helping yet. My therapist has recommended private inpatient care - The Sydney Clinic or St. John of God, as I am isolated and my partner can’t be at home much to help. Our insurance will completely cover it all. I think, at 32, I am too old for USpace at St Vincent’s Private. I had a bad call with the admissions at the Sydney Clinic and some of the google reviews have scared me off the facilities my therapist recommended. Can anybody talk about their experiences in inpatient care or recommend anywhere else? I am a bit frightened but willing to do it and want to try and make sure I go somewhere really good.

5,"I have very sentimental feelings attached to a lot of the toys and belongings I had as a little kid, and I still have several boxes of them. I even still have my old dollhouse, which I was obsessed with as a kid. I feel guilty and silly for holding onto so much stuff that just takes up room and creates more clutter. I know that it isn’t normal to be this attached to my old stuff but I can’t seem to let go. How can I start to let go of some of this stuff without being heartbroken over it? And is this rare or do people just not talk about it? I feel like it is largely related to my anxiety, because having items, especially ones with fond memories attached to them, bring me a lot of comfort. However, holding onto this much stuff gives me more anxiety so it’s counterproductive. ",16Sep2018,1

7,So recently I was told by a loved one that I’m the most narcissistic person they’ve ever known. I’d probably be offended if I didn’t realize that they’re 100% right. I’ve begun to do research and I can’t believe I was so unaware. I can’t think about a time in my life where I didn’t exhibit narcissistic behavior. Even when I was a kid I think I did. I’m humiliated (but humbled) to think that people have probably been aware that I’m like this for years and I had literally no idea. The thing is that i’ve been racking my brain to figure out the reason why. I don’t know if it has anything to do with my brain chemistry or if it’s because of the situations in which I grew up. All I know is that i’m still switching between the mindset that I’m one of a kind and that’s why people don’t get me and the mindset that I don’t want to be like this anymore...which I think is a start. I can’t afford therapy right now but I certainly plan to talk to my therapist about this issue when I can start going again. So I leave you guys with the question: what makes a person turn into a narcissist? Thanks for any input guys! ,16Sep2018,2
8,"I woke up from a nap with my heart racing and several times when I breathed in deeply through my nose, catching distinct smells, multiple ‘broken’ memories entered my head and psychologically it was as if I were trying to remember something but it was so vague it slipped away. I couldn’t control trying remembering I was on auto pilot. Whatever the mental image or idea was seemed so important but I couldn’t put my finger on it. It was the same thing each time and very brief, like a split second and then it was gone.

16,"Hi all,
We're in California. To start, my co-worker (R) and I aren't friends, but we've always been on good and friendly terms. In the past several weeks, I've noticed an alarming shift in his personality. I figured it really wasn't any of my business, until today, when his long-time partner (L) showed up at our work to speak to me about him. Apparently, R has very recently and suddenly become physically abusive to L. L explained that it began with R picking fights and screaming at L for seemingly no reason, but in the past couple of weeks, it has evolved into R choking L on at least one occasion and threatening L with sexual violence. 

L moved out of their apartment last week and is not currently in contact with R. To be clear: L is now safe, but is still very much scared for and concerned for R.

L confided in me that he believes R has begun using very hard drugs. I don't know if the drug use is the cause of the personality shift or if he started using afterward. I don't know why L has come to me for help; I'm guessing he's scared and desperate. I don't know how to help them. I don't have any of R's family contact information; L is his emergency contact on file at our job.

R and I are both students at the local university. I've already emailed Student Psychological Services to ask them to point me in the direction of resources, but since it's Saturday, I won't hear back from them until at least Monday.

Is there anything else I can do or suggest L can do?",16Sep2018,3

24,"Hello, little bit of a weird post here but I need to get this out of my head and into writing.  As much time as I happily invest in consuming content on my own, I spend just as much time trying to get friends to consume that same content.  A harmless comedic example of this would be a friend showing another person a video. and waiting/hoping to see them react to various parts (jokes, twists) they have already seen. I often find myself doing this an unhealthy amount. I used to bug friends about things of this topic endlessly to the point that I would ruin the experience for them. I find myself playing/finishing a game and immediately wanting to watch another person play it and experience it.  This is no minor desire either, it almost completely overwhelms my mind, to the point that whenever I happen to be communicating with a friend I often can't help bringing up all the media/games I want to watch them play / watch with them.  Recently i've tried toning this behavior down but my mind is still on a loop about how me not asking them is not getting me what I want. Even as I write this I feel like a little kid who ""just gets things stuck in his head"" or ""can't ever just go with the flow"".  I also know that my having recognized this as a problem is already along the lines of myself answering my  own question.

25,"To start, please dont be a douche about this. Theres nothing anyone can say that I haven't already said to myself. 

Alright so I used to have friends way back in the day

But I've gotten into this horrible shite cycle of making a friend, then getting scared and worrying if I should even trust them, and then I stop responding to them.

It's more of a man do they hate me or they scare me and pish and then they become part of my list of people who I cant think about because I feel like an aloof douche canoe because I'm a scaredy cat and I cant handle people

So then as any normal person would, they move on and make some new friends because blah blah I'm depressed or whatever 

But sometimes I get SO scared that I wont tell anyone anything. I have this regret in my gut for being too open about my feelings when I was youngers, or not being open enough. So who needs venting when you have existential dread of your own worries and you can keep all 10,000 to yourself?

Now I have no meaningful friendships bevause no one can get withing 10 feet of me because I'm so scared I've jacked up everything for myself and i dont know how to fix it. 

Moral of the story, I want friends but I'm terrified I'm gonna push the next person away again without realizing it or even doing it intentionally because I will keep myself up at night worrying if they just pity me or they hate me already and I'm gonna continue to feel like the asshole in everyones lives. 

It's gotten to the point that I look to hobbies for fulfillment but nothings making me happy anymore, nothing fills the hole, it's a dark place to be in and it's only getting darker you feel?

P.S. I had this depersonalization and extreme anxiety problem (I thought I was losing my mind bc everything would look weird for like 10 mins probably part of the reason I got rid of some of my friends is because I didnt want them to find me crazy) from like 7th to 12th grade and it turns out I was developing epilepsy. Neurologist was surprised my docs didnt notice anything sooner. 
I know its irrelevant but It was part of the reason i pushed some people away.

26,"So my best friend (25/F), “K” and I (26/F) have known each other since grade school. I know she struggles with bipolar depression, but aside from her drawn out periods of highs and lows (usually at least 2-3 until meds are properly adjusted), she definitely is somewhat deviant in a few social aspects. She is med compliant. There’s an inflammatory disorder going on as well. She’s a tough case. She tends to be low. 


Her and I have gotten into a few fights. Maybe one falling-out, but we picked up where we left off, and we’re still very close. Times she’s been hospitalized have always been during mood troughs, a there was self harm involved when was younger. 2 very serious suicide attempts, a minor one in high school. Very, very anxious. Some borderline symptoms that have considerably slowed down (if not diminished). A few unstable relationships that she has now come to let people be, and she’s actually a loner. She lives alone, lives with an SO for a few years. Disastrously volatile. We (K’s family &amp; me) warned her about how unstable her ex was. Ultimately K broke it off. 


Her self image has improved considerably. She’s no longer self-loathing. No interest in self harm in years (I know her well enough to know). 


However, there is (and always has been) a flip side. I’ve seen her go in though relationships with minimal to no emotional response  She goes through periods of isolating for a few weeks. Ignores texts from most people. Cancels plans. She’s not usually sad or depressed when she does this though. Her whole abandonment thing has just become “whatever” with age. 

I’ve also known K to be highly intuitive and even manipulative at times if she needs something accomplished (namely personal matters). Whether it’s cutting corners to save cash or  avoiding troublesome situations that she knows she contributed to— without any relationship related issues. Example: K was never phased by sliding by a few rules to pass exams. Cheating never bothered her. She’s smart enough to do well. She can be lazy, keeping in mind that she struggles with more than mental illness. 


She also had periods of ruthlessness with words amidst altercations. Many girls in school avoided her. She sought dominance in almost every situation. She doesn’t realize that she sometimes comes across as arrogant or aloof. I know her, so I know she’s not that. But I can see how people would point that out.

28,"I don't even know where to start. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and OCD and mild depression 2 years ago. I was prescribed an antidepressant, however after about 6 months later my OCD got worse so they doubled my dosage.

After a few weeks I was so depressed I couldn't function. I would get drunk to take my mind off it (wasn't told not to drink on antidepressants) and then would have panic attacks lasting for 4+hours where I would completely disassociate. I would always be on the move. I would drive hours away in the middle of the night with no sense of direction or I would run and run and keep running during the day. I couldn't sleep; I would constantly wake up in the middle of a panic attack. I began self-harming regularly, I was contemplating suicide and when people found out I would beg them to just let me go. I thought I was the worst person in the world. 

Eventually I came off the higher dose and I returned to my normal state of anxiousness and was far less depressed. I could function and although I was traumatised by all that happened I was in a much better place. I even worked with a therapist to reduce the burden of my OCD and I got it down to 3 major obsessions and rituals instead of 20+. I was so proud.

Then, 6 months into this year my anxiety got worse. I couldn't function as I was so preoccupied with getting everything in my life perfect and being the perfect person. I would go through stages where I wouldn't let myself eat and I was constantly moving and then I would have weeks where I couldn't do anything. So I was put up to the higher dose again. 

This time I lost all energy. I sleep 12hrs a night and still wake up exhausted. I cry at absolutely nothing and have regular breakdowns. I feel so low and sad and miserable that life feels like it has no meaning. Soon all my thoughts turned to self-harming and now it is all I can think about. I don't want to do it as I know it didn't help me last time but the urge is so strong and constant. I keep thinking about taking that next step too. Almost fantasizing about ending it all and even have plans and a note drafted. I flick between will I/won't I constantly. I know it is this medication and I know I need to come off it but it is almost like I don't want to. Because then I think I will have no excuse if I do something and it will be all for attention or I won't do something and I will have to continue living in a world that currently feels meaningless. I don't know what to do. I am so low and all I have are these dark thoughts and no hope.

If I come off this medication then I am anxious, if I am on it I am depressed... I don't know what to do...

Little backstory I’ve suffered from severe depression for many years (I’m still young but it started as a child) and had gone through self harming and attempting suicide (mentioning this because it may be relevant) my whole life I had been a very shy kind of wall flower person. I’d get called on in class for an answer I knew and would get bad anxiety or I couldn’t even order my own food without having anxiety kind of deal for years. While I’ve gotten better and was given the help I needed! ( haven’t self harmed or been suicidal in years) 

 I feel as though I’m almost 2 different people. Not in a personality disorder or delusional way (I’m sorry if that’s offensive I can’t think of another to put it) cause I’m still the same person but I go from being a shy calm kind of anxious person to a strong assertive confident person within seconds if a situation arises where no one else is claiming the position. I just want to know if this normal because I’m always scared of being the centre of attention or the leader but if there’s no one else stepping upto the plate I almost snap and become that confident leader person and after I go back to shy and anxious. I hope that all makes sense and if it does I’d like to hear if that’s a normal thing everyone has or if maybe that strong leader is who I am and maybe I have things to figure out and overcome before I’m able to be that person all the time. I think maybe I snap into that because I want to take care and make sure people are safe and end up with good results in work,school,bar,everyday life etc. Situations.

32,"Hello, I have a very unorthodox, but serious problem and I have very little clue as to what it could be. I'll just get straight to the point.

I constantly feel the need to gag and even throw up for absolutely no reason. It's not just gagging either, but ACTUAL vomitting. This is such a huge issue for me because it gets in the way of daily tasks like showering and brushing my teeth and being out in public. I have thrown up while brushing my teeth. I have thrown up in the shower. I have thrown up while on the toilet. I have thrown up in public, in cars, in restaraunts. Just a side note, I don't throw up on purpose, or want to throw up, ever. Not exagerating, I will feel the need to throw up during anything and everything I do. But besides that, obviously throwing up frequently is probably not good for my body and all that stomach acid constantly travelling up and down my throat. 

How do I cope? It's... weird. If I forget I have this issue, I don't throw up. I've lasted two days without throwing up or gagging, tops. After a year I've just completely normalized this issue and accepted it and it does help with the fear of throwing up a lot (though it still happens even up until today). But my biggest, instant relief? Minty Bubble Gum. It's really strange and I can play as many mind tricks on myself as I want to not throw up, but the second I throw a piece of gum into my mouth it all goes away. Gum gets me through EVERY time, and I've been using it every single day to cope (I've been through 2 sticks as I type this). While brushing my teeth, to not throw up, chewing the brush on top of the minty taste mimics gum and I get through. Yes I chew gum in the shower and on the toilet. I chew gum during conversations. I pop a mint in my mouth to go to sleep. I chew gum 24/7, I'm pretty much known for it. I joke about going through 2 packs of gum a day (but it's sadly true). 

When I first started dealing with this issue, it absolutely destroyed me. I did not want to go ANYWHERE outside my bathroom where my toilet was, because I didn't feel comfortable anywhere in public where I could possibly throw up. I skipped days of school. I'd spend hours inside my bathroom throwing up until I'd have nothing left to throw up. On really bad days, I avoided eating anything as much as possible for fear of vommiting it out later. I'd be doing anything, and all of a sudden if I just have a tiny thought about wanting to gag, I feel that space in my throat/mouth where my gag reflex is, just tighten and close up and I'd have to stop whatever I'm doing and dedicate every fiber in my being to NOT throw up. I overthink about throwing up, and when I think about it, I start gagging. It happens every single day, and it's been happening for the past 2 years. I cannot go 30 minutes without feeling this. In other words, I chew a new stick of gum every 10-30 minutes. 

I have a feeling this is some form or manifestation of anxiety. Or that one phobia people have of vomitting. For anyone who's read through all this, please help. In situations where I can't chew gum or where it's innapropriate, I absolutely throw up. I could keep going through 2 packs of gum a day, but I can't live like this forever! Please don't be afraid to ask any clarifying questions either!

35,"Hello Everyone,

My name is Emma and I am currently completing my Masters of Clinical Psychology degree. I have previously experienced the passing of very close family members as well as hardship and struggles. Additionally, I have also supported children and young people who used suicidal ideation and self-harming behaviours to manage difficult situations and emotions and cope with their demons. As a result of this, I became passionate about learning more about peoples individual experience

The current study explores the experience of young adults aged 18 - 40 years who have previously been in foster care or had involvement with the Department of Child Safety/Protection and remained with their biological family. If you have a spare 10 - 25 minutes and are willing to participate it would be greatly appreciated. Please click on the link below for more information around how the process works and how your confidentiality will be protected. If you need to contact me for any reason you can on the following email address: [emma.ogrady@student.bond.edu.au](mailto:emma.ogrady@student.bond.edu.au).

Thank you kindly for your assistance, as your experience will be valuable in guiding research and clinical interventions for those in the foster care system.

36,"I was an inpatient a couple years ago for a depressive episode - I was ecstatic to be discharged but did not expect to experience stimulus processing issues after.

The first week of discharge was really hard , it was like stepping into a new world. Being in busy areas and shopping centres was hell, I felt like I could hear every noise and conversation simultaneously, like somehow my hearing abilities had increased tenfold. I imagine it to be similar to what people on the autism spectrum might experience during stimulus overload.

Before I was in hospital, I was perfectly fine being in loud environments and crowded places. The symptoms from my days after being discharged have significantly improved but I'm still not the same as I was before.

I haven't heard anyone talk about this before , has anyone else experienced this ? ",16Sep2018,21
37,"Hi everyone, this is my first post. I don't really know where to start. I'm basically completely useless. I'm nearly 21, from Victoria, Australia. I have no job, dropped out of university, I'm a lazy, selfish narcissist, I've had a lifetime of mental illness. 

A little background, when I was 3 I was diagnosed with autism. When I was 5 I was diagnosed with conduct disorder and ADHD (I don't believe I have ADHD, medication never worked and it doesn't affect me anymore). When I was 8 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. When I was 19 I was diagnosed with ASPD and BPD (I do not have these whatsoever, I was dragged to a psych ward by police one day, I saw the Dr, she told me I had ASPD and BPD, and then sent me home the next morning). Between 8 and 13 I was put on Prozac, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Effexor, Celexa, Pamelor, Anafranil, Fetzima, Welbutrin, Marplan, Pristiq, Paxil, and Luvox. I went through the lowest to highest dose of each, my psychiatrist at the time even gave me adult doses which I didn't realize until recently. We tried different combinations too. Not a single medication had a single effect on me, not even side effects coming on or off. I stopped taking 150mg Pristiq cold turkey, which now I know even tapering from 50mg makes a lot of people sick. My body literally did not notice any of these medications. I've done several rounds of CBT, DBT, ACT, IPT, and MBCT, no results there either. I have tried several diets, I was always on a super clean diet as a child because of my so-called ADHD, and those habits have continued into adulthood. I've tried keto to see if carbohydrates caused it, I've tried gluten free to see if gluten caused it, I've tried eliminating foods that contribute to inflammation. I make sure to get loads of B vitamins and iron, and I take magnesium and fish oil supplements. I am very fit, I run a few km most days, my resting heart rate is in the mid-50s. I'm the epitome of health.

I dropped out of university (nursing) at the beginning of this year, I completed two years but I just couldn't bring myself to finish because it was terrible. In that time I did a 6 month course to kill time, in July I joined an employment agency (supposed to be no. 1 in my area) because I was having no luck finding a job. They were able to rewrite and reformat my resume and help me write cover letters and key selection criteria for each job, plus they pay part of your salary as an incentive to the employer. It's been 2 months and I haven't even had so much as an interview. I've been rejected from McDonald's, Hungry Jack's (Burger King), KFC, various supermarkets and department stores, bakeries. People seem to hate me before they even meet me. I've had four jobs in the past, plenty of experience in retail and customer service, I don't know why it's not happening. I'm planning on going back to university next year for education, but I need a casual or part time job to pay for it.

I was seeing a psychiatrist for a year and a half, but he cancelled every single appointment. I'd only get to see him if I begged, which happened once every one or two months. He told me I'm the only person he cancels on because it's a timing thing, so I changed the time and day of my appointments and the exact same thing happened. I think he just didn't want to see me. He was always puzzled about my condition, he tried me on Prozac, Mirtazapine, lithium, and Pristiq - again no side effects, positive, or negative effects, except lithium made me extremely thirsty - lithium was the first drug that actually seemed to make its way into my system. This Dr wanted to look into my physical health to see if there was something causing it, I've had ECG, holter, echo, PET brain scan (showed hypoactivity in my frontal lobe and limbic region, but they still called it a ""normal MRI""), MRI brain scan w/ contrast, adrenal gland ultrasound, every blood test, every urine test - I'm perfectly healthy. I have a lot of trouble finding psychiatrists and psychologists and counselors, nobody wants to treat someone with BPD, ASPD and drug resistant depression stamped on their record. I finally found another psychiatrist that'd take me on after a year and a half of looking again, and he's just as concerned. He's put me on Lexapro, again - useless. He told me last time that in his 30 years of practice, this is the first time he's been truly puzzled.

I have no friends, I never have. I've always had trouble socializing. When I meet someone it's good for a few weeks, maybe months, but then something changes and they just start ignoring me, some are just plain rude to me. I have no idea what I do wrong, nobody will tell me. I've been trying to figure it out my whole life, and from my view I seem to be socializing normally, I'm not ugly or anything, but based on how people treat me, that's not what's happening. 

I so desperately need something to change. I'm using all my time and effort, I break down daily. I cannot move forward, it's never happened and I feel like it never will. I'm never gonna make a friend, I'm never gonna get a job, I'm never gonna get married or have kids. I'm disgusting. I'm a failure. I'm useless. I'm stuck. There's nothing wrong with me, but it looks like everything is wrong with me. I can't just keep living like this. I can't keep wanting to die every second of my life. I can't believe that not a single doctor has seen anything like me, it truly makes me feel like there's no point in trying anymore.

I used to be bulimic as a young teen but that was more of a result of anxiety and my inability to hold down food without feeling incredibly sick (so I would throw it back up). I recently saw someone being bulimic on TV and it triggered me in a way I haven’t experienced before. I have days where I have to force myself from not throwing up my meal bc I feel guilty for eating. My brain instantly thinks it’s a good idea to help me lose weight but I know better. I’ve tried eating within certain hours, eating less all that Jazz but can’t seem to drop the weight and it’s messing with me real hard. I would say I think about losing weight about 70% of the day... it’s getting unhealthy and I don’t know how to stop it. I watch videos and tips and tricks to help me lose the weight I just want to feel happy and it feels like it will never be enough. ",16Sep2018,1
40,"I hate going to church. I have for a long time. I don't like all the people. I'm different from them. I don't like the service I get confused and jittery. I don't like it. Also I'm not Christian like the rest of my family. This morning my dad asked me to go with the family as a ""favor."" I really just want him to happy because he deserves to be happy. He said that there's a difference between me and him. He can be happy and accept and do a favor but I always show my emotions when I don't want to do something. I don't know I guess he's a better person than me. Then he told me it was sad because we'll be the family who doesn't go to church. I said I could go and I could be happy. Even if I don't like it I could pretend if that was the only way he wouldn't be angry for the rest of the day. He then wouldn't allow me to go because he said I'd just be upset. Then they just left.  I don't know how I'm supposed to make my parents happy. I'll never ever be happy enough for them. I'll never be good enough to be a part of the perfect family that goes to church and isn't depressed and doesn't argue with each other. I'm ruining my mom and my dad's dream.

42,"[16M] I’ve realized that I’ve always been feeling like I’m never in the moment in life. I just kinda move through it day to day and don’t make any memories or feel anything anymore. My memory is pretty bad, I can’t always remember things that have happened or how I feel about things and I just feel like I’m so detached or just like empty zombie going through each day. 

I also find it so hard to concentrate on stuff like in school or if I’m reading or listening to music or something. It’s becoming hard to concentrate exactly on what I want to say here as I write this. Music was always my passion and now certain songs or albums that once meant so much to me I can barely concentrate on listening to them and I can’t remember the nostalgia or the emotions that should come with them—same to a lesser extent with movies and books I grew up with and should feel a time capsule of warmth and love for. And also certain places I go to or little moments or experiences I have throughout the day, I feel like I should be able to remember and be in the moment there and then and then look back and feel good about them but I just can’t. I can’t always sleep well and I can never relax. I’m just so mentally checked out all the time that whenever I try to remember anything, like a feeling I felt or a certain memory in time or even a conversation I had a few minutes ago, I just feel like this mental strain or this headache and it becomes completely impossible. 

Granted, there are times where I do feel good and I feel like I’m really enjoying life and being in the present, and where certain songs make me feel some sort of emotion, but those moments are so fleeting and short lived and I don’t know how I can make myself feel like that all the time. I’m just so frustrated about this but nothing makes any impression on me anymore, and I’ll probably forget how I feel in a few hours it’s just that bad. 

A few more things, I don’t know if this affects things but lately I’ve been coming down with a cold so idk if that changes stuff a little more. Also I drink coffee and I drank soda for a long time before that before quitting, and I don’t know if the caffeine has morphed my brain or something as I got older or went through puberty. Again at this moment I feel the importance and motivation to quit drinking caffeine but in a few hours or tomorrow I’ll just be back doing the same thing again.

Thank you so much for reading this whoever did, and if you have any personal tips about lifestyle and how I can improve or change this please please leave me some recommendations.",16Sep2018,5

45,"I need a therapist. I acknowledge this and I am not embarrassed.

I am starting to look for a therapist around my city but I don't know where to start looking for the one who'll fit me. In India, asking your friends for a therapist referral means making a big announcement out of nothing and getting judged too much. I am not in the mood to do this.

Online, I do find a lot of these folks but I don't understand if the shrink who I will meet or speak to, will be able to understand my personal issues or my POV (I feel a strong feeling that I have a lot of issues that might be specific to my life positioning). 

I feel very cautious and I don't have the confidence to disclose my personal life to a random person and not know if it's going to help or not.

My question is, do I mention this to my therapist when I start or should I wait for them to come to their own diagnosis?

48,"So, my grandmother who is 87 has rapidly gone downhill mentally and physically. She falls quite frequently now, doesn't know how long shes been on the ground etc. Which I attribute to old age, possible concussions, and most likely dementia. 

The real mental health thing that scares me is she started to see people and hear voices etc. She is currently in a rehab center for elderly people. Most recent (and probably the scariest), was last night. She said in the middle of the night a man walked into her room, and told her to pack her bags because she was leaving. When we asked who he was, she said it was a nurses husband. She was VERY VERY adamant that it was real, and she even had her bags packed. 

For the past few months shes been seeing people, hearing voices of family members, and saying her husband (who has been deceased for over 35+ years) was home and was setting a spot for him at the table etc. She is VERY adamant that these people are real, the voices are real, and people are seriously with her when she is alone. 

Certain times when we've gone to see her, she has been at the kitchen table, with several plates with food on them set for people talking with them. We walk in and say hi, and she introduces us to her friends, dead family members, or even alive family members and she is being serious. She does have a history of depression, and currently takes anti depressants (Prozac). 

I'm EMT trained and worked in a hospital for a short ammount of time. So I have seen people with dementia. What scares me is she is SO adamant these people are there. She will have us sit down and talk with them. So my mind goes to schizophrenia. Shes from that time period when people didn't really get treated for mental health. So I'm wondering if it could have been like this for a long time, but she refused to tell anyone, and it's become more severe and noticeable because weve been monitoring her and shes in the hospital. So my question is, do you folks think its just severe and worsening dementia, or is something else mixed in there. Thanks alot!",16Sep2018,1

Anyhow...not doing any better, but also not doing much worse. The fire-setting is no better, and I think it had been worse yesterday. The urge wouldn't settle down and kept making me set fires (SAFELY!!!) until I literally crashed. Haven't had a better night's sleep than last night in a LONG time tho! So far today, it is still no better. I am rested so I can fight those urges better for now. I have to. Family is around so no go. It hurts a lot but I can fight them.

Please don't tell me what I'm doing is dangerous because I KNOW this already. That's like telling a suicidal person not to kill themself because it will hurt everyone around them. It is 100% true but it does not help! It just causes more guilt in the person which makes them even more depressed and drives them even closer to actually doing it. Same analogy. I am getting an appointment tomorrow for a Therapist and they want it priority, as they know exactly what this disorder is and it needs to be treated immediately because of the nature of the beast.

52,"So I joined Reddit just to find somewhere where I can write my feelings down. Somewhere that I'm hoping won't judge or make condescending comments just for the shits and giggles. Just want to point out that I'm not suicidal or contemplating it. Also, this isn't a dig at anyone. There's no drama going to be had here.

In the UK, a big thing is made about the elderly and how there are becoming a more lonely generation. How people are becoming so busy that others are just forgotten about. Loneliness doesn't just affect the elderly, it affects youth as well.

I had a difficult childhood in many ways. I am the literal definition of a bastard child (my mum cheated on her husband with a bloke in a one night stand) and I wasn't wanted by my mum because I was a boy. If I'd have been a girl my life would have been hugely different. My grandmother and grandad took me in when my mum was considering adoption and raised me up like their own, and they became my mum and dad in every way.

My grandad passed away when I was 7 in 1996 of a heart condition, something that rocked my nan to the core. She admitted to me on many occasions that the only reason she stayed alive for so long after was because I was there.

Growing up, I had a few problems. Originally doctors thought I was on the Aspergers scale as I had problems communicating, on top of that I had a really bad stutter and could barely string a sentence together. I became very anxious and shut myself away. This carried on through secondary school and struggled to find a social circle that would accept me. I wasn't very gifted academically so I left school at 18 and went into work.

All the while, my nan supported me through everything. We became rocks to each other and helped each other through each others bad points. As I grew up, and went into different jobs, she became the only constant.

The one thing still remained though. I was still very socially awkward. I could deliver a key note speech to 200 people professionally, but ask me to try to pick a girl up or have a personal conversation with someone and I really struggled. I would often decline to go on work get togethers and often was left out in the end. I would bury myself in work and work became what I lived for (living to work, not working to live). 

As I went through job to job, I had the odd relationship but I really struggled in some cases. I accepted that because I wasn't the best looking of guys and the fact I had very little confidence in myself that I would always be the best man and never the husband. I even found starting the conversations difficult, let alone getting those conversations to somewhere that could even constitute ""flirting"".

In 2014 my nan found out she had COPD, mainly caused due to years and years of smoking. The once sprightly woman started to go into her own shell, due to her own difficulties. She became quite bitter about how her life was going. She gave up work and started to resign herself to the same old activities every day, normally watching TV on the kitchen, all the while continuing to smoke.

We also didn't have much family left on the scene. When my nan found out about her condition, she became very isolated. Her family started passing away themselves around her. She was a lot like me in the sense she believed she could do without people (maybe where I got the trait from). She also became very depressed, often talking about dying and how it would be a relief to her. 

In 2016, my life would change dramatically. In the May, a young woman had a job trial in the Supermarket I worked in (I was head of security for the store, a job I loved). I walked past her as she was filling milk up and she smiled at me. To this day, I still maintain that I fell in love with that girl at that very moment. I thought that the girl, with her red hair (at the time) and piercings was amazing. Never did I know how things would go.

The girl got a job where I worked. I had a new starter in the same induction so I was quite close to this induction group (to be honest I couldn't stay away) and she started working for the store in the June. We would have the odd conversation, mostly because it transpired we both had a love of WWE. The conversations at time were a bit awkward for me at times, but either I showed an extreme amount of confidence or she was the most patient person in the world.

Then, it happened. In the July, I somehow (and I don't know where from) found the courage to ask her if she wanted to meet up outside of work, and to my amazement, this girl (who was younger than me and several leagues above me in the looks competition) said yes. We met a few times, and on our 4th meeting, we kissed. We started out slow, but for the first time in over 8 years, I had some female companionship that wasn't my grandmother.

My nans health took a huge turn for the worse about the same time. My life became a roller-coaster at this point. The highs of being with my partner and the lows of my nans health. On top of this, my partner was a uni student and went to start her 2nd year at a uni 100 miles away from home. So my emotions went through a spin cycle at this point.

I saw my partner every week. I would drive to her on the Friday and left on the Saturday afternoon. This wasn't ideal but we attempted to make the best of a bad situation. Everytime I would come home, nan would tell me about a fall she had or difficulty doing something. I don't know whether my nan was jealous of my partner or felt threatened, but I tried to make both things work. At this point, nan started going into hospital because if her difficulties.

Two Thursdays before Christmas 2016, my nan was taken into hospital again, again with breathing difficulties. My partner returned from uni around this time, and would try to help me with all the issues I was having. Nan was diagnosed with Pneumonia, something which scared the living shit out of me, mainly because in the back of my mind I knew she wasn't leaving hospital.

At 5.41am on the 29th December 2016, my worst fears came true. The phone call from the hopsital was brief. But after the words ""Mrs. Malin has passed away"" I honestly couldn't tell anything that was said. For the first time in 28 and a half years, I had no one at home.

My partner did her best. I think the stress that both of us was under at the time (her uncle was fighting a losing battle with cancer) was huge, but somehow we stuck at it. She went back to uni, and again I did the journey down to her every week, but it was at this point I started to feel lonely.

I haven't mentioned my best friend up until now. When me and him first met each other, I hated him. He was a wind up merchant, his Ying to my Yang. Me the ever professional, him the comical work joker. But something just clicked at one point, and over 8 years of friendship (and me being his best man) our friendship is still going strong. We don't see each other as much as we both want, but we have a good time when we do see each other.

But that was the issue, I couldn't see him that often. He wasn't able to make my nans funeral because of work, which I think hurt him more than me at the time. Literally 2 days before my nans funeral, my partners uncle passed away. I was bringing her back from Uni so had driven down to her, and I at least was able to comfort her at that point.

I would go days and days without having conversations with people outside of a work environment. Obviously my partner and I would message, and me and my best friend would, but I would literally leave work, then go home and be alone. I had to do all the things you have to when someone close to you dies, and I grew in mental maturity in so many ways because of the whole experience, but this still didn't help the fact that I was alone for a lot of the time. 

When my partner went into third year at uni, so her stress levels rose. I still felt delicate and at times didn't know how to deal with her issues as well as mine. On top of this, I had been promoted and was in a much more stressful job role (a job which in hindsight I probably shouldn't have taken). I would still see my partner, but we would only see her once a fortnight at this point, which meant even more time alone. I missed my nan more at this point, and I started feeling much worse about my loneliness. 

On top of this, I was attempting to renovate the house me and nan lived in. I was very lucky, that my nan passed away and left me the house we'd lived in as my inheritance. The house was in a poor state of repair, as nan had no energy or money to renovate herself, and with every passing job I was having done, more and more issues (and more and more expense) was being found. This stressed me out to no end.

My partner tried to suggest ways for me to stop the loneliness and stress. She suggested going to the gym. She suggested attempting to take a hobby up. But I didn't have the confidence to go to the gym (nor could I spend the money)	and I really didn't know what to do for a hobby (I wasn't very creative, my partner was) and so found myself in a bit of a rut. 

My partner and I had our issues, and then the envitable happened. In June of this year, mere days after my 31st birthday, we would split for the final time. We both (probably) have different viewpoints about how things went, and I have no reason to go into mine here. Do I regret the break up? Probably. Do I think things could have been different? I don't know. 

This meant that I was literally alone. I had moved into a new company and started finding my feet, but like before, I would leave at the end of the shift and go back to an empty house. I found myself crying at times because of just how quiet the house was, and how much of a rut I found myself in. I would (and still do) put a brave face on things at work, but I do struggle sometimes and sometimes the face goes away.

I am trying to get back on my feet. The place I work has a gym next door (so I have no excuse not to go). I also have a housemate moving in soon, which should help with the expense of the house and (hopefully) help with the loneliness. However, this still doesn't distract from the fact that I do still feel very lonely and I do let my mind wonder and think about things, again which I won't go into here.

I do have regrets about how things have turned out. I do wonder if things between me and my ex-partner could have been different. She seems uninterested in communicating with me, although this maybe due to her own issues rather than me. I also wonder if I should have made more effort with things in my life. I do wonder whether my loneliness is my own fault, because of the fact that I felt so uncomfortable leaving the house, or I devoted so much time to my nan (especially in the latter years). 

If you have read this far, thank you for your attention. Just remember, loneliness affects people of all ages, not just the elderly.

53,"No, not in a way I have anger issues but I have full blown panic attacks whenever someone do something as small as raising their voice in the same area. Recently I noticed that it has escalated to the point of seeing someone argue or vent their anger on the internet will leave me hyperventilating and overthinking. I also loathe the feeling of getting angry and I tend to suppress them a lot and developed some pretty nasty coping mechanism.

54,"I have been struggling with nonstop fatigue for the past 7 years. I first noticed it following a minor cold virus. The fatigue has gradually gotten worse and worse over time. In the beginning it was manageable, just kind of annoying, but every couple months it gets a little bit worse. Now, 7 years later, it has completely taken over my life. My current symptoms include severe chronic fatigue from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep at night, I can feel the exhaustion in my head, head feels very tired and heavy, lower sex drive, it has become very easy to feel intoxicated after drinking minimal alcohol, and I typically fall asleep very easily most nights.

So I have a friend that I made back in high school. We bonded over our mutual love for Hearthstone(Video Game) and we'd talk about the game a lot during classes. He wasn't a really good student so I would tutor him after school and during classes because he didn't like listening to teachers. He ended up getting pretty good results for the final exam and his parents thanked me for taking care of him. They then enrolled him into the same college I went to and told me to take care of him and make sure he did well. Although I promised his mother that I would take care of him, I didn't really fulfill my duty of making sure he studied as I had no classes with him and I would be pretty busy with club activities after classes. I would invite him to the events I organised and went to and he would usually come and I would get to have a nice chat with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day he got mugged while walking back home late at night after helping me out with some event. After that, his parents put a curfew on him to return home right after classes. From then on, he never came to any events with me as his parents wouldn't allow him to stay late. I never made any efforts to hang out with him as I had my own friend group but I would still wave at him when I saw him around. Then a few weeks before our examination, he posted his suicide note anonymously on the college confessions page writing about how he hated the science subjects that his mother forced him to take and that he was doing poorly. He named me in the note with my ign saying that he was sorry he couldn't attend the events I had invited him to and he wished he could have been a better friend to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately he didn't go through with it and his classmates notified the lecturers and he was sent to counselling. His classmates also got him to talk to me. He told me that he didn't like science and that the only thing he was interested in at this point was video games. Looking back, I was kinda harsh to him as I didn't really know how I was supposed to talk to him so I told him bluntly that he'd better just study hard because he wasn't even that good at video games. He ended up doing pretty badly on the exam and would skip classes to go to the nearby cyber cafe and play video games. Then a few months ago, I noticed he always walked around the campus alone (Previously he would walk around with his classmates)  I kind of knew I should probably do something to help him out but didn't know how because I felt like I had nothing to talk to him about as he had stopped playing Hearthstone and he doesn't like science (Which I do and can talk forever about).  I also felt that talking to a depressed person wasn't the best use of my time and he'd probably meet some new friends and get over it.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week we got our mock exam results and he failed 3 subjects and got a C for 1 subject. Not only was it alarming to me that he was not doing well in his studies but he tells people about it as if he is proud of it. He posted about it on the confessions page as an example to tell others to not be disappointed with their results. Is this concerning? And if so, what should I do?",16Sep2018,3
56,"For a few days now I've been having periods of time where I suddenly feel ""on edge"" and I'm constantly looking everywhere to check if everything is normal. Usually it happens when I'm alone but I've been alone for long periods of time before and it was never an issue.

I close all doors that lead to corridors because I can't stop looking to see if anyone is in them. Or anything.

Sometimes I imagine there's someone in the house walking up the stairs right now, but that's obviously not rational because everywhere is locked shut. It's like a very detailed imagination but not a hallucination.

A few days ago I had a very minor hallucination (very short flash of light behind me) and I've been paranoid ever since it happened. My sleep has been suffering, I keep waking up early in the morning and it's not usual for me.

I haven't had any more hallucinations since, and it's been 5 days. I don't hear voices or any strange sounds.

61,"Hi all :)

So basically, I’m going into my third year at uni. I was able to get a space in halls for the second semester of my first year, but it was absolutely shit, I made no friends (all of my flat mates were super antisocial or just did coke in the kitchen), was home every chance I could get and was horribly depressed and lonely the whole time I was there. 

This goes without saying that due to my good pals Anxiety and Depression, university has thus far been lonely and sad for me lol. However, my two friends, both of whom are younger than me, have just gone to uni, both of them are going into halls.... and not gonna lie, I feel a little bit of FOMO and just really pissed off and upset than uni has been so shit for me thus far. On a whim, I applied for a place in halls this year. And, well.... I got offered a room.

I really don’t know what to do. I’m scared out of my mind to move out and leave my comfort zone, but I don’t know if that’s more because I’m scared it’ll be the same as in first year? I really want to make my last year at uni good, and moving into halls at the start of the term instead of midway through like last time might mean I actually make *FRIENDS*, but if it all goes downhill again I’m stuck in a 51 week contract :/ 

I’m really torn on what to do. I’m so so scared and yet so so annoyed with myself if I don’t take the opportunity! I’m also sooo fucking lonely all the time lmao and I don’t know if living in halls will make that better or worse for me (since, I mean, I FEEL like it can’t get much worse but...)

all im focused on doing lately is getting high or drunk and escaping my thoughts, then ill nap. i spent this weekend drunk and taking depression naps, and i had homework to do. im trying to do it right now, but i keep getting distracted.

70,"It took me a while to sort my thoughts and start with this post. I think I am in some phase of fear or depressive illness. 

In the last few months I started getting problems with getting up at morning, getting ready and going to work - though nothing special ocurred at work. Some days were very hard so I didn't go to work (at first only one to three days a month).  

I have pain in my stomach that is getting really strong, also problems with my digestion and headache as well as back pain. It also feel like my chest is under high pressure and my heartbeat is fast. 

In the last two weeks these symptoms were so strong that I did not make it to work at any day. I just did not feel able too face it. 

Today is Sunday and I really resolved to go to work again tomorrow. I had a friend over here almost this whole day and I was fine. But since she is gone, I can't think of anything else than having to go to work tomorrow - right now I am just laying on the couch, without any idea what I can do right now (like watching a movie, playing pc, reading, playing the piano or whatever). While doing so I have the symptoms mentioned above (especially the feeling in my chest and stomach is very intense right now and causing fear of going to work tomorrow). 

But all this does not only restricts to my work life. My free time is also suffering. I feel very demotivated and can not figure out what to do. My hobbies fail to delight and relax me and even though I tried some new things like drawing, sports, meditation and programming, I lost my motivation very quickly. Also my favourite music causes nearly no emotion to me anymore. This is not the same everyday. There are days where I feel fine and days like today, where it is very hard for me. 

After a long research and overcoming myself, I went to a psychotherapist this week for a first conversation. It was totally different than what I thought it would be and after some days of thinking it through, I can not say that it helped me. To summarize it up, I felt like all she advised was that I have to snatch up, go to work again and start with sports again. I thought she would show me some exercises or things I could do to begin overcoming my problems (of course i did not expect for an solution that is immediate and complete). But I wished for anything she could tell me to try. She said I do not have a depression but some depressive behaviour patterns. What wondered me the most is that she said there would be no therapy necessary. I did not really understand why not and then she suggest we could try to have a few test therapy sessions. 

I think I will look for a second therapist, talk to her and ask him for his opinion and suggestions.

It would be very pleased to hear your opinion in this and maybe you even have a suggestion what I could try to find the strength to make it to work again tomorrow.

I have relapsed. I am in relapse. I am starving myself because I ATE TOO MUCH Last night. If I can go to the gym in the morning burn 450 calories and then go to work, and not eat from 16 hours before, why cant I do it now? Last night I went to a party, I had half a beer, then I came home and I feel like I ate 3 meals. And now I’m waiting to eat again, knowing that I am hurting myself. I hurt myself. I make myself struggle. I wont cut my wrists because I people would see the marks. But ill starve myself because I can internally cut deeper and deeper. 

As I sit in a Starbucks groups of friends surround me. Talking about things in their lives that they experienced either together or individually. They have connections, they aren’t isolated. They sit in a community. They sit around each other, they sit facing each other, in an open conversation. Today I build a barrier around my self, consisting of my water bottle, my hat, my coffee cup, my laptop in front of me, my head down and my headphones on. The observing becomes destructive. Why the fuck cant I talk and eat with people? Why the fuck cant I eat a sandwich. Why the fuck can I not have to make things harder for me. Why cant I do what their doing? They must be. College. Students. Why didn’t I go away to college and make. Friends?? It’s not like I stayed home and did anything worthwhile. But, why must I construct their lives in my head and then compare myself? Why do I think they’re life is better than mine? Are they more competent than me? Why must I compare my struggles? Why is it that I have to struggle? If I don’t struggle, is my life not worth anything? Will the math equation of my life, not compute? John plus struggle equals worth. Why is that the equation? I am not Kurt Cobain. I am am not a starving artist. As if that was the job description must be; “Artist: must starve for his work”. Must struggle for the art. Because the art is so important. The art is why you struggle. Art that didn’t come out of struggle isn’t worth anything. But what if at the struggle takes away from the art? You have to work harder for that art. More time, and work goes into it. This gives it Worth. Work gives you your worth. Time is worth more than anything. But what if the art doesn’t even get made? What if the artist starves himself because he thinks he must to make good work. If he wasn’t so afraid of needles, he’d be a junky. One cannot write the blues without feeling blue. One cannot shake someone to their core without having their own core crumbled. If their core is destroyed they know how far they can go without destroying the core of the reader, the listener, the watcher. That’s good Art. That Art holds tremendous Worth. That art is worth everything. 

I am so afraid of not being worth the art. 

From around me the headphones play moving music, isolate the outside noise. The small keyboard and screen block any and all visuals in front. With my back against the wall, tucked in a corner I have made myself the answer to my questions. The groups of friends ask each other what they are doing later and then leave together. They’ll never know what I been doing in my corner, never even probably care. But I Care. I obviously care. Image what I could do if I put that care into my “Art”. Imagine if I put that attention, care and focus into my art. Im sure I could make something worthwhile to someone. But I am too lightheaded to even think straight. 1 more hour before I can eat. You see, this is the struggle I’ve made for myself. A struggle that they will never know and see. That’s why I starve myself. They’ll never see it. They’ll never see the struggle that is supposed to make the art. It’s nonexistent to them, just like the art I could have been making with this struggle. But, “trust me”, I tell myself. This is the struggle. I must struggle. It’ll be worth it, I repeat. It’ll be worth it.

72,"Today was my best friends (Amanda) daughters 1st birthday. She had the 1st birthday party today as well. I planned to go and said I was up until 2.5 hours before the party started. 

With my depression and anxiety and also weening off suboxone, It is so hard for me to get out, especially to shower AND get out of the house. I haven’t seen her in over a year. I haven’t even met her daughter yet because at the time of her birth, we were not really talking. We don’t have the best friendship but we have so much history and have has moments where I swore we weren’t going to be friends better yet best friends, again. There’s been a lot of on/off times with us being friends but we always go back to each other. She knows I struggle leaving home but in the past hasn’t even considered how hard it is for me and she had agoraphobia in high school. You’d think she’d understand especially have such high anxiety as she does also. 

The party was going to have 35 people. It would be her family, her husbands family and her friends like her MOH and one of her bridesmaids that are her best friends as well. I don’t like the 2 friends and they don’t like me. They judge me based on my friendship with Amanda that has clearly been very rocky. I would’ve been her MOH had suboxone and depression not got to me. Not only did I introduce her to her husband but I introduced her to the MOH and 2 bridesmaids. She wouldn’t have had a bridal shower of bachelorette party if I didn’t mention it to the one bridesmaid because I wanted to make sure I was invited. The girls didn’t even think to have one for her. 

Moving on, I had the birthday gift ready (my moms also crocheting a blanket for her daughter too which she knows about), I had most of my outfit picked out but I had to shower. Showering is sadly one of the hardest things for me to do which does prevent me from going out a lot. 

I texted her saying I can’t do it and I was sorry because I thought I could. I told her I’d rather come later today if they aren’t busy with the daughters birthday, tomorrow, Tuesday, Wednesday, any day she has free I’d come by. I said I wanted to just have it be me and them (her husband and 2 kids). I wouldn’t have had time to talk to her because she’d be running around the whole time. Everyone also had their husband/boyfriend with them and the families had each other. I had no one. I don’t have a boyfriend right now. 

She hasn’t answered and I know that’s cause she was busy getting ready for today and then the party itself is still going on now. But because this has happened before in the past, I’m worried she’ll cut me off AGAIN. My mom told me not to let it bother me. If she really gets mad and does this shit again, then she dealt isn’t a friend or best friend at that. I wanted to prove myself so badly today. I wanted to prove to her and those bitch friends that I am strong enough to be there even if I was alone. I can’t help feeling like a bit of a failure. I just KNEW this would happen. I wanted to prove to myself I could do it too. 

I just hope she texts or calls me and is accepting/understanding of this 😔🤞🏼

I've been having really bad anxiety and I guess panic attacks(?), I've never had panic attacks so I'm not sure If they are considered panic attacks.

 Basically, my dad has been abusive since we moved to America. Ex military, PTSD, manipulative, verbally &amp; psychologically abusive/manipulative. Some examples of his evil doings are: Taking all the money out of my parent's shared bank account and putting it in his own account (because he's mad that my mom has a job and makes money, so she doesn't need to rely on him) | trying to control my mom's money | telling my mom she can't leave the house (fighting and yelling) | Calling my mom a derogatory terms for leaving the house and ""selling her vagina"" when actually she goes to work or shops for groceries | accusing me of selling my baby sister's body for sex when I took her to the public library when my parents got in a huge fight | Telling me to quit my job to focus on school, then getting angry that I don't have a job so he tells me to find a job. I get a job and he's mad because ""If I have a job how can you focus all of your time into school?"", so i quit and he's mad because I'm a ""retarded bum."" | The worst: constantly threatening to kick me out, calling me a retard, telling me that I will never accomplish anything, etc...

Anyways I'm in my psychiatric nursing class and I'm realizing the extent of the mental/psychological damage he has done to all of us. I realize that a lot of my awkwardness, dependence on people, lack of motivation, lack of independence, lack of confidence comes from me not meeting my developmental goals throughout childhood. If you're a psycology geek, I'm referring to Erikson's developmental goals.

The situation at home has only been escalating. I'm extremely stressed out, nursing school is extremely stressful and they make it that way so that you develop a coping strategy which is essential when caring for the lives of others.

SO my idea was to get a part-time job as a Nursing Care Partner, save up money, buy my own car, and move out. Put nursing school on hold for a year, become full-time, and when I have enough money saved I put myself through nursing school. I'm really scared to do this because I've never been able to make my own decisions growing up, I've always had to do what was directed to me by my dad. I'm so dependent and I'm intimidated to be independent. I realize that before becoming a nurse I need to grow as a person, and actually become an adult.

76,"I'm a 19 year old boy with a history of anxiety, depression, and body image issues. For a long time I've been struggling with symptoms likely related to my anxiety disorder. After a spell of anxiety I'll often find myself feeling like a different person.

In this state I feel scatter-brained, meek, spaced out, less mature, somewhat skittish. I struggle to express myself and my tongue and mouth feel clumsy; this gives me a sort of lisp when I talk. I experience an odd sense of pressure and a kind of tingling around my forehead, as well as a sensation of tightness in my face.

I also find it difficult to feel genuinely interested in myself and others, even those I'm very close to, and I'm not surprised, upset, or excited by the things that would normally elicit such reactions in me. Because of this, I'm unable to give natural reactions when I'm speaking to people and have to force them in order to seem myself. This extends to my facial expressions as well; every smile and frown is consciously controlled. The same is even true of my tone and laughter. It's exhausting to keep up, and I feel guilty that I can't be genuine for people when I'm in this state.

As well as this, I'm unable to enjoy the things I normally do, like reading, exercising, watching films, playing video games, drawing, etc. I'm less skilled at the things I'm normally good at, especially creatively, and my patience for almost any activity drops. My memory recall drops massively too, For example, last night a friend asked me to finish a story I'd started telling her; I could barely bring any details to my mind, and ended up trailing off into silence, staring into space.

All of these symptoms exhaust and distract me to the point that interacting with people is incredibly difficult. When I'm feeling this way all I want to do is get away from people, but when I'm alone the anxiety only worsens and I'm very vulnerable to falling back into depression.

The most frustrating thing is that I KNOW I'm capable of being socially capable and confident. I've come so far from the days I used to spend unable to leave the house. I rarely even have panic attacks anymore, just an elevated heart rate and slight trembling. I've had countless successes by now and overcome my anxiety many times. If I could just keep this going my life would be so much happier, but it never seems to last and when I lose that confidence it's a long battle to get it back.

Though I understand my anxiety is irrational and I try very hard to return to being ""myself"", I'm never easily able to. Even when I do, I'm unable to completely relax because I know it's only temporary that I'll return to that state again. I'm at a loss with what to do about this and any help this community could give me is really appreciated.

78,"Cowards are brave on social media. Which is why internet trolls exist. They do and say things that would never say in a face-to-face encounter. 

Thinking and higher processes tend to be absent here. If the masses (or sheeple) in the subreddit have a similar mindset and someone presents a different opinion or view, it quickly gets downvoted, no matter who valid the comment.

Imagine what the downvoting does to one's self esteem? At the same time, we see others who tend to become ""high"" when people upvote their comments. They engage in karma whoring. Posting anything and everything just to get these karma points which are a must should you wish to post in other subreddits. What a great place for narcissists Reddit is.

People with mental illness tend to need someone to talk to or vent. It's the most convenient method to do so in social media. You're anonymous (unless you use FB) so you can share anything. We need and look for support. We're aware of the large social platform Reddit. It has topics on almost anything.  Why not post your troubles or just vent? Well, one would be right in assuming this is the place to post your thoughts and feelings, hoping someone will understand. But it really isn't as long as the voting system remains. 

There's extensive censoring of posts and comments on Reddit, largely because of the voting system and because there's no generally accepted rules on harassment which includes but isn't limited to rudeness, shaming, bullying, threats. Subreddit moderators are not too concerned about the posts as long as it brings more traffic to their sub, provided of course they are in line with their ""thinking"". We really can't expect much if any understanding from others on social media. We don't know their agenda or motivation. Many are socially isolated and this is their only source of entertainment. They don't care if they're being malicious or putting someone down. It's all about them a and them fitting in so others will vote for their post or comment. 

Ask your doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist the next time you see them what their thoughts are on the subject. They will likely tell you that social media is toxic and will only make you feel worse, not better. There's very few empathetic and non judgmental people posting in social media these days. Sites like Reddit can either boost (artificially) your self esteem or bring it down (not artificially). The effects can be very detrimental and prevent you from becoming better.

If mankind will progress instead of becoming more primal in social media, Reddit will eventually be restructured. Until then, my advice to everyone who isn't thick skinned and amoral is to get leave this cesspool called Reddit. Your mental illness isn't likely going to improve, much, if any by posting or reading karma whoring comments and posts.

79,"My life’s not bad, no glooming depressing problems. No broken family, no drug dealer friends, no abuse in the house. Fuck, I’ve never even been in a fight. I do well in school, always top of my class even.I’m active, play football 4 times a week. I have friends, good friends whom I can talk to. I’d say I have a good life even, better than most.

But yet, last year I found myself, at age 15, thinking of ending it. I would sit in darkness crying about nothing in particular. Staring at my blank wall I would fantasise about dragging a knife down my arm. I would dream of shooting my freckly little face off or  of throwing my limp frame from a bridge. I would just sit and ponder about the massive, never ending universe and my tiny insignificant existence. I didn’t hate myself, I just thought of myself as unnecessary, thought of humans as unnecessary really. If life is temporary what’s the point in it at all? It has to end, so why not now? I thought I’d never make a big enough impact to justify another 70 years. 

But I decided I didn’t want to think like that anymore. I dragged myself out of that dark place of mind one word at a time. Every time I thought of killing myself I would write down exactly how I would do it. The detail on the page scared me. I would sit and read all about how I was going to lock myself in my room and burn the whole house down to avoid anyone finding my body. Every time I thought about dying I forced myself to think of a reason to live, even if it was a simple commitment to play football the next day with my friends. 

I’m in a much better place now, and have opened up to a girl who I have fallen in love with as well. I know this is probably not the worst I’ll ever feel but it’s the worst I’ve felt at this point in my life and I’m proud to have over come it. I know this is not a one size fits all solution and will not be right for most people but I wanted to share my experience because if one person can give this a go and it can help them a bit then it’s definitely worth my fifteen minutes of effort.",16Sep2018,6
80,My boyfriend has pretty severe suicidal tendencies and has been off his meds for about a week now. He says it’s because he can’t afford them even though they aren’t that expensive and I told him he could use our vacation fund to buy them. He is not willing to help himself at all it seems and I don’t know what to say to him when he feels like this. Every time I say something he says I’m being condescending when really I’m not trying to be. I love him and I want to help him but I am struggling with his inability to help himself.

81,"I want to quit my current therapist, because she's telling me that I need an Organic diet with no GMO's to be happy, and she is old and completely unaware that college students in today's economy can't afford organic food, but she refuses to understand. Every time I try to tell her I want to quit in person, my mom interrupts and keeps saying ""the benefits outweigh the doubts"", and she (my mom) believes that forcing a person into anxiety-inducing situations would cure their anxiety, and I get anxiety coming there because the therapist's office smells 10x worse to me than it does to my mom and my therapist. Also, she uses Biofeedback, but I prefer art therapy and she always uses ""well I I've only known you for a few months&gt;"" as an excuse, but I still want to quit

85,"So I'm a student, and occasionally partake in the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol, and while I don't condone it, it's just a pretty integral part of University life (at least in the UK). I've been experiencing some form of social anxiety for at least the last 2 years, and have spoken to a professional about it. I'm not prone to panic attacks, I just have certain triggers that make me unable to focus on anything, nauseous etc. 

Within the last year I've been experiencing elevated anxiety the day after going out drinking. When I first started University this didn't happen, but now it happens every time I drink. I'm aware alcohol is a depressant so I figure it's a physiological change that happens while hungover. I don't tend to go out too much, so it's manageable, just not pleasant. ",16Sep2018,3

89,"This isn't about the genre of the music, more about a specific set of intonations or a ""suggestive"" tone of voice that starts to blow up your psyche. It can be rap, disco, country, etc.. any kind of specific ""mind influence"" from another human that makes you fill dizzy, suppressed and lost. It is like waves that deforms your body image somehow. 

Let's take an example. Imagine a beautiful summer morning. You are walking in the familiar city streets and you see a crowd full of people and some musicians with good technique and perfect-tuned vocals. They are just playing some ballads, telling some stories etc. But, suddenly, you start empathising heavily and it feels like you've ate something bad. Consciousness is making very quick ZOOM into your sensations. You are starting to ignore the world around you. Maybe that introspection is even better, because you can't look at performers anyway. Eye contact is awful.

  "" But... what happened, why do I feel sick? ""

And it's quickly getting worse because you are experiencing another soul in a very passive, restricted mode - like being tied to a chair near a fireplace. You feel an increasing pressure in your skull. It is like you need to help that person somehow, but you can't. It is a strong sensation.

   "" This situation is 100% incomplete, what do I need to do? And how? Why they are wasting so much energy, what is the meaning of that intonation? I can't visualize their past experiences, what are the missing parts of the story... ""

 No, you can't fix that, Mr. Brain. Look around, it is just a harmless song and everyone is enjoying it! In the end you quickly run away and people are looking weird at you. Does it reminds you something from the past and how you are dealing with it?",16Sep2018,2
90,"I’ve been insecure about my weight my whole life. I recently discovered that I have gained another 10 pounds, breaking the 200 mark for the first time that I’m aware of. I have no idea why, since I’ve finally been able to decrease my sugar intake.
My double chin bothers me the most. I keep having these thoughts like I want to take the sharpest knife I can find and start sawing away at my double chin. I want to just throw away bloody chunks of flesh and fat into the trash can. The more I think about it, the more I sort of actually want to do it. I’d rather have a scar on my chin that have all this fat. But then again, I can’t go back to a mental health hospital. It would break me and make me so much worse.
