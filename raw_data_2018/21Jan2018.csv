0,"I have self diagnosed OCD (Could be something different but through my experiences, symptoms and research I can‚Äôt imagine it being anything else unfortunately) and I also have Anxiety. It‚Äôs very difficult for me to watch movies with severely mentally ill people or people going insane without getting anxiety that I will inevitably become like that. I can‚Äôt remember when it started happening, but it had to have been sometime in 2016. I remember the worst time was when I was watching the shining and that is already a very unsettling movie but I was so afraid that I would become like Jack Nicholson and want to murder my entire family like his character. I had very bad anxiety 3-4 hours after it finished and it would randomly pop into my mind for a week. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be serial killers, I watched Fight Club and I was afraid I was going to end up like Edward Norton, and I even got scared of it while watching Memento. What triggers me to write this is I‚Äôm watching right now a series on Netflix called MindHunters and it‚Äôs about these guys who interview serial killers in prison to try and understand criminal psychology, and every time I watch an episode I can feel the anxiety coming back. Especially when the serial killers are discussing traumatic experiences or anything that could have shaped them into that. The thing is I love those movies and I love this show. I don‚Äôt want to give up film because of this. Am I normal? Has anyone else dealt with this? How can I cope? Do I have to give up movies? I don‚Äôt want to deal with this anymore. I just want to feel normal again ",21Jan2018,1

8,"A few years ago I realized I (probably) have ""pure-O"" OCD - basically severely disturbing intrusive thoughts *that are not consistent with one's personal values* but without the compulsive behaviors typical of regular OCD - after I watched a *Monsters Inside Me* episode about a teen girl who was eventually diagnosed with this disease after being misdiagnosed as bipolar/schizophrenic. Specifically, this girl had what is known now as ""Harm OCD."" She had constant, vivid intrusive thoughts of hurting people she knew with sharp objects - scissors, pencils, cutlery, etc - and she thought she was a budding serial killer, so she started redirecting those thoughts to only harming herself despite not actually wanting to kill/harm herself. Then she started hiding all the sharp objects in her dorm so she couldn't use them and avoiding her friends/classmates because she kept ""seeing"" herself stabbing them.  Luckily she managed to find a good psychiatrist who asked her questions like ""if you had a thought about harming a child with a fork, what would you do?"" and her response was ""hide all the forks of course."" 

I have actually been struggling with this exact same problem since I was a pre-teen, but I never told anyone because I was afraid of being locked up for being a serial killer. I'm also mildly autistic so I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to explain properly that I actually don't want to harm/kill people, even people who have intentionally hurt me or people I care about. I have told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I have intrusive thoughts about harming myself (which I do) and I cope by telling myself ""its just a thought and I don't have to obey it"" and my psychiatrist ordered something called the Y-BOCS scale to officially diagnose OCD. But I haven't told anyone that I'm not journalling or doing homework (I'm supposed to as part of therapy for PTSD, I keep telling my psychologist that I forgot to bring my journal/homework) because I'm afraid I'll end up writing a kill list, that I am putting off learning to drive because I have intrusive thoughts about driving to my convicted child molester and child rapist cousin's house (I was actually his first victim and have PTSD from the assault), tying him up, then running him over repeatedly, or that I'm afraid of starting my own business because it *could* be more lucrative than a typical 9-5 job and I'm afraid I will someday have enough money in the bank to hire a hitman. 

It also doesn't help that the people I have intrusive thoughts about murdering are all horrible psychopaths/narcissists who take great delight in hurting other people. For example, my great-aunt is a retired special needs elementary school teacher who taught for over 40 years at various large public schools. She calls her former students 'retards' and boasts about physical abusing them. If you do the math (40 years x 10 students a year, which is probably low given how overcrowded her schools were) she has a minimum of 400 victims. 

**TL;DR; I really want to make it clear that I think harming and killing people is *wrong* and I do not want to ever kill someone no matter how morally bankrupt that person is, but the intrusive thoughts are so constant and so vivid that I can't focus on anything and my ""hide all the forks"" strategies - not driving, not socializing, not starting my own business which would actually make me happy and give my life meaning - are destroying my life.  I need to tell my psychiatrist whats going on but I'm afraid she wont understand and will lock me up forever.**",21Jan2018,2
9,"So I've been pretty severely depressed for the last two+ years, if I count back the months last year then I realise every single one was a bit of a crisis point. Same for the year before.

Stopped taking meds in September (60mg Fluox, I know, stupid) but I found I didn't get worse. I didn't get better either, I felt the same.

Anyway, aside from a small hiccup I've been pretty excellent the last two months. Responding properly to situations, e.g. happy when things go well and sad when bad shit happens. You know, normal shit as opposed to just depressed every time I wasn't distracted by something.

But I've been kind of down the last three weeks and I can't tell if I'm getting bad again. I have thoughts of self harm but tbh those didn't vanish for two long anyway. I'm just feeling sad in my core and it aches and it hurts, but it's not as bad as I have been before. But I know I'm comparing it to the middle of a depressive episode whereas if I'm getting bad again this would be the start.

I don't know if I'm overthinking. But if I ignore am I just in denial? Is THAT overthinking?

Idk I'm just sad and it aches in my core. 

At least I still have emotions I guess haha.

**TL:DR how do you tell if you're getting bad again? What are your warning signs for a depressive episode starting? Should I monitor things? **

11,"Here I go again, off to check the bottom of my car just in case I hit somebody. Then every outlet, the washer, dryer, stove, faucets, locks, toilets, radiators, windows, under the bed, and maybe I can lie down. Until a horrible feeling makes me get out of bed and do it all again. And again. I'm afraid I've contracted a horrible disease, but sometimes I hope I did. My anxiety makes me believe my phone has been recording everything. I hate to say it but some of the only times I really feel at peace lately is when I can get a hold of some Xanax. I don't deserve anything I've gotten and I can't shake the feeling that I'm just so worthless. I've tried multiple therapists, no luck... I don't know what to do. When I have to hand in assignments I check them dozens of times for profanities, when I leave somewhere I have to check under the seat to make sure secret information wasn't dropped. I'm just so scared all the time. I wish I could have a fucking redo. There's so much more to it all, too much for me to type. There's a whole world out there and I'm in my room feeling so terrible.

i started living by myself at college and i really fell apart. my (ex-)friends told me i'm bipolar and that i need to get help. i was in full denial there was anything wrong but they threatened to tell my family and hospitalize me. i agreed and i made an appointment with a psych.   

i was supposed to see him once a week but i showed up unscheduled everyday to talk. at the end of our second or third meeting he asked what i was going to do when i got back (college dorm) and i answered honestly and said im in a good mood but i'll probably feel bad once im alone in my room. he gave me a look and i instantly knew he hated me and thought i'm attention seeking and pathetic. i started thinking about killing myself once i got back because there's nothing wrong with me and everyone dislikes me. he changed the subject and said something else but i didn't pay attention or respond. he asked if im ok and i quietly said yeah. i apologized for wasting his time and he told me i have no reason to apologize. i said sorry again and walked back to my room thinking about how he hates me and i need to kill myself.  

 i'd go early in the morning and to wait at his office until it opened. i wanted to catch any glimpses of him and be able to talk to him more. he made me feel comfortable and safe and i loved telling him about my issues. i started having sexual fantasies of us together when i was alone. i really liked him. i'd call their suicide/emergency number every night talking about how i wanted to die, etc.  

after a week he diagnosed me with borderline personality and he told me all the symptoms and i knew it was accurate. i was also given some meds to help me sleep but i got in an argument with a friend through text and i decided to overdose because they dont care about me. i told my friend its his fault and i hope he's happy with himself.   

the hospital didn't want to deal with me and discharged me the morning after my ""accidental"" overdose. my school counselor  told me bpd doesn't exist and that i just have minor depression.

i dont have any friends anymore, they told me im unstable and they can't deal with it. i told them i hate them and theyre cruel and i hope they kill themselves and then i begged them to come back and that i'm sorry and i need them. i've been isolating now, i'm scared of people because i don't want to be a burden. i hate myself and my bpd. i got kicked out of my college and moved. i've never been able to function.

i'm seeing a new psych now. i know she hates me and doesn't want to help. i'm so scared. i feel like i have to force people to do what i want or take me seriously. i want to feel like my issues and my suffering are valid. i thought about slicing up all my limbs and overdosing on tylenol to make her help me. i just burn myself usually. the first thing she said to me during our first appointment is that my bpd is probably mis-diagnosed. i hadn't even said anything.   

i'm really trying not to overthink it. will she ever believe me? there's no way to prove i'm not lying, anyone could assume my issues don't actually exist. it's impossible to prove so i feel like my only option is to kill myself. i'm telling the truth but people never believe me. i can't trust anyone to understand or care. none of them care about me. how can i even get help? i only see her twice a week, i can't tell what she's thinking of me behind my back. does she think im pathetic? will she help me? im so scared. i just want to get better. im really scared.  

i can't trust my feelings. how do i manage this? i'm terrified of her rejecting me. its really scary. i've been alone for over a month

22,"I've been like this for more than an year now and half an year of a prelude to this condition.
I am 28 male, work as a legal adviser, however found a passion in programming, coding and decided to move to this totally new sphere and strive to become a developer or of that sort. However I am a shadow of myself without my daily Xanax fix. The constant thought of my grandmother's inivetiable death is always there, stuck with me, draining me out. It is not even a ""thought""it is a background, the wallpaper of the room that is my mind. And it goes further like this - well, after her it will be your mother's turn (I don't care for my dad, so he is not included here). But meanwhile, Boris, you won't be able to enjoy life's pleasures and to achieve successes due your fears. You will be middle-aged Mr. Nobody, a never grown up Piter Pan man. But is it really so bad since now everything feels like old, life cycle - even vacations, Boris, even going to the beach, even going to concerts is now ruined for you... life is pointless... So for the weekend my main activity was lieing in bed and staring at the laptop, try to numb myself with youtube videos. Pleasures or even big repairs at home seem pointless since life is so rough and short, being happy makes me almost feel guilty... I obviously need help. I am still pretty sane and fully comprehend this is not about being phylosophical at nature, I am a person who needs help.

I have finally come across a good psychiatrist that is regulating my xanax in combination with antidepressants. She doesn't want me to stay hoocked to xanax for a long time tho, me neither, I dream of full ""recovery"". I ran out of pill this Wednesday, I am seeing her on Tuesday, however the substitute I am currently taking, which is not benzo-based and quite soft (Fluanxol) only keeps me from totally freaking out, however I am still crippled. I know the true answer to my suffering is therapy, I have tried several therapists for the last two years and they all sucked. I live in Bulgaria and probably the only good therapists are to be found in the capital city Sofia hence I plan seeking somebody there and travelling to visit them. Thing is I am sisturbed by the thought that I won''t find a suitable therapist for my case at all...

P.S. And I am anxious as a person although on the outside I am cheerful, joke-throwing dude, that different types of girls may fall for my ass, we all know the outside doesn't matter... When I was six I witnessed domestic violence from my father to my whole family. I was totally shocked, my grandmother was laying in a pile of blood. Unfortunately my parents got back together I few months later ""for the sake of the child"" which we all know is always a horrific decision and for those four years the atmospehre was not very good and at the end there was some more physical violence and finallymy dad was out of my life foor good. So basically it all starts with his, I am pretty sure. for example I sometimes remember the last chlamydia or STD tests I have undergone and my mind would put doubt in me if they were enough to be sure I am fine and healthy... I have been suffering generally with intruisive thoughts for more than half of my life, like the usual sexual-violent thoughts towards family members, or children, or in church, you name it... Or that time a few years ago I met my father at the street and we had a verbal fight and just before we separated our paths I hit him in the jaw - he was all fin and yelled at me... but when I went home I was thinking... what if now he is dead because I hit him? You get the idea, I guess...",21Jan2018,2

Not asking for diagnosis, just has anyone experienced anything like this, can anyone help me know how one identifies personalities, if there is a way to feel ok about the lack of memories and childhood nostalgia?((cross posting from DID)

For as long as i can remember ive had issues with remembering, i can remember being maybe 8/9 and trying to amswer my mum thinking i had responded and her getting mad and asking why im not responding but i was... or was i? Ive been told by therapists i have problems with dissociation and sometimes depersonalisation and derealisation (though latter has only happened during great stress) ive read up about it and it feels so familiar. I was diagnosed eupd (bpd) following a possible postnatal psychosis break, following my 18th, ive been in many of the therapies they can offer, i've self helped myself out of agoraphobia and am currently being diagnosed with generalised anxiety (though psychiatrist says theyve always told me despite it was only mentioned as features last meeting over six months ago) 

I go through periods of having to buy things like i get obsessed with one thing for a few months, like two year ago i got 7 fish tanks in four months, i dont know why but i needed more even though i physically couldnt look after that many tanks, part of me kept doing it while finishing my college course convinced i would pass because why wouldnt i? 

But following this the past year i had migraine issues for weeks and weeks, ive been unstable in my identity and my memories are all over the place, i don't remember how arguments start or what happens. Ive not fully dissociatied in years but im scared i'll 'wake up' somewhere or something. Ive been struggling with depression for past year particularly and just as the migraines go i get suicidal and im having regular panic attacks again. Ive taken up self harm in the form of hitting my head against walls, ive not done that since just before post  natal psychosis.

Im scare im at a breaking point.

Ive asked to see my therapist for a re-evaluation of my diagnosis to check if medication is appropriate and incase i also have avoidant personality or if my dissociation is definitely just part of the eupd diagnosis (not that i fit the criteria beyond self hatred and self mutilation and impulsive self harming and dissociation and anxiety induced hallucinations (ive since realised it may be more hypnagogic hallucinations as it only happens when im tired)) He refused and that was when he proclaimed ive always had generalised anxiety ,  

All in all im confused, scared, anxious, im under the crisis team following my suicide ideation again but not that worried  because i didnt actually attempt and dont want to put as in patient because people with eupd dont do well as inpatient (or more to point leaving inpatient) I want to kill myself but im terrified of choosing to die and not dying im scared of failing on last time i want it to be right, at the same time i hate myself and want to scar and destroy this vessel im in. 

Ive been looking into did because of how strong my dissociative amnesia can be, and im looking into how you realise or acknowledge hosts/personalities/protectors and things? I know i cant access most of my childhood, and i have very few sensory memories most of mine are flat almost police statement like in recall, cold and feelingless, or pure emotional memories, and  not anything in between . In between the lifeless factual memories and the emotional pain (i struggle most to remember good memories) there is nothing, a whispering fog, that suggests there is or was something but i cant see or hear it. i feel like im drowning in the blackness and non existence of my memories sometimes.

27,"Hello and thank you for reading this in advance and sharing your opinion also I apologize as I‚Äôm not very articulate. Also I realize after writing this that it kind of sounds like I‚Äôm asking for a diagnosis but I promise I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm more just venting and asking for peoples opinions who may have gone through similar situations.

First a little background on me, I am a 27 year old male, I‚Äôve never had any trouble with my mental health up to this point, even after going through some very traumatic family scenes, and have dealt with my stress very well in my opinion. I am a sufferer of Crohn‚Äôs disease, have been diagnosed with it since I was in the 3rd grade but even that has never bothered me mentally. I was working out consistently, making good progress in strength and my physique and was feeling pretty confident in myself, I was studying for my new job willingly, I actually enjoyed studying it every day. But all of a sudden things fell apart on me.

It seemed to just hit me out of absolutely nowhere 2 weeks ago and has been going on ever since, the night it started I was going to bed and my nose was clogged and my ear felt like there was fluid buildup and I couldn‚Äôt breathe very well and for some reason I got extremely agitated and worked myself into a panic because I couldn‚Äôt go to sleep as a result of it. This happened once before too a few months ago, but at that time I was very sick with a terrible sinus infection but once my nose cleared then I was able to go to sleep perfectly fine. But this time the mental effect has seemed to stick around because I think I've associated nose congestion and fluid in ear feeling with not being able to sleep. Even though this time I was not really sick (maybe just a small cold), and can actually breathe good again now, I still cannot for the life of me fall asleep and worry to death all day about not being able to sleep and I feel like my diaphragm area is very tight and not taking in as much air as it should even though the doctor said my O2 saturation was good and my breathing rate was also good. So I‚Äôm pretty sure that my sleep is the main problem because ever since that happened 2 weeks ago it has been like a domino effect on my mental state. I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù as far as I know but I'm not sure because I don't THINK I've ever been truly depressed, I've been very, very upset and angry but nothing like this, my emotions are practically gone, I can‚Äôt laugh, I don‚Äôt feel sad or hopeless although the hope is going away after these 2 weeks, I just feel nothing, nothing other than the fact that I can't sleep irritates me, and I know I‚Äôm very bothered by it because I catch myself pacing through my house often, though this has calmed down a little the past few days. My sex drive just randomly disappeared along with this (was very healthy sexually before this, literally the day before) and my cravings for food also vanished, I was also eating perfectly normal before this too. No food I see or smell wets my appetite or makes me hungry, so I bought a weight gainer powder just to keep my calories up and I don‚Äôt starve.

My ability to yawn is gone too which is really strange, I can feel them coming on but my body will not let them come out or fully complete. Which also bothers me because I‚Äôve associated sleep with yawning. And I‚Äôm sure this is because I notice it happening and my mind stops it. 

But one of the strangest things in my opinion is I have had 3 or 4 moments which lasted a few hours over the past 2 weeks where it seemed like the entire problem went away randomly and was suddenly able to crave food and eat normally, laugh, relax, focus on tv shows and feel healthy sexually again, and even felt the need to take a natural nap, but once the day winded down and I started worrying about sleep again the ‚Äúemptiness‚Äù comes back and erases the entire good feeling.

It's to the point where I lay in my bed and either I keep repeating a thought (song lyrics or some kind of sound bit from a tv show) over and over again in my head or I would feel like I wasn‚Äôt actually in my bed and I was detached from my body or I wasn‚Äôt me, almost as if I was dreaming without actually being asleep. There was also a moment where my mind wouldn‚Äôt actually think of anything at all and it seemed like I was just staring at a black wall of no thoughts, this I kind of think was a result of the sleep deprivation. And when I finally fall asleep I will only sleep maybe 30 minutes to an hour, then I‚Äôm back up again pacing back and forth worrying about sleep. The best way I can explain the way it feels when I‚Äôm able to sleep is my subconscious will play a bunch of random images or thoughts and I can ‚Äúfeel‚Äù them right in front of my eyes, but now the thoughts are very few and feel like they‚Äôre coming from the top of my head (I realize this makes me sound worse lol), and my ears seem to be very active like I'm actually focusing on everything I hear while I'm trying to sleep. I normally have very vivid lucid dreams which I absolutely love to have, even nightmares, and wake up feeling so relaxed and refreshed the next day, but now they have also stopped. It feels like the more I actually think about the problem and trying to fix it is what makes it so much worse.

My physical ability hasn‚Äôt been affected really by this, I can actually play video games and puzzle/word games better than I have ever been able to since this happened (extreme focus?) and I can still drive my car at essentially the same level as I could before granted I'm not running 36+ hours straight of being awake. I‚Äôm still able to talk to people easily, actually a little bit more open since this happened though not as happy and jokey as I usually am.

I do notice that my touch sensitivity has decreased, I can still feel things but nothing is really ‚Äúsharp‚Äù feeling, I had my friend slap my back open handed just to test and I noticed that it didn‚Äôt ‚Äústing‚Äù I just felt pressure of the slap and nothing else. But I'm hoping this is just another symptom of sleep deprivation.

I feel like I also need to mention that I was on corticosteroids for months before this for my crohn‚Äôs and feel it could potentially be an adrenal gland issue? (Unlikely, but just throwing that out there)

I went to the doctor for this and was prescribed ambien which has been helping me get progressively more sleep each night I take it except for last night it didn't do anything at all. because I felt like I was able to eat and chose to do that which I think ruined it since it was supposed to be taken on an empty stomach, but even when it does work I don‚Äôt really like it because it doesn‚Äôt feel like a natural sleep and I‚Äôm also afraid of developing a habit.

Has anyone ever been through something like this? Am I just  doing this to myself, worrying myself to death for absolutely no reason? If so, how do you go about this? Does it seem like something that would go away with some meditation or do you think I should pursue some more medical attention?

PS. I would just like to say as someone who has never really had any instances like this, I could never quite understand how people who were going through these things truly felt. Now I know and have so much more empathy and sympathy for people so that's a positive thing that has come from it. And also it has made me personally realize that I would much rather feel emotional pain than be numb because I feel as if my soul is just ripped out of me, and I hate it so much.

29,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this as most of the posts here seem more urgent than mine. I just feel stuck at the moment. 

I started getting treated for anxiety in November of 2016. That was my first year of college and I was in a very dark place. After starting on meds, I was doing well until my long time boyfriend and I broke up. My grades tanked. I became suicidal. Lots of changes started happening as I moved in with a friend, started working at 3 in the morning, taking 19 hours worth of classes, and taking care of my niece at night. Again, my grades tanked and I was struggling. I even upped my medication at this point. 

Fast forward to now, I'm in what should be a pretty good spot. I'm in an amazing relationship with a guy that loves me and understands my struggle with anxiety and depression. I have a new job where I am working full time that I love. I am participating in a community activity that is forcing me to make friends and be active. My problem is that my grades in school are still terrible.

I do genuinely have a passion for the field I am studying to be a part of, don't get me wrong. The professors, for the most part, are willing to work with me. I really don't quite know what's wrong. I don't feel motivated to do anything related to college. It's like once my grades dropped, they never came back up.  I don't know if any of you have experienced this before, but I am not sure what to do or how to take my next step.",21Jan2018,2

31,"Long story short: I have trouble believing in my opinions.

Last month I watched The Last Jedi. LOVED it. Came home, watched the videos about it on YouTube - people hate it, apparently! Now I feel like I should hate it too. I can't love it anymore. I feel sad and conflicted - one side of me says ""you love it!"" but the other side says ""but they hate it!""

Last week I finished an anime (Death Note). There's this character who became my favorite (Near). I love this character, but turns out that most people hate him. Now I can no longer be a Near fan.

In my brain, I know what I love: I love The Last Jedi, I love Near. But, whenever I think of them, my mind also brings in all the hate I saw on the internet.

I know ""you shouldn't let others' opinions affect you"" and at the end they are just opinions, but I think this is a serious problem. Why can't I believe in my opinions? I can no longer look at The Last Jedi and Near and feel the same amount of love/happiness I used to feel before reading the popular opinion on the internet. I just have to *force* myself to love what I truly love, not what the popular opinion is - but it seems like I'm too much a slave to the popular opinion.

32,"I'm here, because I thought my increased body temperature (37.3C) meant I was getting sick with something nasty. Normally, that temperature wouldn't bother me, but I'd started waking up earlier and more tired than usual, my mom also had the temperature, but none of the symptoms. I was also experiencing my evening symptoms a lot closer to the mornings suddenly. (my unmedicated symptoms are literally hell on earth now, all my fault)

That said, I've already told the nurse, and she said she'll look at what meds are allowed to me (none that would help), but I do have my meds on me right now. I was taking 4mg sertindole morning (12:00), 2.5mg lorazepam (18:00), 25mg quetiapine (22:00). None of my psychiatrists are returning calls today. It's 19:32 typing this, where I live (Latvia).

My current symptoms are due to me messing up a sertindole taper, by going down too fast and drinking caffeine.

That said, I have 4mg sertindole pills (I'm allowed to taper up to 12mg, but I'm not sure that will have an immediate effect, and I need to fall asleep or I'll go insane), 25mg quetiapine pills, and 2.5mg lorazepam (which I'm very scared to take).

I've been semi-meditating and taking deep breaths all day today, ever since my symptoms started. This has seemingly only made me feel worse, as there were times my legs literally felt like tree trunks and feet were coldish.

Later, I noticed my fingers respond strongly to cold or water. And that has been making me very panicky.

I also woke up about 10 times (not an exxagerated number) and only slept about 7h from my normal 12h. I've been sleeping less than usual for about 4 days.

**INFO:** Male, 22, caucasian, 100kg, 180cm, you can basically read everything about my condition online as I post a lot, but my symptoms change a lot, too.

**UPDATE, the nurse brought me 0.5mg alprazolam (xanax). I took it, but it's not going to do much.

++ I had high blood pressure, when I arrived to the hospital. Ever since I've been here, my body temperature has been normal (I don't know, because the nurses use an infrared/head scanner thing, and it says 36.5C)

++ Nurse said the doctor isn't going to come to the infection ward today, as the place they take in patients is packed.",21Jan2018,1

I hope SO will be understanding of that, and I hope he forgives me.  But recently my depression has come back and has hit me like a stack of bricks, I feel numb to everything and everything I do is just boring. That mixed with anxiety-the need of having to do something entertaining and now is really getting to me.  I'm more depressed at the fact that I can't get a job, I've applied for way over 30 jobs now and have heard nothing, it's soul crushing for me but I don't blame the employers, I have no car, no experience and a shitty resume. I've actually considered stripping or being a cam girl or something like that as a job to earn some form of income, which is something I never ever wanted to do. All of my friends are succsessful and having the time of their lives (and I'm truely happy for them,  I really am).  I even have a friend that's a model, I'm stoked but obviously envious because she is absolutely stunning! Altgough she always always complains to me about being broke and having no money and I almost always want to grab her and scream at her. I only make $290 a fortnight (2 weeks). My boyfriend is jobless and isn't making too much of an effort but he currently has no car as well so I don't blame him.  Honestly I've thought of death a lot but I don't even want to die anymore, I feel like the void and all of my years worth of bad luck coming down on me. I have a justno dad and mother in law that gives the shittiest fucking advice. Also the pshycologist/phychiastrist wont be back from holidays until a few weeks.  I know my depression will pass evenrually but right now I'm going through a tough time, i feel as if I'm getting no help what so ever, while every other 18-19 y/o I know is having a great time.

It's not just school starting again. My emotionally manipulative mother is also sick and I don't have enough of my own income and have to rely on her for support.
Every little thing that happens makes me extremely upset and depressed and a keep lashing out at my one friend by mistake.
I tried going to therapy through the university counseling center, but I never liked any of the therapist I tired and they ended up making me feel worse or got to the point where they weren't helpful so I quit going.

39,"Okay, this is a weird situation. A weird life. I feel like I'm peeling away, like nothing connects me to anything. Basically, what you should know is that I need help to become a real person. My mental illness has taken away everything that makes a human life enjoyable, but I don't know how to find a therapist or even get started on this journey. I've been diagnosed with some odd things here and there as a kid, anxiety or aspergers or whatever, but as an adult I don't know how to take charge of my mental health. Maybe someone will relate to my symptoms and be able to give some advice. 

I live on my own and have no friends. I've never been in a real relationship. It's been this way since I was a kid. I don't relate to people. They don't relate to me. I'm soft spoken and have a way of making people feel alienated, even when I'm being kind to them. Social media sends me into a panic. Human companionship is out.

I can't eat. When I was younger I used to throw up a lot, every day, and my stomach is still messed up so I'm always afraid I'll get sick. I have a short list of ""safe"" packaged foods, like bagel bites. I'm 25 eating bagel bites. I can't drink nonbottled water either. I know it's stupid, and logically makes no sense. My brain disagrees. Eating is out. 

I'm sexually broken as well. Too ashamed to even look at myself most of the time. Not even my face. I don't want to explore myself because it feels wrong and horrible. Most of this might be from being raised Catholic as a gay person, but it's ruining my life. Sex and pleasure is out. 

I can't sleep. I usually go to bed when I'm tired at 4 or 5am, then wake up several times before 10am. Not such an unusual problem, but just another way my brain robs me of happiness. Sleep is out.

How can I be called a human being when I am deficient in everything that makes a human life worth living? I'm a shadow. I'm an alien. I'm at the end of my rope. Lately I've been having more aggressively paranoid thoughts, like that my boss is recording me while I work or my neighbors are breaking into my house while I'm not around. None of my old hobbies are fun. I talk to friends I made up. It's a total mess. How do I find a therapist for all this? How do I trust a therapist? How do I rescue myself? Does anyone else have problems like these? Thanks to anyone who read this far, just writing all this out helps make me feel a bit better.",21Jan2018,0

41,"Hello all! I am a 21-year-old male (in the U.S.) and I just made my first appointment with a psychiatrist. I am a full-time student at a college in the bay area in California and I moved out here from the east coast in September. I‚Äôm not sure if I made the right choice in choosing a psychiatrist over a psychologist but I‚Äôm going to give it my best shot and see how it works out. I‚Äôm also not sure how I‚Äôm writing this because I usually hate writing but maybe the possibility of getting help gives me the motivation that I need. So, I know that I need to get help because I felt something was wrong enough to make an appointment and I also spent the last few days in bed not responding to texts from friends and not showering when I used to be on top of those things when I first moved out here. I also was outgoing and talked to people and made a few friends when I first moved out here. I feel like I have been steadily declining over the last couple months. I know that no one here can provide a diagnosis, but it would be nice to maybe get a suggestion on what I might have in case it‚Äôs blaringly obvious to everyone but me. I also think this is a good chance to get my thoughts out so that when I go into my appointment I already know what I‚Äôm going to say before I walk in so that my mind can‚Äôt convince me that I have no problems and minimize everything I‚Äôm going through. I‚Äôve had appointments with a therapist and a psychologist years ago, but I never told them the full truth because I was embarrassed, and my brain told me that everyone else goes through the same thing that I am going through. I know now this isn‚Äôt true because normal people don‚Äôt all of a sudden not give a shit about all their friends and just lay in bed with their door locked for three days straight while only eating candy. When I first moved to California I was excited to be going to college classes because I had taken three gap years and I felt like I had finally learned the value of hard work (my last year in high school was a disaster). I was getting up two hours before school excited to go to class every day. I immediately started striking up friendly conversations with random people in the school cafeteria every day and now I have at least 6-7 friends who I could text and probably hang out with today. About halfway into last school quarter I started having extreme writers block and couldn‚Äôt get hardly anything down on my second paper for English (this may have had to do with getting distracted super easily and not being able to focus). I looked through the documents on my computer and saw that I had written a rant that day (which allowed me to write with no constraints) about how I hate school so much and how writing is so hard and about how reaching the wordcount is complete bullshit. I also started doing the homework for my favorite class, humanities, in a panic like thirty minutes before the class started as opposed to days before like I did the first couple weeks. It even got so bad that I gave up a few days and just turned the assignment in late. I barely passed my English class because I didn‚Äôt write the last paper until I was panicking after I took the final (most teachers don‚Äôt accept work after the final, but I wrote it in like 10 minutes after I took the final and my teacher was kind enough to accept it). Anyways those were the struggles of last quarter. This quarter I am taking philosophy which I should be in love with because I‚Äôve loved it in every other context, but I‚Äôve already missed two of the class periods in two weeks because I woke up and decided I didn‚Äôt care (I managed to get to my next class one of those days which starts an hour later). Last weekend I didn‚Äôt do any homework until I read one chapter of the three that I was supposed to read Sunday night in a panic. This weekend I stayed in bed in until at least 3pm everyday and then when I got up I didn‚Äôt feel like taking a shower and instead just stayed in my pajamas all day (and wrote a post on suicide watch one of the days). Today I managed to force myself to take a shower and put on regular clothes. I think that the fact that I lost my motivation for something that I should be excited about and then my failure to maintain basic hygiene and my failure to contact back my friends indicates some sort of problem. My original theory is that I may have adhd or some form of anxiety which causes me to not be able to focus which in turn causes my grades to decline and then I begin to get embarrassed to be alive and to show my face to anyone and hence avoid everyone (not sure if this is it or if something else is at play here). Another important thing to mention is that I have an extreme masturbation addiction. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a porn addiction because if I don‚Äôt have porn I just jerk off without it. I‚Äôm not sure what this does for me, but it may have to do with allowing me to relax. I do it before I go to sleep every night and usually do it in the morning. On average I do it like 3-6 times a day. I‚Äôve tried to stop multiple times but after a couple days of abstaining I get bored doing something else and I decide I don‚Äôt case about my abstention anymore. I think I have a problem, but I‚Äôm terrified of going to the doctor because I think it‚Äôs going to be awkward conversation (like all my previous experiences, anxiety?) and I think my biases won‚Äôt allow me to tell the truth and get an honest diagnosis. What I mean by this is that when I look in the mirror I see a normal health person and so my brain then begins to tell me I don‚Äôt need a doctor. Also, if I go in believing that I have adhd then I will tell the doctor all the times in my life where I felt I couldn‚Äôt focus but that may not be what I have I could just be exaggerating experiences to convince myself that‚Äôs what I have. I was diagnosed with depression last time I saw a doctor but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs it because it was a shitty doctor and I don‚Äôt think I was telling the truth at the time. I also think that it may not be depression because it comes and goes in seasons and seems to be only when I‚Äôve fucked up somewhere (like if I am stressed about an assignment, grade or seeing people). I also think its important to mention that I am an extreme adrenaline junkie. I‚Äôve sat down on the edge of cliffs and ridden a motorcycle over 100mph (before I sold it to move, I would ride it as fast as it would go every time I rode). My theory on this is that maybe since I used to be suicidal it‚Äôs a way for me to convince myself that I won‚Äôt actually kill myself or it may be a way for me to find the extreme focus that comes with an adrenaline rush. Hopefully someone has some insight into this and can let me know what they think. Oh and forgot to mention that I quit my last job as a barista before my move because I was having panic attacks twice a day. Panic attacks meaning that I couldn't breathe in more than halfway or else I would get a sharp pain in my chest (these lasted for like 15minutes to 30 minutes each).

43,"I am in therapy after having a nervous breakdown in June of last year. I've learned that the underlying issues are rooted in a toxic, codependent relationship with my mom and consequent passive identity throughout my life (major revelation).

I want to try antidepressants to stabilize myself and function in every day life (I had to quit my job before), but I'm worried that they will interfere with the helpful process of therapy?

44,"I've had psychosis for 2 and a half years and I've never been consistently under the care of a team or a psychiatrist. If something happens I have to see the GP or go to the emergency room.

So tomorrow I'm seeing the GP. I know that some symptoms are showing and I'm in denial about my depression. The obstacles for getting help is the fact I'm studying an intensive masters course and I have a part-time job. Both rely on me to stay sane.

But my brain is breaking apart. I will not use the kitchen/bathroom when my landlord is home because being in those rooms makes me feel exposed and vulnerable even though he's never done anything to me.

I heard people on the street say they were going to get me/come for me but these hallucinations have stopped for a week now.

Sometimes the fear of returning home is so strong that I go for LONG walks in the rain, cold, whatever just to avoid it for a few hours. And once I'm walking I feel closest to a breakdown because I think that I could keep walking further and further and strain my body until I collapse. It feels like I want self destruction in some way. I've been managing to fight the urge to self-harm.

I've been struggling to focus on my coursework and I have a lot of deadlines. I've been feeling shit in general about myself and I'll feel like such a failure if my mental health starts to effect my coursework. But if I don't get help I'm afraid it will just get worse.

I'm stuck trying to hold everything together, work, study, pay my rent but I can't last forever. I feel like I'm reaching a boiling point where my psychosis or whatever it is will start to show on the surface. The reason I'm scared about hospital is that last week a previous doctor told me I could be sectioned if I don't go back on meds but the medication side-effects is too much to deal with and they make me brain-dead and unable to do my coursework.

I'm sick of schizophrenia coming in uninvited because I just want to go back to things being normal without having a big episode every few months. I tried so hard to do this masters course and now if I end up in hospital I'll probably fail two units for this term.

Edit: I listen to the same song again and again. Something, someone speaks through the music and it's what I have to hear at this time. I'm miserable and I sometimes want to end it but that communication keeps me going. Even if it's not real imagine feeling like music was comforting you and you specifically. Maybe it is.

Besides I feel like I'm always on the border of insanity and I don't know if I am or not and maybe it's easier to be insane than sane. I really hate being in limbo tho. I actually went through a time in my life when I abused shrooms and other drugs and I lied to myself and said that it was just because I enjoyed it but in reality I know that I enjoyed losing grip of reality. The worst I think I've gotten was I was violently slicing my legs and laughing hysterically for a while then I suddenly realized what I was doing because at the time I was completely unaware. It was pretty troubling for the next few days but I got better. That's why I haven't seen a doctor is I always end up being fine not long after my little breaks and then there's the part of me that wants to be crazy. Maybe that part of me is causing me to act crazy but that's all it is is an act for myself to fulfil my desire.

The second half of the trip was strange and I tried to make it not awkward even though I should of probably. We got back, and I decided to stop talking to her completely and move on, but by doing this I also asked her to create a new group chat without me and I lost contact with about another 7 people who I considered friends and just stopped talking to all of them with no justification, just because I wanted to move on and forget about this girl. 

The thing that haunts me now, after 6 months, is if I did the right thing in ""disappearing"" like this from the whole group. I really think she led me to believe she liked me so I really still have no interest in talking to the girl, and to be honest I have no interest at the moment in talking to the rest of the group either.

Up to this point I thought he was just an asshole who had narcissistic problems and needs to straighten out his morals. But finding out he lied about being raped? Basically making up a whole life to someone who has known him for years, makes me think there is something actually wrong with his head, like maybe he has a lying disorder or bipolar disease - this behavior just isn't normal and I no longer think he's just an asshole, I feel like there is something wrong with him. He also has a messy history with addiction and substance abuse, so I know he has DEEPLY rooted issues. He is clean now.¬†

My problem is - Im healthy and happy but I'm madly in love with the guy. When he isn't lying or doing weird shit, I feel more in love with him than anyone I've met. Our connection is very strong. He has serious work to do on his mental health and he admitted after I found out about the lies that he would go to AA, therapy, and a psychiatrist to see what drives him to do the crazy stuff he does. I'm trying to figure out what is wrong with him and why he has always lied to me and EVERYONE. What is going on? Please no ""he's terrible, blow him off"" replies - I know that already, I just want to know what's wrong with him because this is of course very uncomfortable for me.¬†Up to this point I thought he was just an asshole, but now I'm starting to ask myself if he might truly have something wrong with his head that makes him act this way, and maybe he doesn't eve realize it. I know he wants to be successful, he does care about me and he does want to grow and I do believe that, but I feel like whatever is going on in his head is stopping him. 

TL;DR Ex has lied pathologically to me for the five years I have known him. I am still in love with him (the good parts) but I can't understand WHY he acts so mentally unhealthy and if there may be something deeper going on here, like a mental disorder that drives him to be an addict, lie compulsively, etc. ",21Jan2018,3
