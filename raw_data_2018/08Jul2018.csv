0,"Lately I’ve been hearing things, for example my mum left the house to go on a walk. My little brother was downstairs eating breakfast and I heard her come home and talk to him. When I went downstairs she wasn’t there so I asked him were she was and he said she wasn’t home yet. Things similar to this have happened in the past few weeks, me hearing things then nobody else hearing them. Does any know what could be going on?",08Jul2018,5
1,"I’m a school social worker and former EMT. 

I get that question a lot. “What’s the worst thing you’ve heard”. 

I could sift through stories. Fights, drama, drugs, weapons, gang violence. even some of sexual abuse in teen relationships. However, today, it was the worst. 

For extreme cases of truancy, we do truancy workups with our truancy officers and a school social worker whenever we find the family. 

I had an appointment at 1 for this truancy hearing. I look up the name in the computer, print out the basic information on this girl I’ve never heard of. 

One of truancy officers for my school comes in. He tells me my appointment at 1 was cancelled. 

I get ready to call the parents. We can accommodate, we can go to the house, we can go wherever to have the meeting if the parent can’t make it to the school. 

The truancy officer tells me to “not worry about calling” and that the appointment is “really, really canceled”. 

I ask why. 

He informs me that he drove out to the house to be shooed away by heavily armed Homeland Security,  FBI, and state + local police. 

2 hours later, he gets an update. Our student was a kidnapped human trafficking victim from Canada, and the “parents” were pimps. 

Then I learned soon after that when the police made entry to the house, a pimp tried to hold the girl hostage with a box cutter. He was shot in the face, the girl had her chin cut by said box cutter. 

I’m pretty upset by it. I will post any updates if any become available to me.

2,"Hi, I'm 19, MTF, PL.

My life was going downhill for quite some time now. I've basically stopped any self-development. I'm only whining about it and not doing anything, I have a bad attitude towards the world. I can't break away from my bad habits like youtube addiction, dissociation from the reality and all sorts of stuff. Today I've told myself I can't ever work at IT, the only thing I'm good at, because I hate systemd and I want to be a sysadmin.... How do I STOP behaviour like that and move on, taking into consideration that I'm getting more and more numb and negative everyday? I don't want to go to a therapist, nor take any pills, the shit we have over here will completely wreck my brain and I don't want to suffer the stigmas (hell, that's why I'm writing from a weirdass account, don't even dare to analyze its genesis pls ;_;)",08Jul2018,3
3,"It has destroyed my family. It has destroyed the love my wife had for me. And most importantly, it has destroyed my wife's view of the world. 

She began having psychosis at the beginning of this year and refused to seek help because she didn't (still slightly doesn't) believe that there was anything wrong with her.

She wholeheartedly believed that I was poisoning her, performing witch craft, and or trying to kill her/hurt her in some way. It got so bad, she actually got extremely violent and is locked up at the moment. She has been taking Zyprexa 10mg for the last 3 months (not exactly consistently because getting in line for medication depends solely on you when you are in jail) and yet she still feels like her delusions were real. She is still afraid of me, still doubts everything I do for her. Believes she can know what i'm planning by just looking at my eyes. Today she looked at my hands when I went to visit her, and told me my hands were weird/different/strange. She told me that when she gives me a hug, she can feel my energy and she feels an immense weight on her whole body. She sees everything good that I do for her but believes there are ulterior motives for it. 

She hasn't been properly diagnosed yet but did spend 14 days in the hospital before being moved to jail. That's where they prescribed Zyprexa. They will be offering her a plea deal for mental health treatment so I hope that she actually gets the help she needs to get back to the person she was before all of this... She was normal.

5,"The morning / afternoon started out ok. I [26m] cleaned up my apartment, did laundry, went to a coffee shop and hung out for a bit. Grabbed dinner and started feeling like absolute shit. I was by a seemingly happy young couple who had a kid and it made me feel like garbage because I feel like that will never be me. I don’t know if I’m gay or straight, and I don’t have many friends my age and the ones I do have I don’t think would stay as close with me if they found out I was gay. 

On my drive home I started experiencing EXTREME self loathing. Yelling at myself to just die, wishing I would die, driving 100mph and screaming, punching my dashboard. I haven’t felt this in a long time. I got home and started throwing shit everywhere and screaming. I punched myself in the head a few times and punched the floor. Try as I did I could not manage to cry, just yelled and groaned and wished to die. I started to rationalize suicide and was thinking of ways I could do it. 

This is all because I’m alone and lonely, because I reject myself for being gay. Because of all the shit I’ve heard and teasing that was done before I knew any better. I don’t know how to get over it. I am at a point where I CANNOT accept myself. I would rather be dead. I wish I was not born.

I searched online something along the lines of “what’s the point of living” and it at least distracted me enough to fall asleep. When I woke up I had this fuck it attitude and signed back up for a gay fetish site I swore off, watched porn after intentionally abstaining for nearly 100 days, and started talking to some guy on tinder. After I climaxed, I made a point to continue to watch the video to see how I felt about it. I felt shame and guilt and disgust, I don’t want to continue this conversation with this guy, and I’m generally feeling like shit. 

I don’t feel as bad as I did when I got home but I don’t feel good. I have no one I feel like I can talk to about this. The bottom line is I hate myself for something I can’t seem to help. I want to keep myself away from close friendships and relationships because I can’t stand any more rejection than I’m putting myself through. I’ve moved literally across the United States 4 times in the past 3 years, trying to run from myself. 

I’m not suicidal right now, but I think about it a lot. I just hate myself so goddamn much. I don’t know why I’m posting this here except as an obvious cry for help that will likely be fruitless

7,"I have dementia, hearing loss, vision damage, a permanent headache, and a host of other health problems that were directly caused by Psychiatric poisons.  I'm 38 years old, previously intellectually gifted and in good general health.

I made the unforgivable mistake of going to a psychiatrist and trusting his recommendations.  He had me take additional drugs to try and deal with the effects of other drugs.  The whole thing spiraled out of control.  By the time I realized what had happened and took control of the process by stopping all drugs, it was too late and the damage was done.

I'd like to tell you my story, and would appreciate your efforts to defend this dangerous profession.

I started on Latuda 60mg, to treat supposed bipolar disorder.  After a traumatic event, the Psychiatrist added 2.5 mg of zyprexa.  From my own research, I now understand there is no reason to combine those two toxins, and no data to ensure their safety.  I continued taking these two drugs for about 8 months.  When we stopped the zyprexa to go back to the original plan to just use latuda, I developed insomnia.  I couldn't sleep through the night and would wake up very early.  After roughly 3 weeks of this, I reluctantly went back on the zyprexa.  Sleep was restored for a week or two.  Then I developed a more insidious insomnia, not able to fall asleep for 2 straight nights.  The psychiatrist added Klonopin to the lethal cocktail, .5 mg, and raised the zyprexa to 7.5 mg.  This stabilized things for about 2 months.

I began experiencing panic attacks multiple times a week.  They were awful.  Nothing I had ever had before.  I now know that panic attacks are a reported effect of Latuda (I refuse to call them side effects, because the effects of psych drugs are exclusively negative).  I also think it was some kind of defense mechanism for my brain to let me know it was being harmed.  However, I did not listen.  I reported the panic attacks to the psychiatrist, but he did not seem concerned.  He added Clonidine.10 mg to try and stop the attacks.  Unfortunately, it did not prevent them, but could sometimes calm them after they had started.  For reasons I will never understand, I continued taking these 4 terrible drugs every night for 6 months.  It was awful.  7.5 mg zyprexa, 60 mg Latuda, .5mg Klonopin, .10 mg Clonidine.

After about 3 months of the poison, I started experiencing memory issues.  First long term, then both long and short term.  I always had an incredible memory, so this was concerning.  The Pseudoscientist suggested the panic attacks and resulting sleeping issues were the cause, but I didn't think so.  I had sleep issues before, but they never affected memory or cognition.  Finally, after about 6 months, I had enough.  We stopped the Klonopin, because he suggested it was the most likely culprit of the memory problems.

The panic attacks seemed to get worse and more frequent, so he added Depekote, starting at 125mg and going all the way up to 750 mg.  I now know that you are not supposed to take more than 500 mg of Depakote in a single dose(I know you're allowed more in a day) but he didn't seem to care.  Throughout this entire process, he kept insisting the drugs had ""no long term neurotoxic effects.""  The truth is the complete opposite, I would come to find out.

He told me I could stop the Latuda without even tapering. This was surprising, because apparently I could have stopped it at any time.  NONE of these horrible drugs provided any benefits, so there was no reason to take them anyway.

The panic attacks stopped once the Latuda and Klonopin were removed.  But the memory and cognitive problems persisted.  I decided my only chance for recovery was to stop all dangerous drugs.  We tapered the zyprexa, depakote, and clonidine over the next few months.  I went slowly, because I was afraid the panic attacks could return, but they never did.

I noticed more troubling problems, like losing most of the vision in my left eye, and hearing loss.  The skin on my fingers became extremely dry, almost calloused.  I never slept the way I did before the drugs.  In fact, as I tapered off, I started waking up earlier and earlier and seemed incapable of feeling tired.  I haven't needed to set an alarm clock in 2 years, and I used to be a late riser.

After not being able to sleep through the night for several days, I stupidly agreed to take Doxepin 10 mg.  I took it for 2 months, and stopped it.  I can now sleep about 6-7 hours per night, but am still unable to feel tired.

I've done a lot of research, and it seems that the only possibility to recover from Psychiatric Drug Induced Brain Damage is to stop the offending drugs and hope for improvement.  It's been 6 months since I've been off all drugs, and nothing has improved.

Can anyone suggest a possible course of action?

How can Psychiatrists do this to people?  My health and life are destroyed because I trusted an arbitrary opinion.  Psychiatry has no objective diagnostic criteria.  There's absolutely no reason that I should have to suffer for the rest of my life.",08Jul2018,0
8,"WARNING: This post contains a tale full of emotional and physical abuse by mental health professionals and law enforcement.

My girlfriend is a very kind, very loving, tiny pixie of a girl who suffers from bipolar 1. She has been symptom free for over 2 years but recently started having hypomanic (and then manic) symptoms brought on by lack of sleep (probably). 

After four days of gently urging her to seek treatment voluntarily, she finally agreed to go see a therapist. We are new to our area and so I had to resort to Google to quickly find something (before her mania caused her to change her mind). I found the Montgomery County Crisis center in Rockville, Maryland, about 20 minutes from where we live.

I brought my girlfriend, who was calm and asked if she could bring some art to show the therapist. She brought a picture of a wilted flower, which she had painted the same day, because one of her manic impulses is to tell everyone she is a ""fragile flower that needs to be treated with respect and love"".

As soon as we entered the waiting room, I immediately got a bad feeling. This place felt more like a ""prison"" than a crisis center. But...there was some patient-made art on the walls that made us both feel a bit better.

When I finished her intake forms while she chatted with other patients (usually just saying ""hello! you look amazing!"") we quickly met with the ""therapist"". An obese woman with stringy red hair, glasses, and a pallid complexion (also, she smelled vaguely of rotting fish, I now suspect it was the smell of her heart/soul). 

My girlfriend asked if she could find out the woman's name before she talked to her, and asked her to promise that she could feel safe around her. The ""therapist"" shrugged and said ""I guess so"" before ushering us in.

My girlfriends symptoms immediately became much, much worse. In fact, I see now that this woman's unwelcoming and unfriendly demeanor terrified her.

What  occurred next was unlike anything I've ever witnessed, in real life or on TV. This ""therapist"" turned out to be a COMPLETE MONSTER.

My girlfriend repeatedly asked her for validation for her art. ""I'm an artist!"" she said (one of the things she repeats in a manic state), ""I just need people to understand my art!""

The ""therapist"" just gave her a frightened look (by the way, my girlfriend is 90lbs and completely nonviolent, even when manic). She never smiled or tried to understand what this wonderful, innocent, sick human was going through.

The crowning jewel was when my girlfriend said ""I just need to know you understand my art. Can you tell me what this means to you?"" she said, showing that pallid, worthless, waste of flesh her drawing of a ""delicate flower"". (by the way, it was quite good, if a little minimalist)

The ""therapist"" looked her dead in the eyes and said ""nothing.""

At this point, my girlfriend fled the room. I tried to reassure the woman that I would be taking her to the hospital immediately but she insisted on calling the police. 

Now, this part I understand, it's protocol to contact authorities in this kind of situation. If my girlfriend was a danger to herself, that would be a good thing.

The officers that arrived were not trained in any sort of mental health management, and they were not accompanied by a mental health professional. They proceeded to threaten to taze my girlfriend, and then brutalized her and put her in cuffs, despite the fact that she was agreeing to accompany them without incident.

She has been traumatized as a result. I suspect she may need years of additional therapy to recover.

Again, just so you can keep yourself and your loved ones safe, this is the MONTGOMERY COUNTY CRISIS CENTER in ROCKVILLE MARYLAND. Here's a link to their facebook and website if you want to urge them to improve themselves.

9,"Last year I wanted to hurt myself and didn’t feel safe. I went to the ER and asked for help. They immediately took me back and that is where my nightmare began. 

I was forced to strip in front of a nurse and remove all my clothing. I was given a hospital gown and scrub pants. Then they did a drug test and made me take a breathalyzer test. I don’t drink or do drugs, nor was I acting like I did. 

Then I had all of my possessions removed from me. My phone was locked away and I was moved to a large room with two other people in it while I waited for hours. I developed a massive migraine and when I asked for my medication was told no. I was crying and in the four hours prior to me screaming for someone to give me medicine for my fucking raging migraine and for the TV to be turned down I spoke to no one. No doctors, no social workers nothing. Finally someone came by and gave me a terribly dry sandwich and asked if I wanted to be in patient or out patient for help. That I seemed normal so I could be out patient. 

Then I waited for two more hours of migraine hell and had enough. I demanded to know what was going on and when they told me they didn’t need to tell me anything I lost it. I know that I am supposed to be kept updated on my care and this place only made me feel worse. There had been a new girl added to the room and she was pacing and making me more agitated because she kept coming up to my personal space. No one cared. So I demanded to be released since no on saw me as a threat. They wouldn’t let me leave until someone came to go home with me. 

I had to call my mom and tell her to come immediately so I could leave. Things didn’t get better until I left my job and all the extra stress it was causing me. Then I finally started getting better. 

Now I’m right back, if not worse, than I was a year ago. My mom is terminal due to her cancer coming back. I’m her caregiver. My brother is useless and I’m caring for/paying for him as well. I lost my friends due to my mental health and the craziness that has been the last two months of my life since my mom had to undergo a craniotomy and my life flipped upside down. 

Today all I can think about it leaving. Or ending all the suffering I’m dealing with. I don’t want to keep trying and failing. Nothing I’m doing is enough. I’m treated like shit and I’m alone. It’s too much and I’m not well mentally anymore. 

I can not afford a therapist and I have horrible reactions to medications so I’ve been trying so many different things that it feels hopeless. All I want is to feel supported and connected and “normal”. This is just all too hard. 

I thought about going to get help again but I do not want to be treated like a criminal for not being strong enough to not harm myself. So instead I’ve bought a new blade and I’ve cut my skin to draw out blood since it is the only thing that makes me feel calmer. Not enough to do serious harm, just enough to breathe again.

A few minutes have passed.

Now I feel as if somebody is watching me. If I look up, I expect somebody, a presence, to be there, but there is not. It is just me alone in my apartment.

A few more minutes have passed. Now the photos appear flat again, almost too flat, like the illusion of 3D is missing from the photos.

...

\^ These symptoms, along with many other strange symptoms, come and go in a cyclical pattern. This happens every few months. These symptoms are not severe enough to require hospitalization or to prevent me from doing things like going to work or functioning in a social setting, but they are distinctly noticeable. They tend to cycle between positive symptoms (like feeling as if I am being watched, feeling as if I do not need or desire human company) and negative symptoms (not feeling as if I am being watched, feeling lonely, desperate for more human company). The cycles can be very rapid, alternating back and forth every few minutes. They can alter back and forth every few hours, or every few days. This is maybe the fourth time this has happened to me over the course of two years and each time it lasted for several weeks to a few months. A doctor described the symptoms as schizo-affective-ish, but I haven't actually seen or heard of anyone else with the same thing as me. Also, it is very much resistant to meds. Lithium did absolutely nothing, Carbamazepine did absolutely nothing, Depakote did not fix it, and antipsychotics actually can make the negative symptoms (like I mentioned it rapidly cycles between positive and negative symptoms), antipsychotics can actually make the negative symptoms worse. I am in a very strange predicament.",08Jul2018,1

I want to go out with friends. The feeling comes on fast, but then 10 minutes later I've changed my mind. Another 30 minutes later I change my mind again and want to go out. This goes back and forth for several hours until I eventually make my decision which I usually get from talking myself out of it ""oh if its more than 30 mins away I wont go"", almost like I'm betting with myself. Sometimes I'll go as far as driving to a destination, but halfway there I turn around and change my mind by talking myself out of it. I always feel guilty after deciding not to.

I didn't know much but I knew what emotions were; Mad, sad, scared, happy.  I saw other kids having fun and I was scared of being killed but also thought I should be dead.  When I was eight My brother was born very sick and everyone thought he was going to die.  Because of that I didn't see neither my mom or my step dad and was juggled though people.  The situation hurt me and I felt as if I was more of a nuisance than a help to my parents and they didn't care about me enough to console me.  Because of that I decided I was never going to bother anyone again.  I attempted suicide, I did not succeed.  Everyone was more upset and I promised to never do that again to myself.  When I was ten I was bullied everything got worse.  I was called overweight, I was 4'9'' and 70lbs, that bothered me.  Later I was given an assignment for school about the flu.  In the article I read it said that one symptom of the flu is vomiting and it was important that you eat gentle foods so you would vomit and would keep all the nutrients your body needed to fight it off.  That gave me an idea, I knew that if I threw up after I ate I would actually process the food and if you did not process the food you wouldn't eat and that made you lose weight.  I became bulimic and later got chronic migraines. School, bullies friends, weight, pain, and home life weighed in on me I began  to cut.  I didn't like the scars it gave me it invited questions and I didnt want to answer.  Then I discovered burning, It didn't leave scars and it was slow and painful.

22,"First time poster. I’ll try to condense only to salient details. 

My partner’s mom passed away suddenly in February. This happened while he was working full time and in grad school full time.

Once the semester ended, his mental health took a downturn. He’s always struggled with depression and anxiety, but I think that without school to keep him busy, he was forced to acknowledge his grief.

He doesn’t have insurance at the moment, and has had a bitch of a time finding a doctor and a therapist that he can afford to see regularly. He’s started on medication but feels that it’s not working; however, his next doctor’s appointment isn’t for another month or so. 

He’s been drinking a lot more in order to help him sleep. He’s not particularly nice when he’s drunk, and he tends to get even sadder and more insecure, except in this case it’s even more difficult for me to penetrate his drunk logic. 

When he’s sober, he’s still just...incredibly sad. He doesn’t know what would make him feel better. He thinks that asking me to help him with anything is a burden. So we sit in oppressive silence all day long, and I try to distract myself from the fact that it seems like I can do *nothing* to help him. 

I was just starting to be in a good place when things with his mental health hit the fan. Now I’m struggling not to sink down with him. It’s hard, because I feel guilty for being somewhat happy and functional while he’s having such a hard time. I’m trying to disentangle myself from all the codependent tendencies that cause me to feel like I’m responsible for his happiness, but my god, it’s hard. 

I guess I just needed somewhere to vent. The situation feels so hopeless and I don’t see an end in sight. Please tell me there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. ",08Jul2018,3

I'll try and keep it short.


I am a 28 year old male, I live in Atlanta and have a amazing girlfriend(she will be important later). 

I have been using drugs since I was 15. I never saw it as a problem, I considered myself a ""High Function Addict"". I kept a stable job and housing. Being able to support my drug habbit and hide my drug addiction from friends and family. It started with simple things pills and pot and evolved to herion, cocaine and the occasional meth use(I don't like being up for long periods of time).

My family recently found out about my drug use, it just became to much. They noticed me nodding out and having track marks. I lost everything, when it affected my work. I checked into a detox center to help appease my family. Getting high and escaping this world was everything to me.

Apperently schizophrenia runs in my family, my uncle has it. He used to be a engineer in Guatemala (I don't have to explain the healthcare there, you get the point). When I checked in I instantly regretted it. The paranoia set in very quickly.

I couldnt sleep when I got there. I stayed up for 3 days. (Not on meth Opioids are my drug of choice but that dosent mean I would pass on it.). I was to scared to fall asleep. I thought the other patients where plotting to kill me.

I remeber being so terrified. I would sit and listen to them talk in thier rooms about the best way to kill me. Horrible, gruesome, things torture, rape everything under the sun. I had made friends with a night watch nurse(I thought she was in on it to). I would rant and ramble about the things being said and what I was hearing.On the third day, the nurse stopped me mid rant and said ""I think you have early onset audio schizophrenia"". She explained that my drug use has made my schizophrenia show early(Apperently it's normal for signs to show in the 30s).

I didn't know what to say, I denied it. Finally I fell asleep and I was still alive. The next couple days were a blur, but I was taken in front of a committee of doctors. I was moved up to a 10-14, and asked all kinds of questions. That night I was given Risperidone. To be honest I don't like it, the side effects are to much. I don't feel like me.

When I was released I stopped taking it. That's was a month ago. I still see things, tho I know it's not real. Its always just someone at the edge of my vison watching me, Or visual distortions(Like the heat coming off payment but on a object). Its the voices I cant take,it's my girlfriend's voice telling someone how I should die, Its torture. My best friend telling someone how horrible my death should be. I have noticed that the voices only become intense and almost unbearable when I'm coming off drugs. I want to stop using drugs but my reality is to much. Being high is just, simpler.

I have contemplated suicide, I don't want to be taken care of. My Girlfriend is very supportive she's the best type of person always positive. I don't think I can put her through this. I cant sleep and I'm worried about the future. It scares me almost as much as the little girl I cant see, but hear. She never says anything negative, she just asks me wierd questions like can she drink my coffee(I don't hear her very often).

The point of this is I have no one to talk to. I don't want to put the love of my life through the pain of seeing me go through this. My family wants to shove pills down my throat. My best friend has his own family and problems to worry about. It's really just to vent.

29,"I feel like that all the time. Whatever happens to me, good or bad, I feel like I only can truly grasp that by looking in other people's eyes, hearing their thoughs.  

I lost a lot of weight recently. Mostly because I don't care to eat properly, but I also got in a kind of frenzy of exercizing not too long ago. And I was at that party where everyone congratulated me on that. Up until that point I felt nothing. I don't care if I look good. I care that I look sufficient for others. And in recent past I was scolded for such behavior/thought pattern because ""If you don't need yourself why the heck would someone need you? You might as well just die"".  

I don't know about that last bit though. I always thought that I don't care if I live or die because I cannot possibly know the difference. And yeah, a big request would be to keep it secular. But aside from that - who CAN know the difference? And where can this ""I need myself"" thing come from? I have no idea at all and I was hoping someone could help me with that.  

I also feel like I cannot truly accept affection of others because of this. Because everytime someone says or indicates that they like me and they need me I get a ""Why?"" question stuck in my head. And whatever reasoning they might have come up with (and yes, I do know its weird to coax people into that, so add guilt to that mix) results with a 404 thing in my brain, because, I guess, I can't just think""oh yeah, I can see that someone would like that"".

32,"Recently I was watching the ""Pull up"" series on Joe Budden's YouTube channel. On the episode where his guest is Styles P, part of the discussion is on mental health and how Styles P believes that rage should be considered a mental health condition. I agree wholeheartedly. Suffering from rage has been something of a detriment to my life and has caused me to have many regrets. I strive to be a good man but due to many traumas endured, I have developed an armor that sometimes becomes an uncontrollable anger. The fact that these emotions are at times out of my control leads me to believe this could possibly be a mental health issue as Styles suggests.

34,"I keep parrots and a dog, and in researching and practising training techniques for animals, I've finally found an effective way of overcoming my motivation problems. I reward myelf for **EVERY small bit of effort** I put into everything and anything positive that I do, *no matter how small that effort is.* It's like training an animal to pick up a ball and bring it to you in small increments.

First: the animal touches ball. Give a lot of praise, and reward.

Second: the animal picks up the ball. Give a lot of praise, and reward.

Third: the animal brings the ball halfway towards you. Give a lot of praise, and reward.

And so on, until the entire behaviour is completed. All by focusing on and celebrating **every** small success.

I do this with myself by making a note of every small thing I do and ""patting myself on the back"" for even just trying, even if the progress is slow and the positive changes in my efforts are very small. An example: I used to have trouble in motivating myself to read books and novels, something which I now enjoy doing every day. I overcame this by making a note of and celebrating *even just touching the book I wanted to read.* Make a note in a diary, give yourself a gold star, eat a chocolate bar, whatever works for you.

I constantly had this feeling that people were out to get me. Which even made me lose my appetite. At some point i was wondering whether i had an eating disorder, because people kept commenting about how thin i was getting. I even had a plan for suicide. I wanted to hang myself on a bridge not too far from the school. I would also write a poster next to my hanging corpse that would blame society for my suicide.

Today i am feeling different. I don't really know whether what i'm feeling is good or not, but i'm certainly not depressed anymore. I do have this weird feeling of just complete emptiness inside me though. People would tell me good news, and nothing. People tell me bad news, and just nothing.

Another thing i have noticed. My personality seems to be very much all over the place. My thoughts feel very erratic. Almost as if my mind has been shattered into pieces. I think this is the reason i have no friends. My impression is that people have difficulties trusting me, and i have difficulties trusting them. Therefor i have problems bonding with people i guess.

I guess i should mention my lifestyle as well. I'm not living an ideal lifestyle. I sit in the darkness in my room 24/7 on the computer. That is basically every day for me.

Since i have no friends, obviously loneliness would eventually become a problem. I have always talked to myself as a method to cope with the silence. But i realized that it was not enough. So now i have bought a doll from the internet that i use to talk to.

45,"My younger brother is 7 years younger than me and just turned 24 yesterday. Our mother was an addict and we were placed under guardianship of our older sister by a court order. My brother was always very close with our mom... she passed away unexpectedly 4 years ago.

My brother was diagnosed with ADHD when he was very young. Our mom ended up with his meds and he never took them. When my brother was in high school he was hospitalized for mental illness 4 times. I'm not sure of his official diagnosis, but I'm pretty sure he has manic depression. He is also prone to very violent outbursts. 

My brother is a hard worker, but he constantly changes jobs. He's worked mostly in restaurants. He'll move up to management really fast then fizzle out and get another job.

Last April he was having a depressive episode. I knew he wasn't well. He told me that he wished he could just be with mom (who is dead), so I immediately asked if I could take him to the hospital. He agreed to go. The ER we went to was terrible. The doctor who came in gave a whole, ""you're so young, you have so much to live for"" spiel which really pissed me off. 

He was released from the ER that night and set up with a counselor. I had him move in with my husband and I soon after. He went to a few counseling sessions, but was angry because they were pushing meds so he stopped going.

 He lived with us for a year and finally the time came when my husband &amp; I needed our space. My brother got an apartment and was very excited. About 2 weeks after he moved out I was at work when I received a call from one of his friends... she said he had flipped out and was driving into oncoming traffic. I rushed to where she said he was and found his car on a tow truck. He'd been arrested. I talked with the arresting officer and he agreed to transfer my brother to the nearest ER. 

He was there for a few hours. He started getting agitated and a nurse came in. He flipped out and the nurse said he should respect her because she was ""old enough to be his mother"". I knew it wasn't going to go well after those words. He sounded possessed and screamed, ""my mom is dead!!!!"". They called security down. I asked the nurse to leave and calmed him down. He then said he had to use the bathroom. He tried to run out of the ER. They made me go to the waiting room. I pleaded that he needed something to calm him down, he was having a mental health episode and needed medical help, not jail. He ended up getting tackled and was arrested and taken to jail.

My husband and I ended up bailing him out hours later and took him to another hospital (he was still wearing a hospital gown). The second hospital was calmer. I explained everything that happened and the triage nurse asked if he was having a manic episode. Hours later they finally got a crisis counselor to do an assessment and he was eventually taken to a mental health crisis center.

I got his car out of impound a day later and when I was cleaning it out I found busted, dented cooking pots. My aunt and I were working to try to get him a bed in a facility for a couple months. I then found out that my brother had left the crisis facility after only one day. He apologized and said he had freaked out because he found out his girlfriend had had a miscarriage and broke up with him. 

It's been 2 months since and he's not doing well again. He quit his job and started a new one. He has missed car payments, keeps running out of gas, and his behavior is becoming erratic again. Apparently his apartment was robbed last night and his debit card stolen. My husband is done with helping him and I'm there as well. We've helped him out financially with thousands over the past year.

 He needs help and needs medication, but he says it won't help. I'm just too stressed to help anymore. I have PTSD (from childhood trauma as well as my boyfriend's suicide years ago), extreme anxiety, and depression. Medication, an amazing therapist, and a support group I started keep me functioning. My brother is on the verge of another episode. I'm considering giving him an ultimatum... either he gets mental health treatment (I'll help sort his affairs out) or I'm completely cutting him off and will probably have to get a restraining order. I fear the latter is what will happen and he'll end up in jail. I'm kind of just ranting right now, very stressed and worried. If anyone has any advice or insight into situations like this, please share. Thanks.

Right now I’ve been stuck in my apartment for over a month (for the second time this year) with a foot injury and it hurts to walk. I can’t do anything. I have BPD.

Everything that happens to me feels like ive seen it already, and i feel like ive seen all of this during my 1st trip in April, as if i was shown that all of this was gonna happen, and that i could've prevented it by ""letting go"" i thought i was getting arrested during my 1st trip and it still feels like im getting arrested in the 1st trip NOW, but i was never arrested, nothing happened, or so i thought.

My friends dad was saying things during the night like ""Someone tipped them off"" and ""You guys are on heavy drugs, dont realize whats going on."" and shit like that, that made me even more worried that i was getting arrested. And im so worried that he was talking about police, and that i just retreated into my mind so that wouldnt happen, its all so scary.

Its starting to feel more and more like this is some fake coma reality, i'm so worried that i'm just gonna wake up either in my house after a psychotic break covered in piss and shit (cuz well, i have to go in this reality) or that i'm gonna wake up in my friends RV back in April, the deja vu is only making this feeling worse and i don't know what to do about it, i cant stop thinking about it, and i cant see a psychiatrist or go to a hospital because we cant afford it and insurance wouldn't cover it, i'm 16 and i don't want this to ruin what teenage time i have left, please help. Ive told my mom basically everything (except the dog part in the detailed writing) but i cant tell my dad, hes just gonna look down on me and even though he took a bunch of acid as a teen, he doesnt even believe LSD exists anymore, he thinks that there is no more real LSD, and im so scared that he'll just hate me, or think im some druggie. Help

49,"Hello,

I don't know why, but recently, ordering fast food has been kind of an ordeal. My life is a complete mess, and cooking at home is not really possible for me so I order out a lot. For some reason though, maybe a week ago, when I order any sort of take out that is ""unhealthy"", like a burger and fries kind of thing, I can only eat a little bit of it before I have a panic attack. I just had a panic attack now after trying to eat a few french fries.

I guess on one hand I'm not complaining, I guess it's kind of advantageous to have negative reinforcement preventing me from eating unhealthy, but it is really shocking and scary. Sometimes I don't have the option of getting healthy food (time of day, or other circumstances making more healthy options unavailable for example) so I end up not eating anything at all. I've gone a couple days without much food at all before because of this. It's great that I'm afraid to eat unhealthy food now, but still I'd really like there to be no panic/anxiety gamble with every single meal I sit down to eat. Most foods I'm unsure if it'll trigger a panic attack. I even bought a salad one day (one of my favourites, a greek salad) and it triggered a panic attack in me. I'm scared that eventually all food will cause me to panic and I won't be able to eat right anymore.

Any thoughts on this? I'm going to talk to my therapist about it tomorrow, but I wanted to see if anyone else had some thoughts or advice I could mull over. Especially since I just threw out an entire meal I just bought because I'm too scared to eat it. Is this some kind of eating disorder or is it more in the realm of anxiety disorders?

**tl;dr :** Eating unhealthy food will trigger a panic attack guaranteed, and it seems like more and more food regardless of health factor triggers a panic attack in me as well. I'm getting afraid that soon I won't be able to eat anything without grappling with a feeling of imminent death. What's happening here?",08Jul2018,4

51,"I just lost one of my guinea pigs a few days ago. I did cry for like 15 hours, 9 hours before he died and 6 after. But since then I haven't been able to cry except for once for a few minutes. I can't feel anything really.  He was dear to me. He and my other piggie were the only reason I didn't kill myself a few years back. I did love him. But for some reason I feel like I cant grieve.  Just now I walked past his cage and it's like I saw him there for a sec in the corner of my eye. But he wasn't there. 

Did I just use up all my grief in one go? Or am I still in denial about it? I know he's dead. He's not coming back. I miss him. But I can't feel anything. Is it because of my depression? It just feels so wrong that I'm not grieving by crying.

Personally I feel like it's a symptom of a sick culture, but it's next to impossible to make any real, lasting change. I feel like my severe depression is mostly a symptoms of my hyper awareness and sensitivity to the problems I see around me, and I feel like taking medication to supress that is wrong.

59,"Hi, so something extremely weird happened today. Yesterday, I returned from a 4 day trip with my friends, during which I was pretty much constantly drunk. I also smoke quite a lot, and have experiences with weed, although that wasn´t part of this trip. 

So once I got home depression hit me hard. Today I almost couldn´t get up, I didn´t have any motivation to do so, I was just lost in my depression (which comes mainly from me being fat, gay and in love). I didn´t eat much today and, in the morning, I snorted some caffeine, probably a bit too much. Then I spent like 3 hours listening to music, thinking while hungry. I came up with a plan to start working out (which I have tried before), to tell my friends and get their support and I got really hyped. I ate a bit after that and then was doing something on my computer, when suddenly, something in my brain snapped.

Suddenly I felt confused, got this really weird feeling regarding pretty much everything. I felt like I just woke up from a dream, although I could remember my earlier thoughts, I felt like they weren´t really mine. I  suddenly thought my plan was crazy and my depression went away and was completely replaced by confusion. I snorted some more caffeine in the evening and feel somewhat better now. 

So could it be the caffeine? Nothing like this ever happened before when I did caffeine. Also I got worried about having B12 deficiency or something from all the alcohol and not eating much. Am I schizophrenic, or do I have a bipolar disorder? I just don´t know. I will talk to a psychologist in like two weeks about this. There is much more to my story but that would be probably too long for anybody to read. ",08Jul2018,0
60,"Im soon 18. My life has been good if you compare it to people in other countries. The thing that has been tough tho is my mental health. Long story short, my mother and dad had a fucked up relationship. My father abused my mother, the police got involved and I was an 8 year old child taking care of my two younger siblings cause my poor mother had a hard finishing the makeover my dad started on the house and yard. She did everything by herself while feeding 3 young boys and making sure we hade a good life. This made me “grow up” at a young age because of the big responsibilities I had to take. 

Now I’m 18 in 2 weeks. I’ve been struggling with eating disorders, body dysmorphia and other related stuff past 2 years. My head is full of thoughts and responsibilities and I cannot relax.

Last few weeks I’ve had a feeling like I’ve lived my life and it’s time to die. I’m not talking about suicide, i mean like it’s my time now. Like I’m 100 freakin years old. 

I wanna add that I find it hard to “be young” , have fun and relax. I hate it. I wanna enjoy my life while being young without thinking about the calories I eat, my next workout, my family’s economy, my family’s health, my appearance, my personality, my future, my grades(which luckily are very good)- EVERYTHING!

I also hear things like rocks tumbling down the mountain and splashing into the river below when I camp despite there not being many rocks or a river close enough by to hear.

It feels like something else is in control of my life and I’m just idly standing by as it passes.

64,"Posted a few days ago but trying again :)

Hello!

I hope you’re having a great night. Honestly: this is a long story so I’ll throw a TLDR at the end.

I’m looking for help at diagnosing and getting past my anger and lack of confidence.

This all started about 2 years ago, during my senior year of college. I’d done two internships for a Fortune 500 company and received great reviews. I was eagerly awaiting a job offer from them. When I hadn’t heard back for a while I contacted them only to find out that they had not recommended me for employment on grounds of being too “easy going”.  This shattered me. The job was going to be in the same city as my girlfriend and family and I’d worked for this company and built relationships for two years. Many of the folks I’d have worked for I would consider close friends. It hurt.

I proceeded to take another job but it didn’t feel right. I remember moving south and during the drive to said place I’d be living I felt nothing but guilt and sadness to be compromising so heavily. Of course, the distance didn’t work and my girlfriend of 3 years and I split. Due to stress and genuinely hating the work environment of that job I ended up leaving after about a year with the intention of going to graduate school.

After leaving the job, I moved home, and since then I’ve lived there. Beforehand I just felt like a piece of crap all of the time and like nobody liked me or thought I could do anything right, but now, the anger has started. I can hardly look at myself in the mirror without wanting to punch the face in it. I’ve pushed away my friends and family with my anger. I don’t know how to explain it, I was always an easy going guy and now, just two weeks ago, I was at dinner in public and snapped. Something on the menu changed and I threw my perfectly functional phone on the floor, shattered it, and stomped it to the ground before walking out without it.

Tonight I got a ticket in my car going 27 in a 25 and after the cop gave me the ticket I politely accepted it, left my car where it sat in a neighborhood, and just walked 5 miles home because I felt if I touched the car again I’d just get another ticket because I’m too much of an idiot to drive properly.

I’m honestly afraid at this point. I have no composure. I start graduate school in roughly a month at a dream school, Harvard, but I can hardly even go into public without having a panic attack.

Do I forgo my admission to the best school in my field to get my mental health back? Do I move out of this house ASAP? Do I need to seek professional health.

I’m honestly afraid I’ll harm my future beyond repair if I don’t get myself in line soon.

TLDR: having serious self confidence issues since being denied from a job that meant a lot to me and having serious anger issues since living at home. Looking for help",08Jul2018,2

Schizophrenics in third world countries without access to medication recover at a higher rate than those forced into western institutions and placed on neuroleptics.

67,"#Introduction:
Hey my name is Ron, I'm 18 and I am very unsatisfied with how I act and acted for the past 18 years. My current state has been with me since I remember myself trying to put effort into certain objectives I have had in life.

#Backstory:
At the age of 1.5 years I was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma (eye cancer), in the surgery they took out the tumor with my right eye, so I only see in one eye.

I was always hooked to computers, so I played since kindergarten and I spend about 8-16 hours a day on the PC gaming (sometimes coding).

I used to get bullied in elementary school quite a lot (age 7-12).

At the age of 11 (somewhere around that), my 2nd psychologist diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety, I was treated by him until I was 15, I went to a psychiatrist and took anti-depressants (which I take until today), moved to another psychologist who I left about 5 months ago.

At the age of 14 I was diagnosed with Colitis (chronic colon disease) and PSC (chronic liver disease), I got is very easy compared to other people with these disease. I am only limited to not drinking alcohol (not too sad about it).

Throughout my life in school (middleschool and highschool), I only acquired one person I could call a true friend who I moved to a highschool in a different city, that's the place he got new friends and kind of ditched me... at that time I got myself more into the internet especially Minecraft where I got some internet friends (who I called true friends back at the time), I have known them for 5 years and some of them met in real life at some point (one from Sweden and one from England), we had a huge arguement and that seperated us but not completely. We are not as close as we used to be but we still play together.

#Real life examples of the issue:
E.G. Number 1

I finished Highschool not long ago and keeping my grades high was important especially in Maths, Physics and English. Part of that was consistently studying which I could bring myself to up until the last 1-2 days before the test and I wouldn't study that much. Everytime I thought about it I told myself ""this test, I'm going to do X and Y, everyday I am going to complete Z exercises"" and I could never keep up with my own promises. I loved Math &amp; Physics back at the time.

E.G. Number 2

I code plugins for servers as a hobby in a game called Minecraft, that's also how I started learning to code. We are currently working on a certain project and no matter how much I get excited just thinking about it I just can't bring myself to constantly work on it.

#Why I came here?
My motivation with these kind of tasks was rocketing into the sky when I thought about performing them but when it came to actually doing them I just got ""lazy?"" (that's how I call it) and couldn't really do them.

I brought these two examples because they cover up all kind of different things in life that you'd want or not want to do. Studying is usually boring so it's reasonable to not want to do it, but I couldn't do it even with my favorite subjects. Coding is my hobby and even if it's what I love doing I still can't bring myself to consistently work on that same project.

This is why I suspect my abnormal laziness is a bit more then what being lazy is. I typed out most of my life story to help people in the comments figure out where this behavior maybe comes from.

Feel free to ask any question about my life or what did I do in certain situation if that could help you somehow help me.",08Jul2018,5
