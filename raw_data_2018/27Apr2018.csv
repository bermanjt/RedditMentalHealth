0,"Alright. So I don’t know if I should post this here. I don’t know if a mental health issus but here it is.
Ill start by saying im dyslexic. Unofficially at least. That a post for a other day.
So like im going homeless at the end of the month or on the 29… oddly enough I cant wait…
So like at the start of the month ill lost my job. When two weeks  of laying in my bed saying I suck. Why I lost my job. Cause well they thing. They fucking thing im gonna cause a accident. So they fired me for it… last week got a day gig. What was supposed to be 8 hours. Got send hone after 6.  I got send home by the foremen. Who then when on to tell I should look up PWD and apply. So like im freaking out. Go nack into depression. As of Monday I cant fucking wait to go homeless. I don’t fell no depression or stresst. No depression great. No stress is weird. My stresst level are always sky high. And now for what should be a extremely stressfully situations. I have none. Apply for social assistance ask me if I ever heald a job and a place for 2 years. Witch im 25 the longest I when is 8 months.
So like I fell like this is what I am. A homeless man with no hope.  I cant hold a job for more then a month. No matter how hard I try. And in 6 year of my adults I spend accumulated 3 and half homeless in one form or a other.
I left nb to come to bc to not have any of this happened anymore. I spend 3 month telling myself I can. And will do this. For it to come crashing down. 
I was diagnosed hyperactive adhd and a profession bullshiter at 20. Told im making up systom of being bipolar to try and get disability. Doctor said and I quote “you might fool your family and friend but your not fooling me”. So ill tolk his advice go try and find myself work. I was 20. 25 o left nb cause after 3 year of tying to find work I couldn’t. Come to bc 4 months ago. And now here I am right back where I was when I was in nb.
So what should I do? What would you do. Ill been told to go back home now so many times. But ill be gping home to be in the exacle same situation I am. Do I go to mental health againg. What if they get my file from nb.  And decided im pretending againg. If that the case id like to stop now. I thought acting  was fun. This not fun. And I haven’t evening mention how I lost all my froend over the years and family don’t talk to me anymore. And you can probably guess. I don’t let anyone get close anymore. And because of that I fell so isolated and their nothing I can do about it. 

I don’t know what to do anymore.

1,"Something I notice is a lot of the time my concentration can sometimes go so bad that it feels like I have learning difficulties. Sometimes even when I am my self this can happen, but it generally happens when I am around other people. Some of the symptoms look similar to adult adhd, but then again some of the symptoms look similar to social anxiety. The thing is if it's much worse when I am in other peoples company then does this not just look like social anxiety? But maybe my concentration is already bad and then being around other people makes it even worse which then brings on even more anxiety? Sometimes when someone is talking to me even when I am not feeling anxious a lot of the time I feel very uninterested in what they're saying and actually have to really concentrate to pick up what they're saying, but often my mind is just wandering. But then say they started talking about something that really interests me, I would usually start being able to concentrate a lot better. ",27Apr2018,3

4,"I've been going to a therapist for about a year. My main issues are that I obsess about wanting to be female \(gender dysphoria\), which is a huge distraction and has made me extremely depressed. But I have a really hard time getting anything useful out of therapy. I've already said everything I can think of about my issues, and so I can never think of anything new to say in response to my therapist's questions. We just kind of go around in circles talking about the same things over and over. Meanwhile I'm getting more and more depressed and non\-functional and am about to lose my job. Recently he suggested that maybe I'm depressed \(duh\) and should go to a psychiatrist. But he won't actually \*say\* whether I should do that or not. He just asks whether I want to go to a psychiatrist and take anti\-depressants, but I don't know whether I should do that or not. I'm not an expert. 

Is it normal for therapists to be this non\-committal about recommending a treatment? I really have no fucking clue what to do to fix myself, which is why I went to a therapist in the first place. I'm not capable of making decisions, let alone ones this important. ",27Apr2018,1

6,"(Sorry for the rather long text/story here and thanks in advance for reading).... My sister, 28, struggles really badly with anxiety, and in a way she always has done but in recent years it’s got really bad. Struggling to sell her house a few years back pushed her into some kind of ‘breakdown’, she was very depressed, she attempted suicide on two occasions, thankfully unsuccessfully. It was a cry for help and it took a little time with recovery but she got back to ‘normal’ with work and life. The ‘incident’ as we refer to it now was in the past but it had left a mark on her. She seemed a lot more fragile as a person. And I learned a lot. 

3 years on though and we are unfortunately back to the same situation. Everything was fine (for ages) but she woke up one morning a few weeks back absolutely convinced that because she had anxiety as a condition and hadn’t informed the DVLA (driving) of it, she thought she had committed a Crime. In her head she was going to lose her license, was driving illegally and had been for years and it was the worse thing ever.... She tore up Her license, cancelled her car insurance, meaning she couldn’t get to work, couldn’t sleep or rest, wouldn’t eat, constant worrying. It was the catalyst for other worries, work related worries, adamant she was going to be investigated and prosecuted for working with anxiety. I had to stop her putting her house on the market to ‘pay off the legal fee’s’ (which were non existent). Some of these worries I could understand but some, if not all were massively out of proportion and hugely irrational but there was no compromising with her thought process and changing her mindset............ I have since read up that this is Catastrophizing, a side effect of anxiety, where you truly believe the worse case scenario as the outcome to a situation, and it seems 100% real. 

She spent 14 days at home, at this point on some strong medication, but not able to leave the house, her head collapsed into her knees, body tight, crying, at times begging me and her boyfriend to end her life (obviously we would never). We were of course trying our best to support her, hoping she’d improve. But It just got worse day by day and one night she came to me with a knife saying ‘do it, put me out of my misery, just once to the throat’. Enough was enough. I called the local mental health team who came and took her to a local facility. 7 days in there with no improvement and even more irrational Thoughts. 

She has now been moved to another facility and been sectioned. I’m separated by distance from my sister by 200 miles so I’m unable to see her right now but her boyfriend is visiting daily. I’ve been told she will be in there for a minimum of 28 days. She’s seeing doctors and psychiatrists. Apparently because of her mental state she’s unable to use her phone and so I can’t even speak To her. I’ve never not spoken to her for what’s been a week now. She’s my twin sister so we are very close. I just don’t know what to do now. I know she’s with the ‘professionals’ now and everyone is telling me this is the best place for her to get the support she needs, but this is not easy. 

I’d just like to know other people’s thoughts and advice who may have gone through similar things...I’m trying to understand all I can. 

Thanks x",27Apr2018,2
7,"I need professional help, I know I do. But the problem is, I have two part time jobs to help pay for university and I'm still on my parent's insurance plan and they are completely against me getting help through therapy because they say that I'm just sad and need to get it over it because my life is fine and good. I don't know what to do. I try to do construction projects on the side but therapy without insurance is a costly nightmare for me. 

I feel desperate. My life was so much better going to a professional. I finally felt like I was succeeding and getting somewhere and now I just don't know what to do. I hear people say excercise more, eat better, sleep better, but I don't know.. none of it compares to a professional.",27Apr2018,3
8,"I’m 25 years old. After college, I moved back home and worked at a good job in my hometown. Felt confident and good about myself working and had nice goals in my mind for my life, yet dealt with undealt with mental health issues from college.

Lived with strict immigrant parents with expectations - this contributed to a stress/anxiety induced breakdown last June.

Still recovering, so much better. I feel stupid for saying this, but in therapy I have been working through my childhood issues with them. Is it absolutely silly at 24/25 I still felt/feel intimidated by them? I suppose because when you move back home, you get put back in your car childhood role.... I am the baby of the family.

9,"What are your thoughts on depression in general? Everyone is different. Everyone manages differently. Everyone’s brain chemistry and life experience is different.

Many people go by that depression is an illness (I’m not undermining that it isn’t). A chemical imbalance they have to deal with through psychotherapy and medication perhaps.

Others point to that depression is rooted in early childhood/trauma experiences. You simply have to unroot/talk these issues out in therapy and you are “cured”.

Didn't used to be like this.  I just went for a physical and the blood work results are fine.  What the hell is wrong with me?  I don't wanna see people, don't really enjoy any activity or hobby anymore, don't wanna do anything at all really - and it's starting to affect personal life and work.  And then at the first sign my boss or girlfriend or friends are disappointed at me, I begrudgingly do the minimum to back ""on track"" - have dinner with them, get my work done well, and then right after they're ok with me, I don't care anymore and just go back to not wanting to do anything.

Again, I still find funny things funny, I don't feel sad or depressed about anything, I just DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AND DON'T ENJOY ANYONE OR ANYTHING.  I'm in great shape, am well-off and have no financial stresses.

16,"Let me start by saying I have major depressive disorder with psychosis and have struggled with this since I was about 11 years old. I am on higher doses of Pristiq and Latuda now, which only seems to help me function throughout the day so I can wake up in the morning, shower, and go wherever I need to go to run errands. I never really feel anything other than a neutral mood and whenever I experience some form of joy through laughter or texting with friends it is very short lived. Unfortunately, this is the only combination that has seemed to work in a ""I can function now"" way after being on over 35\-40 different medications \(I've lost count, actually, but I know it has been about 35 so far\). Even my psychiatrist seems like he gets fed up with me sometimes when I tell him something doesn't seem to be working anymore \(e.g., I was on Abilify for over 5 years on the highest dose and it stopped working randomly, so I started disconnecting for hours on end and saw shadows\).

However, it feels as if my medications just help keep my psychotic MDD at bay until it decides to break through every so often, which has now become more frequent. I don't really know what to do anymore with it and suicidal ideation has become 60&amp;#37; of my thought process throughout the day, even when I feel neutral. To me, suicide isn't about the ""well, they're better off without me"" thing\-\-it's about me not wanting to deal with emotional and physical pain anymore. I never have a plan, but it's like an obsession with suicide and death. Little distractions help, of course, such as photography and drawing, but my illness has seemed to kill my creative process now, and I never get anywhere with therapy \(yes, I have tried it over and over again\).

Does anyone else feel this way about medication? People constantly talk down to me about being on medication, but I guarantee you if I wasn't on it, I'd be dead already. I've tried going off of it for quite a number of months and I became almost catatonic and wasn't able to function nearly at all. To me it just keeps the main symptoms of my psychotic MDD at bay until something major triggers me or I deal with a build up of stress over and over until I break into pieces and go under.",27Apr2018,2
17,"Background: we moved across the country a couple months ago to live with his grandparents in Cali. He's always had anger problems before, and after seeing a psychiatrist when he was younger he was diagnosed manic depressive, aka bipolar. Aside from the anger and some depressive episodes, there hasn't been much of a problem. Last week he fell into a mania, and ever since he's been 100% different. Extreme paranoia, delusions, false connections, amplified anger. He blames his entire past on us. He tells me he chose wrong and to go home. He tears apart his grandmother. I know these are all typical symptoms that require time, patience, and medication/treatment, but that doesn't always help the pain we feel. I try to help him. We took him to see a doctor, and he was prescribed medication, but it only helps half of the time. I don't know if I can take this. I don't know if this is what I want.

19,"**TL;DR:** I don't know how to answer a mood chart. I fear that I might downplay or overplay my mood. Looking for suggestions on how to identify how High/Low I'm feeling.

--

I went to a psychiatrist recently and he mentioned that my behavior and mood need to be tracked for a few weeks in order for him to make a more conclusive diagnosis (bipolar vs. depression).

I was tasked to answer a Mood Chart. When I saw it at the doctor's office, it looked simple enough that I didn't ask him about it anymore but when I started, I realized that I don't know how to answer it properly. It requires me to tick the mood which best describes each day:

&gt; High +3

&gt; High +2

&gt; High +1

&gt; Normal Mood

&gt; Low -1

&gt; Low -2

&gt; Low -3

I feel really stupid that I don't know which is the proper level to tick. I would assume that Low -3 feels like someone died, but I'm clueless for -2 and -1. I'm often low energy but I think my low energy days are normal (at least for me). I'm a workaholic and have the habit of desensitizing myself.

I'm worried that I might be downplaying/overplaying. Or there would be a discrepancy because I used a day's level of achievement as a good sign and did not consider my exhaustion and struggle to deliver my work on that day.

Is there an accurate way to answer this without feeling like I'm guessing my mood? Maybe a proper benchmark on what a Normal day should be? Or if it's -1, what should this feel like compared to -2 and -3, and so on?",27Apr2018,2

21,"Today was way better than I anticipated. 

I was told better news regarding my foot than I even thought imaginable. I found out I did not have to get a shot and I did not get a appointment for surgery. I got the go ahead to not wear my boot anymore I work and I now get to wear a very sexy night brace just for sleeping exclusively which looks super attractive with my boyfriend's CPAP mask.

 I am being grateful for my guardian angels looking after me &amp; my prayer warriors (support system). It sounds silly to admit to being spiritual &amp; being a new stand up comedian all in one combo but I do believe in positive energy and I'm ok with any good prayers or energy sent my way. 

I got Cane's Chicken for lunch in celebration &amp; gas in my vehicle and blue raspberry Pop! Rocks for pure feeling of nostalgia. QuikTrip is one of the few things I have an appreciation for here in the City of Fountains area that I haven't experienced in other areas of where I've lived before.

I finally got to work around 12:30 so I had less than half a day. It flew by fast. Today is now officially Friday and tonight I'm going to a comedy club to watch and do research for my next performance. I've also found some great podcasts to help my comedy career like Let's Talk About Sets &amp; Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert. 

Today wasn't super great for free material to use in stand up at work but I thought of my book title for when I'm ready to write one about my life &amp; my journey in comedy. It's a double meaning just like my 2 tattoos. 

My mom also confirmed she wants to come visit and us go to The KC Tattoo Convention in May. I'm stoked. I'm waiting to get my tax refund money to get my next tattoo. I have 2 and want a few more. They all are double meanings and in hiding places on my body that aren't obvious to others unless you pay attention. 

Speaking of that: the ASM that checked me out at QuikTrip had a hidden semicolon tattoo on his finger and I asked him about it. I'm super accurate at spotting those and know the meaning. My next tattoo also has a semicolon design in it. It's a fun Easter egg if it's not too obvious. He said most people don't notice them and I told him why his tattoo meant a lot to me. He was kinda impressed that I spotted it and told him my story about being Bipolar 1 and my Robin Williams inspired tattoo next. He told me to please come back and see him. I will.

22,"Hey guys, I’m pretty new here on reddit. So I don’t know what all the rules are. But nonetheless here’s my situation: 

I have a history of mental health problems ever since I  can remember. I was diagnosed at age 8 with bipolar disorder, OCD, and Tourette’s just a very anxious kid. I was also put on medication at the age of 9 years. Since then, it’s honestly hasn’t been easy. It’s been sort of difficult. (I say “sort of” because everyone has their own battles worse or not.) Medication in all honesty made me slower and it’s absolutely horrible to watch myself deteriorate over time. But unfortunately, it’s gotten worse in the past 3 years. I’ve been manic on and off being suicidal and being admitted to mental hospitals and rehab facilities that are residential for 30-90 days. In the residential rehab I was diagnosed with insomnia, PTSD, and definite signs of borderline personality disorder. When I got out I was ready to face the “real world” and get going on my life. Well, I moved back with my dad and things were going ok. My father and I made some rules of when I stayed there. I had to volunteer, keep my personal care/hygiene taken care of. I was actually making progress in small steps! I was proud of myself and I felt comfortable living with my dad. Until my fathers girlfriend moved in. In the beginning things were really good actually. Like making dinner and going shopping what have you. I slipped into a very dark depression and that’s where things got difficult. I stopped volunteering little by little. A lot of it was very bad stress which I still have. I feel like I have the flu when I’m under stress. *Side note* if you ever look at before pictures of me and present pictures, you would think they were different people. I stopped cleaning my room and I only went out during the day to get fast food because I didn’t want people looking at me and thinking I was disgusting. I also think I have social anxiety too. So as soon as my dad and that...... thing realized my health was deteriorating once more they had a discussion with me. All I can say is that my dads girlfriend is a condescending, controlling narcissistic woman. It was all degrading and invalidation that came out of her mouth. She didn’t even barely let my dad talk! I was so angry that my dad would let this happen again. My dad does have a tendency to date woman like this. My family knows this too. So after that “discussion” I drove to my best friends house crying my eyes out. We hung out for a couple of days and things seemed to be ok then. I drove home to MY HOUSE and there was a bike lock on the front gate to the front door. I was like wow this is happening again. A wave of anxiety came over me. The garage door opened after a few minutes of me frantically texting my friend that I slept over with. I asked my dad calmly why there was a bike lock on the gate. He told me he didn’t know what I was talking about. Then ONCE again we all had a “discussion” about what was going on. I took a video for evidence of the situation. I did that because my dads girlfriend does have a violent history with my dad. Aka she is abusive. I would post it but I’m trying to stay completely anonymous. Trying to reason with her she cut me off telling me insults like: “Your emotions don’t matter.” She then proceeded to tell me that people show other people they love through cleanliness. She yelled get out and I went to my room where I was going to get my personal items to get the hell out of there. When I went into the room that was once mine i tried to grab my stuff only to see her snatch my things throwing them into the pathway to the garage. I drove down again to my friends house to tell her what happened. I’m now staying with her currently. I have researched and read anything on what I could do to find a place to call home. Section 8 takes two years or more to be approved and the waiting list for it is closed for right now. I can’t go to a homeless shelter because of all the stuff I have and plus I’m on medications. Homeless shelters are not safe at all anyways. I texted  and called family members too. They couldn’t take me in and they were never obligated anyways. I even looked into going back to a mental hospital to then be transferred into a permanent supportive living situation but they either had a copay or they didn’t take my insurance. I’m in such a stressful situation and all I’m asking for is advice or tips on anything that comes to mind for you guys. C: I would like to get my life back on track soon because I want to go to medical school to become a veterinarian someday. :3
 I hope this all made sense. I’ve just been very stressed and depressed. It would help if I could relate to some people because I know my best friend is tired of hearing it lol. ♥️♥️",27Apr2018,1

I’ll just be honest; I’ve been trying to get off of my antidepressants. Effexor and Remeron. I went from a regular Remeron dose which for me was 30mg to now 7.5mg as of two weeks ago. I started having extremely relentless and vivid nightmares. Now in the past several days I went from sleep terrors to three hours of sleep tops a night. I understand it’s only been about four days but I went from feeling tired to extremely exhausted and sleeping three hours at the most during a night. I’m also super light headed/dizzy  all day and very nauseated. Force feeding myself a bit here and there. I have called in sick all week and I NEVER call in sick.

54,"I know my girlfriend for 8 years now. Since I know her, she has depressions and difficulties at school, even though she is very smart. She is 26 now and doing her Bachelor’s in the 2nd year,  but having difficulties passing many courses as she sometimes just cannot go to school etc. We tell each other everything, but there is one “problem” that she has that she neither can tell em nor her therapist. She said that it is acutally nothing awful but she just cannot express that problem to anyone. I would have to figure out myself. 

The last couple of weeks and months, I have been doing lots of research with respect to mental problems in general. Even though I hold my PhD in the field of engineering, I somehow feel like holding the same degree in psychology now. However, I seem to fail being a good Sherlock Holmes. But let’s start from the beginning.


**Background:**

My gf has been exposed to sexual harrassment (afaik touched by a man) when she was around 6 years old. Regarding her, she forgot most of the details and does not consider this being a big problem. During her youth she was hit by her father, when not performing well at school, causing a test anxiety. She has been to different schools and boarding schools and somehow managed to graduate from high school at the age of 23. 

In everyday life, she used to be a very social person (she used to use makeup, went out a lot, etc.) but is withdrawing herself more and more, even though we see each other several times a week. There are several characteristics/symptoms that are worth mentioning:

- She ruminates a lot and thinks about all the chances she missed in the past (i.e. “what-if” question) and that she does not manage to get anything done.

- She say that she has self-destructive thoughts; I do not know to what degree. However, she is not suicidal as she is afraid of death.

- She can be very impulsive whenever she is afraid or insecure.

- She drinks and drives, speeds, and uses her mobile phone when being on the highway. (Careless behavior)
- She has issues concentrating herself and is tired most of the time. Whenever she takes Ritalin or alike, she can do some school work, but otherwise she can’t. Ritalin also makes her depressive so she does not take it anymore.
- She has a very poor self-esteem and a poor body image (even though she is a very good looking girl).
- She is generally in a “bad mood” because of her “problem” and is depressed regularly especially after sex (sex life quite normal besides that she feels uncomfortable being totally naked). 
- She has sleep problems. Currently I put her on CBD oil. Now she manages to fall asleep normally. Before she would be awake for hours because of her ""problem"". 


However, there are some more specific issues that are obviously linked to her “problem”:

- She cannot stay over at my place during the night. She managed it once, and had to take an own blanket. I talked with her about this a lot and she keeps on saying that it is related to her “disease/disorder”. She sometimes tries to stay here at night but then gets up around 4-5 am and says that she has to leave right away (even when she drank alcohol). There is no way to stop her then.

- So at one ponit she said that she wanted to go some months abroad working for an NGO and had to share rooms with strangers. I asked her how she is planning to manage that. She replied that she would not have any problem to sleep in the same room/bed with strangers, homosexuals or girls. But she couldn’t do it with her best friend (male) or me. 

- Sometimes she says that her “disease” is taking her over and it would be better for her to be ing a “friendship” for me for just some weeks and then get back to our relationship. Citation: “Nothing would change, we would still love each other but have a friendship for some weeks to make it easier for me.”  (I also read that PTSD could cause or co-cause attachment disorders that would have been a good explanation for this).

All these symptoms look like that she suffers from PTSD, but she said that this is not the case. She obviously has been doing reseach on her own problem to understand herself, and she said it is something very uncommon that explains everything that she does. In my logic, the sexual incident was the trigger for the PTSD, and staying over for example would avoid incident related stimuli (male &amp; heterosexual person whom she trusts). When I explained my thoughts to her, she laughed and said that she was happy that I did not figure out her problem. She even said that her problem is just in her head and did not have any trigger. I doubt it though.


So there are two options:

- She is mistaken by her own diagnosis (self-diagnostics have a high likelihood to be false)

- There is a disorder/disease/whatever that meets the symptoms and also makes totally sense that I have not found yet.

Regarding her, it is very rare. In the country where we are from, she said that there are hardly any clinics that offer treatments. She added that when she filled in some online form of that clinic, they also thought she had eating disorders (as in bulimia). But that is totally not the case: she eats everything. Also she says that she knows her own feelings when she has to leave at night, or needs me-time or alike and that they are not consistent with my PTSD assumptions. 

I am hoping that you guys can help me out. I think it is very important in relationships to understand the other person. She knows everything about me, and understands every step and action that I do. And even though I know her for such a long time, I am sometimes puzzled by her actions and have the human need to understand her. And without knowing the roots of her problem, this can be quite a challenge.  

I also ask her random questions now and then that could help me diagnosing her:

- No, she does not haluscinate (she was very confused about that question)

- No, she does not have chronical pain.

- She thinks that she is old and has nothing achieved for her age, and is afraid to get old (not sure whether this information is useful)


If there are any more questions? Feel free to ask and I will try to answer them.

55,"Well, the title is nothing less than backwards.

First off, I don't know why it checks out that I'm a schizophrenic of sorts. My diagnosis is ""other type of schizophrenia - uninterrupted."" I guess it essentially means they don't quite know what's wrong with me, but they're pretty sure it's schizophrenia for some reason. But what reason?

The only reason I've been given for the diagnosis is restless thinking and disorganized thinking. I see the restless thinking, but the disorganized thought evades me.

Second, I think I know what's causing my symptoms. It's just the inability to feel my old emotions. Of course, I don't know why my emotions are blocked the way they are. That said, I'm depressive, but SSRIs don't fix the lack of emotion, they only make you ""feel good"" in a certain way. There's nothing that fixes the lack of old emotions.

I feel like I'm onto some sort of solution here, but there's nothing I can really grasp. I've tried begging my mind to change. And I really can't imagine another way to ""induce"" my mind to restore my previous way of feeling. I used to feel insanely good, then one day it just stopped.

I'd like to chat about this with someone, but I'm not sure who. I can't just pick a random stranger, and psychotherapy online costs an insane amount to me. I'll probably visit my psychologist/therapist soonish, I guess. My psychiatrist has been hinting towards it.

Maybe get into psychotropics? Probably a bad idea.",27Apr2018,2

63,"First off, sorry if this is rambling and incoherent. I'll try to edit to make it more concise. Right now I just want to get this all down.

I'm from the U.S.

I've never been diagnosed with anything, although I've never seen a mental health professional for long enough that they would give a diagnosis. 

I'm 24 years old. I feel like I've had mild depression for several years, but I've never talked to any professional about it (counselors in college, but I never consistently went). Every now and then I kind of just shut down for a few weeks, usually in the winter months.

 I've never experienced a manic episode, although when these periods of feeling ""down"" end I do sometimes feel like I might be in a hypo-manic state. Constant  ideas, feeling like they're all easily achievable, feeling hyper-motivated, I should learn new skills, start this project/that project etc. Usually wears off in about a week or two.

I *often* think of killing myself. Almost every day. Hanging myself, shooting myself, jumping off of a roof. Whatever. The thing is though I know I definitely don't want to die. I'm in a good enough place that I do know all of these feelings will pass, I've gotten through this before and I will again. I have thought of plans to kill myself though, and these thoughts have persisted for more than 7 days in a row (Honestly, I have them more days than not.)

I also feel like I'm developing anxiety issues. My base level of anxiety throughout the day has increased. I get socially anxious more often. Although, I have plenty of reasonable things to be anxious about, given I'm just starting to build a life for myself. I know that this is relatively normal.

The thing is I almost never feel calm. On a day-to-day basis are most people *actually* feeling calm? I constantly feel like I have racing thoughts in my head. Constantly playing out hypothetical social situations, arguments, revisiting past embarrassments. 
I often find myself in a tense, angry, or anxious mood because I'm thinking about something that I *literally* just imagined.  

I used to use a lot of drugs in college. Mostly psychedelics and weed, but I also got pretty heavily into benzo's at one point. I still smoke weed basically every day. 

I know I should speak to someone. I've not been in a financial situation where this is possible for a while now. I'm getting a raise soon so hopefully that will change things.

I don't know if how I'm feeling is normal. I really feel unstable as fuck sometimes. The thing is though I *do* have valid stresses causing these emotions sometimes. I've been living paycheck-to-paycheck  (which will thankfully change soon). I've been unhappy at my job (which has improved somewhat).

I do have a family history of mental illness. I have an aunt with pretty severe Bi-polar, she's also gone through states of dissociative fugue. I believe her son (my cousin) also had Bi-polar and possibly schizophrenia. 

Once, when I was 16, I was very ill with bronchitis and an extremely high fever. Basically, I went completely insane, started hallucinating and having delusions for ~ 30 minutes. The hallucinations wore off before I got to the doctor. My temperature was measured at 106F. I remember most of everything, including saying and doing things that made absolutely no sense, and since then I've been very afraid of losing my mind.

I work in mental health research. Every day I conduct an hours-long semi-structured interview with our participants. A **LOT** of the questions I ask subjects set off red flags about my own behavior/mental state.

I'm not really sure what the point of my post here is. I know the best advice is to go speak with a professional who can properly assess my situation. I guess I needed to vent my worries.",27Apr2018,1
64,"Was at the doctors today for the second time since my Major Depressive Episode started almost 3 weeks ago, and indeed I was diagnosed with Major Depression following a questionnaire.

The doctor has prescribed me Citalopram (20mg per day) and to be honest I don't know how I feel about taking them, I've read some good stories and some bad ones. The side effects aren't my main concern, nor am I ashamed to take them, my biggest worry is that the make my depression worse as things are hard enough at the minute as it is.

Has anyone on here suffered from 'Major Depression' and used Citalopram to treat it?

Did it work for you? And how long did it take before you noticed any sort of improvement?

What other experiences did you have on it? And any other information you can give me?

65,"I've been seeing him for almost a year now, but I always left the sessions feeling a little dissatisfied. Like he wasn't listening to me. Well, I googled him on a whim, and it turns out he specializes in substance abuse.

I don't have a substance problem

When I went in and did my evaluation or whatever, he must have latched onto the part where I said ""I recently started smoking weed ~5 times per week..."" and forgot to keep listening when I said ""... to self medicate and keep the psychosis from driving me mad and the depression from killing me and the anxiety from turning me into a recluse""

I've been having these issues for *years* before I started smoking. I only started because I turned 21 in a recreational state...

I guess I just went into it thinking that I could deal with my problems instead of focusing on the one piece of the puzzle that helps me feel better

Also I can't ask for a new therapist because of the aforementioned anxiety. Guess I'll find a new practice, probably an hour away or more &gt;.&lt;",27Apr2018,10
66,"I'm not a therapist and I'm not trained or qualified to give this advice. What I am, is human and I suffer from rare but very severe depressive episodes. I'd like to share my experiences and give some ideas which you might find helpful.

You only get this life, even if you believe in, or especially if you believe in reincarnation, you want to experience the entirety of it. Trust me. Plenty of time for the other side, later.

What do you get when you're dead? You'll see soon enough. Maybe nothing, maybe something... you're alive so you can't know. Guess what though, you will die eventually and then you'll have that answer but, if you die *now* you **won't have any** of the infinite **answers** you may have experienced from this moment until you pass away so what's the damn hurry?

Yes, **depression is the** **fucking worst**. If you do not have depression, imagine the worst possible life you could be living... for someone with depression, that is how they **feel** and how **their reality** is perceived by them and **how you view your reality is your reality**. If you're truly depressed, you want out but I urge you to consider living.

Depression is a **physiological** problem and a **social** and **personal** mental state. There are chemicals that need to be in just the right places but you also need to be in the right place. I know, being depressed, you don't see any options because everything just screams out to you, ""this is madness, the world is fucking horrible, why do we do this, why am I here, etc.""

Take a step back though. **Sit down, breathe, relax**.

What is it you're upset about, right now? Maybe you just lost your job? Maybe you just split from someone for whom you had great *attachment* or you lost a loved one to death, you made a horrible mistake which might cause you legal or financial issues... whatever that one main thing is, just work on that.

Imagine a time before that was a problem. What were you doing then? Can you do that again?

Imagine a time in the distant future when you can't even remember this whole event. Think back from that point in the future and try to imagine what you did to solve this problem. **Do that**.

**Do anything** you think might help solve that problem which doesn't involve you taking your own life.

A lot of what I feel when I'm having a severe depressive episode is actually my lack of control of any situation and feeling helpless, which paralyzes me from any action.

All you need to do is act and you will begin feeling better, I hope.

Take up **meditation** as well. This is very important. There is a reason everyone is talking about meditation all the time. It works. Be mindful of yourself, your thoughts, try to watch yourself from outside yourself. Be aware of the present and realize the **past is out of your control, as is the future**. Right now is your playground, the present moment. Why not play!

I hope this finds someone who needs it. Good luck, **you are absolutely crucial** to the survival of the universe and no matter what is happening in your mind right now, it's okay.

Sometimes I have phases where my thoughts, speech, and movement are either heavily slowed, stutter, or freeze. (Typing this is taking a while.) I’m aware that I’m frozen but not able to do anything about it. Even my thoughts will halt or stutter.

This seems very strange to me. I’m wondering if anyone else experiences this?

72,"I don’t know if I have it full on, but I am insanely insecure about my body. But the thing is I am very well aware of how I’m perceived by others which is that many people would find me pretty/cute/hot. I’ve hooked up with attractive guys previously 

But none of that makes a difference in how I feel about my appearance. I think I’m super ugly, and I’ve actually bawled my eyes out a couple of times after looking in the mirror because I HATE the way I look

I hate my face the most. I feel like my eyes are boring and too big. My nose is huge. And I feel like I have a Leno or Reese Witherspoon chin except Reese Witherspoon is gorgeous unlike me. I feel like I’m so painfully bland looking. It’s like as time goes by, I gain a new insecurity about my body. Insecurities I’ve never had before. Now, I’ve started to become self-conscious about my lips because I feel like they’re too thin

I didn’t really have issues with my body especially as a teenager. I’m constantly told that I have a body many women would love to have, and my body type (long and slender) is pretty overpresented in the media. But over the past few years I’ve come to be massively insecure about it too

Like in high school, I had small boobs. And that never bothered me. In fact, I preferred it that way. I loved it. Then as I grew older, my boobs apparently became bigger though I never noticed it, but guys noticed. And I’d get compliments about them since they apparently were “big” for my very slender frame. But those compliments have now become a source of my insecurity about my breasts because I’ve become even thinner due to unintentional weight loss (probably because of meds I take for depression and anxiety as well as a loss of appetite from poor mental health and poor eating and sleeping habits; btw I don’t have an eating disorder; I’m actually trying to gain weight). As a result of the weight loss, my breasts became smaller, and now I feel like I’m just uglier. I rarely used push-up bras before, but now I rely on them. And it makes me feel fake as fuck be sure I feel like I’m deceiving people about my appearance. I fear that if I rely on them a lot and attract guys, they’ll think I’m fake once they see me naked and see that my breasts are B-cup, not C/D cup.

Before, my body could at least make up for being facially ugly, but now I feel like I have nothing. Even my legs which I get compliments on are a source of my insecurity because I feel like they look like long fucking twigs 

Who would find someone who has a bony face with a huge nose and chin, no breasts, small ass, and long twig legs attractive? I feel like guys look at me and think “Yeah I can’t have sex with her. I’d be afraid to break her in half”. I feel like I look an awkward beanpole

Oh and my longest running insecurity has been my height. I DESPISE it with such a passion. I’m 5’7, and I would kill to be 5’10. I know my height is a few inches taller than the average female height in North America, but 5’7 isn’t even tall. It’s just tall-ish. And I feel so inferior and like a fucking failure that I’m not actually tall tall. I get so jealous of girls who are taller than me. Even on the rare ocassion that I feel alright about how I look, all that goes out the window when I see beautiful girls who are tall and thin with actual long legs. I also feel fake when people tell me I have nice legs. It just looks that way because I’m slender, and it fools people into thinking that I’m 5’10. I guess I should be glad that I at least can pull off being deceptively tall?

I know what I said sounds so stupid and irrational. I KNOW. But I can’t help it. It wouldn’t matter to me if every person in the world said I was pretty. I think anyone who says I’m hot is either lying to just sleep with me or they have poor judgment/bad taste/low standards 

It also irks me when people think that I feel this way to fish for compliments because they think someone who can be conventionally attractive can’t have mental health issues and insecurities. I don’t fish for compliments because they do jack shit for me. They don’t validate me. If they do, it lasts for like a second. And compliments have no value if they aren’t organic. If you have to fish for them, it’s fake. Even compliments from very hot guys never validated me. Sleeping with them didn’t either 

I always just felt like they probably didn’t even find me hot. They just needed someone to fuck so they did their usual fuckboy thing and said whatever to get into my pants or just wanted to sleep with me because they liked my body. It’s not a compliment to be seen as a pair of legs to fuck or hit up when you’re horny. They probably were like, “She’s got an ugly face but those legs are hot so might as well hit her up since I’m horny”

It’s just so mentally exhausting and torturous to feel this way because I can’t ever EVER step out of the house without being on high alert. I can notice anyone who looks at me or looked at my body. My eyes are constantly searching. Like today, I’m wearing a short dress with bare legs. I saw many people look at me, and their eyes went to my legs. And I just felt so embarrassed because I feel like they thought, “Jesus Christ this girl is so skinny. Ew. Her legs look like stilts. There’s thin but this is too thin. Eat a burger. She has the body of a pre-pubescent girl”

And you know what’s even more fucked up? Despite being self-conscious, I wear clothes that are revealing. When I go out with friends, I wear short dresses with heels that elongate my legs even more. I wear crop tops and shorts. I wear short skirts. I wear short tight dresses. I must be a masochist. 

It’s funny how people think I’m so confident. People tell me that. They’ll be shocked to know this is what goes on in my head. I’m an aspiring actress so I guess the fact that people think I’m confident makes me think I have some acting talent 😏. Btw, I don’t know why people think this because I’m just being myself. I don’t pretend to be confident. I actually feel like people can tell right away I’m awkward, anxious, insecure, and neurotic 

And I know that my insecurity stems from the fact that I’m unhappy with my life. I’m a failure for my age and potential. If I was successful, I know at least half of this insane bullshit will go away. 

I apologize for how long this post is, but I just had to vent because people looking at me today made me anxious 😓

73,"So I sometimes have this super intense dejavu. But instead of just feeling that I’ve done something. I feel a connected feeling to something larger. For you all who have tried psychedelics, it’s the feeling of an external interconnectedness, along with the feeling that i was there before death and will return after death. These moments only last 5 seconds and I completely lose the understanding of what I experienced afterward. They also sometimes present themselves as dejavu about dejavu. 

Should I be worried about, sorry about the spelling but, schizophrenia, oh wait I spelled it right lol. Also this has been happening to me since I was a child. My use in psychedelics in the past year hasn’t seemed to increase this at all.

One more thing, there is always clear images I see that trigger them. Though the triggers are 99% of the time different there were two times where I had this stopped at the same traffic light.  

Somethings that have triggered this: Wish you were hear album cover (this happened about 3 seconds before writing this post), oceans in minecraft, walking down or up my stairs (this is the most consistent trigger probably like once a month I’ll have the dejavu going up or down my stairs). There are many more, as I think this occurs just like normal dejavu but is just a bit different.",27Apr2018,3
74,"Hello, 

I'm sorry if at times I waffle but thank you for reading. I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety depression disorder in 2015 by a Psychiatrist with a history of self-harm and severe substance abuse but have been dealing with mental health issues since I was 15 years old. I'm based in the UK. 

I am close to suicide. I am 100% sure I also have Borderline Personality disorder as well as I fit every symptom on the 
scale. I can self-harm and it supresses me suicidal thoughts but recently self-harming isnt enough.  
I spoken to my GP a few months ago who is the clinical lead for mental health services in my hometown. She refered me to the community mental health team for assessment. They then completely downplayed everything I told them in my assessment and told my GP I wasn't a risk of suicide or self-harm despite mentioning I can't keep myself safe in the appointment. I felt disheartened with the appointment and went home and self-harmed. 

I was then referred to CBT. 5 months on I am still waiting. The woman from CBT had to ask her manager if they would accept me because she said my needs were too complex.

Roughly 2 Weeks after the CMHT appointment I was walking up a busy road and had to fight myself from throwing myself in traffic. I rang the first response service (NHS recommend them in a crisis) who said they can't do anything other than offer me to haven which is a safehaven service run by volunteers. I told them I can't do this as I can't handle other people and social situations when I am feeling suicidal. I should of been assessed by a medical professional. He said there is nothing he can do. I went home and self-harmed. 

Weeks later I was on the phone to my uni about missed deadlines and my tutor rang an ambulance for me because she was scared. I was on the phone to her cutting my arms. I got to the hospital 
spoke to an incredibly unhelpful mental health nurse. She let me go basically despite me telling her im building up to suicide
and i can't keep myself safe. I pretty much begged to be put somewhere for the night but she said theres nothing she can do.  I later found that she wrote in her report that it seemed like i was competing with my dad and ignored everything I had said to her, 
(my dad tried to commit suicide and was restrained under the mental health act for many months) I have gone back to my GP
to tell her I can't cope and feel I should be assessed for BPD. She was incredibly dissmisive and said she would refer me
to CMHT but doubt they would see me. I'm just lost what to do now, i feel i have been neglected. My mood can go from happy to suicidal in a matter of seconds and i dont trust myself but i dont think the NHS take me seriously.. Would it be worth taking legal action? I have complained through PALS which is the NHS complaint procedure but to no avail.

75,"Title mostly says it all. My dreams center around going to law school and actually wielding some sort of power to change lives, for the better hopefully. But in that dream, I always have a person beside me, a person who makes conquering the world worth it. I really do want to go to law school and be the first in my family to make something of myself. But I don't have any drive on my own. I've always felt that I work many times harder for people that I care about than I do for myself. And that doesn't really sound healthy, but I don't know how to change that. To be honest, most of my dreams, even my short term ones include finding a partner, but I have no idea on how to go about doing that either. I live in a small rural community and I'm not financially independent enough to go on dates in my opinion. I guess this post turned from my dreams to my loneliness and I don't really expect anyone to derive any meaning out of this anymore but I guess I needed an outlet for my brain. If, by chance, you have found anything resembling a point in this post then please, any help or advice is appreciated.",27Apr2018,3
76,"I'm currently a 17-year-old male residing in North Carolina. I have an appointment scheduled in four days with a therapist. I've been suicidal for the past week and a half. I want to be upfront as possible with him, however if at all possible, I would like to avoid hospitalization. Is there anything I should avoid saying in order to maintain confidentiality between he and I and avoid hospitalization?",27Apr2018,3

81,"I am trying to figure out how to better manage my mental health. 

I am dealing with a lot of layers of trauma which my therapist is emphatic about. I am grieving the sudden loss of my husband. And I am not doing well. 

I am on Zoloft but it's mostly making me number. Prescribed by my gp. 

My therapist gave me the project of getting in touch with my emotions and how my body feels. 

Upshot: both are shitty. I am chronically ill so hey I am in chronic pain all the time. And emotionally I wish I were dead. And I don't want the meds I had before for either which turned me into a zombie who couldn't hold a job. 

I can either go back to pain management or psychiatry (I only have the spoons for one at a time). I'm not sure which one is easier or more likely to help but I don't want to either dissociate or feel like death every day. ",27Apr2018,1

85,"Recently over the past 4 or 5 months almost daily I feel really weary and I can feel my heart rate go up and it'll stay like that for hours until I go back to my house or around my best friend's house. Some times I will get it in my own home where I feel like shit and my heart just goes for no reason, its recently gotten worse and more noticeable. Any ideas of what's going on with me and how to stop it? ",27Apr2018,1
86,"So basically I haven't been able to do sports for almost a year and a half \(Im 14\) because of an injury. My knee stopped hurting as much, but my entire legs especially my shins and ankles hurt when I run now. I guess this is fine but I am kind overweight \(Maybe 5 pounds\). I feel really lonely. I never really feel happy, like I'm mostly feeling numb all the time \(With some occasional sadness\). idk maybe I'm just overeacting",27Apr2018,1
