0,"Hello,

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2010. Ever since, I've been taking medication for it. I take my medication daily since 2010 and I do consider myself in recovery.

However, lately, I've been experiencing a lot of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts mainly due to the fact that I am single and have never been in a relationship. I am getting older and I am afraid that I'll never have a family and children. But aside from that, my life is going very well. I work, I am in graduate school, I have friends, I have good links with my family, I am considered successful and I'm passionnate about the things I do. I am functionning but I feel very depressed and I've been trying to manage the symptoms on my own since last summer. 

I am going to call my psychiatrist tomorrow because I see that my feelings aren't going away, instead, they are getting worse. Is it possible that my body has gotten used to my medication and therefore, the effects of the medication aren't as good anymore? Has anyone experienced this?",11Jan2018,2
1,"Hey

4 days from now I was going to achieve my dream. A dream that I've worked so hard for, spent much time doing and invested money from both my parents and myself. Now, I found out that this dream of mine is postponed or canceled. Possibly forever, because of my own doing. I feel so lost, useless and a disappointment to myself and my family. I feel like I have let them down by not achieving anything in life and not being able to follow my dream. I hate myself more than anything.

2,"I just don't seem to care anymore. I'm not saying that I don't care about my life or the world. I don't feel depressed inside, at least I don't think. I just don't care about things. I've let my room get to a complete mess as a reflection of my mental state. I do take showers once a day along with a one a day brushing of teeth + mouthwash but I could be doing better. I haven't studied to prepare for a course I'm retaking in college since my finals in November. I am spending too much money on my credit cards not even caring how big they get. I got laid off of my job because they told me they'd work with my schedule then after the holidays they kicked me to the curb. I don't feel sad or depressed or anything, I just feel numb. It's very strange and I don't know why. I sleep a lot too. Could this be a different kind of depression than I used to get or maybe a mental disease/disorder I could have? What do you think?",11Jan2018,6
3," 
I am so confused guys.
So, basically my story with HOPEFULLY Suicide-OCD began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific.
Here is what happens.
After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific: 
Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows:
It is triggered randomly.
This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

Yesterday I was relatively fine until some random guy told me that this is not OCD and i will start attempting it soon.

So basically, today I woke up I had thought like 'I want to die, it is pointless and i am overwhelmed' a knot in the stomach came and i start obsessing if it is ocd or not. The scariest thing is that it feels like an urge. It is terrifying. It lasts for the whole day now. I am now my bed tried to calm myself. Tried to fell asleep, I calmed a bit then those thoughts feel like bombarding me 'I want to do it. Etc' and it felt like an urge. I can't tell if this is me or the OCD. The knot in the stomach is still there. 
My mother went to my bed and wake me up while hugging me. When this happened the thoughts got more intense and the knot in the stomach too. I just measured my heartrate it is 127BPM. Guys. 

1. So basically about the thoughts, I never fantasie about it, never indulge into the thoughts, but they feel real, like an urge. Can anyone relate? (The urge can happen anywhere, doesn't matter if it is near danger objects or not.
2. When for example my dad starts arguing with me the thoughts appear, does that mean I am actually suicidal?
3. ""Background"" thoughts and thinking about this topic even when I am fine. Another thing, when I am fine I get like butterflies in the stomach. Is this post-anxiety ?
4. When someone asks me if i think about it consiously, I answer no, then a feeling like I am/was thinking about it conciously appear. What does that mean?
5. Terrifying feeling between life and death, even when I am fine and when I am fine I got moments when I imagine the whole 5 months with this 'suicide thing' and I freakout like 'Am I thinking about this and undervaluating my life?' And like a feeling like i do.
6. When the anxiety us high up when someone asks me(or I ask myself) if i want to die I can't give an answer which is terrifying and the anxiety raises even more. Was I really suicidal in this moment?
7. This happens randomly and lasts from secs to hours. Like somehow life losts some of its value(not the depression 'not worth living' thing.) More like a scary feeling which tells me the barier between suicide and me has fallen. Which is even more terrifying. What the ###$?
8. When the anxiety is high i get that life is pointless feeling without any logic just a feeling with a like 'future imagination wave' which happens very fast idk.
9. When the anxiety is high I get a feeling like trapped in life?!?! Which makes the thoughts even more ######6 real? Is this a side-effect from the anxiety?
10. Existential intrusive thoughts like 'what is the point of working when I can...' etc.

So I basically chatted with a therapist and she told me it is OCD. now a feeling like 'it doesnt matter what she said i want it appear' and the knot in the stomach appeared and again the scary feeling.
And as i was writing this I just imagined going to the therapist. And then my head continiued like 'he says it is ocd but i say it is not and i want it' and it feels like i do. ###$ what is this do i really want it.
Tell me this is ocd please.",11Jan2018,5
4,"Hey All,

I'm a 21 year old student who withdrew from university last year due to failing grades from heavy pot and alcohol addictions. I had started drinking and smoking with friends freshman year, but soon turned into a complete recluse who needed to be crossed from waking up till going to sleep. I would stay in my room all day long completely ignoring my studies. People who saw my life were shocked and disgusted, so I started compulsively lying about these addictions and my grades. I was lying to everyone around me--friends, family, people I met--to ignore the fact that I was plummeting socially and academically.

All these lies made it impossible for people to get close to me, and as I became more and more alone I ended up using more and more drugs and alcohol to cope with the depression of failing school and the guilt of deceiving all these people who cared about me.
This cycle of intoxication, lying, and loneliness was paralyzing. My self-esteem was destroyed, and I dropped out of school.

Last December I finally told my close friends and family the reality of my situation--there was horror and disappointment but everyone was fully supportive. Not being alone anymore is indescribable.

Since coming back home, I've quit all my addictions (4 weeks and counting!). For reference, I was smoking an eighth of pot and a pack of cigs every day, drinking two handles a week. Also started No PMO last week. My main focus is being clean of these substances and getting on track to reapply to university.

Despite my issues, I've always valued willpower more than seeking professional therapy. I think I'm pretty honest with myself now and don't think a psychiatrist can help with anything other than having someone to talk to--but then, I have my friends and family now.
Yet I still find myself constantly in the midst of mood swings and almost unbearable stress at the thought of working my way back to school, which entails working through all my old classes again and trying to get a job in the industry. I don't think I'm still depressed but the constant lethargy in my day-to-day routine makes me question that assessment.

I'm here to both share my story and to ask for advice ways I can reprogram my thoughts to be productive again. I'm turning to exercise (yoga, walks, weights) when I feel super stressed out, but that isn't helping me persevere in working hard on my academics.
Moreover, to be readmitted to school I'm going to have to prove my recovery from drugs and depression. I feel strong enough to not go to AA, rehab, or a psychiatrist; but without these third-party sources, how can I show that I won't fall back down this hole once I'm in school again?

Any thoughts or recommendations would be a lifeline right now. Thanks for reading fam.

Cheers,

Another in Distress

6,Ever since i’ve been home from college I have been crying and over emotional over little things all the time. It’s my first year of college and being home this break is killing me mentally for some reason. I guess i.t may be because some family problems that come back to haunt me when i’m home and being by myself more often than I was at college. I️ feel like my thoughts are eating away at me. Nothing feels the same as it did before I left. How can I stop my overthinking?  Is this normal to feel when you come home from college?,11Jan2018,4

10,"So to start, I've been bullied and ostracized by people. This led me to have the mindset thay everyone is against me. Just today I had my depression worsen due to this. It was until I went to martial arts (for the first time... this style) I felt as though the people where labelling me. I thought that I was being a privileged person and they where judging me because of that and my skin color. Today as well I made a new friend but i was depressed and couldn't stop thinking how I am bad at socializing. 

My question is, how did you combat this?",11Jan2018,3
11,"Let me first say, mental illness runs rampant in my family. Both my parents suffered from depression and my mother was a paranoid schizophrenic.   

With that said, I don't know what is going on with me. I have a family of four kids and wife, who I love dearly, but they seem to be my only purpose.  I often fear dying before they grow up, but am completely OK with death after that.  I have problems relating any empathy for my wife, which has caused issues in our marriage. Emotionally, I am just vacant it seems for the most part. 

 Now, on the other hand, I am 34 and have very few memories of my childhood. I do remember it was abusive and not a good situation at all. I had multiple suicide attempts, became a junkie and everything. I cleaned up at the age of 22, been sober since and no suicide attempts. However, here lately I find myself remembering more and more of my childhood - except it doesn't feel like I'm remembering it. It's like I'm playing back an episode of a show with just parts of it. It's faded and jumbled, but everytime it leaves me feeling completely and totally sad. Like something has been ripped from me.  
  
 I played video games growing up, a lot of snes and genesis stuff. Sometimes I'll se a YouTube video with box art from a game and I get that feeling all over again. I'll remember something,  something that I can't quite put my finger on, but I'm left just wanting to cry and then die.

 And finally, I often carry entire conversations on with myself. Not just small inner monologues, but entire conversations. Any conversation I have with my wife, I try to plan it ahead and I rehearse it in my head. She says we have conversations that I have no memory of also - which baffles me. 

So, does anyone have any clue what is going on with me ? Is this normal ? Am I showing signs of what my parents suffered through?  I have always been worried that eventually I would demonstrate schizophrenic symptoms,  so I have tried to keep an eye out for them, but here lately, everything seems to be spiraling out of control. I don't dare tell my wife, as she has enough to worry about.  Need help.  Please..

I get mad, beyond angry... uncontrollable anger. I've been seeking council the past year about this and other issues that feel are controlling my life, end all I'm ""codependent"" have not been diagnosed as depressed. Anyway... Its really hard to do some of the advice (walk away, go for a walk, meditate) as in most my occurrences are explosive if I'm triggered. 

Lately, I've been getting these out of body experiences during these outbreaks. Is this part of the process of understanding my wrong doings? Or just some imaginative things going on? I tried some googling, found a similar yahoo post from someone yearsssss ago, but nothing else.
ex:
I tried walking away earlier from an argument at my home with my S.O., but they followed not giving me space and I exploded on them yelling and screaming, eventually finding an empty room to lock myself in. I paced for a few moments at this time I started feeling this experience of outer body: Where I felt hesitant to pick up an air can. Instantly it was in my hands and thrown at a wall causing damage... then just standing there in utter silence back in my body... staring at the hole in the wall.

16,"I am 31 and realize that the life that I thought I would have will not be. For instance, the men that I like do not seem to be attracted to me. I don't meet any men where there is mutual attraction. I tried to be a bit more outgoing and I reached out to men on a dating site and no one is really responding back to me. Men rarely ever approach me outside. The men that I talk to online only sexualize me.

I want to get into entertainment (modeling, writing, reporting) but I keep getting rejected. I have not pushed the entertainment part enough but the attempts that I have made have all resulted in rejection. I can't understand why it's so hard to get into commercial modeling when I feel that I have a not bad looking face and I see other commercial models who I feel are just ok looking.

It frustrates me even more when I see just ok looking women with such handsome boyfriends and husbands and I can't understand why that can't be me.

I am a parent of a soon to be 13 year old and I realize that she is my main job, and the only thing that I can do kind of right is just earn and save money for us and be a good mom.

It saddens me to know that I will most likely be alone. I am getting older and will be less noticeable to men and the chances of me being passed over for younger professionals for whichever field I choose to get into increases. I should be well into my career right now but my temp job of 2 years ended two weeks ago and I am looking for a permanent position but I'm only finding part time positions. I'm just stuck. On top of that the jobs that I would like to do require me to possibly publically speak and attend meetings but I deal with anxiety (which has been under great control for 2 years but I don't know how a more demanding job will affect this).

I am trying to block out thoughts of dating and thoughts of being in the entertainment industry but I just don't know how to do that without feeling bitter. I don't want to feel envious of couples and those working in the entertainment industry.

It's like all of my life I'm inches away from being great. I hate it but I want to be able to accept my life as it is.

It's almost as if I fell partially asleep. I will sometimes begin slapping, or hitting myself and sometimes repetitively hitting my bed when feeling overwhelmed and then coming back to reality after a minutes.

20,"I don't want to go through the whole story but in short my ex broke up with me in a very mean way and just blocked me out of her life without granting me closure a little more than a year ago. I just fought through it and eventually was okay again until recently she contacted me and asked if we could talk and deal with it, remove any negativity. I thought i could finally get the closure i wanted for a year and agreed. It turned out to be her telling me how happy she is with her new guy and life and stuff like that. Obviously i was a little shook and instead of giving me a little time to process all the stuff she said and then talking properly she sent me a one liner stating it was a mistake and saying bye.

I tried to reach out to her and asked her to talk again like adults and deal with this once and for all and to end it on a positive note for both of us. This only resulted in being blocked without a word.

Now im struggling to get over this again. Random images of our relationship pop up in my head, anger, disbelieve how someone can be so cold hearted, sadness, desperation. Every free minute these thoughts and memories are on my mind. I fall asleep with them and i wake up to them. They're staggering me, Im unmotivated, i can't think straight or focus on important things. These thoughts are taking over my mind whenever they get the chance to.

I need advice on how to deal with this? How can i get control over my mind back? How can I get closure when she's not willing to grant me that.

21,"First off some context, for the stories sake my friend will be named Lily.

A week or three before Christmas Lily attempted suicide twice, causing her relationship to break up. About three weeks ago she got home again. All the while I've been supporting her, including trying to come up with things to do.

Last weekend we went out for drinking and she got called that she needs to come home. We texted a bit after she got home and she mentioned that ""if her parents go on, she will attempt it for a third time"".

As a result I haven't slept that well from saturday to sunday. Turns out she didn't feel well either. Went for a visit, we went out to get food she wanted and went back.

I'll be honest about it, I said things that weren't that smart to say, Sunday and Tuesday. Two years back I had a major crush on her, got declined and we went on as friends.

In the past I had problems with anxiety, which seems to be triggering now as well. The reason why it is happening is because I can feel that something is off. She used to reply rather quickly on texts, but now she reads the texts and leaves them unanswered. She does reply to other WhatsApp groups.

Now because of all that happened, I seriously suspect she has a disorder like borderline. Thing is, because of all what happened in the last weeks I feel like I can't talk about this to her. 

Now I know what is wrong, but I just have some trouble to let this just 'go'. This isn't even the complete story, since there are so many aspects to it.

I will think vividly about doing something,  and then I'd be convinced that I jad actually done it until I'm faced with obvious evidence that I didn't (for example, one sleepy morning I could have sworn i put the leftovers of my breakfast up. Like, I was 100% sure. But when I got home, the bowl had been licked clean by my dog) and I don't know how often that happens, but I'm always really confused when it happens. I'll imagine conversations or interactions so clearly i can't figure out if I did it or not. been having dissociation episodes, too.

25,"My mum has suffered from severe depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. Due to a series of distressing events that were centred around her and took place during my early years of childhood, she has deteriorated at a rate I’ve never seen before. She’s tried to get help through the NHS but finds it very frustrating and unhelpful. She used to be covered on my Dads private medical insurance when they were married, but was taken off the policy after the divorce. 

I’m not a mental health professional by any means but it’s my belief that she has a few conditions that have gone undiagnosed (I’ve researched it to death), therefore I’d like her to see a private doctor as we’ve got nowhere with the NHS. 

I’ve spoken to close members of my family about the situation and we all agree that getting her sectioned would be a good step, as she frequently tries to commit suicide (probably an average of once every 4-6 months), self harms, drinks to excess, takes copious amount of benzo’s etc(illegally imported from Romania). In one night she can do all of the above in a bid to take her own life. 

She has tried to pursue therapists that she just pays for on the day (unsure of the terminology), but she hasn’t found one that suits her, despite searching for years. One of her main issues is that she feels no one cares about her, and feels dismissed and belittled. 

Due to dealing with all of the above since the age of 5, I myself have had my own mental health struggles, which luckily I seem to have found my way out of now. Using my Dads medical insurance I had access to a very prestigious and established hospital. I just want the same for my Mum so she can lead a normal life and have her demons put to rest. 

While I was an inpatient at said hospital I tried to get them to help me section her, I believe they called it “safe guarding”, but to cut a long story short it ended up blowing up in my face and didn’t help at all. 

Does anyone know what I can do.. simply removing myself from the situation isn’t enough. I don’t want to watch my mum struggle through life anymore, it’s not fair and everyone deserves help. 

Is it worth enquiring about getting her own private insurance plan, and accepting the fact the premiums will be £££ because she has several existing conditions and a messy history? 

If you have had a similar experience or know anything that may help, please let me know.

I explained my situation. My situation being mood swings that last a week once a month. One week I feel very low, very depressed, very distressed, low confidence, suicidal thoughts. Then the other three weeks I would be 'fine'. By that I mean not being in that state. I delved in some self harm the past year on three separate occasions. It comes in waves and I don't precisely know when exactly I felt this but I do know it's been like this for a year and a half. Perhaps more.


Since my appointment with this social worker went well I went back to that lay state. And for a while I can't seem to leave this state. The holidays was both difficult and tedious. I spent more days feeling low than I did feeling high. I can recall spending nights awake with flooded suicidal thoughts. And some days here and there I felt a burst of confidence and felt energetic. I was told that after the holidays I would be contacted and see what help I needed. But I don't want to live like this anymore. I'm getting too impatient. And I don't know what to do.

36,"I have been told I suffer from delusions but at times it feels like the delusions are real. I don't know how to discern between what is a real delusion, like when dealing with the public it seems like I'm seen as someone weird but also suspiciously evasive. The truth is I like people and always wanted to fit in and still do, my dislike of self is strong though and I don't know how to like myself the way confident people do, so I guess confident people see me as an enemy. A doctor would hear me saying this stuff and think I'm delusional but I think that's unfair because whenever I think people like me it turns out they really do hate me.

I just wanted to get this out there for anyone else struggling mentally, if you think something is just a delusion or irrational belief you need to still treat it by introspection as well as calming supplements, there's a big difference between a delusion where someones summoning a Patronus against me and a delusion where people are just hating you because of the way you walk or talk.  For me I would say being gay/bi has been the biggest source of animosity and suspicion from others and delusions and depression involving self-talk. Sometimes it feels like the world hates me and then I think I am actually being too optimistic about my chances of fitting in and being a regular guy rather than being delusional I am actually Polyanna. Ever since I realized I was bi as a teenager I've been treated totally different by people, with trepidation, my friends really disliked me because of who I am and it seems like a large chunk of society really has it out for people like me too.",11Jan2018,2
37,"I am really worried about my husband's mental health and I am not sure that I can stay in our relationship much longer. He has struggled with clinical depression for a long time, but especially over the past 5-6 years. We have been together for 17 years, and married for 10. After some very low points he finally sought treatment for his depression. He has been on Wellbutrin for about a year, I think. During this last year, unfortunately, our relationship has gone from bad to worse. His depression actually has gotten a little better, but it has been replaced with, for lack of a better term, a very persistent and extreme form of anxiety.

Here is where I am struggling to talk to him, our therapist, and our physician. ""Anxiety"" is does not go far enough to describe what happens to my husband during one of these episodes, which can last most of a day sometimes. His speech changes, his posture changes, he get's a little bit of a lisp and becomes irritable, irrational, and he loses much of his short term memory. He'll tell me that I said things that I didn't say or he won't remember something I just said. He becomes a completely different person. Often times, when he is in this state, we will get into an argument and he will spend the next few hours locked in his office crying. I am really worried about his mental health, I am worried about our marriage, and I am worried about him forgetting that the stove is on or some other potentially dangerous behavior.

Again, I have been expressing concerns about this to him, our therapist, and our physician for about a year and have not gotten the traction that is needed for the seriousness of what is going on. This could be connected to his medication, but maybe not. I'm not sure and I'm not qualified to make that decision.

I appreciate your time and any feedback you might have.",11Jan2018,2

43,"Hey, I'm a recently-turned eighteen-year old, male, sorry this is a long post but I am in desperate need of help. About four months ago I took just over a gram of MDMA within the course of five weeks (prior to this I had only taken MDMA four or five times, each only having 120mg-240mg per session). Ever since then I have been dealing with a mass slew of psychological issues and mental disorders (which prior to taking MDMA I have had zero history of - my life was perfect aside from some confidence issues) and the only solution that keeps sliding it's way into my head is suicide. I don't think I'd ever be able to do it but I'm at the end of my tether because my life is now just completely miserable. Here's a detailed explanation of everything I'm dealing with, sorry it's written a bit weirdly, I originally only wrote it for myself to read:

Overall Description - Get anxious about certain things, such as the place where I did MDMA, being on my own, going to places I'm not familiar with, afternoon lighting, a hoodie I was wearing when I had a huge panic attack, a girl I used to really like who I was thinking about when I had that panic attack, and the idea of my mind making more associations. I constantly, obsessively ruminate about all the mental/psychological issues I'm currently dealing with (the anxiety, the associations, the depression caused by these problems). Intrusive thoughts concerning the thought that my mind will make new associations.

Easy Assocations, the Anxiety Surrounding them, and Head Tension/Pressure - Ever since having learned that my originally, inexplicable ""off"" feelings surrounding daylight was a result of my mind having associated daylight with comedown depression, my mind has seemingly been given the power to make associations very easily, however, I would put this down to my problem of over-thinking and over-analysing things, also my potential anxiety disorder and current negative frame of my mind that has been brought about by the anxiety which has made me very depressed that is actually causing these particular ""associations"". It seems that if I feel even slightly weird when thinking about a particular thing it suddenly becomes associated with that weird feeling and I develop a slight anxiety towards it which causes head tension/pressure (I hear this phenomenon is referred to as ""somatisation""). Something I've noticed about these particular associations is that it's not the actual thought that triggers the reaction, it's the thought that reminds me of the feeling my mind associated it with that triggers the reaction, which is why I believe this problem is caused by negative ways of thinking and that my mind is tricking me into believing these associations affect me.

Daylight Association - Whenever the sun is out, specifically during the afternoon, the way it colours everything (making everything look quite orange), brightens things and projects shadows makes me feel really ""off"". The best way I can describe this ""off"" feeling is a combination of slight depression and uneasiness/anxiety. It doesn't make me feel like something bad is going to happen but it makes me feel as if something is wrong. This feeling in itself makes me depressed. I assume this association came from the fact that I would wake up after a night of MDMA use while the sun is shining and the comedown is starting (in which I would feel very depressed - I suppose this ""off"" feeling I get is also a slight bit of worry and anxiety which probably comes from my body anticipating a comedown to start even though I haven't taken any MDMA). After a talk with my therapist, this association may have also stemmed from childhood in which I remember always disliking the afternoon sun as it would make me very anxious because it 
reminded me of times where my Mum would have been drinking at parties (I was very anxious of my Mum when she was drunk, not because I was scared of her, but because she was clearly different and I didn't like this difference) which would obviously start in the afternoon. This anxiety surrounding drunk people would have also come from my grandparents who would drink too, however, over time this anxiety subsided, particularly when my step-father came into my life, who, from my perspective, was someone who could look after me when my Mum was drunk and could not (I vividly remember me telling him this fact one time my Mum was drunk). The fact that this association has reappeared now could maybe be put down to MDMA having brought it out via an underlying anxiety disorder (which I've heard taking MDMA can apparently cause).

Romance Association - Whenever I picture myself in a relationship or liking a girl, or picturing myself physically with a girl I like or picturing the girl I like herself I begin to feel head tension/pressure. This was caused by an anxiety attack I had the day after a night I spent with a girl I really liked, during which I was hit with the thought that I would suddenly start associating said girl with anxiety, which I ended up doing. However, it soon became apparent that this anxiety stemmed to other girls I found myself liking romantically, too. After some time passed the anxiety surrounding girls I liked romantically became head tension/pressure (which is better than full-blown anxiety but it's still bad and interferes with my train of thought), although thinking about the particular girl I spent that night with still causes some anxiety alongside the head tension/pressure.

""Fantasies in my Head"" Association - Typically when I'm not preoccupied and have nothing else to think about or I'm listening to some good music, I tend to imagine myself in stories that I make up in my head (such as an action scene if the music is intense or romance if the music is romantic, etc...). However, due to an ""anxiety spike"" I had whilst thinking about one of these stories, every time I try to think about myself in one of them I get a lot of head tension/pressure. The best way I can describe this feeling and the head tension/pressure is to imagine your brain as a container, whenever you have a thought it appears in the container and starts off small but continues to grow the more you think about it before it's entirely what you're focusing on (at this point you're oblivious to the world and ""zoned out""). Whenever I try to think of one of these stories in my head, it appears in the container that is my brain, starts to grow a bit but eventually ""something"" detects that the thought has appeared and a hole opens up which allows this substance to enter, fill up the rest of my brain, put a heavy weight on that thought, pushing it away, preventing the thought from growing and the story continuing, taking up the rest of my thinking space, distracting me, and causing my brain to feel as if something is causing it to compress in on itself (resulting in the head tension/pressure). I used to use these fantasies that I could make up to empower myself in ways that I couldn't in the real world (this relates to my confidence issue according to my therapist) and now that I'm unable to completely do that I just feel hopeless.

I know I took a lot of MDMA in a short time but I've had very conflicting views from people, some saying I did abuse it and took way too much and others saying I didn't necessarily ""abuse"" it despite the fact I took a lot, so I don't know whether to put this down to MDMA itself or MDMA setting off a chain reaction that caused all of this, either way I am never taking MDMA or any other drug ever again. I would be so thankful if anyone can give me advice, ways to get better and get through this, an attempt at an explanation, anything. I feel as if my life has been ruined and I have no idea what to do, my therapist is good to talk to and give possible explanations (as is evident in the text above) but they aren't actually fixing the problem.",11Jan2018,3

45,"Hi dear r/mentalhealth!

According to what I have known and my search results, the ""recommended/approved"" maximum daily doses of atypical antipsychotics are: aripiprazole (Abilify) 30 mg, asenapine (Saphris) 20 mg, brexpiprazole (Rexulti) 4 mg, cariprazine (Vraylar) 6 mg, clozapine (Clozaril) 900 mg, iloperidone (Fanapt) 24 mg, lurasidone (Latuda) 160 mg, olanzapine (Zyprexa) 20 mg, paliperidone (Invega) 12 mg, quetiapine (Seroquel) 750 mg, risperidone (Risperdal) 16 mg, ziprasidone (Geodon) 200 mg.

46,"Hello,

How does one go about getting a diagnosis in the UK? I've had a few private counsellors, and they all refuse to label my problems.  I've not asked my latest one because I don't want her to feel like I'm being ridiculous.

I'm certain I have PTSD, maybe even Complex PTSD.  I just wanted it labeled so that I can stop denying to myself that I'm struggling.  I keep telling myself it must be nothing if it doesn't have a label (and I know that's not true).

So, in the UK, do I go to my GP or do I need to man up and ask my counsellor if she can label me?

Thanks in advance. ",11Jan2018,1
47,"Hi r/mentalhealth,

I have an issue where I am constantly unhappy in life.  I often get that feeling that ""the grass is greener on the other side"" - feeling unhappy in relationships and wanting to leave, then regretting leaving, or wanting to change career trajectories then regretting it.

This does not seem to be a commitment phobia issue, as I have had long relationships and have also done a lot of years of study in particular areas.  I suspect it has to do with me feeling quite empty/unhappy inside and blaming my current circumstances. 

I can see how pathological this issue is.  I do not know how to fix it.

Does anybody have any suggestions in terms of what type of therapy or approach may help?  I realise you aren't professionals, but I imagine some of you have had similar issues before and may have had therapy to conquer them.

For context, I have had quite a lot of therapy over the years.  I'm in my mid 30s, have been treated for PTSD/Depression/Anxiety/Eating Disorders over a number of years. CBT and DBT were helpful, as long as they occurred in a talk therapy type of context.  

I am undiagnosed, but likely have Asperger's syndrome as well.  As a result, I am very 'fact' based, rather than 'emotion' based (for example, understanding stuff about attachment theory was much more helpful to me in therapy than simply learning skills - I seemed not to be able to 'click' and learn the skills without that link in science/facts).  I mention this as it may impact your suggestions.

Thanks

TL;DR: What type of therapy/approach can help an inner unhappiness, and that feeling that 'the grass is always greener'?  Some context to do with the type of approach that tends to work for me in therapy is spelt out above, but usually fact-based is best.

48,"I've been doing some contemplations over my life and past. I was previously diagnosed with something called Anankastic personality disorder, bipolar, and add, and some other stuff..

I am mostly just curious if there is such an illness that may be described as awareness of persona, and possibly fear of it?

I'm not really sure if I'm afraid of persona, but I have lived in my mind for so long that I can perceive it directly.

Similarly to how mindfulness works for some, but it's not a temporary action that is ""controlled"". My mind is consistently nit-picking at everything. Especially aspects of self identity.

There is some form of perfectionism involved, or there was.


Other things:
I don't believe in time. Though my body seems to have an effective clock. I seem to be consciously unable to ""flow"" with time.

I've been practicing mindfulness and instead of self reflection it seems to be something deeper, that I don't understand and frankly none of the people I've gone to do either.

I've been following Eckart Tolle, and his introduction to the power of now has caused something to happen in me.

To put it without as much complication. I think that my ""mind"" has always been unsatisfied with this physical world because it can see through the facade. This has led me to understanding the meaning of the power of now.
In that I am seeking to destroy ""my"" persona. Let go of the past and be only in the now, without judgement.
This feels real to me. More real than anything ever has.

As I accept the nature of the power of now, it becomes revealed that not only is the power of now the only true living. But, it is the absolute pinnacle of what my obsessiveness has been ""looking"" for.
But, let's take back the current psychological knowhow and instead of saying obsessiveness. I am going to say that it wouldn't make sense for my mind to be seeking the one thing that inherently ""shouldn't"" make sense to the mind.


So, as I practice the method of breathing, which is to focus on the breathing as you go through-out everything in your day. That focus is helping align the awareness to realize directly the mind is a very good liar. So, good in fact it has billions of people fooled into focusing on tomorrow.
I never felt that made sense. At least not for me.
This breathing does this as it aligns you to your body, that which only exists in the now.

I seek destruction of persona. Where does this occur?

Edit: I decided to add this as well...

50,"Hey everyone (sorry for the long post and spelling and if the message is unclear at times)

My father was in a sudden accident yesterday and is a very unstable condition in the hospital. He was swimming in the ocean there was some kind of complication in which he has severely damaged his spinal cord and which brought on a subsequent heart attack. He was taken to hospital where he is in a deteriorating condition and it looks like he will pass away in the coming days. My brother and mother are with him in the hospital, but I am overseas in Germany as I teach English here.

I love my father very much, he is the best person I've ever known and we have had a great relationship these past years. He was probably the closest person ive ever been to. I would much rather anyone else I know pass away rather than him. He is a truly amazing dude.

What is the real shock is that I am not particularly upset about the whole situation? My mum and my brother are going to pieces. But I am managing to stay pretty rational about the sitauation. I am not underestimating the gravity of this situation as I know this is going to have massive consequences for my family and my life also.

I am trying to work out why this is... first and foremost, i have only talked with my family and friends about this so far... i am still overseas and i am thinking that it might not have hit me just yet and that it just might be this surreal situation that i havent really come to terms with. I think this is the most likely explanation, however:

I am somewhat of a paranoid person and have thought through this exact situation many times in my life and have always somewhat braced myself for if this were to happen unexpectedly - maybe I was kind of mentally prepared for this exact scenario?

Also, I tend to have somewhat narcasstic and sociopathic tendencies - mind you I have never been diagnosed or spoken to any professional about this - but I feel I have a lack of empathy for most people (including my family at times). Could this be a contributing factor?

Finally, I see myself as a practical kind of person and i kind of justify it to myself not to get upset about this kind of thing because it is out of my control and there is nothing i can do for my father so there is no point getting stressed out about it?

The whole situation is bizarre, i should be more upset about this than anything that has ever happened but im not even particularly sad... part of me cant even justify going home to see him because i would rather remember him with the good memories and i feel there is nothing positive i can achieve by going there... i think i would just make the situation worse being around my brother and mum... with whom i dont have nearly as good a relationship as i have with my father.... and i dont see any reason to grieve as i can be of more benefit to people around me and myself if i deal with this situation rationally 

i was 10 times more upset a few weeks ago when i got bedbugs! Is this because im a selfish person or because this situation with my father is out of my hands, i have mentally prepared myself for it and/or i havent seen him and it hasnt sunk in just yet?

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. sorry for the long message and spelling mistakes. Thankyou thankyou. xo",11Jan2018,6

I've always had small problems with mental health - minor anxiety and I was diagnosed with some form of executive functioning disorder when I was in grade 6. I don't really know where to go from here - I've never been to therapy, I've never been medicated, and I've never had any official diagnoses. The thought of even going to counseling or seeking out a diagnosis (ADHD and anxiety run in the family) makes me anxious and worried. Everyone I know who has been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, or anxiety always tells me that it's nice to put a name to their experience - but I'm just worried it will make me feel like a failure.

I just want to help her and I truly have no words. Can someone point me in the right direction? The things to say and so?

59,"So, one of the reasons I marked down for seeing a therapist was because of suicidal thoughts/ideation. However, a part of me wonders whether or not I actually have them. I want to die, but because I'm tired of the loneliness and the anxiousness of the future.  I know I won't do anything to hurt myself because I love my family so I've never come up with a plan, and honestly I don't see myself wanting to come up with a plan. I just feel hurt, anxious, and depressed. I want to die so I don't have to feel anything. With that in mind, does that mean I am having suicidal thoughts? I don't want to be appropriating the term from people who really are suicidal (I don't even know if my feelings qualify me as suicidal). I know there are people out there that really do want to hurt themselves and/or have a plan for it. I don't. I just want the pain to stop. Am I suicidal? Every time my therapist asks if me I have had suicidal thoughts, I second-guess myself because I feel like my reasoning for want to die/disappear is not serious enough for me to say yes, so I always deny any suicidal thoughts. Am I even having suicidal thoughts when I am writing reasons/thing I want to just end if I were to die. I just feel like I'm taking away from someone who really needs help, like I'm 
 wrong and I'm over-exaggerating by calling my thoughts suicidal when I'm just really jumping to conclusions. ",11Jan2018,4
