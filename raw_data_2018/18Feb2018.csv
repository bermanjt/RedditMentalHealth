0,"Title. Basically, I've been feeling fucking terrible for a very long time now. I'm diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome, though that doesn't necessarily correlate with my problems. I can't do anything. I feel completely useless. I push every small task away. I push my family, and especially my mother away. She got upset about it, and when she went to sleep I sent her a text explaining how I'm feeling. She came in, hugged me, and asked if I wanted to talk about it tomorrow. I said no. I honestly don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I have people who probably consider me to be their friend, but none of them would want to listen to my shit (like actually trust me on this, none of them are close enough with me to give a shit about it, we're just in the same class and therefore talk daily). I'm just so out of touch with everything, and I'm a spoiled brat. I have so much anger that I just don't seem to be able to get rid off. I have these fucking terrible thoughts about either killing myself, or killing someone else. That's the one thing I decided to not tell my mother, because the last thing I want is to end up in a hospital or anything else like it. So yeah. I confessed to my mother about most of the things I'm dealing with. ",18Feb2018,2
1,"I don't know why but I can't really open up to my therapist or show her any emotion. I always show up with a blunt face and reply to anything she says with a simple yes or no. This also makes it hard for me to make friends. I don't have any friends whatsoever and all my therapist has told me to do so far was to be more enthusiastic and friendly, but I have trouble doing that as well. I really want to change my behaviour so that I can get more friends and maybe even a girlfriend. Any advice would be appreciated.",18Feb2018,1
2,"Hello again. Im 14, Male.

So after posting yesterday, I researched more about Dissociation and i actually have most of the symptoms of it. But i just wanna ask the Public so i can really be certain.

 So yeah most of the time i feel like my thoughts aren't mine, Like im sharing my own thoughts to someone else inside me. And sometimes, Just rarely, I forget myself when i see myself in the Mirror, It doesn't last long and it doesn't happen a lot but it still worries me. And i feel like im inside of myself and someone else is the ""Me"" outside. Im still me but that's the feeling i get. And im always, Always forced to act as a Girl even though im straight. And actually i forget things quite a lot, It might be just from our family but it's still nice to put here just in case. And lastly, I feel like im not myself. That someone else is the real me, Like someone else is my Body and brain and all i am is just the Voice in my head.

These atleast are what im experiencing. Thanks.",18Feb2018,1
3,"Here’s a little background... I’m 18 years old and currently on a journey of achieving good mental health, clarity, and comfort within myself. I have been diagnosed with a few different things, depression, anxiety, bipolar NOS. I feel like Anxiety is the most prominent in my daily life. In a literally sense, it feels like there is a constant shadow being cast over me, preventing me from enjoying myself and others. I am convinced that EVERYONE dislikes me and I know this is because I don’t like myself. My biggest issue is pushing my friends and family away, I have become very secluded besides my boyfriend. I feel very comfortable when I am with him and we hang out with our friends. Unfortunately I jump to the chance of getting drunk or high to be able to actually enjoy the company of others and feel like I am being interesting. It’s an awful habit because I feel like I can’t have or BE fun without it. I notice that I mimic people and their personalities when I am with them, it’s very annoying and difficult to notice while I am doing it. I am not a terribly unhappy person, but I get overwhelmed and sad easily, I am sensitive. To carry on a conversation stresses me out because my mind is so jumbled. I guess I’d really just love to hear from other people who feel this way so I don’t feel so alone. Its difficult for me to open up to the friends I do have. Any tips? ",18Feb2018,3

7,"I’ve probably got a little PTSD brewing from my time in EMS and my childhood, but self diagnosis isn’t recommended especially in pros. 
I can’t calm down, ever. I’ve got deeply engrained habits that are results of trauma. My anxiety is almost always through the roof, coffee only helps a little bit. Yeah, I know, caffeine addiction. Here are some of my habits/quirks

• Being a generally quiet person, but able to go 1-10 really quick in a violent situation 
• Reaching out to touch doors about an arms length away and reaching down to touch handles as I get closer to avoid getting my face slammed. 
• Being extremely jumpy and reactive to touch I wasn’t “prepared” for. 
• Being extremely protective of colleagues and students
• Cannot put my hands in my pockets
• Visually Assessing everyone I come in contact with - students, coworkers, parents. Pupils, expressions, emotional state, drug use signs, breathing sounds, weapons.
• Speedwalk to light jog everywhere, unless an emergency then I run. 
• Physical Violence in my environment amps me up to the point I’m physically and emotionally numbed, and then later I have a massive adrenaline crash. 
• Watching for obstructions should I have to use defensive techniques against a student  

And even when I’m not spewing with anxiety, I’m still doing all of these anxious habits. I know how to calm down, but I can’t tell when I need to take a minute to do so most times. Also, can anyone just talk?  ",18Feb2018,2

9,"I just got a new job working as a call center support agent. The training went great, I did really well on all my tests and ended up 4th in the class. Today we started our first day of “nesting” which basically means we go out on the floor and actually take calls all day, but we still have supervisors around for us to raise our hands if we need help. I thought I could do it. Seems like a pretty easy thing, right?

I walked out. I had a pretty huge panic attack and I walked out on my lunch break..Thankfully my fiancée also works there, so she talked to her supervisor and left with me to take me home. She’s so understanding. But I feel horrible. I feel so dramatic, stupid, and useless. I only made it through half the day on my FIRST day of calls. I feel like at this rate, I’ll never make it anywhere in life. What am I supposed to do if I just quit everything I start? What am I ever going to do if everything makes me anxious to the point where I want to die?

I don’t even know why I thought I would be okay doing this job. I get anxious and have to write out what to say just to make a doctor’s appointment, how did I think I was going to be able to work at a call center? I don’t know, I feel like the most dramatic person in the world. And so weak. I didn’t even try. 

I’m not gonna lie, I’m really hating myself right now and I kind of want to die. Which is also dramatic, but that’s what my brain is telling me to do right now. I don’t think I will, but it sounds really tempting.

Fuck. I don’t know what I’m going to do. What the fuck do I do. I’m dreading telling anyone that I quit my job on the first real day. I’m so fucking weak. 

I don’t really know why I’m posting this. Maybe for advise if anyone has any? Has anyone else gone through something similar? Or maybe just a kind word or two? I think I just needed to vent. Oh, and I’m from the US, the rules say to post what country you’re from so.",18Feb2018,3
10,"Lately people around me are expressing concern about my mental health. Actually this has been going on for some time. I never payed their claims any mind because I knew that I was pretty intelligent. Never able to keep long term friendships but I never have given up knowing I forever to make friends, doesn't hurt me so much. So let's get to the concerns. Been reading the mess out of the new testament lately, going ham so to speak. I became focused on Jesus and helping others which people were initially proud of and still are but people close to me are becoming concerned. I just know God has something special reserved for me or that I'm going to be called to accomplish something. Also a potential problem I noticed years ago but I've come to grips.

12,"So long story short on the traumatic shit. A lot of bad things happened. I got out of the situation. I had a brief few years of being an absolute mess and 'getting over it' on my own where I had (self diagnosed?) PTSD, drug abuse, and severe depression. I slowly got better the longer I was on my own.       
In fact, I got so much better, I was really doing well in life. Everywhere I worked, I was promoted to management for being able to handle stress so well. I didn't show much emotion. I wasn't bottling it up, I truly just wasn't fretting over things and shit hitting the fans was as emotional for me as taking a stroll on a nice day.      
Suddenly I started getting strange physical symptoms. I attributed this to possible anxiety coming back and just ignored it but they got so severe, it felt like death. I would suddenly get very sick, my legs would go paralyzed, and I would lose consciousness. Never in my life had I ever been that scared which concerned me considering what I went through. But doctors couldn't find anything wrong with me. Trust me, I've had all the main tests and I'm in debt from it.   
I'm starting to feel sick almost every day. It's like it's getting worse as the years go on. My anxiety has definitely returned. And now I'm getting daily panic attacks which I know how to control but they are still there.  
After being so proud of myself of getting out of my mess of a situation and doing above and beyond what I imagined, it was a huge blow to my self esteem to have doctors start to think I'm just attention seeking. My brain started to implode and I questioned myself as a mentally stable member of society.   
After seeking a therapist, she told me I show no emotion and if I were able to truly feel that again, I may resolve my health problems. She was concerned that I didn't seem upset when recalling my past even though I told her I had just simply accepted the situation and learned from it.    
It just sucks because if she's right, I think this is conversion disorder. But many people (including doctors) view this as 'faking' so I'm not very welcoming of the possible diagnosis. It's quite the isolating diagnosis and I don't think I could handle the reality that I have it.

14,"I have failed to find help for years and just need someone to read this and share their thoughts.  This is long and I am leaving a LOT out.

I’m a white male from the US in my 30’s.  I’ve still not been formally diagnosed with anything to date.  I seem to have had OCD since I was a child, but was only seen as disruptive and a bad student.  There have been some theories that I am autistic, but if that’s true then I am either “high-functioning” (I do extremely well in my line of work), or just barely on the spectrum, because most people don’t notice anything off about me until they get to know me well.  I have a long history of not being able to effectively communicate with others, and ruining friendships along the way (though I’ve had multiple, caring, long-term relationships.)

I was not previously aware of the OCD myself until seeking help decades later, but it wasn’t until a multitude of significant life events had happened that pushed me to do so.  

When I was graduating college around the turn of the millennium I began to experience serious outward symptoms that started with swelling emotions that were difficult to keep inside.  They were powerful enough that I felt like I would cry out.  These would occur whenever I was watching a film (it didn’t have to be particularly moving), and the music would sweep up and over me.  I had a lot of emotional reaction to “epic” music then.

This lasted a few months until I began to vocalize involuntarily.  It was in a semi-controllable way at first, where it would only happen in the shower, or when I was alone, and usually my mind was idle and not focused on a particular task.  I was able to keep it to myself for some time, but then these symptoms gradually became worse until I could no longer contain “sighs” or other audible sounds. These were generally interpreted as frustration or exhaustion by those around me, and not yet an obvious psychological disorder.

I didn’t seek help for this for about 5 years.  This was during the era that insurance companies were pulling the “preexisting condition” crap on people, and the internet was beginning to show signs of recording and indefinitely storing every detail about people (how far we’ve come since then).  I was terrified of this for a long time, so I chose (mistakenly, I think) to live with this in secret.

I self-medicated with a glass of wine every night for that period of my life.  It suppressed the part of my mind that caused the symptoms and I was able to live in peace for the most part, but obviously this became habitual, and I knew it would do more long-term damage if not checked.  

By my late 20’s I had established myself in my career (I work in the entertainment industry as a creative-type), and felt secure enough to seek help.  I approached my general physician with my problems first.  In hindsight he was a piece of shit.  He put my on Zoloft with the literal excuse “don’t worry, this will make everything better”.  It did at first, because it was the first time I realized I had been living with extreme social anxiety.  I made new friends easier than I ever had, and felt more free than I had before, but my symptoms were still there.  

The Zoloft changed my personality so much that I began making significant mistakes.  I switched from drinking to smoking marijuana because I felt it was healthier and it also suppressed my symptoms.  I became more aggressive in my social behavior, and was more narcissistic to the point that I lost my job.  (I’m not a narcissist under normal circumstances and I was very blind to my behavior).  

I tried to see a therapist around this time, but he blamed me for my problems and offered no help or way forward, so I immediately stopped going.  I retreated into myself then, smoking to an unhealthy extent, and focusing on my work to find another job.  I was fortunate to find one about 6 months later and moved to another state.  Due to shame over my past job, I cut ties with my past co-workers.

When I started my new job I immediately tried to seek help again.  I found a wonderful psychiatrist who monitored my medication and helped with therapy.  I tried so many different medications to reduce my symptoms, easily more than 20, which is probably a low estimate.  By this time I had switched back to drinking to self-medicate, and my original issues were lost under habitual alcohol use.  

Some of the medications made me manic, and I began destroying relationships at my new job.  My original symptoms became worse over time; they seem tied to stress and situations were becoming so stressful that I couldn’t manage anything.  I was removed from my original position at my job and placed on a different team.  My psychiatrist retired, I had switched back to marijuana in desperation to stop the drinking, and my behavior at work was out of control.

It’s worth noting that I sought help multiple times for the substance use, even checking myself into a rehab facility, but their processes were ultimately unhelpful.  I knew the substance use was as symptom itself of attempting to cover up my original symptoms, but things became confused as to what I should “fix” first.

I chose quit my job when confronted by HR for a second time.  I cut my ties with my coworkers a second time, but was so manic and deluded, and feared I had killed my career, that I decided to go into business for myself.  For 5 years I struggled to make ends meet, making less than $15,000 a year (down from a normal salary).  I was now on the maximum dosage of Zoloft and feel like it contributed to a significant loss of inhibition.  I began medicating with more frightening substances such as Kratom and Dextromethorphan in an attempt to “kill” the part of my mind that was causing this.  

My OCD began to make me relive every negative social interaction continuously throughout the day, which in turn exacerbated my vocalizations, making them more Tourettes like.  This wore my partner, by then of 8 years, out, who no longer felt they could trust my behavior and had no energy to help me any further.  My partner sought out another, more stable relationship.  

I have been suicidally depressed since losing that second, good job, my relationship, and several long-term friends who knew nothing about what I was experiencing, weren’t close enough I could open up to, and only saw substance use and mania from me.  After the loss of my partner, my medical insurance went away.  I chose to quit Zoloft by myself two years ago.  I pushed through with the help of alcohol and just pure will.  I wanted to see who I was after 10 years on that medication.

Who I was then was so stressed out that the prior events had left me with severe PTSD.  I now no longer need to think about actual, negative social interactions, as my mind will invent fictional interactions that are emotionally stressful enough to exhibit outward, uncontrollable, unmanageable vocalizations.  I also now have physical ticks that manifest at the same time in the form of full-body convulsions.

I’m currently living with state-funded healthcare (not disability though), and my current psychiatrist and therapist (two separate people), are absolutely terrible.  I’ve seen multiple therapists/psychiatrists since then with a mix of results, but nothing like these people who are over-worked and borderline-irresponsible.  Today I share an office with other independent contractors in my line of work, but I now experience such severe symptoms and mood-swings (which are also new), that it’s been impossible to keep my condition a secret any longer.  Everyone is annoyed by my presence and I feel it’s only a matter of time before the situation will dissolve on its own.  

I’m no longer using any substances to self-medicate; it became trivial to stop after I also quit the Zoloft, but I began taking Zoloft again a week ago because I don’t feel I have a choice.  I have no money, no one to fall back on, and the only reason I’m not homeless is due to the amazing, unearthly kindness of a few people in my community.  This has been a very log way to fall, especially considering that I’ve actively sought help almost the entire way.

The good news, if there is any, is that I do know I’m not experiencing psychosis (have to take the positive wherever you can find it, I guess).  I also never stopped working and managed to make almost 30k last year.  Frighteningly, I still don’t make enough to live off of, but I do now make enough that I’ll be forced to pay for healthcare this year, which will eliminate my budget for living expenses.

That last bit is not as important as just sharing this though.  I want to know what’s wrong with me, if there’s any hope.  How can someone see multiple psychiatric professionals, over the course of over 10 years, and no one has any idea what’s wrong?  I get that people are reluctant to hand out diagnoses, but this is fucking ridiculous.  

If anyone has any input or advice, I would appreciate it.  I have no resources, social or otherwise, to manage this any more.  I just needed to reach out anonymously and rant, and hope to receive some hope.  Thank you for letting me do so.  ",18Feb2018,1

I started seeing someone within weeks of going on antidepressants in like October.

18,"I was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and I know I have problems. However, one of my problems is being non-confrontational and speaking up. I have been seeing my psychologist for about 3 or 4 months now, but I have to make appointments 2 or 3 weeks out, and I really don't feel like we click. Unfortunately I don't really know what I need, or what kind of psychologist (or really even what kind of therapy) is best for me. 

My questions are
1) Is it rude to ask your current psychologist who now knows your personality, to direct you to someone more like you. (I feel silly saying this but I feel very fake when I'm talking to someone who is too squeaky clean as a psychologist. I feel like I need a really down ass motherf***** to be my psychologist i.e. someone who has experimented with drugs and maybe even curses on accident). 

2) Is there any sort of psychology triage (even a match.com-esque site) where someone can evaluate you and tell you what's actually best for you as far as treatment and who you would work best with?

I have been looking at new people in my area, but there are just so many people and it is so hard to peg down someone's approach and personality by a 2 paragraph blurb. The idea of having to sift through all of them and the disappointment of having finally tried to get help and it's just not working (and I feel like the same thing will keep happening) makes me want to suck it up and not go back to therapy at all.

I don't care if a family member has x disorder or if you work with kids you still don't have the experience to diagnose someone. There are too many armchair psychologists running around.",18Feb2018,3
20,"Last December and after a long three months of messed up sleep, anxiety over work and feeling like I'm gradually losing myself I decided to address my complains to my GP. She quickly suggested that I had to take medical leave and stay off work which I did for a month during which I found a therapist, tried to rest and be patient with the feelings of guilt (over leaving my work duties on my colleagues) and depression (for not being able to prevent all this from happening in the first place. A few weeks later, things started to get better, I was able to get some proper sleep, enjoy simple things like a day out with dog and reading a good book. This, is when I stupidly decided I should return to work and try to re-integrate by doing a few hours per week.

During the month of my leave, my director asked me to have bi-weekly meetings and discuss my progress and I agreed to, mainly out of guilt. He even proposed to me a new position within the company, so that the triggers of my anxiety are as limited as possible. Having this pressure (even if he meant well) pushed me into stepping back too soon.

And this is when things got worse. It's been 4 weeks since I returned and even though I am supposed to feel better, I feel worse than I did before. Insomnia is getting back at me but this time, I had a few panic attacks and I'm feeling completely depressed. I know I have to leave my work at some point, but right now, I cannot seem to get the courage to apply for a different job and I'm not even sure I could make a new start anyway. I cannot stay off work as I have very minimal savings, barely to cover the bills for this month. I had to stop my therapy because my insurance won't cover it and I cannot afford it. I am completely horrified to explain my state to my supervisor even though I am legally entitled to up to 100weeks partially paid medical leave. On top of this, I had a few blood tests last week that came up with a thyroid problem I've never had before. I feel like this job makes me sick and that I'm harming myself every time I step in this environment and at the same time I'm so so angry at myself for not being able to cope. I've been through massive depressive episodes before and all the self work I put into it has collapsed.

So I guess my question is, how long does it normally take to recover from a professional burn out? What am I supposed to do now and how am I gonna find the strength to do it?

Anyway, she is beautiful....rather normal intellect, but so strikingly pretty. She's sexy in a way that tiny, pretty girls are, but she is also super stylish, a bit of a diva, but the kind who has tons of friends, is always the center of attention, is everyone's best friend. She's a party girl of sorts...always went on spring break, fit in at clubs. At the same time, she met her boyfriend their first semester of college and have never split up, five years later. He has a degree that got him an oil and gas job. She has two or three of her own little businesses and recently did a wedding planning that looked like it was just incredible. She is also something of an instagram influencer and travel blogger in her city. Each night she is out at some fun place or with all her friends, and her valentine day pictures were perfect. I say all this just to say that she is talented and sharp and also beautiful. 

I'm her same age. Two years older actually. All my life I struggled. My mom died when I was young, I've not had good relationships, in part because of choices I made. I have no prospects, and most days if you put a camera on me, I'd shoot you. I'm never camera ready it seems and when I am, my pics are far from perfect. All this sounds superficial, but it's not that I want what she has....I just see her having a real and adventurous life, and loving her life, and I get up each day, feel overwhelmed and even old, feel tired, don't want to smile, don't love, don't enjoy what I am doing and certainly don't want to show it off. For one last contrast, her Imstagram showed her and her guy at a bar, both looking immaculate as always, not a care in the world, and with all their friends, fresh off a ski trip with many of the same people. Me, I stayed home alone after visiting a friend with cancer, resting after grinding away all week at two jobs I don't enjoy, in a city I don't want to be, with only a few friends, none of whom ever want to go out.

While I want a little taste of what she has, I also don't want to feel like shit about ,self and my life. I STRUGGLE with asking the universe WHY it is that I just don't seem to get it....like I'm defective, or broken. And why this girl, this rather normal, although attractive, girl, isn't. What am I missing? What is wrong with me? And how do I not be resentful or cruel or mean, or unpleasant? Tonight I spent too much time just trying to get my mind around why it is that way, or what she does or is doing that I'm just not. And I find myself onsessed, locked down in my own head, and just lost, unable to solve the riddle.

Can you help? Can you tell me what's wrong with me, or what I can do to clear this out of my head and my life? I worry it is impacting my life in the long term and I just hate it more. I'm so lost...",18Feb2018,6

But no matter how much I improve myself in any field, I just never feel like I have done enough.

Deep inside of me, I know I would only be satisfied by having my name in history books and I know that this is unrealistic, but this idea is shaping my life in an unhealthy way and I don't know how to slow the rhythm.

25,"So a friend in my usual friend group deals with a lot of things.  She  is in/out of medicines and seems to have manic episodes she says etc.  Very dramatic stuff.  I guess my thoughts concerning mental health in general is...solution based?  I'm always like, ""ok, you feel this way.  And it is ok and there is no shame in feeling the way that you feel.  But what can we do about this?  What are our options?  Let's try to catch ourselves when we are going down a bad path and move toward something better.  Yeah that is tough. A lot of the time those bad thoughts or just completely irrational things happen out of nowhere and seemingly automatic.  It feels like we have no control over it.""

And like....maybe that is where my issue is?  Is this the right sub for this?  Like, a part of me always thinks there is always something that we can do to help our situation no matter how we feel.  We can learn to recognize the things that give us difficulties and move forward from there.  Some days may be hard.  A lot of them will.  They will be difficult.  And that is ok.

But said friend said very directly that her brain is broke and she just worries about shit and she tries to deal better with things.  When she thinks about solution it gets her stuck in a cycle she cant get out of.  

To me I'm like...ok so we recognize that his happens.  What can we do to help this then?  Idk, should it be accepted that some people really are just ""broke"" as she put it and just leave it as such.  Are there really no lifestyle changes, medication changes, etc. or ANYTHING that can improve stuff? Just an attitude of hopelessness and resignation to one's issues...is it insensitive that that isn't something that I can accept?  Like I get that feeling but I can't accept that it can be the end for someone in life.  

I think what frustrated me about the situation is that we were talking about worries and I said I know how it feels to worry.  Cause I do. I deal with over-thinking and stuff a lot.  She shut me down and said I don't in the way she does.  Which I suppose is true. I am not her. Idk. I'm a bit frazzled over it.  Eh. Thoughts? Give 'em to me lol.",18Feb2018,1

27,"I’m in the US. 

TL:DR- I want a new therapist but I don’t want to make her feel like a bad therapist... it’s just her style of therapy doesn’t work with me. 

So I have been in therapy for almost three years and I’m on my third therapist. My first therapist... my god was AMAZING. I loved her, she was so helpful. She specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy, and it worked out so well. Every session was so structured and I really felt she was trying to help me understand what was going on and how to fix things. 
She went to work somewhere else, for victims of sexual assault. 

My second therapist was a bit shit, she moved to Alaska. 

My current therapist is sooo annoying, but she is a very sweet woman! (She is a child’s play therapist?) I knew her previously as she was one of the leaders in my IOP group I went to and I didn’t even like her then.  And BAM now she is my therapist. I’ve been seeing her for maybe six months and I hate it!! Every time I try to talk to her about thing she just sits there and stares at me and when I’m done she goes “...ah.. I see..”. There is no level of structure in my sessions and it is driving me crazy. It’s almost like I just sit and ramble for 30 mins. I have problems that I need help with and she isn’t helping me in anyway.  She is never willing to work with my schedule either which is a bit of a hassle at times. 

My last appointment was 1/04/18 and I have been trying so hard to get an appointment scheduled with her for the past month and she finally replies telling me she is booked and cant see me. THEN I get a letter in the mail saying if I don’t get an appointment by the end of the month, my case will be closed. SHE IS THE ONE WHO WROTE THE LETTER. SHE IS THE ONE NOT ANSWERING ANY OF MY CALLS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. WTF.

28,"I didnt know who else to ask but reddit so here it goes. My whole life iv struggled with mental health issues iv never understood. Im always anxious in social situations and my anxiety has always gotten worse because im anxious about becoming anxious so iv gradually gotten more and more depressed about it.

Iv been on anti anxiety medication that hasnt helped, iv been on anti depressants that made me feel even worse and iv never known whats been wrong with me. Iv recently seen bipolar symptoms online and iv ticked pretty much every box from it but im a little scared to go to my doctor again and get put on another type of medication.

Can anyone on bipolar medication tell me if its helped you at all? Have you had any anxiety issues that have gone because of taking them? Iv tried so many things that havnt helped and i feel like im always going to be like this, i just want to know what's wrong with me.",18Feb2018,1
29,"All my life I have been extremely sensitive to other people's emotions, often to the point where if someone else nearby is in pain - physical or emotional - I feel their pain too. I'm also autistic and have been told all my life by various doctors and therapists that what I experience with being a ""emotional sponge"" is impossible, that I have too *little* empathy and inherently see other people as objects due to my autism...which couldn't be further from the truth. My dad has even told me several times when I was younger that I'm a psychopath, although even then I was able to realize that he was having a terrible day, had a headache and a stomachache, and was taking out his frustration on me.  

I was recently diagnosed, after twenty years of being misdiagnosed with bipolar II, with severe major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and OCD. My OCD is primarily Harm-OCD and my rituals involve checking to make sure I haven't hurt myself or my parents/brother. It's so bad I can't drive and until a couple days ago I was a crying mess thinking that everyone and their dog was angry at me.

But not anymore. I'm on my seventh day of 20mgs of Cymbalta. 5 days in, I woke up pretty late and realized I was A) not beating myself up for sleeping late and B) I wasn't worried that my mom/dad/brother had died in their sleep/of suicide (mom is in poor health and dad and brother are both very depressed and dad refuses to seek help and I have no idea how my brother's therapy is going). I was just like ""well, I'm adjusting to this new med and I don't sleep well anyway, of course I'm tired. No big deal."" 

Everything I've read about OCD (another ritual involves research so I don't get blindsided by side effects, so I know a lot about OCD treatment) says that it takes at least 3 months at super high doses of SSRIS/SNRIS to show any effect. To treat depression, it can take up to 6 weeks.  20mgs is the lowest possible dose of Cymbalta, and my mind is already quiet. I'm also pretty much unable to feel pain now, which I hope normalizes into feeling pain at a realistic level.  However, the biggest change is that I no longer mirror the emotional state of everyone around me. 

Is it possible I never had OCD and my main problem has always been uncontrollably mirroring other people's emotions/pain?

30,"Basically, I fucked up a 4mg sertindole withdrawal. I was on 0.5mg lorazepam and 4mg sertindole at the time, and I lowered sertindole by 0.5mg/week, then got hospitalized with high blood pressure/pulse and cold feet/arms.

I didn't stay in the hospital due to stubbornness, and later increased the 1mg (from hospital) of lorazepam to 2.5mg. It stopped helping, as my symptoms just shifted to 1pm instead of being later in the evening, I tried to take lorazepam right before my symptoms started, but that was no longer possible.

I then increased sertindole from 4mg to 8mg, which helped me greatly.

I voluntarily went to the hospital, and they've been giving me 1 halve of sertraline + 1 red pill of bromazepam (benzo) in the mornings, and 1 halve of sertraline + 1 red of bromazepam + 1 yellow fluanxol in the midday. I still take 8mg of sertindole and 2.5mg of lorazepam before bed.

My question is as the title suggests. Is this the correct way to permanently treat an anxiety issue like this? I also note that I don't want to/can't be put on new, stronger anti-psychotics due to having heart palpitations and mostly all of my symptoms being cardiovascular.

32,"I recently made some decisions in the relationship/sex side of my life that were probably not very good and I can't stop thinking about them every single day. Just for background, I made the choice to start hooking up with one of my close friends, then stopped, and then did again despite knowing that it wasn't good for me and a lot of my friends told me not to. I just can't stop wanting to take it all back and this whole situation I'm in made me confront a lot of issues about myself that I want to change but have no idea how. 

My first problem is that I overanalyze everything and think about things people say or do and blow them way out of proportion until the smallest thing turns into a life or death scenario. I constantly misinterpret things people say to me because of how much I read into things that aren't there and It's ruined a couple of my friendships and relationships. Whenever I start to blow things out of proportion in my own head, I know that I'm thinking about it too much but I can't help but think about the ""what ifs"" until I drive myself insane. 
 
My second big issue is that I regret every decision I make even though I know that I would regret the alternative the same amount if not more. From what I eat for breakfast to really big things. Using my current situation as an example, I really, really wish that I didn't hook up with my friend but I know that if I didn't hook up with him, I would be beating myself up over missing an opportunity to hook up with someone who I've wanted to get with for years. 

What makes both of these so much worse is that I know that I'm doing them and don't do anything about it. I know that I'm overanalyzing, but I still do it and get so much more mad at myself because I'm conscious of it and it's the same with regretting my decisions. I know that I can't go back in time and change my decisions in the past, but I still think about it every second of every day. The fact that I know what I'm doing makes me so angry at myself that I can't stand being me anymore. I can't handle existing inside my own head because I'm so angry at myself and It's taking a really big toll on everyone around me because I've become kind of unpleasant.

Then, I will hear footsteps sprinting towards wherever I am laying. (Last night it was on the couch, usually in my room though.) I am always too terrified to open my eyes, but when ever the footsteps arrive, the voice screams at me. VERY LOUD.

But the thing that's really bothering me is my fiancee told me I talk in my sleep. ""Yeah, right"" I said. Mumbling a little bit while sleeping is normal, she's just blowing it out of proportion.

Then she recorded me. And I feel like the world's biggest piece of shit.

I don't just mutter in my sleep. There's no mumbling, this is loud, projecting, full on voice talking. And the shit I say is just fucking awful. Like, almost started worrying I had Schizophrenia bad. Horrible, hurtful, threatening things. I felt like I was in The Exorcist listening to it. Things I would never say coming out of my mouth.

I was almost in tears, hugging my soon to be wife, watching this video. And apparently it's gotten worse, because I opened up a groupchat I have with my friends and found 3-4 messages sent at 4am, while I was supposedly dead asleep. And it's the same. Horrible, awful, outright evil things.

I'm scaring the people I love, and I have proof that I've been threatening them. And that hurts me so much. I had everything handled for so long. I've been sick since I was 6, and I was better for 5 years. 19-24 I had zero symptoms. I had a life. And as soon as I hit 25 my OCD came back, I was checking locks ten times and repeating my daily plans to myself over and over again until I finally said them ""right"". I went to the Psyche for the first time since I was 17 and he hits me with a bipolar diagnosis. I had OCD, Anxiety and Depression. Since I was 6, that was my diagnosis. And I've developed a literal 'psychotic' disorder since. And he told me there's a chance it's going to get worse, told me that 25 is like mental illness puberty and any mental illness I'm predisposed too will likely manifest itself in the next year or so.

I don't know what to do. And seeing videos and evidence of me operating at 100% capacity while I'm sleeping, telling people I love how I'm going to hurt them, is just about more than I can take.

51,"Hey all

One thing I've been having trouble with for years now is distinguishing between actual, real limits that I can't push past and not making progress because I'm not pushing myself hard enough.

This applies to many things, but explaining it is easiest when talking about weight lifting: If you don't lift enough weight you won't make any progress since your body sees no need to adapt and grow muscle/stronger. However, there is of course also other factors that can hold you back such as not eating enough protein, not sleeping enough, too much stress etc etc. On the other hand even when you push yourself and lift heavier weight you can't just force yourself past physical limits; I can't just decide to bench press 100kg to push myself when I've never even benched 80kg for example.

And this is where my problem lies. It extends to other parts of my life as well: Do I need to push myself harder to become a better physicist and try to remember every single physical law I ever learned about? Where do I draw the line? How hard should I push myself? 

Is there any trick to knowing when to push yourself harder and when not to? I feel like such an idiot having trouble with this. ",18Feb2018,12

The kind of sadness where you try to get a hold of yourself for the sake of your pride ego dignity but you are the dropping china glass crystal. 



You are instantaneously broken and you know when and if you try to pick up the pieces they will cut you bleed you dry only to never be whole once more.

The kind of dull ache that transforms from knowing exactly why you feel this way to a normalized familiar pain you can count on to keep you company as the laughter fades and your smile deteriorates and you're walking home and wondering why and how you feel the way you feel how is it that you feel this way and there is no one here to hug me just hug me just hug me and hold me and tell me you'll be there for me here for me always. 



The upsides of pain sorrow sadness hurt hurting is the delusional sense of pride ego dignity composure where you convince yourself that you can survive anything never really hurt again because you've been hurt so badly before there is no possible way that you will shed those tears ever again you will not be on the bathroom floor once more you will not be the girl crying in the subway on a Friday night you will NOT feel that way ever again.

I have had psychosis for 2 and a half years. This is my 6th hospital admission and the only one where the focus has been on depression and suicidal thoughts as opposed to acute psychosis.

Basically I was put on mirtazapine but had disturbing nightmares. They started me on fluoxetine (prozac) yesterday. There was talk a few days ago of discharging me tomorrow (Monday). The ward manager told me not to worry and they won't discharge me until I'm a bit better but I'm still really worried about it especially since both interactions with my doctor have ended in arguments and the last ended with me kicking off and punching my wall over 20 times / now have soft tissue damage, had an xray no fracture.

I'm still withdrawn and not feeling comfortably sharing much with the nurses about how I'm feeling since they are understaffed and overworked as it is.

Have had low-grade depression and bouts of anxiety throughout my life starting in my teens. Currently 30. over the last 3 months I have out of nowhere developed anxiety which I've barely managed to keep in check with medication and such. What is confusing me is out of the last two weeks I have been hit with the worst depression I have ever experienced. It started with lack of motivation which I first interpreted as lack of energy. Once I realize it was lack of motivation I understood what was going on and knew I could deal with it as it wasn't my first time. 

Suddenly over the last week I have been hit with the worst depression to the point where it's feels physically painful. My mind is such a mix of anxiety and depression I don't know what the fuc to feel. I can barely process anything that's going on around me and have literally spent the last week sitting on the couch staring at read it on my phone. I'm a husband and father of two kids and have absolutely had no interaction with anyone.

2 times now I've had bouts of paranoia as well. I was watching making of a murderer on Netflix and had an anxiety attack because I was worried that the police are going to break down my door and arrest me and bring me to prison. I'm worried that things are going to break in my house I'm worried about everything but to the point of paranoia. I've had both swear I think somebody is out to get me and wants to hurt me. There's something in my mind that tells me there's this isn't true and I know it's not but I don't know what's causing those thoughts in the first place. It's fucking terrifying.

I don't think I'm going to get over this. I think this is it it's it's over. I've lost my sanity and I'm never going to get get it back. It's game over that's the only conclusion I can come too. I'm not even mad. And I would never kill myself cuz I don't want to cause pain to my family but I really wish that my God would forgive me for everything that I've done and then just take me so this can be over.

64,"Looking for some help on this as I know zero about mental health or help, but here goes:


I have a fur coat fetish.  I enjoy buying them and wearing them during sexual activity. My wife has sort of gone along with this fetish over the years, she enjoys the fashion.  In the bedroom, she will wear them and satisfy me, but almost immediately upon being intimate she will hop off the bed and the first thing she does is throw off the fur coat she's wearing.

This past weekend, she finally confessed something to me.  She said when she was 7 years old, her parents gave her a rabbit fur coat.  She was allowed to wear it only to special dinners or theatre events.  Naturally, she was drawn to how soft it was and attempted one day to enter her parents closet and ""pet"" her rabbit coat.   She was found out by both parents and scolded very badly to the point of tears.

Now, she confessed to having a ""mental block"" about this.  She told me that whenever she puts on a jacket, she can almost hear her parents scolding her for it.  Hence, why she immediately yanks it off after sexual activity.

How can this be overcome?  Any methods or solutions to this?  I need some help on this.",18Feb2018,1
