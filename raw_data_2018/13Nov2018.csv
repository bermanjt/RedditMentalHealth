0,"It probably stems from a severe lack of confidence (which I couldn’t tell you when that all went to shit).. but whether it’s for a family baby shower, a school concert, a date, or my friends want to just have a fun “photo shoot” there is a very high chance that you’ll find me  frantically pulling my clothes out of my closet on the verge of tears trying everything on and hating it until I break down and cry and end up showing up incredibly underdressed because I resort to wearing baggy clothing that clearly gives off the vibe that I don’t care... reality I do care I just panic while trying to get ready :(
I don’t know why because over the past year while I’ve really improved on my self confidence... anyone relate/ know why I might respond like that or how I can work through it? It really puts a damper on my day when I have something important going on.",13Nov2018,1
1,"Today, my sessions with my therapist, who I have been seeing for nearly two years, have ended. He told me he thought that I was done with therapy and believed I’d be fine without it. I strongly disagreed with him and still do. I’m now aware that many True CBT therapists do this. It is a time based type of therapy and it does not offer supportive care. In my eyes, it is a therapy based on getting themselves good results. Sure it can help in the short term and get people out of bad situations, but it is not designed for any form of relapse that might occur. 

My therapist has said I can return if another crisis occurs, but frankly, the trust has been broken and I’ll likely never see him again. He also had to drop this little info on how he’d normally drop a client who refused to do the homework assigned in CBT, like I did, but saw I needed help. Which also irritated me very much. 

So to sum it up, CBT is too rigid and designed to post good results from their patients as opposed to truly letting the patient dictate when therapy should end. I will not be going back to a therapist who uses those practices again. ",13Nov2018,1

4, I’ve been having nighttime panic. It happens most nights where my heart races at like 7 or 8 pm. I’ll notice that suddenly my heart rate is elevated (sometimes up to 100 bpm) and then the normal panic and worry kicks in. Often times I’ll be asleep and suddenly jolt awake with a racing heart and a tight chest. I have a history or anxiety related to bipolar disorder. Has anyone else experienced nighttime panic ? ,13Nov2018,1
5,"So, this is rather new to me. I’m 21 years old, and over the last few years this problem seems to be getting worse and worse. 

I was always annoyed at loud noises, and to my parent’s dismay I would always turn the t.v. down to low levels even when I wasn’t in the room. I guess noises have always annoyed me, especially certain kinds of dissonant (maybe?) noises. However,  now it’s becoming ridiculous. 

I’ve started to notice it whenever the letter s is used in conversation louder than normal level. Just an annoying sharp uncomfortable sound. Clapping in this auditorium today was just obnoxious and I found myself covering my ears without even thinking about it. Dropped dishes can stay in my ear for over a day with that gross ringing. I can’t seem to watch 80’s and early 90’s movies without getting bothered by the crazy sound effects even at a moderate level (forces me to cover my ears). Some people’s voices just annoy me in general, and also conversely I guess some voices are just heavenly to listen to. 

My housemate’s loud noises are really getting on my nerves so much. I’ve told him it annoys me, but it’s hard to explain how bothersome. I think I’ve started to subconsciously like him less and get annoyed at him more in general mostly just cause of this. 

Anyone have any ideas what’s causing this? Is this a mental thing? Is it possible it’s some spectrum of autism? Still, I’m quite sociable and have high empathy I think. I’m rather befuddled :3, and why is it getting worse??

TL;DR

Certain noises have always bothered me, but now it’s getting worse. Anyone know why or what I should do??

6,"Hey guys, my friend has been acting strange lately. They have been very reclusive, stand offish, and somewhat angry. They have always been somewhat withdrawn, but its been a lot worse lately. I have asked them a couple times if anything was wrong but they always said they were fine, but things got worse. The other night I found them outside in the cold huddled in the corner of our patio clutching a doll. I tried asking them if something was up but they said nothing was. It was kind of weird because they would kiss the doll and just huddle in the corner. Should I be concerned? Or am I over stepping my bounds and being nosy. Thank you.

8,"I have mentioned it a few times in posts but I haven’t gotten responses and I’m kind of desperate now I just need someone to listen.

My girlfriend was murdered a year ago (I am a lesbian just for reference), and I had to witness that one. My friend was also murdered almost a year ago, it will be in December. And it is my dead girlfriend’s birthday in December as well. So needless to say, everything sucks and I don’t know what I am doing. I’ve been so depressed for the past couple weeks. I’ve barely been able to function. I didn’t go to any of my classes last week. I feel so lost. I’ve been having nonstop flashbacks as well. 

I don’t know what I’m doing. I’ve been dissociating all week. I was at work and just left the faucet on and it sprayed water all over me for about a solid 2 minutes before a coworker asked what I was doing. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I’m doing. I feel so stuck.

9,"I worry.. a lot. I over think.. a lot. I can’t focus.. a lot. I’m guessing what I’m experiencing is anxiety but I wouldn’t know because I’m too scared to make an appointment with my primary care giver because I won’t know if they’ll believe me or not. 

Growing up I would worry about the slightest thing wrong with me and my mom would tell me to stop being a hypochondriac and that I’m fine. She wouldn’t ask me about why I was feeling what I was but instead of insisting that I was okay and nothing was wrong with me. And now I’m paranoid that people think I’m over reacting when I tell them of a symptom that I’m having. 

Lately I’ve been loosing clumps of hair, and losing weight without trying. I’ve been trying to remember to take multivitamins because I haven’t been eating healthy, or barely eating if that. My anxiety and worrying has been super high lately and last week I broke down in the bathroom at work.  

Im scared to notify my doctor of what I’m feeling and I don’t know how to go about it either. Do I just schedule an appointment and tell them I think I have anxiety? Do I try and go to a therapist? Do I have to go to a psychiatrist for this? I don’t know and each day I feel like I’m failing in life somehow. 

I’m not depressed, I was depressed a few months ago due to my birth control but I got off of it now and I don’t think my body is quite back to normal yet. Could that be the reason for my anxiety? 

I don’t know what to do and I can’t talk to anyone about it in person. Please leave me some advice.. I would greatly appreciate it. ",13Nov2018,1
10,"I have an appointment in a month to do untreated for a psychological evaluation specifically looking for depression, ADHD, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. I am very anxious about getting the testing done. I have dinner the normal battery of self administered autism tests that the web has to offer, and have always gotten likely to be in the Autism spectrum and to seek a professional diagnosis. The idea of being autistic has terrified me, I hate no idea what to expect at the three appointments I have prior to the results appointment. Should I expect mostly multiple choice questionnaires? Should I bring in self reports on where I believe my weaknesses are? Should I just cancel the appointment since there is minimal in the treatment for it?

My boyfriend of 10 months and I broke up about 2 months ago, and ever since I’ve felt so sad and bored of life in general. It’s not like my relationship was the best thing ever, we became really toxic, but I don’t think I’ve ever really felt as happy as I did occasionally with my ex. I’ve had little flings since we’ve split, but it literally feels like I don’t know what it’s like to catch feelings for someone anymore. The worst part about this all? My ex has turned into some completely different human being, he’s a total a**hole. It’s like missing someone who doesn’t even exist anymore. He and I had been on and off and in between I’ve always felt like this, but now that I know for sure he’s not coming back.. I’m just so empty. And it’s not like I have a boring life. (I’m 15) I have the lead in the school musical, my grades are in the high honours, I’m always writing and reading and making music and singing and dancing, hell! I even made the senior dance team! I’ve also got a job! I also hang out with my friends all the time , so.. it could be my eating habits or sleeping habits but I’ve really improved on those things as of recent. It could also be the same routine , but I don’t know how I’d spice things up? I can’t enter a new relationship if I can’t fall for anyone else, I hate parties, I don’t have time to do anything new, I feel so broken. I’ve gone to counselling before as well due to a traumatic incident that occurred in the summer time, and that just doesn’t help. I wanna feel like I did while I was in love. I don’t want to keep trying to like people that I just don’t. I want to feel excited again.. also, my friends are dropping like flies and I just feel so alone no matter what.

One night my at-the-time boyfriend was at my dorm and we were sleeping. At some point he started playing with my boobs and that woke me up. I told him to please stop because I really needed sleep since I had an early lecture, but he didn't. I got mad and told him he wasn't respecting my boundaries and he lashed out at me saying I was making him feel like a pervert and a rapist and started acting offended. When he got mad he would give me the silence treatment, sometimes even for days, and suffering from generalized anxiety disorder that would exacerbate my condition and be unbearable. So I apologized to him and let him touch me. Was I wrong to ""make him feel like a pervert"", as he told me I did? He is not entitled to my body, regardless of our relationship.

15,"I’m the summer time, I went over to a friends house to smoke some marijuana and this was about the fifth time I’ve done so, so I wasn’t expecting anything different to happen. We were outside in the dark in my friends yard and we were sitting at a cramped table with Christmas lights above us. My friend, (let’s call her D), and I had arrived late as she was dating the host. (Let’s call him K). It was kind of awkward because I hadn’t hung out with them since I was dating my ex so they offered me a hit to break the silence. They handed me the bubbler of which I had never used and told me to inhale. I did this wrong and inhaled everything inside the damn thing and took a HUGE hit. I then started coughing and literally couldn’t stop and then slipped into a weird state. Everything started to look further away from me. And that’s the last thing I remember. Telling them “I was scared”. So then I remember everything going black and I just saw like pixels and I tried to make shaped out of them but it was really scary it was like I had to make certain patterns to survive. Anyways, I can’t remember what order things went in and I’m not going to get in too deep because I’m already messed up thinking about this night.. but I remember feeling like someone was raping me and calling out for help and hearing little snippets of the outside world. I remember scratching at the ground because I thought if I stopped I would die and they’d all let me die. I remember everything going so fast and I couldn’t stop it and I kept hearing someone screaming. I remember seeing fractals and not even being able to comprehend what was happening, like the world I knew was a lie. And this was real. That scares me to this day. I remember saying nobody loved me and calling out for my parents and my ex. Anyways, eventually I slipped into an okay state and I remember D, who had not taken anything being the only sober one. She helped a bit by trying to bring me back.. but eventually I just slipped back into what was happening in my brain. They then took me inside where they gave me water and I remember feeling like I was building shit, it was weird. But then everything kind of faded away, but still, the feeling of like realization that I had felt plagued me the entire night. That night my entire world view had changed, the next day, I still felt high. Which wasn’t different for the last times I’d been high. But the feeling never really went away. And then I started thinking about it all the time and having weird questions pop up in my head everyday. And this still happens (this was 4-5 months ago? Anyways, later on I found out while all of this was happening in my brain, I was like jumping the ground and banging my head up against the fence and running backwards into the fence and screaming extremely loud, so much so that the police showed up and they hid me. So let me continue, the thoughts never went away they still happen, fast forward one month after the incident and I’m feeling like I’m high everyday and everything is pointless and fake. Until one night happens where I feel like I’m high again, like I’m reliving what happened and I get really scared in my friends car, everything feels like it’s the same night and everything in between was just part of the trip. I scare the shut out of my friends and my mom takes me to the hospital where they put me in adavan and tell me it’s just anxiety, anyways. The next day nothing changes and I’m at my boyfriends house at the time (we had gotten back together) and it happened all over again! Fast forward to much later and I’m still having panic attacks and flashbacks but this time weird shit starts happening, like feeling things that aren’t there and feeling like everything’s going super fast. Nd feeling like I’m vibrating. Anyways, and still these thoughts aren’t going away. So I start not being able to sleep in silence or everything starts to speed up and I hear things and I get scared of sleeping alone because of the dreams... so anyways now I’m here. Where still some of that stuff still affects me, like the thoughts and now the sadness and the no point in anything feeling but the panic attacks have kinda stopped..I’ve tried taking to a counsellor but it doesn’t help. I just feel sad and anxious and hopeless and empty and bored all the time now. Scared of randomly slipping into an attack or going back into my head like I did that night. Is anyone feeling the same?

Does the first part mean physically moving slow like a sloth? Or is it being slow completing tasks due to motivation/procrastination/distraction/etc?

Also, when I have changed my dosage of SSRI or SNRI meds I get ""the zaps"" and I always have trouble explaining what they are. It's a sort of tingling or electric feeling that sometimes seems like it's in my brain, and sometimes runs down one side of my body all the way to my toes.

22,"Hi all,

I (24) am looking for advice on respectfully encouraging my significant other (21) to seek therapy.  

We’ve been together about 10 months and the subject of going to therapy has come up a couple of times.  I myself go to therapy and see a psychiatrist and take meds to deal with my mental illness.  She’s currently not on any medication or seeking any treatment but suffers from mental illness.  

Tonight she mentioned how she’s pretending to be okay all the time when she isn’t.  I asked if she was open to therapy, and she got mad at me.  She says she can’t afford it, which I understand, but I truly believe her family would help her out with the cost.  I’d also be more than willing to help with the cost, but I can’t offer or she’ll be offended.  Additionally, she hasn’t actually checked if any therapists in the area take her insurance, so it kind of feels like an excuse.  I of course did NOT say any of this to her, as it’s not my place to say, so we dropped it.  

Has anyone ever been in a similar position?  Is there a way to strongly encourage it without coming off as a preachy?  I care about her and just want her to be happy and healthy. 

Thanks in advance!

26,"Let me tell you a bit about myself, I'm a 19 year old male currently in University trying to figure his life out after a long time being in the trenches of life to put it into perspective. I'm on this sub a lot on my main account but for some reason I just embarrassed enough to not actually post this on my account. I'm sorry if a lot of this is rambling, I need to get this out somehow and I need help and perspective. 

&amp;#x200B;

I fell in love with this girl about two years ago and kept it a secret until last month. We didn't talk for almost a year until last month because I had to pull myself away when she had gotten back with her ex-boyfriend who cheated on her. It was a very fucked up year for me, dealing with severe depression and isolation for a good year before I was able to pull myself up and do what needed to be done.

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted her last month and told her how I felt in person and laid out that I came in with no expectations other than to let her know how I felt. From there we developed our friendship again very quickly and soon it has lead to us being sexually involved. I'm quite in-experienced sexually as I've always been very picky with who I even associate with, let alone being with a girl. I reject the current dating climate because it's just not who I am. I can't be the fuckboy who goes around hooking up with girls, in fact I'd only been with 2 girls prior to this and it was strictly making out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had issues with having girls being interested in me but due to my personality and just the person I am, I do not engage with a lot of people and mostly have always rejected any attempts people have tried to get to know me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now getting back on track (sorry for the rambling). I fell in love with this girl and didn't tell her for a long time until recently as I mentioned above. I'm currently at a point in my life where I finally for once in my life feel like I'm in control, after a very shitty childhood riddled with agony, pain and loss. Stuff is going quite good, I'm going to school, working out and playing hockey which is something I love to do. I can sit and ponder upon thoughts of love, existence, the cosmos and anything else I find interesting (thank you meds) without being depressed. I still overthink a lot, which is partly why I'm making this thread right now.

&amp;#x200B;

The girl I'm in love with and kind of talking to right now has been with another guy and I don't have an issue with that because it was a relationship. She told me that she'd made out with like 4-5 other guys like almost a year or over a year ago, and I didn't really mind that because I can't expect everyone to conform to my standards. I'm not sure why, but she'd eventually told me about this one other guy this past summer who she took it a bit further with (giving head and being fingered by him), and it made me furious inside. I didn't show my emotions or say anything at the time, but I woke up this morning and my heart just was pulsating and I felt like I didn't have control over how I could feel. I felt disgust and anger towards her even though I can't blame her. I keep thinking to myself that I should not follow my heart and just pull away from her again. It breaks my heart and I don't know why. I really like her though I don't know how I would feel about a relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? Does this feeling of heartache go away? Why does it bother me so much even though we didn't even talk and she didn't know I had feelings for her. I never thought I'd be the guy putting myself in this position, but I'm for once in my life feeling raw emotions like I never have before. I want love, but I don't know if I can go through the pain.

Last week my little sister called me saying she dreamt I killed myself and begged me not to. The people I love the most are worried about me, that's honestly the worst part. I've always cared more about everyone else than myself... It's damned if I do damned if I don't ya know? If I stay here they hurt because of me.. if I leave they hurt because of me. Lose, lose... Heh. 

Is there an opposite to being a sociopath? Like empathizing to the point of insanity? I hurt for myself but I hurt 10 times more when I see someone else suffer. It's got me fucked up lol. Damn I'm ranting as usual. Feels nice thooooo so whatever :)

33,"I am under 18. A few years ago, I went threw a move that was really hard on me. I had a lot of problems at the time. After a while, most of it went away. Not everything is gone, but I can deal with it myself. I have been doing so for about a year. Maybe I’m not ‘fine’ but I certainly don’t need help. I am a happy person. I dislike therapy because they have tried to tell me how to solve everything when sometimes it’s easier to deal with the little stuff then to do something about it. I have been in and out of therapy for about 4 years. I have stopped each time because I refused to continue. I always improved myself through self motivation and I do not believe therapy has helped me in any way. My parents believe any victories I have are solely due to therapy, even though my progress nearly completely happens out of therapy. 

I am mentally stable. I eat, sleep, exercise, get good grades in school and show no abnormal behaviour. I believe my mother is projecting that she is unhappy onto me. She is easily stressed and it makes her feel better when I go to therapy so I do. I have spoken to her about it many times, but it just stresses her out and I always and up going anyway. When I tell the truth to the therapists I find they over analyze how much my problems impact me.  My mom is also very concerned, and I am very suspicious she has told them so. I believe the therapists are more concerned because my mother is more concerned because she is projecting herself onto me. She has mental health problems herself and every day is a victory for her. I don’t want to make things harder for her but I don’t want to continue with therapy and would just like to be left alone. 

I am taking one last trip to the therapists on Wednesday and my father is going to come too to try to close it up. My mother has reluctantly agreed. How should I make this a smooth as possible for her so she doesn’t worry about me so much? 

P.S. My mother has been diagnosed and is currently seeing a therapist. ",13Nov2018,1

36,"Hi everyone, This post may feel awkward because I'm trying a stream of conscious thing since if I think too hard over a post, I start feeling like I'm lying and making up things. 

**Heads up this is super long. The TLDR is that I'm experiencing a lot of negativity in my life right now and just want to vent about it because I don't have a support system due to social isolation. I am planning on seeing a licensed therapist/counselor once I look into my health insurance options. I feel like shit and I want to change it. :)** 

I feel terrible. I've felt terrible for years and for years I've been telling myself ""things will get better once I get past this one thing"". First it was high school, then it was college, then it was finding a job, my surgery, etc. Each time I get near the hurdle, I feel so excited and happy and like I'm literally on top of the world and living my best life, and once I am past it... the excitement is gone. I feel bleak and empty and am left questioning, why do I feel this way after reaching a goal? And I just feel so empty inside and find myself looking for the next big thing to focus my thoughts on. I feel like sometimes I care too much and out of nowhere, I stop caring and care too little :/ 

I can't handle people and it's really gotten worse once I reached adulthood - wasn't good in middle or high school (and definitely got worse in HS), but since college and graduating, I feel like I've isolated myself. If my partner broke up with me, I would have no people to talk to my age aside from a few friends who don't really reach out to me much. I've had ""people troubles"" as I call them for such a long time. The same situation repeats itself - my friends leave me, I find new friends, I allow some of them (some don't) to use me and belittle me because I want them to like me (I've forgiven friends for what I now recognize was bullying), and then something changes in the dynamic - I either see them not reaching out to me as much or I see them starting to prefer other people over me - and I pull away from them, I withdraw into myself and realize how little they care, and next thing I know they're gone and the cycle is repeating itself. The few friends who haven't been toxic to me, I want so desperately to retain the friendship, but I don't know how. Things get awkward - I find myself not knowing what to do or say and it gets so uncomfortable that eventually I stop trying. And I find myself feeling sad, angry, and bitter like it's their fault that things got awkward even though in my heart I know it was me. I didn't reach out enough, I didn't try hard enough, I was and am a bad friend. But really, if they reach out to me, suddenly I'm not angry anymore and it's like the relationship goes right back to where I left off.

For a long time I was no longer experiencing bad thoughts. But since things have stagnated for me this year, my bad thoughts are returning. They show up most when I'm thinking about work stuff. If someone criticizes my work or points out a mistake I made, I beat myself up over it. If everyone on the team is laughing and I'm awkwardly sitting there not sure what to do or say and internally feeling so isolated, I beat myself up over it. I tell myself to get over it an I tell myself that I'll never be successful in my career if I can't even laugh and joke with people I've been working with for over 9 months now. I'll walk to the bathroom and all I can think about are the bad thoughts... I wanna hurt myself. I haven't acted on it thank god. Been there and done that and learned my lesson. but it doesn't stop my stupid brain from saying that I need to. 

I just wish I understood why I feel these things. I know that I have trauma that I haven't dealt with - this trauma started in my preteens and was consistent for almost a full year, and after that I have continued to experience I guess minor traumas since then idk if you can call them traumas tho, more like consistently shitty things that happened. I'm in my early 20s now and it's time that I suck it up and see someone. I know that I need to process this trauma and explore the emotions that I've been feeling for almost a fucking decade - I crave a name for this so I can find people who truly understand my feelings and my thought processes. I just want to find out why I act this way and do whatever I can to change it. I'm fucking sick of waking up every day feeling empty and just wanting to make it through the day, through the week. This is no way to live. 

Sorry about the shitty typing. I just needed to get this all off my chest and I'm so afraid that if I keep re-reading what I've typed, I'll start changing things and sound fake as fuck and portray myself in a way that I'm not. If anyone has any advice (other than the obvious see a therapist advice - which I am planning on doing haha), please feel free to comment or PM me. I'm not in a good place right now - I'm sad and empty and these feelings have been consistent enough for me to say that I've once again fallen into the pit of feelings and it can be a lot to deal with :( And the worst part is that I've isolated myself and am recovering from relationship troubles that lasted a while (things got kind of fucked up due to substance abuse and I am relearning how to trust my partner), so I feel like I have no one to really talk to this stuff with.

37,"It is important to clarify this. I suffer from anxiety, but symphtoms haven't been truly showing up these pass months, so in brave, and very stupid, kind of reward, I've decided to stop seeing my therapist. 

Anyways, this pass month, I've been feeling like I am not me, and anxiety started to haunt me again, plus insomnia. 

Crazy thing is that things that I used to love, do not fullfil me anymore, I feel no motivation whatsoever, and I am really desperate. Is this a sudden kind of identity crisis? Is there a relationship between my anxiety and this thing?

38,"I don't even know if this is an actual problem, but when I Google it, I can't find anything about it. I probably should've looked more into it, but I wanted to ask here.

I feel as though my feelings can be spent. Which sounds weird, but I'll try to explain it.

Imagine you really like something or someone (ex. a singer). You love and adore them so much so you start telling everyone how happy they make you, right? Usually that feeling of adoration towards the person lasts for a long time. It probably gets even stronger, actually. But I find the more I talk about something I love the more I lose interest in it.

For example... Maybe like, seven months ago, I used to be really, really into xiumin from exo. I really liked him, I thought he was adorable and he would make me fangirl so hard. I made a huge post just talking about how much I love him, then I thought about making a fan page and I did. Almost immediately afterwards, these strong feelings were just gone. Same with BTS. I bought many albums and I loved them so much, then suddenly I lost interest in k-pop altogether.

It's the same with people I know! I really liked this girl, but I talked about her so damn much and now I don't like her as much. Not because I started disliking her. I just don't get butterflies thinking about her anymore. I don't know why.

It sounds super weird, but at times I'm genuinely worried. I mean, what if I get into something I like momentarily and then once I've gotten too deep into it I fall out of it? It's so weird... 

Has anyone experienced this? I'm sorry if I'm blowing this out of proportion, I was just curious. Thanks so much in advance to anyone who answers.",13Nov2018,1
39,"I’m new here. This is actually my first reddit post. I wanted to reach out in this group to hear if anyone else shared the same struggle as me..
A little backstory; I’ve always struggled with MI even in my adolescence. I had major anxiety as a kid and then developed seasonal depression in high school. My senior year of HS I knew something had shifted, I had a wave of depression before the colder weather was even near. And then it just got extremely worse that winter. I went on antidepressants in the spring— celexa to be exact, a common SSRI. I was on it for about maybe 6 months and then around fall of 2017 I shifted again into MAJOR mania, crying my eyes out without any reasonable explanation for 2 weeks straight every time I came home. Extreme lows and extreme highs. 
I told my doctor about the change and she said it’s very common for an SSRI to trigger someone’s bipolar to come out. I guess what I’m coming on here for is for advice. I don’t have health insurance anymore nor can I afford it so everything is starting to get more difficult as time goes on. All I can do is busy myself and designate lots of time to myself... 
I’m on seroquel now and it’s helped a lot at first but it’s settling now that I’m used to it. It’s not the best but it helps me not feel manic. 

I’d appreciate if anyone has gone through what I’ve been through. Much love ",13Nov2018,1
40,"Recently I have posted about being suicidal. All though I deleted those posts, I feel extremely guilty. I have been extremely suicidal lately but have a perfect life. I don't know why I feel this way. I know it's stupid of me, but I can't get out of it. I haven't felt like myself in years. I don't know what I need. I'm in therapy, I just feel terrible",13Nov2018,1
41,"So I'm 90% sure I suffer from depression, and my mother being so sure that she feels ""why should I pay someone to tell me what I know?""... but that isn't even the main point here, so I'll move on top that. Well there might be two or three really...

1) I struggle to speak with people, especially to strangers, even in places I'm comfortable... Like later this week I'm gonna be hanging out with some friends at a Bar-esque type place, I've been once already. I know everyone in our little group, but I know I'll have a hard time talking because I've not seen one of them in ages. Really only a few months. But this had always been a problem, I simply lose my ability to talk at all when it comes to strangers/people I see frequently. Like I can't talk to most of my family because I don't see them often enough to clock them as friends/family. I have no problem talking with my friends, but the second we step foot in an unfamiliar place, I'm struck silent, best I can do is nod, shrug, and shake my head. *I've entertained the thought of learning ASL as means of communication, but others would have to know it as well...

2) I'm not very outgoing at all, I don't have many friends, and the friends I have could literally do just about anything to me and I'd stick around despite that. But my problem comes with fictional characters, I often consider them to be my best friends, I will become offended on their behalf and speak as if they are real, and as though they'd be offended or excited by what someone had said. Like I know and understand that they are fictional, but they still register to me as though they are real and they are friends. I become very protective of them as well...

3) I literally cannot handle most changes, especially sudden ones. I had a breakdown over the simplest change just the other day, which warranted my mom and dad to practically pick on me for it, or at least to taunt me. I've never been good with any changes, when I was younger I sobbed because my parents sold/got rid of our dining room table *also got me picked on and/or taunted, sometimes still today they do it*

I'm just wondering if there are names for these kind of things, because I want to see a professional and I want to go in it with some knowledge of what to talk about directly. Not that I'd be able to talk with them... because I can't talk to strangers. *would they let me write in response?? Because I could do that!

42,"20y/o, F, in Australia. 

Not sure if this is the right place so please remove if it’s not, also I’m on mobile so sorry about formatting. 

Also go to the 3rd big paragraph below to skip the symptoms etc. 

I’m basically 100% sure I have depression, I’ve talked to my close friends about it and I’ve been to two doctors to get mental health plans- I had to go to a second one because I left the area of the first one when I moved back home after my university semester ended. The first doctor I went to did the K10 test (I’m in Australia, not sure if it’s a thing elsewhere but basically the GP asks you questions from the test and your score basically determines if you need to see a mental health professional afterwards- I’m not sure if this counts as a diagnosis or not? But I got a 40 on the test, which basically means depression, yay)

I’ve been struggling a lot for the past 6 months or so, I’ve been constantly fatigued even though I get enough sleep, pretty much always apathetic or just neutral mood, about once a week or so I’ll have a breakdown where I basically just cry until I fall asleep because I can’t calm down otherwise and just general feelings of worthlessness and low self esteem. During one of my breakdowns I called a helpline (beyond blue) and just talked stuff through with the lady on the other end which was good.

The thing is I’ve been really open with this stuff with other people? Like I literally made a picture book for a presentation for one of my classes that was essentially a reflection exercise and one of the pages was just basically “I have depression”. I was asked to present a similar thing to this at a final year event for this class on Thursday afternoon which I am going to do, but I want to be able to invite my parents. Which is where the problem is. 

I haven’t told my parents about any of the above. I think part of it is that I don’t like people pitying me? I have a good relationship with them, they’re both very understanding of mental health issues (they’re actually both psychologists). I want a way to tell them what I’ve been going through- or even just that I think I have depression without going through the really bad stuff- without them stressing out.

My family are causing me terrible anxiety and it’s only getting worse.

My sister is super judgmental of other and also has been a bully to me for most of my life, she jokes around and sometimes we laugh and get along but a lot of the time she will put me down about my cleanliness, laziness or my job and passions, she will talk down my career which I studied for saying anyone could do my job and even when I told her recently I completed training she basically reacted like it was nothing. 

My mother however has been extremely emotionally manipulative ever since I moved out, if I don’t call twice a day and go around multiple times a week she gets upset. She also constantly wants me to bring things over or pick things up for her that she has brought. If I don’t she will call me and yell at me down the phone for 10 minutes or more berating me and my partner (most of this I keep from her to keep her from getting upset since she’s easily upset) she will call me and yell at me if my garden is untidy, she’ll make up that my roommate is unhappy with me about things which aren’t true and will afterwards call me crying and apologising that it won’t happen again.

46,"Hi,

I'm a male college student hoping to be a doctor one day, hopefully. The thing is, I don't think I am nowhere near ready to be a doctor, my mind and my habits are just tripping me up.

I should start by talking about how I spend most of my time: reading webfiction online. Sure, it's not inherently bad, but I've noticed that I read webfiction so that I don't have to think any complex thoughts; my other time sink is my addiction to masturbation, I think because of the incapacity to form proper coherent thoughts that is associated with the fugue state I enter when I start searching for porn. 

I do well in my classes, putting in the least amount of time I can to get an A. I save as much time as I can to enter 'oblivion' as I call it. It is a state where I don't have to think, worry, or do anything at all. In a regular weekday, I go to classes, I study, then I waste time trying not to think about anything that worries me. In a regular weekend, I fritter away the entire day by reading webfiction or masturbating. I should mention that I am not suicidal.

What am I worried about? Well, I'm worried about whether or not I'll ever be a doctor. See, by masturbating and reading webfiction online I've effectively devoted a significant portion of my life to seeking nothing, whereas my fellow competitors for Med School seats have probably used that same amount of time to do club stuff, research, volunteering, and other things that I haven't done. Med Schools seem to be obsessed with finding students who have 'life experience', which is something I am clearly lacking. 

This feeds into my worries about breaking expectations. My parents, my grandparents and I want my life to be meaningful, and I genuinely believe that becoming a doctor and helping people is the best way to have a meaningful life -- while also not having to worry about money ofc. In high school, I was just expected to get good grades, do well on all the standardized tests and the colleges would admit me because I provide padding to their statistics; this was fairly easy for me to do. But now, I'm supposed to seek out 'opportunities', build 'life experience', make meaningful friendships/networks and just generally have a life outside of classes. This stuff, I have not done. In college, I got a great score on the MCAT, a 3.9 GPA in the classes I've taken, and I've made one or two passing friendships; however, the other stuff just seems really unstructured and I always ignored it because it didn't seem as easy and tangible as getting grades and test scores. 

Talking about this does pull some weight off my chest, so let me vent some more:

Another gripe/worry I have with myself is that I can't do anything significant without someone telling me to do it. If someone else asks me to do something and I say I'll do it, I'll definitely do it. However, if I ask myself to implement a habit that is important to me, like exercise, better cleanliness, stop wasting time, etc., I will do it for at most a week (more like just 2 days) and then return to my default state of seeking 'oblivion'. My default state is doing nothing, and it doesn't seem like I can make permanent changes to my habits by myself. This is super irritating to me. I pay \_so\_ much attention to what other people want from me, but why can't I devote myself to the things \_I\_ want? Surely I should be able to ask for that from myself? This is a problem that's probably been with me since middle school, but it was only really apparent when I left my hometown where I had a martial arts teacher who would force me to work out 4 times a week. 

I don't know where to start. I've tried changing myself with willpower over the last 3+ years, but obviously, it hasn't panned out. I need better skills and coping strategies. Whenever I think about how powerless I feel, I immediately blanket myself in apathy by tiring myself out somehow. However, I get the feeling that I can't keep devoting my time to thinking nothing nothing if I want to have some kind of life with challenges and meaning. I can put in bullshit levels of effort into classes and still get an A, but I can't put in bullshit levels of effort into relationships and myself and get anything out of life. I feel like, in terms of life experience, I'm comparable to the average middle schooler, instead of a college student. 

Thanks for the help. ",13Nov2018,1

Before that, I thought that I was just nervous and shy and that anxiety was a term reserved for people with ""real problems"". I always had the inclination that I didn't deserve to say that I had anxiety because other people out there have it much worse.

Now that I've finally past that, I feel like I want to go out and get diagnoses for a million other things as well (dyslexia, ADHD, autism, OCD, etc.) and I'm wondering what drives this impulse, and why so many other people want to do the same. It seems like everyone wants to wear a mental illness badge these days.

I try and be as honest as I can with myself and consider whether or not I have such disorders or if I just want to be unique and ""sophisitcated"". Are people seeking diagnoses to validate their lack of success in life? Are people just trying to grab on to mental illness statuses to make themselves feel like they're special or ""damaged""?

I have a cousin who always complains about her own social anxiety even though she hasn't been diagnosed and is the biggest social butterfly I know. She is also incredibly lazy and it gets her nowhere in life. Is she using her self diagnosis as an excuse for having done nothing with her life? Could I potentially be doing the same thing by seeking further diagnoses for myself?

My girlfriend has a laundry list of mental illnesses but she is the exact opposite of my cousin. She has pretty severe autism which tends to branch out in to all sorts of other issues, but she keeps it to herself and you'd never know she had any problems unless she told you. She mentioned to me that when she was younger, all of her friends would start to mimic her illnesses for no apparent reason. Why does this happen? Do people do this to feel special? How do I know I'm not doing the same thing?

I'd never done what I outlined in the title (almost literally) until I had a Shroom trip in college. I'm not even sure I had self-awareness before that, and even after, it's sputtering and painful. I strongly suspect most of my family has some degree of executive functioning issues. Anything involving me using the concept of time as a tool is extremely difficult. I've been living my life on autopilot, and deadlines don't exist unless they're immediate.

The hell is going on with me?",13Nov2018,1
58,"Just looking for advice. Fairly new relationship (8~ months). My partner suffers with anxiety and depression and has been medicated for most of their adult life. They've openly told me that they are in a funk, and it's getting worse...trying to get into their psych to change some meds and trying to find a resolve, but sometimes I'm at a loss. 

I get that detaching and isolating is a symptom, but I don't know when to keep pushing or the retreating is on purpose. For people going through this, what do you want from your SO? I am extremely supportive, if anything I want to help too much always willing to go out of my way or whatever I can do, am I being annoying? Should I just give them some space?  

Thanks in advance. ",13Nov2018,1

60,"I'm from the east coast of the states, and for years now I've been struggling mentally. I can't diagnose myself with anything because I haven't talked to a doctor about it yet, but I'm planning on doing so very soon. I'm just worried about how it goes and how to go about talking about concerns for depression. Do they just ask questions and diagnose you? I'm not sure how they go about it and what my experience will be like once I go check out what's going on. Can anyone that has talked to a doctor or nurse about their mental health provide me on some info? ",13Nov2018,1

63,"To start off I feel as if I need to go through my history. At the start, ages 5-8 I had a handful of friends and was like any other kid, I went outside and played with my friends and all that. But at the age of 9 I started to feel my depression for the first time, I wasnt sad or anything, I just felt empty. I stopped going outside and I talked to my friends less and less. Then the day came when I moved, the friends I made, just gone. I moved into my grandparents house (My family wasnt doing the best on money and needed the money from the house we sold and a loan from my other grandparents to buy a new house) And we lived there for two years I believe. My two uncles lived in the house as well as my two cousins and aunt. So they were quite a bit of people in that house. I was forced to share a room with my parents for 2 or 3 years and when I wasnt at school I would be at home playing video games. But I would leave the room to go places with one of my uncles and my dad. But one day my grandfather and uncle (not the one I went places with) got into a argument with my mom and dad saying that we needed to move out, tensions rose and my grandfather hit my mom across the head. I didnt speak to him for years until recently. I was below the age of 11 during my time in my grandparents house , but the exact age I do not know. After that I never left the room and I began to get chunky obviously. That side of my family didnt speak to me anymore, even people who werent part of the fight were quiet around me besides ""hey"" or ""you heading to school?"" ""how was school"" or ""you hungry?"" The only person who did speak to me more than that was my grandmother. Its not their fault though because I am very socially awkward. But while I spent all my time in my room, my brother had become great friends with my aunt and I remember wishing that i had someone like that. I should also mention that my dad used to have problems when I was younger, he would constantly get into arguments with my mom and at times even smack her. it got worse as my brother got into his teen phase of ""you cant tell me what to do"" cliche. he got to the point of hitting him in the back of the knees with slim bamboo sticks and one day punching him in the lip when he said ""Fuck you"". And one day an argument got so bad my dad got on top of my brother, wrapped his hands around his throat and said ""ill kill you"" my mom yelled for me to call the cops and I did. My mom came running a few moments later and banged on their closet which was where I went to hide and call the cops, I opened it and she hung up the phone. The cops came and my mom said that what I said was a misunderstanding and that it was just yelling She only said that so my dad wouldnt get arrested, yes the events happened) I later found out that my brother grabbed a pair of scissors on his nightstand and stabbed my dad in the side with it to get him off. Yeah and I was about ages 4-8 when this stuff happened. He doesnt do that anymore though it stopped when I was 13 I think. He doesnt raise a hand or have violent actions anymore, at most he just yells now, but its rare for arguments to break out now. And im sure he is ashamed of what he's done because he loves me, he may be dissapointed that im not a ideal son, but im his son and he does provide finnically for my family, and when all this happened, i told my mom to leave him. That I wanted nothing to do with him and he took that hard, that I wanted nothing to do with him and he changed over time. Ha. But back to the part I was at. But I never left the room anymore after my grandfather hit my mom. And it only made the loneliness worse. I dont remember the exact age I was while i was there and dont remember much because I think I repressed most of my memories there, my brother lived in the attic of the house and we both refer to it as the ""hell hole"". after we left there and got a house, and again I moved and lost all the weight I gained in the hell hole. This time I did have two friends, but they only lasted half of the school year so Middle School was very lonely for me besides the few months of friends I had. The arguments with my dad and brother got worse and worse. One day I was downstairs on my dads Xbox One, playing Dead Rising 3 with a internet friend I had played with since I was 7 and my dad and brother broke into a fist fight, my brother swung on him and my dad out him in a lock to prevent the fight from going further. The entire thing happened while my other grandmother was visiting and her and my mom tried to pry them apart. but my grandmother burned her leg on our wooden stove which caused both my dad and brother to stop and help her. The entire time i was in tears and just continued playing Dead Rising 3, this was the first time I used video games to cope with something. My mom then kicked my brother out the house because my dad said 'he needs to go or I go"" and my mom cant work (she used to be able to, but there was an accident at work where she fainted and disrupted her neck, herniated disk, which causes her not to sleep for days. When this happens she eventually just passes out due to lack of sleep and ends up falling while standing up somewhere in the house. One time it got really bad when we lived with my grandparents my dad went to check on my mom yelled out for my grandmother to call the ambulance, my grandmother did so and yelled in terror as she saw my mom unconcious on the bathroom floor covered in blood. My dad came into the room to check on me and he told me everything was okay, but he was covered in my moms blood. I never got up to see what happened, I was frozen in fear and crying and it was made worse by my grandmothers reaction, the fact that my dad asked my grandmother to ask for a ambulance, the fact that my mothers blood was on his shirt and just everything about that night. I learned later that she passed out from the lack of sleep and hit her gums on a mirror which caused all the blood) but since my mom cant work and my dad was the only source of income.. She kicked my brother out, but she knew  he had lots of friends and other family members he could stay with. Fast Forward in the same house a bit. One day my mom was going through on of those things where she cant sleep and she entered my room and asked me something that I dont remember while I was playing COD Ghosts, I asked her if she could bring me up something to drink and she did, but when she got up to my room she passed out. my dad rushed to help her as did I. He looked at me and said ""you couldnt get the fucking drink yourself? You had her get it when she hasnt been sleeping. Glad to see her son looking out for her"" and I went back into my room and sobbed for a long time. Him constantly blaming me doesnt stop there. After a while, we moved.. Yet again. But this time into my third uncles basement (he was the only one who didnt live with my grandmother) And we had the whole basement so it was a hell of a lot better that the hell hole (grandparents house) but again, I didnt have any friends at this new location either. But I did meet a girl one day, and we eventually started dating and it was amazing, I was the happiest I had ever been before, I didnt care that i didnt have other friends or that I lived in a basement. I had someone that cared about me and i was happy. I started to open up a little to her, I was always a very closed mouth person that didnt open up and she hated that I almost never opened up to her. Part of the reason for that was because when I opened up to new friends (on the internet) within 2 months they would abandon me and I didnt want to lose her. We moved again to Florida and I continued to date this girl (it was long distance, she never lived in the same state and YES IT WASNT A 40 year old man, we skyped a lot so I saw her face a lot). Also my brother moved to FLorida with us and lives in a trailer about 5 minutes away. She told me she loved me one day and ill never forget what she said ""I know you dont believe in love at this age, I know its silly to think that people our age can love (i was 14) but I love you"" and I told her that I loved her too, which i did. I really did love her. She was there for me while my parents would argue and I would lay in my room sobbing (the basement was very big so my uncle made a separate room for me) She was there while I was depressed, She was even there when I sat in the bathroom in the basement and told her that I wanted to kill myself. I didnt deserve her. But on to Florida. One night I was arguing with my father and I punched a hole in a wall and I grabbed my switch blade for protection and went out at 12 at night for a walk. My mom didnt know I did this and thought I ran away so she sent my dad to drive around looking for me, but i was really far away. That night I used my switch blade to cut myself. A lot. I still have marks on my arm from that night, there was so many cuts that it went to the crease of my elbow, it took up my entire forearm. My mom saw these cuts and didnt do anything. my family is old fashioned and doesnt believe in mental therapy (I do) and I even told her how I felt, but I still havent seen a therapist nor will I ever. But after two years of being with this girl that I loved so much, she broke up with me... For another guy. It destroyed me. I was back to having no one again, I was alone and the girl I loved was with dating someone else, he got to hold her and kiss her while I never got to do those things. But even with all the emotional pain.. I started to feel nothing again and went numb. A few months later while i was walking around at school she texted me.. (we kept in contact because I really needed someone in my life, I couldnt be alone again) telling me that she wanted to get back together and I lost it, I texted her about how much of a bitch she was for thinking she could just come back like that (she didnt start out asking to come back, she just called me babe again as if we were automatically back together) and I told her ""fuck you"". It was the first time that either of us had said it towards the other.. But only I said it. She then told me that she would leave me alone and rot in a grave. She threatened to kill herself. And I, obviously not wanting her to die and was just letting out anger because she hurt me so deeply and thought everything was fine, I took her back. but it was even more rare for me to open up and each text I got, I assumed that she was leaving me again. She hated herself for putting me through what she did after she learned about how hurt I was. But it all eventually got back to normal and I was happy again, but I started getting more attached since I was even more afraid of her leaving. Not in a stalker, controlling type of way. But there were times when she would flat out ignore me, like i would message her 5 hours ago and she would be on Instagram liking photos for 10 minutes and not reply until 3 hours afterwards. I hated it because I assumed it was her way of leaving again, of distancing her self. it got to the point of her ignoring me for a day and a half and only messaged me at 11 at night, but she wasnt busy those days. She was at home, but guess what, she of course posted on Instagram and liked photos. Needless to say, when she ignored me I wasnt very nice to her when she decided to respond. I was a asshole. She'd text me all excited to talk and id tell her to leave me alone. I wanted to be alone so I wouldnt take out anger on her. But it let to arguments sometimes. Like she'd say ""im not on my phone all the time"" and yes that is a valid excuse, but id tell her ""yeah not on your phone yet you like and post on Instagram most of the day. ok."" Yeah I was a real asshole. But I just hated being ignored and forgotten about. Thats my biggest fear, that the people I love or care about wont remember me, that ill never cross their minds again. My name wont mean anything to them"" I couldve told her that, yes, but I didnt figure out why I hated being ignored so much until later. But most of the time we were happy, or I was happy at least. Then one day she left.. Again.. for another guy... Again. And that so far is the last time she left and im alone again. Ha its been two years, and im still not over her. I miss her so much. But our story with her doesnt end there. Months later she messaged me, needing someone to talk to, and I talked to her. But I would unsend my messages sometimes because I felt like a bother to her and she'd get mad at me for this. One time I unsent a message and resent the exact same message, but with more added and she got mad even after I told her it was the same message but with more on it she got even angrier saying ""ive grown sick of you"" and I would only respond ""im sorry"" and ""im sorry for bothering you""  She needed someone to talk to multiple times and each time I was there, then one day I was even lower than usual in my mood and I needed someone to talk to for a change so I reached out to her and she said ""I dont have time to deal with you right now"" . After all the times I was there for her, I needed one time for her to be there for me and she turned me away and it hurt. I told her I wouldnt bother her again and blocked her. Fast Forward to Sophmore year in High School and I was alone for a long time up to this point. But in one of my classes there was this girl and we started talking one day, it was in my biology class and she sat next to me on the double seated tables. She was singing Backstreet Boys to herself and she got to the part where they say ""backstreets back"" and out of instinct I finished it with ""alright"" and she got quite a laugh out of it considering id never spoken in my class until that point. But her and I started talking and clicked on every level. We even had these nicknames for each other, My name is Nik (Nick) and her name also started with a N, she was short and i was tall. All that mixed with the fact we were pretty much the same person, I called her Little N and she called me Big N. Yeah its stupid, but when you have a friend that you care for deeply, it doesnt matter. And thats what happened, we clicked on every level and cared for each other deeply after a while. Even at the start of the friendship I would try to push her away, but she never let me, like she knew what I was doing and why and refused to let me be alone again. She taught me to open up to her, and in turn she opened up to me. We got very close to each other. Then she started to talk to me less, started to stop teaming up with me during classwork that required a partner, talked to me even less. I knew what it meant, everyone I care about always abandons me, I was ready and expecting it the entire friendship. Then one day during class, I entered early (class was right after lunch and since I dont have friends and have really bad social anxiety so I didnt eat lunch in the cafeteria and still dont to this day) and the chairs were in a giant square around the classroom with no chairs on the side closest to the board. I sat down in one of the chairs at the end, and no one sat near me. The closest person was like 8 chairs away from me. I looked down, put my hoodie on and just wanted to get through this class already. Then I saw a pair of shoes peek into my vision, right in front of my chair, then the person sat down next to me and low and behold it was Little N. We did some light joking and at some point in the class my anxiety started going off and when that happens i put put my hand on my leg or a desk or any surface and knock. Like knocking a door at a rapid pace without moving your hand away. She always made fun of me when I did this ""no ones home"" she'd joke with me, but this time she didnt make fun of me, she reached over and placed her hand over mine and ran her thumb along the side of my hand back and forth. After doing this, a couple minutes later after she pulled her hand away she leaned closer and rested her head on my shoulder. I remember being pumped with anxiety and also wanting to just hug her right there and then. A month later she told me that she had feelings for me and I told her I felt the same, but she said no. Either for two reasons, at the time her emotionally abusive ex kept getting back together with her and she didnt want to hurt me (what she told me when I asked her why she wouldnt give us a chance) or because she did that thing that ive heard that women have started doing when they are bored (not all women obviously) where they fake flirt. Im sure its the latter. It all went downhill after that though. She started to ignore me, just like my ex had done, but the difference is, Little N would ignore me for a week before ignoring me for a month. and at this time Instagram had added that thing where if you hadnt talked to someone for two days, if you opened your dm's you would see the last time that person was on Instagram and it would always say ""active 10m ago"" or ""active now"" It got to the point of a near three month period of her ignoring me. But she did start talking to me again but the damage was done, I started to feel like a bother, like I was bothering her, that she only spoke to me cause she felt bad for me. I started unsending texts that I had sent to her because I didnt want to bother her (this was on Instagram). She'd even text me saying ""stop unsending your texts"" but I still did whenever I would go on Instagram and see my message that was sent had been sent like 17 hours ago and still no response I would unsend it. One day, recently I told her to just leave me alone and I pushed her away for the final time and uninstalled Instagram. The only reason I had it was to message her (I dont have any friends besides her lol) and for the past 7 months its just been her ignoring me from a span of a week or a month. Ive been alone since then. But im not done yet. remember earlier when I said i had a internet friend I had played with since i was 7? Well I had another friend that I played with since I was 6 or 7 and he passed away and it hit me very hard. Before my real life friends when I was 8, this guy was my first friend ever. My best friend, childhood bestfriend and he's gone. Im never going to say our inside jokes to him again, I wont hear his voice again and ill forget it one day. After that, a couple months pass and the uncle I used to go places with commits suicide. I live in Florida and he lived in New York, my family all pack and drive all the way there for the funeral. and I cried quite a lot and it was hard to see them close that casket knowing that, that was the last time ill see my uncle. Im now 17 in my Junior year in High school and my suicidal thoughts have been sounding more and more like good ideas and I dont know what to do. With all the emotional pain, I used to be able to numb myself and be fine, but now, even with numbing myself by not feeling emotions, I still feel worthless and alone and I just want to die. I dont want to be here anymore. Im so alone. Having absolutely no one is such a fucking hard and heavy thing to feel. And I dont mean FEELING like you have no one, I mean actually having no one. Its such a disabling feeling. Im not knocking people who feel alone but have people, im just saying that the emotions are obviously different cause they are different circumstances. But I just want to die, in the past week ive looked at my switch blade and thought about jamming it in my throat or opening my wrists, I dont want to be here anymore and I dont know what to do. Im sorry for making this post so long, im sorry to bother you and make you read all of it, but I really dont know what to do and I just want to die.",13Nov2018,1
64,"I don't know if anyone has had any similar experiences like this or not, I'm just looking to figure out how to get the old me back. As the title says I can't focus, at all. To exert the effort to write this is far more difficult than it should be. It's been like this for months, almost constantly. Some days I can't even get out of the house to go to class, I really want to, I just can't. I work on homework for hours and get next to nothing done. I feel hopeless and defeated. I wouldn't say depressed but I might not actually know what depression means, idk. I think it has to do with stress though. I've felt this way before, almost constantly, for 5 or 6 years from work. Now the stress is worse and the symptoms are worse, that's the correlation I came up with at least. Also, I may have some undiagnosed issue from when I was little. Here's a list of symptoms/behaviors ;

1. When I was little (like from 5 until I was about 10 or 11)I constantly thought everyone around me was watching me and when I'd leave the walls would flip down and they'd be running experiments and could see when I was coming with secret cameras and would flip the walls back and act normal before I could catch them. I'd leave the room and run back in to try to catch them, I never did. At a certain point it was really interfering with my life and I just decided if they were going to do whatever it was they were doing I couldn't stop them or it wasn't real then it didn't matter. Either way, I had to stop or I knew something bad was going to happen. I quit, and have never had a thought like that since. It took a year or two to fully accept but I did quit.
2. If I step on a crack I have to do it with the other foot in the same spot and then in 4 more places along my foot on each side to feel 'right'. If the crack was too small compared to how the first or last one felt I had to find another little crack to add to that spot. Still do. I also flex my calves or move my tongue from the roof to the floor to match up in between and on those yellow or white dotted lines in the road for lanes. Or the same with electrical poles.  Idk why.
3. Now current stuff, as mentioned before I have been drowning in stress for years. Not regular stress, the amount of problems that come my way are unproportionally and those around me have pointed it out as well. Simple things need followed up on, bad things happen at least every 6 months. But the last year has been an exponential growth. I was keeping up at first, then I started being late with paperwork, now I can't even get my wife's car to the shop to get a quote to submit to the insurance company and I'm just driving it without a mirror and a leaking door. I was the master of paperwork, state and federal forms were my expertise. Now I can barely read. I can still read, just anything longer than 15-20 words and I drift off and have to come back but can't find where I stopped and start over, rinse, repeat.
4. So physically and mentally (some are kind of interconnected so I'll just list them together), my head is swimming (like I'm drunk kinda), can't focus, no energy most of the time, hopelessness feeling (I'll sometimes press something sharp against me hard just so I can actually feel something, so I guess a void as well), anger is an emotion I can unleash though and sadness (maybe more like self pity, I've never cried as much as I have in the past 6 months), I had some paranoia constantly looking at our security cameras like someone was trying to get in or was in (that wasted too much time, I was more sleep deprived then), if it's quiet I can sometimes here an indistinguishable radio host (male) talking away about something I can't make out, I've heard a girl (around 14 or so) laugh but nothing was there, I heard a boy scream in pain downstairs but it was nothing, then a girl (20ish) scream like she was in agony with a whimper at the end. None of those were actually anyone and it was never in the same room as me except one time I heard two old ladies bickering about me being in the house and I needed to leave (just around the stairs railing 5 feet from me), this made me really upset because I live here and who are they so I ran over to approach them and tell them to shut up and I can be here if I want. I didn't think at the time that I should be telling them they need to leave because they don't live here, or why were there two noisy, bickering ladies so deep into my home. Those voices and screams are absolutely terrifying, the radio is kind of soothing though. I've also seen doors open and a dark figure of a person walk in and close the door and keep walking (I hear the floors crack even) and stop at a dark point and they just never emerge again. I tried to approach a couple but there is nothing there when I get a light to that point. And I've seen other dark masses or figures dart behind corners or they were 10 feet in front of me and slightly to the side but if I try to look directly then they are gone.

I do have a meeting next week with a counselor at the vet center but I've never had counseling before and I don't really see how talking to someone can make things better but I'm out of options now. I can't function. At all. And crap just keeps piling up. I'm assuming sleep deprivation makes me paranoid and after a certain point gives me auditory and visual hallucinations, that's not hard to believe. Same with the shapes, or it could have been my eyes adjusting to the light change. Swimming head and all that probably stress related somehow. And I've probably had compulsive behaviors my whole life, also obsessive but I know OCD is misused a lot and I'm not like Monk or something. E.g. if I start to research something or given a task I learn all the ins and outs, god forbid I be able to do that for homework, but it's kind of a family joke now. My brother is too hasty to do something and I take far too long even though I do know what I'm actually doing at that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, this is much longer than I meant. I'm sure I'm forgetting some stuff but if anyone has any insights on how to cope or resolve these kinds of issues I'd appreciate your perspective. Thanks.

66,"Background information: I have OCD, bordeline of diagnosis for autism, and some unknown anxiety problem. Typically I am not very anxious, but twice in life I have had very severe panic attack episodes, and the second instance caused severe anxiety for months afterwards, so I started medicine.

When I started the medicine I'm taking (citalopram hydrobromide [selexa]), I was really down for hours a day and anxious a lot. Then I started the medicine and regained a will to live. Also, time and medicine has largely eradicated my unknown anxiety problem, so now the only real anxiety I have is OCD related (what I mean is, not a large magnitude of anxiety; back to normal much lower level).

But for the past few weeks I've been pretty down again. And really irritable. Someone says/does something, I feel outraged, get depressed, and just stop doing what I need to do. I also get stressed out really easily and this causes me to get mad and also sad and stop doing things.... I was upset almost all day today.

A couple of friends thought it could be BPD, but I definitely don't meet all of the requirements.... so I really don't know what it is

I've been too unmotivated to go to bed on time and also get distracted like crazy studying. I really need to get myself help, but I don't know if I really want to. Frankly, I am butthurt that my parents (both medical professionals) hardly take my issues seriously, and only account for my obsessions so that I stop whining about it. My brother acted like it was my fault, and caused me a lot of anxiety, and my parents did almost nothing.

My boyfriend says that I'm worth it, but it feels almost impossible to imagine being worth it if even my own family hardly bats an eye at my suffering.

On top of that, there are two people I used to be good friends with. One (Friend1) with ADHD (*possible* autism but no one knows), the other (Friend2) with a slew of them including aspergers, depression, ADHD.

Friend1 is spoiled, inheriting a house debt-free, lives at home, and does not even have to work or do chores. Friend2 gets needed attention for her illnesses -- she gets medicine(s), doesn't have to work/school, lives at home, and her parents literally saved enough money and made family living arrangements for her entire natural life, because she may be too unstable to hold down a job. I also had Friend3 who lives at home, doesn't work/school, and just got government money for her disability (which I agree she needs, to be fair).

My parents let me suffer through untreated OCD for years without so much as getting me a therapist or even *telling me it's OCD.* And when my Mom stresses me and I tell her that she is stressing me, she gets crabby, and then stresses me more, or if not, still stresses me later.

I have a lot on my plate (school, part-time job) and just wish my parents would actually fucking acknowledge that hey, maybe it'd be nice if they gave me some help instead of being so apathetic and oblivious. I *know* that they know better, but they just don't care that much. Even when my brother stressed me to the point of having bad anxiety, cutting, and finally moving out for a month until he moved out for good (transfer to university), my parents still did not take my side -- apparently somehow both of us were at fault. Yeah, and it's a terminally ill cancer patient's fault that he's dying.

TL;DR I know I ought to get help, and I am starting to really struggle. I can't bring myself to, though, because I feel like if my own parents don't care, then why should I act so deserving.",13Nov2018,1
67,"So, like the title says, I’ve recently started suffering from disassociation or like the feeling that nothing is real. I noticed this was happening sometimes while I was driving late at night and thought it was just me being tired, but in the past 2 weeks or so it has gotten to the point where it’s scaring the shit out of me. 

I keep having moments where nothing feels real, or it does feel real, but it feels like it’s not happening *now*. For example, I’m in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend and he just visited a week ago. I was lying next to him in bed and he was telling me a story about his family and I just kept staring at the ceiling and had to touch his face multiple times to try and feel some sort of attachment to reality, and nothing worked. I felt like that moment right then felt just as real as when I was lying in bed alone a week before, and I felt like there was no distinguishable differences between the two and like either one of them could just have easily been occurring at that moment. Even now, 2 weeks later, I’ll think back on that moment and still feel like it wasn’t real. 

The scary part is that it’s been happening almost every time I get in the car. It makes me not want to drive. I will feel like I could swerve into the canyons and nothing would happen because it’s not real, and during those moments I try SO hard to pull myself out, like rolling my windows down and feeling the air on my face but nothing works until I get home. The other night I got home around midnight and still felt like I wasn’t *here*, so I went and stood in the middle of the intersection by my house so my heart would start racing and I could be brought back to reality. 

I’m basically just looking for anyone to give me advice or tell me about any similar experience they’ve had. I know this post is long so thank you if you’ve read this far. I go to therapy but my therapist had to evacuate due to local wildfires and so I can’t see her for another week or so. These events seem to have come out of nowhere, although I have been more stressed lately and my grandmother died on October 4th. ",13Nov2018,1

69,"Recently I haven't been able to function as a human, in fact I feel an utter disconnect. As if I'm not even a part of the human race. I exist at work, then I'm on the couch. I haven't slept in a bed in months, I haven't really slept all that much in quite awhile either. It's like I'm saving all my energy to function at work, just to blend in with society and because I need the money to pay bills. I don't remember the last time I did anything hygienic, I can't bring myself to eat more than once a day, if that. I can't concentrate on anything, in an hour I'll watch 10 mins of some random Netflix show, read a few pages in three different books, and play three different games on my Xbox. I'm angry, constantly frustrated and consistently empty. It's just like a deep nothingness inside, but I wouldn't classify it as apathy. My mind is always racing, I can hardly track the tangents, or even the subjects of my thoughts. I'm having a hard time remembering things, I haven't been able to find my house keys in two weeks now. I've been paranoid, to the point of absurdity. I've been fighting the urge to carve words into my skin, not because I want to feel pain, but because words are beautiful, words are ideas, thoughts and concepts. Although, I know the pain would help, pain seems to center me.

That being said, I feel like I cannot be officially be diagnosed with anything, primarily because it would destroy my dreams, the career I've been pursuing for the last six years. However, I'm equally as terrified that I'm losing my mind

70,"While I may contemplate the concept of suicide once in a while, I have never felt compelled to do it. All the same, I have noticed that I am rather indifferent toward whether I live or die, in fact I am indifferent toward nearly all aspects of my life. It really hit me hard a few days ago when I was at the beach watching the sunset and standing at the edge of a cliff. I looked  down at the rock below and thought to myself, ""What if I just slipped and fell right now?"" What scares me now is that the concept of dying right there didn't frighten me, in fact it seemed almost like it would be a relief. I have been hit by a car because of this lack of interest in self preservation. I saw it coming, and instead of trying to move out of the way I just let it happen.

71,"cw: Drowning, murder, dead bodies, abuse, suicide

When I was 5 years old, I ran away from my mother when she wasn't looking. I ran to the next door neighbor's and jumped in their 5 foot pool. I had no idea how to swim, I remember dipping my one leg in and then feeling as if I was being pulled in by some force, and the last thing I remember is seeing my big toe going deeper and deeper, pulling the rest of me. I wasn't afraid, in fact, I was curious. It was then that I drowned, that my mother realized I wasn't home and ran panicking to the neighbor's, and that the neighbor's son pulled my limp body out of the pool and began giving performing cpr on me. It only took a few moments to revive me, and I remember being extremely angry at this young man for taking me out of the pool, when I was just trying to have a swim. I had no idea that I had drowned or that I had needed cpr, they had to tell me. This is one of my first memories.  
5 was also the year that I first remember abuse occuring from my father. We came home from seeing a popular superhero movie at the theater, and my sister and I had been in the back seat pretending that we were superheroes and had our own abilities. My 'superpower' was that I had super strength. My sister insisted I prove it, so when we got home I was the last one in the door and I slammed it super hard with my 'super strength' and surprised my sister. I remember us both being excited until our father approached, began screaming at me about disrespecting his house, and then picked me off of the ground by my neck, choking me. I don't remember being choked as much as I remember seeing my feet lifting off the ground and being 'taller' than I ever had before, and then being dropped and crumpling on the ground.

Around this time or possibly a year or so later, my mother and sister and I were involved in a serious car accident on our street while leaving the house. Our road was a dead end but there was one street connected to it that had a stop sign that someone blew through and T-boned our car, pushing it into the ditch on the other side of the road. The airbags were deployed, my mother's door was broken not only on the outside but on the inside she ripped out the door handle trying to escape and scratching the interior, as we all thought the car was on fire since there was smoke everywhere. My mother broke her ribs but my sister and I were okay. The next thing I remember was the emts being there, and walking home with my sister to tell our other sister that mom was being taken to the hospital. 

Then there was the dead body incident. When I was in grade school, a body was found in a vehicle at my school. A teenage boy had murdered his father because he had been grounded and his phone taken away. I remember finding out the news on a Myspace chat room I frequented with my friends after school one day. My friend told me about the body, and I remember feeling extremely disturbed with the fact that I had been at school that day playing on the playground at recess only a few meters away from a dead man. I started tingling everywhere and breathing heavily. I explained from my friends that I needed to go, that I felt like I was having a heart attack and that I could feel this man's pain. They acted like I was crazy and gave me all the :rollingeye: emoticons that they could.

My teenager years were especially hard, being abused and struggling with an abusive custody situation that officials and lawyers continued to allow happen despite several attempts of intervention. I got caught in the act of attempting suicide by my father, whose immediate response was to take me to the police station where they would detain me for hours, lecture me about how good I had it and how ungrateful I was, and in general be treated like a criminal. I wanted to try again, until I was finally allowed to see my mother and she cried and held me in her arms for what seemed like forever and promised me she'd make everything better and fight for me. I was 13 then, she was finally successful of saving me from that house and those horrible, cruel people when I was 16.

When I was 19, a friend committed suicide by blowing his head off. Several of our friends in the group had all seen the signs and saw it coming up until a few hours before, but chose to ignore it. I could hardly look at them during the funeral, which, by the way, was open casket. I still can't fathom why in the hell his family chose to do so, especially since he ended up being cremated. I was unable to be up close and personal with the body due to the fact that the mortician had used a flesh colored clay to essentially sculpt him a new face that was eerie, waxy, and looked nothing like him. I felt nauseous and cold, I had to leave after that. I was truly shocked and disturbed by how okay these people were, not only with themselves, but with sitting and chatting and laughing amongst themselves so close to a dead person.

Fast forward to today. The recent death of a friend that I grew up with has traumatized me so much more than the previous one. It all boils down to one thing: he chose to die, she didn't. She had so many goals and aspirations for her future. She loved her life, her job, her family and her friends. This was something that he had thought about and contemplated for a long time, whereas she probably never thought that she'd die so young once. In fact, she thought she'd live to 100. She reminded me a lot of myself in that way and many others.  I also only knew him for a couple years, our adult years. He taught me how to drink and play beer pong, but she taught me how to love, laugh, and be unconditionally kind to others. I watched her grow from a small child into a blossoming young adult that was loved by many. 

I really want there to be hope for me. I want to finally heal from years of traumatic experiences and get over my current and constant fear of death. I should be spending my days doing things I love with the people I love, like she did. I should be making a difference, teaching people things, and helping others. But I can't help others if I can't help myself. I can't be making others happy when I myself am not happy. I want to move past all of this, but there's so many layers and things I don't remember, and I have a feeling that my time here is limited. I desperately *want* all of these things, I don't know what's stopping me.",13Nov2018,1

73,"I need serious help. I'm not sure what information matters, so I'm hoping whoever answers can help me by asking some questions? 

I have been to a few therapists, but nothing long term. I feel like counseling and therapy is so...basic. I feel like I've learned more researching on my own than I have from any therapist - even an expensive, reputable one. But I also am completely unsure of myself so maybe I'm just dumb. I can't afford it anyway. 

My mind is scattered, always all over the place, and paranoid. I'm worried people won't like me, like REALLLLY worried. It affects me every day, every single relationship.. I can never be enough, and at the same time, I am over the top. I am functioning, but barely. People, from the outside, see me as scattered brained. I have been called ditzy, inconsiderate, rude, goofy, flaky, flighty...etc.  But I have also been called classy, mature, intelligent., etc. 

But I do not identify with those at all. I feel like those describe my anxiety and the front I put on. It only make me more confused because I really want to be able to see myself clearly and not as this offensive monster I think I am. I know this makes me seem flaky, which I am.  I know they know I'm fake.. and I've been called htat many times. Because I am. 

I have a pretty weird family - diverse, crazy, eccentric, and not supportive. I have a weird history and I definitely have a weird perspective on life. 

I have always been curious about people, but lately, I have been obsessing about them and who they are and how they deal with things. I feel almost detached - like an alien looking at humans like I'm not one of them!

I just feel bizarre in all I am. I am also depressed, I'm sure of it. I'm sure I have been depressed for over 10 years. 

I can't seem to get help, because I feel like I do odd things in order to manipulate people into thinking I'm normal. If that makes sense. I have made such a habit out of pretending, that I come off as all over the place. I don't even know what's real anymore... or what is really me.

I just think people don't think it is as serious as I think it is. But, likke I said, I am so unsure of myself that I also think I could be being dramatic and stupid. I'm also angry at myself and other people for all of this. I want someone to blame, and I have so many people to blame, but it helps nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just so confused as to how to get help. I don't know anyone else that can relate to me. I feel like most of these problems manifest in my relationships with other people - which are getting fewer and fewer. People still seem to tolerate me, but because I have never seemed seriously mentally ill, people seem to be annoyed or mad at me all the time. I take it really hard when people get mad at me (or even irritated or annoyed) and it pushes me deeper and deeper into my bad image of myself. Every single person's opinion is valuable to me - and I am always at odds with myself.

It lasts maybe 30-60 seconds, then another minute or two if breathing into a pillow or shirt to get back to normal. Then it's like nothing happened, in back to my activity and only remember that I had an ""attack"" but none of the symptoms are lingering.

93,"My mental health is pretty bad at the moment and I'm already seeing a therapist, psychiatrist and my school counsellor, so please don't just recommend to talk to a professional. 

Along other problems, I really struggle with anxiety and social phobia, which already makes going to school hard for me. I constantly feel like everyone in class is staring at me and making fun of me, even though I know that nobody would care enough to spend all their time doing that. Still though, it makes me so anxious that I can't focus on the lesson, (TW: slight mention of self harm, maybe?) scratch and pinch my hands and arms until I bleed, bite my lips until they are raw, shake and flinch and just want to run out of the room, smash my head against the wall and cry. I have no control over it and constantly feel like I'm on the verge of a really ugly panic attack. 

Still though, I try to still go to school because I'm already redoing the year and will get kicked out without a diploma (or any qualifications) if I fail again, which honestly is not helping my anxiety. 

Today periods 1-4 were free and I only had to come for 5th and 6th Italian. Our clock downstairs used to be ahead of time, so I thought I'd be arriving a bit early for class. When I was at school I noticed that I was ten minutes late though, so my parents probably fixed the clock without telling me. The thought of getting into the classroom that late for 5th period when everyone was already working  just gave me this gut twisting feeling and I knew I couldn't do it. I searched for the school counsellor but she wasn't in her office. I told myself I just gotta do it, rip it off like a band-aid or whatever but... on my to the classroom I just froze and felt a panic attack coming on that I wasn't able to stop. So I went into one of the bathroom stalls and just completely broke down and couldn't calm down. I knew I wouldn't be able to go to class. So I left and just went home but I can't help but feel terrible about skipping the class.

101,"I spent many of my teenage years being severely depressed. Took all the meds (none of which were the least bit helpful, and had trouble stepping down from them), saw therapists and psychiatrists, was even hospitalized at one point. Eventually, I got better, bit by bit, did a lot of walking and talking with my funny, smart Dad. Ended up joining the service, learned a lot, found a great wife, and got a great education. Got out of the service and found a very rewarding, but not great paying job helping others. Wife is great, but doesn't know how to help me. Neither do I. 

Now my Dad is dying. He's been fighting cancer for a while now, and I see him slipping away from us. My mother is devastated, and looks terrible. Dad had a long talk with me the other day about what he wanted for funeral plans, and I could just tell, he is ready to go. 

Man, I am slipping back into that black depression now, badly.  I can barely breathe, feel like there is a concrete wall on my back. Talked to my doctor about it, and she said she would be willing to put me back on my old meds, but it was ""situational"" and I needed to find a grief support group.

I'm a recent University grad who, like many of my friends, experienced a series of mental health-related setbacks in higher ed. After I graduated, myself and a couple of my friends decided to incorporate a non-profit organization as a side project that will sponsor (i.e. offer non-repayable grants) for mental health research projects by early career scholars in Canada. 

If you're wondering why I'm bothering to tell you guys about this, it's because I think our social media channels might be of interest to you. On our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stratasfoundation/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stratasfoundation/), we plan on summarizing a recent mental health research paper every other day (with citation). 

We're still in our very early stages (soft launched last month), but we hope to raise $40,000+ by next summer. Oh, and if you're put off by the amount of drug-centric research, we hope you still give us a shot. Due to popular interest, we decided to run a small research series on controlled substance use and mental health outcomes - but this is set to wrap up by next week.

If you're interested, give us a follow! If not, that's perfectly alright - any feedback or help would be appreciated beyond words.

I thought I'd finally share my story, yes I am an exhibitionist and I can say that now, but 6 months ago I would never have said that...

I had this problem ever since I entered puberty but never really thought about it, never really got in trouble with the police or anyone just a few slaps on the wrist and told to keep my clothes on.

Anyway so my wife and I had a really crappy year last year, 10,000x more stress that anyone needs or deserves in the world so to cut a long story short, I started posting nude photos online to help relieve my stress (and yes it did and still does but i am not here to write about that). Most of what I was posting was just selfies nothing crazy, but things got slightly out of hand and in the end my wife found out, and was crazy upset and angry at me (which is totally understandable).

It is a weird and difficult condition that I don't want to get out of control (as that could be realllllly bad)!

i still love being naked and being seen but i've been learning how to control myself, and it is way harder than you'd think...

122,"I was talking with my group of friends (we live together in a university dormitory) last night and from all of sudden the topic turned about me not sharing my feelings and secrets with them, like ever. They said I am building a wall around myself and I don't let anyone close enough. They said I should talk to them in private sometimes, so they can get to know me better. I told them that I don't believe that once we move out of the dorm we would ever meet again, or even chat on the internet. I told them that I used to have some very good friends during high school and I was certain that we would keep our friendships after graduation but they all forgot me. I tried to keep connecting them, inviting them to have a drink or a meal and they nearly always declined, even that few events weren't special, just 1-2 hours of talking about old memories and that's it. 

I told them I don't believe in long lasting friendships like that anymore and I don't feel like investing more time into any of their companies because I don't want to feel that sadness again that someone doesn't care about me anymore who used to be very important in my life. They said that they want to be my friends for real, that they wouldn't forget me, I should break that wall and let them close. However they don't know me, that I'm socializing way more than I used to do it a few years ago. That it's a big step that I'm spending a few hours in the backyard talking with them almost every day. My ex-roommate who knows me for a longer time also confirmed it. I get easily tired from socializing and I don't feel myself well all the time when I am with them but I just realized that burying myself into video games is not any better either, it just makes the time fly without giving much satisfaction, and I'm already short on time. 

I would like to open myself more but I just don't want to feel that sadness again when people forget me. And I'm hella sure they would. I rarely talk, and once I gather my strength to open my mouth, when I'm sure this time I wouldn't say something stupid  that would haunt me at night, they just interrupt me, like they wouldn't even care. I'm just a listener most of the time. And when I'm talking I always think about what they think about me after gaining that piece of information. I hear how they talk in the back of each other and the only thing I can think about what they would say about me. I'd love to be myself in front of them, but I know that they want to see who I show, not who I am. Honestly I just want to run away, get out of this, forget them, let them forget me, meet new people, hope they would be better to me, hope they could love me for who I am, but it happened already so many times and it didn't get better. I'm so jealous of those who keep saying they still have their childhood friends. I just feel like I don't belong in a society, and it surprises me that they suddenly want to be my good friends.

This research study has been approved by Lindenwood University's Institutional Review Board (IRB). If you are interested in taking part in this study please read the description below and click on the link. 

Please consider taking part in my research project involving the stigmatization of trauma. It is a short survey that will take approximately 10 minutes of your time. To take this survey you must be at least 18 years or older and have experienced trauma at some point in your life. Please note that all traumatic experiences are unique to the individual and will not be evaluated on severity. I understand that everyone has their own ways of dealing with, and processing, trauma. Therefore, my goal is NOT to determine the severity but instead, learn about how individuals have coped with trauma. I believe more attention needs to be drawn to this subject and my hope for this research study is to do just that. This survey is 100% voluntary and if at any point you feel uncomfortable you may opt out of taking it. This survey is also completely anonymous so I will not be able to personally identify you nor your results. Thank you in advance for your contribution to my research.

THANK YOU. YOU ARE APPRECIATED.

130,"By 'stereotypical nerd' I am specifically talking about nerdy guys who look like the guy in this photo - https://imgur.com/a/nRfdlD8

I also like looking up weird ways people have died and one time I made a forum thread about weird ways people have died (just out of curiosity) and someone replied about how some years ago a stereotypical nerd was being harassed so one day the nerd locked this person in a bathroom and then the nerd got him to the ground, put him in a scissor hold and choked him until he died of asphyxiation.

Something about that turned me on so much I kind of became obsessed. Every few years I look at news cases to see if it's happened again and it has. In 2014 in Oregon a man was found dead in his car. The bruises on his neck suggested that he was strangled between a set of thighs, and the victim was last seen alive at a restaurant with three stereotypical looking skinny nerds. There was one in 2013 too and the nerdy guy had a Facebook profile. His victim too died of asphyxiation when he put his neck in a scissor hold after an argument - the nerd squeezed his neck for ten minutes. I remember seeing the description of the case and when I saw that he was choked via legs, my heart began to beat rapidly wondering if a nerdy guy did it, and then when I saw his photo it was like a dream come true for me.

I already liked stereotypical nerds before all of this but something about this makes me really love them for some reason. Like I act super nice to nerdy guys all the time because I respect how deceptively deadly their thighs can be and I feel somewhat jealous of the people who died. Like maybe not to death but just having a nerd jump on me and wrap his thighs across my neck and give it a squeeze.

I probably sound like an insane person but I semi hope that a nerd goes and constricts someone to death with his thighs again soon so it gets into the news. I managed to find 4-5 cases since the 80's but it's probably more considering a lot of murder cases never make it into the news. Also I managed to find like 10 cases of people strangling people with their thighs and 4-5 cases were fatal and the fatal ones were...you guessed it, the ones from nerds.

133,"About 5 years ago, following years of being unsuccessfully treated for depression and taking a lot of different drugs, I came to the conclusion I had borderline personality disorder. I won't bore you with the details but everything I read about BPD made sense to my situation. It felt strangely positive to have realised this. My psychiatrist at the time was dismissive of my self-diagnosis and suggested that I could be bipolar. I have never had a manic episode and disagreed strongly. I quit going to this psychiatrist and decided to see if I could manage myself. A year or so later I went to a different doctor who suggested CBT. I reluctantly had one session and decided it wasn't for me. I had read that BPD symptoms decline with age and at this stage I had developed my own coping mechanisms so I decided again to manage it myself.

I am now 32 and it doesn't seem to be getting better. I would never even consider harming myself but frankly I find just getting by to be hard work. I don't know if this makes sense but I feel exhausted just calming by brain. I know that my emotional overreactions to everything aren't real and will eventually calm down but I often find by the time they do my brain is overreacting to something else. If I go too long without down-time, I feel like my head is going to explode.

I have a beautiful spouse, a loving family, a lovely job and no financial issues. But I feel like I'm just going through the motions. The only emotions I feel are overreactions to perceived shame. I don't even know if I love anyone or have any real feelings.

Have any of you gone through something similar? Did it just get better? Would you advise me to go back for treatment? I know that I never gave CBT a fair shot but I find I have a very closed mindset toward it and get frustrated easily. I don't know if I have the energy or patience for it but I really don't want to start taking drugs again either.

135,"So, I am a 21(M) and I just want thoughts on emotions I guess. In that I feel like I have always had a very big emotional imbalance.

When I was a toddler my parents had me tested for autism because I was just really weird(I was not autistic). Yet until grade 8 I just had issues. For the first 3 years of elementary I would hide in closets(apparently) and on the first day of kindergarten I remember hiding under  something the entire class.

So I have always had social anxiety. It wasn't until grade 8 and highschool that I had good friends who normaled me out per say.

Yet from here on out certain emotions I could never control. I would cry for no reason as a kid. Or let's say I get called a name or one of my siblings punches me. I always remember being confused as to why I am crying because I wasn't really that upset.

This is similar to if I do something wrong at work of elsewhere. I guess I can't handle that because I get basically suicidally depressed if I get yelled at. I just can't control it. If I get angry at myself for something, or a couple weeks worth of procrastinating there is nothing I can do to stem the wave of emotions. 

This worries me.  As no matter how reasonable I try to be with myself it just takes complete control. I will be fine in the morning. But two weeks later or whenever I trigger (I guess) myself again it's the same.

This is the same for crushes I guess. I go on a coffee chat with someone. And even though it didnt lead anywhere I just can't stop thinking about them. It's again something I have tried to control.

I guess over the years I have just tried to shove all my emotions in. I hide them well. I am calm and collected at work, and at school and to family. 

But idk. I just feel like there is a darkness inside me. A voice when I was younger telling me to do things I definitely didn't want to do. Just thoughts that shocked me that I had no clue where they come from. 

It has slightly come back imo, but with a voice saying really racist things in my head. I don't feel like it's me thinking it. As it shocks me and I dont understand why. I am definitely not racist.

I don't know. I know I am not exactly mentally stable. I have basically had depression for a long, long time. I just don't know why I can't control my emotions. On one hand when I lose control I get consumed by darkness. Yet I also jump between new grand ideas for my life. To travel the world. Or to pursue this career or that.

136,"I’m 16 years old, I am a male. You know that feeling you have when you just wake up? That few seconds where you are just realizing where you are and remembering who you are. It only lasts about 3 seconds. But who knows? Maybe this is just me.

But throughout my entire life I’ve gotten this feeling at random times. It only happened every now and then. Nothing to be concerned about. But as time has gone by, there have been certain times where this feeling keeps happening to me over and over again. Sometimes I have this feeling as much as once every 2-3 minutes. Other times it never stops, and I’m stuck in this loop until I fall asleep. But I’ve come to notice that the 2 experiences I just stated only happen when I am either pulling an all nighter, or am high off marijuana. I have only smoked about 3-4 times within the past 2 years, 

But throughout the past month, I’ve been getting this feeling every few minutes. It doesn’t matter what I’m doing. I could be playing video games, hanging out with friends, or even when I’m in school. It just keeps happening. It’s almost as if things don’t feel real. 

If this is a sleep problem, then I don’t know what to do. My sleep schedule is kind of odd. Some nights I’ll sleep as little as 3 hours. Then the next night I’ll sleep as much as 16 hours. It’s pretty random. I never know when I’ll wake up. 

But if anybody has any advice I’d appreciate it.

137,"We're in a long distance relationship, so the information I've been getting the last few months have all been via text/messenger/calls. Essentially, his brother (who is 16) has anger issues as well as suicidal tendencies. He's gone out on their property with a rope and duct tape before, a few times iirc, but has always come back. So I believe there's some part of him that panics before he actually does it and then he stops the attempt. But the attempts still continue. More recently he had a rag stuffed in his jacket that he was going to use to attempt to choke or strangle himself. Luckily my boyfriend caught him as he was trying to leave and talked him into coming back inside. They sat down and had a conversation where his brother told him what he'd planned on doing. They talked it over for a while, then went to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

The help he has received - He was inpatient at a facility in Alabama for about three weeks. They adjusted his medications (I'm not entirely sure what he was taking; I can find out if it's important), involved him in group therapy and he had an assigned counselor. He hated it there. My boyfriend said he seemed a little more docile and definitely didn't lash out like he has done to them in the past, but as soon as he got home, he started right back up with his outbursts. It doesn't seem to have prepared him for coping or dealing with his issues outside of the facility. 

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've gathered, he has a very specific view of the world. He thinks things should be a certain way and the world needs to conform to his view instead of vice versa. He thinks he's going to be alone forever, he frequently tells his parents that they didn't raise him right and that's why he is the way he is, women hate him, he is disappointed with everyone in the world because they aren't conforming to his ideals. He does fine in high school as far as grades, but says he really dislikes the other students. His mother offered to get him into a different school and he brushed her off. He's particularly abrasive towards her as opposed to his brother and father.

&amp;#x200B;

They're kind of grasping at straws at this point. In my mind it's either going to come down to he's either going to succeed in taking his life, or they're going to have to book him more long-term in a facility. I don't know if anyone else has been in a situation or knows of a situation similar to this, or has any advice or suggestions as to what can be done. Thanks in advance.",13Nov2018,1

140,"Hi guys - I appreciate that this post is an unusual one, but hear me out.

I'm currently looking to interview people who have suffered from depression, either currently or in the past. Our conversation would be formally recorded, but this would be done on an entirely confidential basis. 

My aim is to incorporate this interview into a *one-off, 5-minute creative audio programme entitled* ‘*Lost at Sea’*. I am an **MA student at Goldsmiths, University of London**, and the piece will initially be shared just within my department. With your consent, it can also be shared in the public domain in order to raise awareness. My end goal is to inspire others to discuss their mental health issues, and contribute to ending the stigma against speaking out.

*I fully understand that it can be difficult to discuss mental health problems.* I come from a family background of depression and anxiety issues, and have struggled myself in the last few years. The interviews, therefore, can be taken at whatever pace you deem fit, and you are more than welcome to assist me in the editing process afterwards. *Interviews cannot be done over the phone* – we would most likely have to arrange a meeting place: one that suits you.

If this is something that you'd be interested, then drop me a message here on Reddit, and hopefully we can agree something. If you have any general questions about the project as you are unsure, then by all means - ask away! I'm happy to provide any information you might need.

Remember; you're not alone. Don't bottle it up, because its a burden that no one should have to carry.

Thanks guys,

143,"I can't seem to find any information online about this. I feel like there must be some formal term for it, but if there is, I certainly haven't been able to identify it. 

What is it called when someone seems to have a fairly extreme aversion to initiating communication? There's someone in my family who's like this and I can honestly say that I've never seen this sort of behavior in anyone else. A lot of times the aversion to initiating conversation isn't due to to some sort of existing conflict (i.e. giving someone the cold shoulder when you're angry with them). It can be as simple as not being the one to initiate conversation in the morning, even by doing something as simple as saying good morning. If there's something that obviously needs discussing, they usually won't bring it up first - they'll wait for you to do it. 

The only time it gets complicated is when they don't initiate communication when it would make logical sense to do so, and then get upset or feel disappointed when other people aren't as ""on top of"" keeping tabs on them as they would like. For example, if they aren't feeling well (this person has a health condition) they won't tell you about it - they expect you to periodically check in with them to see how they're doing. Same thing goes for when they're upset about something - you have to be the one to go and pry the information out of them. If they have a project they're working on and need help, they won't ask you for help - they'll wait until you ask how they're doing first, and even then, you usually have to be the one to offer up your services. 

The strange thing is that this isn't motivated by secrecy or a desire to not open up. This person almost always *wants* you to communicate with them - they just won't initiate it most of the time. 

I'm having trouble figuring out what could be the motivation for this kind of behavior. If it would be advantageous to initiate communication (because most people aren't mind readers), either because you need emotional support or you need help with something, it makes logical sense that you would initiate that communication. I don't know what would make someone feel so averse to doing this. Is it a pride thing? Is it because they might somehow feel devalued being the one doing the asking/initiating?

This person doesn't have low self esteem either, which further confuses the situation. I understand how it might be annoying, upsetting, or embarrassing to feel like you're initiating communication in every scenario, because the people around you never take the time to ask you how you're feeling, how you're doing, if you need help with something, etc. But I can't wrap my head around the reverse situation - feeling upset by a lack of communication while simultaneously making very little effort to initiate it.

146,"My adult brother who is in his 30s, lives at home, doesn't have any friends (and hasn't had friends since a long time, maybe 15 years ago), but he does have a job which I helped him apply for.

I am worried since it seems to me that he is depressed and has been depressed since a long time. 

He tells me that if I where to leave or every time I leave home, he gets depressed or will get depressed, that I am the only person he can talk to, the only friend he has. I sometimes live at home and sometimes I don't and am currently trying to become fully independent. I don't want to leave him in this state but I also can't just not go on with my life. 

My parents don't help, since they think trying to make him do anything will result in him becoming even more depressed, since he normally reacts very hurt if you try to suggest he should exercise, for example. I also think one parent (who seems to have narcissistic tendencies) doesn't want us to leave and by extension doesn't want him to leave anyway, since she also says we are the only ones who she can talk to and who make her happy.

I guess that he might be depressed, maybe he is just very dependent....but whichever way, I want him to get on with his life, too and at least not feel as if I were the only person in the world that he can talk to and that if I leave, everything will fall apart. 

I am going to therapy, not only because of my family situation but also because I have been depressed and have generalized anxiety. I wish my brother would do something similar, at least try to socialize with others. I have also suggested to him that he should go to events which interest him, which he has done one or two times, but apparently this hasn't change anything.

147,"Wondering if anyone has some insights on possible things to look into.

I became aware that a relative of someone close to me infrequently has complete, irretrievable gaps in memory. The occurrences of her memory gaps are years apart and cover a span of seconds to maybe a minute at most and she is immediately aware of their occurrences after it’s passed.

The first occurrence she’s aware of was around 3rd grade in class, where she was reading a school text, then the next thing she remembers is holding a pencil and seeing a word underlined. She was verbally punished by the teacher (“why did you do this? This isn’t good behaviour” etc), but according to her, she was too filled with dread asking herself “where did the pencil I’m holding come from? Why did I underline? Did I even underline?” to properly respond to the teacher. She points to this as the starting point for existential anxiety/depression-like thoughts in how she sees the validity of her own memory.   

A few have occurred over the next 15 years, but none in the last few years that I’ve known her, otherwise they follow the same pattern: recall normal sequence of events - gap -  recall normal sequence of events + asking what happened in the gap. 
She describes it like someone edited out 20 seconds of a movie in the middle of scene, the stream of visuals has no break but you know you just saw a break in the causal sequence. Behaviour-wise her family can’t point to any occurrence of unresponsiveness, seizures, etc.

She won’t see a dr. about it unless she has some kind of rough target, as she doesn’t seem to fit to other memory loss categories ( antero/retrograde amnesia, TIA, epilepsy, dissociative amnesia/fugue, etc.)

This survey is anonymous and information obtained will not be personally identifiable. After results have been analyzed and computed, the responses will be destroyed. My contact info, as well as my advising faculty member's info, is disclosed in the survey if you feel you have any questions or concerns. The purpose of this survey is strictly research. 

Please consider taking part in my research project involving the stigmatization of trauma. It is a short survey that will take approximately 10 minutes of your time. To take this survey you must be at least 18 years or older and have experienced trauma at some point in your life. Please note that all traumatic experiences are unique to the individual and will not be evaluated on severity. I understand that everyone has their own ways of dealing with, and processing, trauma. Therefore, my goal is NOT to determine the severity but instead, learn about how individuals have coped with trauma. This survey is 100% voluntary and if at any point you feel uncomfortable you may opt out of taking it. This survey is also completely anonymous so I will not be able to personally identify you nor your results. Thank you in advance for your contribution to my research.

It comes out of nowhere, it comes randomly, I can't do a thing to relax. I tried medicine to calm me down, it never worked, I tried exercising, I tried getting myself occupied, nothing. I have never smoked or drinked in my entire life, I live in a very... angry family, my mom gets enraged very very fast and it spreads like a disease. It's intoxicating. I have decent grades, I don't stress too much over school, I'm planning on studying medicine after finishing military service next gear. It's lately been getting much much worse. I have a girlfriend, she's a very kind, loving and gentle person, she's quite sensitive to things. A couple of months ago I have gotten to such a degree where I have considered suicide many times, a few times I almost did it, I have attempted it  6 months ago with overdosing medication. I have a chronic migraine, I live with pain each and every day of my life. Once I tried to open up to my girlfriend, told her about the suicide attempts, the thoughts, she's been super supportive over it and tried to help me a lot until eventually she gave out. She was so worried it started affecting her daily life, her grades declined, I has to snap out of it. One of the hardest things for me is being male. It's so riddled with old stereotypes on how a man is SUPPOSED to be and is so closed minded in my circle of people that I have nobody to talk to. I have tried the schools therapist, but after a few attempts it just made it worse. I feel guilty about bring emotional all the time, I almost never talk or complain about my emotions. But it has been getting serious as of late. I lack sleep. I sleep a few hours at night, even thoe every 2 or 3 days I get a lot of sleep which is nice. I have constant nightmares of either driving and crashing a car, being brutally murdered or being attacked by various insects. I wake up either i  terror, flailing my arms around myself or in cold sweat. I also have very scary dreams which are very hard to describe. A few months back my computer broke down and my friends of 10 years abandoned me completely. I get very angry very fast, sometimes I get anxiety attacks or panic attacks ( rarely ) I loose motivation and will to do stuff quite easily and snapping out of it is very very hard for me.

152,"Had a couple of seizures a month apart about six to nine months ago. They were the only two i had in 21 years of life. Since then, seizing is a fear of mine and I’ve dreamt of it quite often. But recently, I’ve been having these “episodes” and I cannot tell if they are panic attacks. The episodes consist of either no buildup or a slight feeling of discomfort. Then i have  10-20 minutes of intense symptoms. I become disoriented, dizzy, I get tingling in my fingers/hands and crotch. Everything feels like a dream and I feel like I’m depersonalized or going through derealization. I feel like I need to lie down and get scared I’m going to have another seizure. They never happen at home, but they’ve happened in varying intensities so far: once at work where i felt like i had just taken acid, twice in classes where things start to feel fake and like deja vu-ish, and I had another one about an hour ago during my haircut. I can retain composure and I don’t think anyone can tell but it’s frightening. I feel like I’m going to seize any second. Eventually they pass after like 10-20 minutes and I don’t seize, and I just feel tired and kind of muted afterwards. 

So, my question is: are these panic attacks? They don’t feel so much panicky and I thought panic attacks wouldn’t entail so much derealization as what happens to me. The only thing i can think they are would be panic attacks but they are not what i imagined them to be like. I start to panic about seizing but my breathing doesn’t really change and the biggest thing I notice is it feels like a chaotic depersonalization/derealization attack mixed with dizziness. My face also got extremely pale the first time I had it happened.

I take kratom and drink coffee daily, although I’ve reduced my use by 2/3 for the kratom and by probably 4/5 for the caffeine. I drink on occasion. These attacks seem to follow no ryhme or reason and I cannot predict when they will happen. I’m on a bunch of meds for depression and anxiety, including olanzipine, which is what I attribute the original seizures to along with binge amounts of kratom. I’m on a lower dose of olanzapine and have started on viibryd a few months ago. I take a small dose of Prozac everyday as well and can take hydrozyzine three  as needed up to 150mg a day.

If anyone can help me figure out what these “attacks” are, it’d be great to be able to tell my doctor. Thanks, I can provide additional input in the comment sections. ",13Nov2018,1
153,My ex girlfriend and I were together for 2+ years I loved her and we were a pretty happy couple for the most part. She came up with a little bit of a troubled family and doesn’t know her dad much. A month of so before we broke up for good she would break up with me everyday and get back together and I figured she was just going through something. Then she would start using the words that show up above the keyboard every night and typing paragraphs with them and when it would say something wrong she would claim the parapgraphs meant something. I tried to stay with her but it got to the point where I didn’t know what was going on and she broke up with me again and I just stopped pursuing.

The obvious meaning would be that well, she wants or deserves a vacation. The hidden meaning would be along the lines of ""this conversation is torture and I want to get out of it right now"".

I'm not showing it. But i feel broken. My dad comes home at night, my mom doesn't even try to understand why i'm so sad. They argue a lot. I haven't had a real friend i could talk to in maybe two years so this is the only way i can get this out of me. Any advice would be appreciated.. ",13Nov2018,1

166,"This won't be a long post, I just wanted to comment on how it's starting to feel more and more like the whole universe it built around giving me the tiniest spot of light, only to then suck me deep into the void again.

I've been replaying the same song for about an hour to re-hear ""Everywhere I look is a mirror, Everywhere I stand isn't solid ground"" because that's exactly how I've been feeling.

For the past 2-3 years I've never stood on solid ground. Wether the ground I stand on is forged from sadness or happiness, it always seems to crumble leaving me more scarred and hurt with every level I drop.

I started with just anxiety, which turned into anxiety and PTSD; which turned into anxiety, PTSD, and Dysthymia; which turned into anxiety, PTSD, Dysthymia and ADHD; Which turned into anxiety, PTSD, Dysthymia, ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder.

I'm aware some of these might have always been with me, and my diagnosis might have just made me more cognitive about them.. Yet they seem to be getting worse at every turn. ",13Nov2018,1
167,"Hey,
I'm half a term into my A levels in the UK (Grade 12 for US comparison?) and I feel so lost.
I have always struggled with motivation problems, but never this bad, always being mildly lazy, not tidying up after myself, washing up etc. But recently I've been really truly down.
More down than I have ever been, I've never been like this in my life; questioning my own mental health or even considering anything other than 'I'm just a happy kid'.

But the truth is I feel terrible. I find myself being unable to do anything, I drag myself into school when I have classes and wing my way through them without attempting to absorb any information. I put off homework assignments until the very last possible moment. My already very small amount of notes I have taken aren't organised in anyway to help me either and I fear if I leave it too long I'll be in too deep.It feel like I know I should be doing these things but my arms won't lift. Or my legs won't let me go to the table. I find myself wanting to curl up, and my eyes forcing themselves shut, hoping we can sleep it all off. I just feel so emotionally and mentally drained it seems so incredibly daunting to me. Like climbing Everest. Which is simply insane for a 17 y/o boy, that he can't even get up to write an essay...

I'm in a constant state of putting off work until I'm threatened by teachers to finally do it, but then they slam me with more work the next day...  then I restart the cycle. It's so utterly shattering.

I have no fun anymore, I take no joy in watching a movie or playing any sort of video game, I simply do it as a means to shirk my assignments and responsibilities, something, anything to preoccupy my mind for a while so I forget I'm like this all of a sudden. I forced a smile everyday for the past 4 weeks as I couldn't allow myself to think I was anything other than perfectly fine.
I had hoped this feeling would subside but it simply hasn't. It feels like I'm constantly weighed down, my body won't help me do anything, but my brain is desperately trying to do literally anything. I mask this pain in snide and sarcastic undertones which I claim is humorous, but it's quite the opposite, it's frankly sad and very terrifying. It's already taken me an hour and countless tears to be able to type this very post.
I can't go to my mother as she is of the opinion that depression or melancholy feelings of self pity are all made up and fake, or for attention. I have no father, and no friends whom would listen to me without laughing.

I just need help, or someone to talk to, or anything I don't know. Should I waste even more school time by missing my already low attended classes to go to the health center on-site? It seems ridiculous I should even have to ask this I'm sure but everything is slamming together in my mind that I can't even see the point in doing that. Should I see a doctor? I don't want my mum to be disappointed or laugh at what a weakling I've become.
Please, if anybody could help Im just in total need and I've never been in such a dark place before, I don't know what to do.

170,"Back story: three years ago I suffered a horrible mental breakdown. Two years ago I tried to kill myself. I was stuck and felt no chance of escape. 

My dream took me on several journeys back in time. First the helpless feeling of my parents telling me at 15 that I am too young to ""play around with kitchen tools"" (I was going to cook my own meal) and instead eat fast food like them.

Second, was the helpless feeling of looking at a time schedule on the wall of when to work and seeing all my hours dictated randomly (fast food job). The sensation was not even correctly processing, instead I just obeyed. My life existed only for the company.

Third, was the helpless feeling of being stuck in a major with a group-like thought 100% the opposite to my personality. They were heavy consumers with the high likelihood of hoarding. I felt like I was being ripped alive, especially when I tried to gain insight on their thinking style.

How exactly are these things related to hoarding? Well the environment was so cognitively interconnected with my choices that its negative influence felt like a natural part of my personality. It made unattractive choices and decisions attractive.

Let me repeat that again: it made unattractive choices attractive. 

This, to me, was and still is extremely problematic.  How much influence has the environment shaped my cognitive decision making abilities? 

For example, I thought anything for a time was better than being stuck in my parents' hoarding home: military front lines, jail, death, any job. But the more I psychoanalyzed my parents' behavior, the more red flags I see in other people's behavior. Like huge, avoid this person, red flags. I find it, for example, extremely difficult to talk to business people that are in sales, marketing, accounting, finance as I get extremely triggered. 

My college major was in the business school due to helpless attraction (before realizing the red flags).

I am still technically living in the hoarding home but I am burning some savings at AirBNBs to deprogram some of the helpless behavior if that makes sense.

However this is not sustainable forever (limited funds). What are some jobs/careers that are anti-hoarding in the direct or indirect sense? For example I cannot see myself doing fast food work ever again. Polluting is a sister to hoarding and we have a large enough debt already to mother nature (which no balance sheet really ever tends to show).  

I already feel so old (26) and that most of my life has disappeared. What are your thoughts and suggestions? I have no college degree and I have been out of work for over two years. ",13Nov2018,1
171,"My dad accepts no responsibility for his actions and how they have caused my major self esteem, self worth, confidence and happiness issues. He is unsupportive and where I used to talk to him about everything, over the years I have learnt I can't go to him when I am low because he will bring it up to me spitefully in an argument. He once even threw at me in a very spiteful way that I should check the symptoms of BPD because I probably have it (I don't but it's the fact he would throw a diagnosis at me in an argument that demonstrates what I mean).

I genuinely believe a combination of the way my dad treated me in my teens and the trauma surrounding it still to this day is a massive part of why I struggle to feel happy and value myself. He refuses to see how he wronged me and that makes it even worse. I am so standard text book messed up by my parents it's a joke. Any idiot could see. It's such a cliché. I don't really know what I want from him but I would just like him to stop implying that I feel this way because of me and who I am and accept how badly he treated me. I don't know why I need him to but I just need him to.",13Nov2018,1
172,"So I have a girlfriend who loves me very much, but I feel like she can’t exactly wrap her head around what it feels like to have depression (yes I’ve been medically diagnosed, prescribed etc) she constantly writes it off as just me being sad, so she suggested deleting apps off my phone relating to fashion, something I look at often because it interests me, because it may be causing my depression because I can’t have what I’m looking at. I don’t really agree with that at all because there’s no real relation to me, but I tried it anyways because I figured it couldn’t hurt. Then she told me that if I would get off my ass and go outside then i wouldn’t be in this situation, instead of sitting in my dorm. Not that I disagree with that, but I’m out often for classes, eating, etc. but then she goes on to tell me that i don’t deserve to be at such a beautiful campus because I never go outside. I don’t know how to talk to her and explain to her what it feels like and how nothing she says to me actually helps without me coming off like a jackass. Any advice  would be helpful",13Nov2018,1

175,"About a week ago I got a job offer as an EMR (emergency medical responder) with the ambulance in my town. I'm super excited because my current job makes me super unhappy and is just not something I'm proud of.

I've thought about applying for the EMR position and put it off a couple times now as I was focusing on bettering my mental health and not wanting to rush into things. Anyway I live in a small area so someone got the word that I was interested and now everything is in motion and I should be starting around Christmas if all goes well. 

The point of this story is that when I got the offer everyone was super excited including me! (And nervous obviously this isn't just an average job) but now that some time has went by people keep bringing up other options like transferring to a different department with my current job or going back to school. I just feel like they don't think I'm capable because of my past with mental health.

I've been researching and watching information about this job for quite some time now. I'm aware that this job will not be easy and I will see things. I know people are just worried for me but it's disheartening and makings me wonder if I'm doing the right thing...",13Nov2018,1
