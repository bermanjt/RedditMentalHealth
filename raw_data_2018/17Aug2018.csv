1,"Lately I’ve been starting to feel this way a lot with my mental problems. I know there isn’t an actual discovered cure for mental health problems yet, but I keep having these feelings. Or maybe it’s just wishful thinking or a leap of faith, or maybe I’m actually onto something for myself but can’t quite pinpoint the answer.",17Aug2018,9
2,"Everything is going really well for me now and I’m at a point in my life where I couldn’t ask for more. I just moved away from home, have an amazing partner, and a job i love. So you’d think I’d be happy— and I think I am happy, but something doesn’t feel right.

I have plenty to do, but some days I don’t want to do any of it. On those days or on the days that I finish my work for the day, I just feel empty and bored, but nothing sounds good to do. 

It’s like I’m unsatisfied, but I don’t know what I want/need?? 

Anyone feel/ever felt this way? ",17Aug2018,1
3,"Recently, I made my first post on reddit in /r/confessions regarding my suicidal thoughts lately.  It was fairly vague and there's a bit more to it. Only a couple people responded to it, but it did get me thinking. Technically, I'm posing a question here but it involves mental health.  If I'm posting in the wrong place feel free to move or remove this. 

Now, I'm looking to start logging my thoughts and story. I've never told the whole story to anyone, for various reasons. So I'd like to do that here on reddit. Why not do it in front of uncountable strangers?  Won't be able to do it in just one post. Likely do it over the course of multiple posts in no particular order or subject. 

What would be the best way to do this?  Or am I just wasting my time?

Also, on a side note, I want to thank the two people who initially responded to my first post.  Might not save me, but did buy me some time, maybe. If you see this, thank you. ",17Aug2018,1

5,"For me it is socialization. I spend a lot of time isolated. I moved back to Canada after living in Colorado for a long time. Not long after I came back my depression finally caused me to crash and crash hard. It happened just after moving back to Canada so I didn't have time to make friends. I am and extreme introvert and dealing with severe depression on top of that doesn't help so I have a hard time approaching people. Well lets be hones I just can't get myself to approach people and talk to them. 

I think that having socialization in my life would lift the depression a little bit. I know it wouldn't be a fix all but I think it would help and take away, not all, but a lot of the loneliness I feel and prevent me from isolating myself so much.",17Aug2018,10
6,"I know there are a lot of coping strategies out there for depression and anxiety, some work for people some don't. I thought this would be a good place for people to list some of their coping strategies that others may not know about and hopefully spark some conversation as to what is working for others.

The two coping strategies that I find really useful for me are:

1. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). More specifically the thought challenge. Challenging the thought with evidence that supports the thought and evidence that doesn't support the thought. Most of the time I will find more evidence that does not support the thought and then I am able to change the thought into something more positive and realistic.
2. Mindfulness. I use the head space app. Its free for the first 10 days of mindfulness practice but it's an expensive app to get full access so I keep repeating the 10 days as they are useful enough for me. I find that with the deep breathing while practicing mindfulness helps to bring the anxiety levels down and just be in the present, not dwelling on the past or the future helps to calm my mind a bit.

What are some of your coping strategies that you use?",17Aug2018,8
7,"I preface this by saying that I am not normally an anxious person. I'm not currently on any drug , prescription or recreational, outside of over-the-counter allergy meds. I currently work 2 jobs. My sleep schedule is kinda screwy. 3-4 hours of sleep then I go to a part time job for 5 hours, then sleep 2-3 more hours before going to my full-time job. I've been doing this for almost 2 years now. At the end of last week, I noted that I had begun to feel nervous as I attempted to sleep. I became uneasy when entering my apartment, entering a restroom through a closed door, or coming around a blind corner. Almost expecting someone on the other side. It slowly began to effect what sleep I was getting at night. I find myself restless, looking towards my door (studio apartment), as if someone could creep in at any moment. At first, I ignored it. I assumed it was similar to when I think about death too much and have trouble falling asleep, but realized this was different. Today was the worst day so far. I didn't sleep at all before my first job. When I got up to go to that job, I realized that I was extremely anxious and seemingly paranoid. I've never experienced paranoia like this before. I caught myself looking over my shoulder a lot. I usually listen to music when I commute but I didn't this time as I wanted to be able to hear everything around me. I walked down the stairs of my building and saw a guy get out of his car and head towards the building. Not unusual for my complex even at 3am. But I was very suspicious of this guy. He wasn't doing anything other than walking to the building. Not even near me. While driving to work I kept looking in my rearview mirror and checking my back seat. When I arrived to my job I was jittery, had started nervously scratching my beard. I was also jumpy. The slightest noise made me jump.I began breathing quick short breaths and even found myself getting emotional. It took about 2 hours of trying to focus on my work before these symptoms stopped. I have no idea what's happening with me. It's made me concerned about where my mind is going. I don't see a theraopist, as I've never had a reason to. I haven't hit my head, or experienced any trauma. What can I do? ",17Aug2018,1

I finally told her about my past thoughts of suicide and how I'm really scared for them to come back. I've had this fear that anytime I bring up suicide that I'll automatically be hospitalized against my will. She was so open with talking about it that I wish I had started to see her sooner. She helped me get a handle on the fact that I am seeking help now means that I'm doing what I can to prevent that from happening.

11,"If anyone could help me with my life right now, it’d really help me. I’ve never shared this with anyone and I don’t know where to turn, so I thought I’d post it here. I don’t know where else to go.



Here’s my story. I’m 17 years old, going into my senior year of high school. I have a mostly happy life and I’m thankful and grateful for being here. But sometimes I get into really bad moods. I’ve never once gotten angry or projected these moods onto anybody else, they only happen when I’m by myself. When I’m alone, my insecurities CONSTANTLY pop into my head and I don’t know why. I get extremely sad and just can’t pull myself out of it when it happens until the next day. My insecurities are summed up with several social problems. I didn’t get the chance to age well with my peers- i.e. my parents are extremely strict. My parents were divorced when I was 2, and it was hard for me to fit in throughout middle and high school. I consider myself to be quite funny and likable if anyone gets to know me, but I’ve always had to go to my dad’s on the weekends so there was never time for me to hang out with friends( he lives 45 mins away). This progressed throughout summers and by age 14, my parents made me get a full time job working minimum wage at a grocery store. I got treated like crap while I was there for 2 years, and I never had time to hang out with anyone. I got a job last summer at a Marina, and it’s fun-but this time I work 60 hours a week. I have ZERO time to myself, let alone time for friends. I’ve been getting really really sad every night I go home from work. I think about how every year I start off with remnants of friends I had, then slowly get more and more as the year progresses. Then I’m left at a crossroad in June. All these friends are to be lost for the next three months, having fun with each other while I go back to work. Next September I have to recycle the process. I’ve never had a friend I can really vent to or anything. I’ve had one friend over all summer and that was for 2 hours.. anyway, you get the picture. My parents don’t allow me to go out much, if at all. So I’m stuck at home. Another insecurity I have is my siblings. I have a step-brother and step-sister, each on opposite sides of the family. The brother is my step dads kid, the sister is my step mom’s. I can’t help but feel like total baggage when I go from house to house to visit parents. I always felt like I’ve been number two my whole life, with no house to confide in. My dad sees pieces of my mother in me that he doesn’t like, and my mom sees pieces of my dad in me that she doesn’t like. She even calls me out and says, “you’re acting like your father”. It cuts deep. These houses leave me in the middle. I can’t talk to girls worth a damn. I’m so bad at it that most numbers I get are from my outside appearance, just being a basketball player. I’ve never had a TRUE girlfriend or even been on a real date since like 7th grade. I know my mom and Dad are disappointed  and it’s absolutely embarrassing. These are most of my insecurities.. all these add up and over the years of my life I’ve done nothing but either take them out on a track or a basketball court.. while I’m fit and should have a good self esteem, I don’t because nobody knows how terribly antisocial I am. I can’t fit in with the basketball players very well either, I’m insecure about my upper body strength- my arms are like noodles. A few times I’ve been running really hard trying to forget my insecurities as they keep popping up that I’ve thrown up while running(working too hard) and started crying and just kept running. It’s happened on the court too (but only when I’m by myself). I keep telling myself that the fact that I’m a varsity starter will make up for these issues, but deep down I know they won’t. I’m crying as I’m writing this. I don’t know what is wrong with me. If anyone has cared enough to read this far, thank you so much. I appreciate even your time. If possible, I really need help. Can anyone provide any insight? I’m a wreck right now.",17Aug2018,3

14,"(throwaway for privacy)

I've been unhappy for as long as I can remember, but my childhood was great and I have a wonderful family and great friends. I wouldn't say it's depression, it's just a general discontent with myself and my life that has persisted for years. I've struggled with disordered eating, self harm, and a variety of hard drugs for years, and just recently quit coke. I had an emotionally abusive relationship for a year and a half, left him 8 months ago. I have just never been happy, content, anything like that. I've always searched for something in drugs, but I have no idea what it is I'm looking for. I've always been pushing my own limits, seeing how much I can take, how much my body and mind can handle. I was medicated for anxiety and depression but I didn't see enough of a change so I stopped. I see pieces of myself in symptoms of ADHD, OCD, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression, but it doesn't feel like enough is wrong with me to have any single one of those illnesses for real. I have a therapist and I'm working with him, but theres just this huge part of me that has negative motivations that I don't understand, and all this pain I can't explain the origin of. If I start thinking about it too much I get emotional, because its scary to feel like you don't know yourself and can't explain the feelings you're having. Why do I keep making all these bad choices even though I know they'll hurt me? I don't get it. Does anyone know what could be wrong with me? ",17Aug2018,1

24,"So to preface this I just have to specify that I'm not suicidal. I'm kinda the opposite to be honest. I love life, so that's not my issue.

However, I have a massive issue with anxiety. Like, for example, I had to get an injection for my ankylosing spondylitis (Or spine arthritis), and I heard that it was extremely painful the night before. I ended up thinking about it until it happened, and I couldn't get it out of my mind, to the point where I couldn't sleep until 3 am (I usually fall asleep at midnight).

Well one day when I was about 9, I started thinking about death. I tried to process what happens after death, and it was haunting me. I got the idea in my head that once you die, you're stuck in a pure white void for all eternity, but you keep your memories and the ability to think. This haunted me for 3 years before I got it out of my head, thinking that odds are even if that happened it would be impossible that we kept our memories and the ability to think.

Similar thoughts came back to me over this year, only they're a lot worse. They're around basically every night, and I just feel horrible when it comes into my head. I just wanna cry most of the time. This time though it's not like I have an idea on what it'd be like after death. I'm just terrified of the unknown.

The fear's really hard to describe for me, but I hope that's enough. I can go into more detail in replies. I also have Aspergers, which apparently can contribute to this? Also I'm only 15, idk if that matters. 

For anyone who knows what I have, do you think there's a way to fix it? I feel bad about asking for therapy, as it's pretty expensive, so this is the best I can do.

TL;DR: I have haunting thoughts of life after death every night, and they keep me awake often. They also make me feel horrible and I can't deal with it anymore.",17Aug2018,2
25,"Hi, first time posting on this sub.  


I'm a 21 year old male, hounded by strange, intrusive thoughts lately. These thoughts are irrational and occur so much that I'm starting to question my sanity as I'm writing this. The cause is silly, but I do hope someone can help me alleviate it in any way, because it's making it hard to live life properly at the moment.  


I've always been an overthinker with a wild imagination, ever since I was a kid. Most kids at school would say that I lived in my own world. I always found that offensive, but I got over that because it is kinda true.  


Anyways, I love learning new things and I love philosophy. My mind sometimes works in strange patterns and I'm fascinated with deconstructing things I think about until it becomes obsessive. I've also noticed I like things to match, or be in perfect order. I would say that maybe I have OCD, but I have never been properly diagnosed so I only use it as a joke when somebody gets weirded out over my behavior.  


So, I've gotten into a relationship last year, and I'm still with my girlfriend at the time of writing this. I love her to bits, and I know she loves me too. However, since the relationship got more serious, my insecurities started to emerge and it has made my life quite a hassle since then.  


I have so many intrusive thoughts, be it of her cheating, breaking up with me and all the other clingy partner stuff. However, unlike in my previous relationships, I've learned to not act out on my irrational feelings but to try and be supportive whenever she goes out or something, because she is a very active girl and likes to have her space. So, I often supress those feelings, and later overanalyze the situation.  


One of the things I've noticed in my life, and have been increasingly focusing on, is that when I expect something to happen a certain way it will happen differently than what I imagined, or not at all. I know it sounds silly, but whenever I want a good outcome I keep imagining the worst case scenario on purpose, hoping that I could somehow magically alter the universe with my thoughts and expectations.  


For example, whenever I feel uneasy, I imagine my girlfriend will break up with me the night we see each other. She never does, and we mostly go out and have fun. Now, this has translated into other parts of my life and is driving me nuts. I'm obsessively looking at the outcome of every situation, even the tiniest and most irrelevant bits, and saying to myself for example: ""When I turn on wi-fi on my phone, I will see his/her/their reply. When it doesn't happen, and usually it doesn't, I get freaked out and do more and more of these patterns in my head. I even go retroactively in my head to analyze situations in my past that may have been like this as well.  


It's so exhausting and preventing me from leading a normal life at the moment. It feels like I'm stuck in my head. Even as I'm writing this I'm thinking ""I'm expecting a lot of comments helping me, and that's why nobody will reply."" I don't want to drive myself insane with this, how can I stop these thoughts ?  


Thanks to anyone who finds time to reply. :)",17Aug2018,1
26,"I know that generally, people are very considerate to those living with mental illnesses, but of course, there are a select few who aren't as considerate and could use a wake-up check. 

Earlier today, I was on my way home around 20 minutes from where I live by public transit. On the subway, on my way home, I was sitting down playing games on my phone. I looked up and I saw a woman, maybe in her late 50's. I considered offering her my seat, but I decided not to because there were a dozen people around me sitting as well who just as easily could've offered her a seat. 

I'm not a selfish person. I didn't offer her my seat because I'm selfish and thought I needed to sit more than she did, I didn't offer it because just the thought of approaching her was terrifying. As a person living with anxiety, I was incredibly afraid to just approach her and offer, which was why I was hoping one of the people around me could offer theirs because I couldn't do it myself.

A woman on the subway confronted me, and me only for this. She went up to me and said, ""if you bothered to look up from your phone, you could realize that some people need the seat more than you do."" This was one of the worst moments I've ever faced because of my anxiety. I don't understand why the woman confronted me specifically, as there were dozens of people around me on their phones as well who didn't offer their seat. 

That was the worst moment I've ever faced because of my anxiety. I felt embarrassed, and felt that people were judging me after I got up. It has even gotten to the point where I feel too afraid to take public transit anymore because I'm afraid of a situation like this occuring again. 

I know to some, this may seem petty, but for me, this was very difficult. As it does for most, my anxiety makes it hard for me to do any action without feeling afraid or simply anxious. 

I wish the woman who confronted me and put me in this situation had considered other possibilities as to why I didn't offer my seat, instead of assuming that I was too carried away with being on my phone.

Bad things always happen on holiday, they are more frequent to happen than at home. 

I really don’t want to get in that car, I am afraid, for some reason angry. My chest is even beginning to hurt. Top it off a family member and their kids are going to stay at the house.

Mental health options are very limited in our country but he was recommended a clinic by his doctor, and he has been to a couple of sessions. I'm not sure what they discuss obviously, but after his last two sessions he has been extremely sensitive and insecure about things that he feels are inadequacies in his character. We had a blazing row last night because I mentioned going to back to college next month, and he has never been. He accused me of thinking I was better than him etc. Afterwards he apologised and said thy'd been talking about it in therapy and he was just really paranoid about it but now he's started to wonder if he should continue in therapy because he feels so crap about himself afterwards. I didn’t have this experience when I went, so I’m wondering if it’s just something that he needs to power through for a few more sessions until it pays off, or does he maybe need to find another counsellor?

'Why aren't you working?' 'What are you working on?' 'Why are you so lazy?'. The more they nag me the less I want to do it, and I know thats a big problem too. It's my stupid shit pride that gets in the way of taking care of myself. I've lost all my motivation to do what I love and my hobbies are lying in the dust now and have been for about a year.

 I understand that they want me to get a job and be successful, however my specialty is rare enough in Hong Kong and I cannot speak Cantonese, which automatically puts me at a handicap, I don't want to do any teaching/store jobs either, but I will if push comes to shove. 

I am trans, FTM, my parents also do not care about that, sweep it under the rug and pretend it doesn't exist.  I'm terrified to ask them if I can go back to therapy to see my gender therapist. I doubt they would agree. They are pushing me to work in England but I don't want to leave Hong Kong, its safe here and yet if feel like I have no future, but I've still applied to all the jobs I can find and done some networking already. 

I also don't want to leave because of my girlfriend, shes a very kind, supportive and sweet person and wants me to be happy, but I can't help but feel life we'd drift if we did a long distance relationship (even though our relationship is that of close friends and i doubt that would happen), I have no idea how she can work and come along if I do land a job in England (visas etc are hard). I have attachment issues and I've been trying to work them out into something more manageable and healthy because I am too desperate and clingy since my last partner cheated on me. Even though I gave them three chances to leave so our relationship didn't suffer. 

I know I'm a very emotional person, I'm not ungrateful for my life up until now. I really appreciate the people I've met and done things for me just because they're nice. But I feel like I have nothing to of value, dysphoric and I always feel like I want to jump off a roof one day. I promised to a lot of people I wouldn't.

I have had depression before and learnt how to deal with my mild anxiety when I was going to a therapist, but it has gotten so much worse over the last year, that I just couldn't take it anymore. My mind is at it's limit for thoughts now.

He told me that I have social anxiety combined with some sort of panic anxiety (what he called it) but that it might actually be AvPD (Avoidant Personality Disorder) but that he would have to try and put me on anti anxiety meds for a little while to see if that helped or what.

Now I am just sitting here with my newly bought meds, looking up everything that I can about AvPD, and it just makes so much sense. Everything is basically what my life is and has been. And I don't know how to feel... Am I upset about a possible diagnosis? Am I happy that I am getting help? I don't know what to do or think.

For weeks now I’ve been barely sleeping/ sleeping with the lights on because I keep having bad dreams.

It’s like every time I try and focus on these positive things there’s some dark thought that creeps up and devours the happy thought.

-I start a new job on Monday, “No one at work will like you and you aren’t capable of handling the workload” 

-I’m in a relationship with someone I love, “you’re not good enough for him and he’s going to realize it and either leave you or cheat on you like every other relationship before this” 

-I have amazing friends and roommates, “they tolerate you and are your friends for convenience and they’ll get tired of you”

66,"TLDR: On the last straw with my somewhat toxic mother, after having a depression relapse on holiday, arguing with her. I don’t know the steps forward. I need help.


I’m a 24 year old undergraduate student from the UK. I’m currently on holiday with my mother and father in Canada. Today my mother exploded at me because I’m having a depression day.

My head is splitting. My muscles are aching. It’s taking a huge amount of energy to do anything, I’m surprised I even managed to shower at 9am this morning. She yelled at me because I went back to bed, and started mentioning my symptoms. I got yelled at for leaving the towels on the bathroom floor, despite there being a huge amount of water from the shower leaking onto the floor, and now she doesn’t have towels. I’ve apparently ruined her entire holiday because of my depression. She got angry because I couldn’t put my contacts in and they were burning my eyes, and my meds that I’m on have a side effect of making my muscles ache a lot. Hence the whole staying in bed thing and just waiting for it to cease.

It then escalated to, oh, I spent so much money on you and you’re just going to spend the day on bed (I should note she bought me some loose leaf tea yesterday, despite me wanting to buy it myself but she butted in at the checkout). She went off in a huff, to go find my dad who wisely decided to get some fresh air during all of this. I closed the door, and may have been petty and changed the Netflix account password which I pay for. She came back, calling me a spiteful little bitch, going on about how my ex was right to leave me because I’m such a chore, how I shouldn’t be at university due to my severe exam anxiety, that I won’t get anywhere in life, that I should just go kill myself, that she wishes I weren’t her daughter. Etc. You get the idea. She’s also decided to take the noise cancelling headphones I use to calm myself down with panic attacks and disassociation. Yay.

No matter how I try to explain it, over the many years I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety, she’s never going to understand it because she’s never suffered from it. She claims herself as a mix between Christian and Buddhist, however she says awful things to me and acts petty back to me, and calls herself high and mighty. She’s definitely of a higher moral standing than anyone in the room right now.

I’m aware that she’s wrong in her perspective. I’ve spent countless times arguing with her about how my depression affects me, and I also understand it’s difficult for her from a parent’s perspective. But she’s very materialistic, and thinks that providing the roof over my head is the only support I need, god forbid I need emotional support for a mental health issue. I understand that I don’t always react in the right way. I shout back at her in the heat of the moment. Yes, the Netflix password changing was petty, but I’m not sure whether it was me trying to assert some control over the situation of her taking my stuff, or just angry at her. 

This isn’t the first situation of it’s kind. This happened back in 2012 too. Apparently I ruined her entire holiday by needing a couple of rest days in bed to recover and get my headspace back in the right arena. I’ve caused them to work full time because they didn’t want me to get a maintenance loan for my studies (despite being fully willing to do so). She’s angry because she spends so much money on me (on things I don’t normally need, but she buys anyway because she just does) and then feels that I’m not grateful because of my depression and everything’s always about me. On the contrary, as I said, I wanted to take out loans because I know my parents can’t work full time forever, and that I need to stand on my own two feet, however they stopped me. 

I just don’t know how to deal with this situation anymore. Living at university has made me realise how much better my mental health is when I’m away from her. But I’m financially dependent on my parents at the moment (I can’t get a maintenance loan due to the fact they’re high earners). Ideally I just want to move out to my own place, but due to my mental health conditions and studying, I can’t commit to a job otherwise I’ll just burn out. I have four more years left of my degree (BSC and masters combo). 

I guess all I’m looking for is some advice on how to move forward with this.

If you want to accomplish the goals in your life, that Dream life that you’ve always thought of, it starts with \* mindset \*. BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. I really mean, fully and truly believe in yourself. Obvious right? But that’s just the thing. People have dreams, but they don’t pursue it because deep down they feel inadequate, they don’t believe in themselves. That’s when the saying “The only person stopping you is yourself.” To them its up in the clouds, unreachable, and will “never happen in their reality.” 

Set yourself aside from those people, and dig deep down into yourself and believe that you CAN do it and be so sure that it WILL happen \* no matter what \*. You are the only one who can conquer this dream and you are the only one who can take you there. Be your own #1 supporter.

75,"I was diagnosed with bipolar and BPD at 14 yrs old. I know that at that age bipolar isn’t supposed to be diagnosed but I was up, down, up, down, self harm, it was a vicious cycle. I put my parents through hell, I had two psych ward stays under my belt by the time I was 20 with multiple multiple multiple med changes. I was on heavy meds like lithium, depakote, lamictil, etc but like a true bipolar, I never took the meds long enough for them to actually work because I didn’t feel like I actually needed the medication. I had been on all of the anti depressants and then just gave up. I turned to acid, mushrooms and weed to cure my mental health. I sold my car for drug money FFS. 🙈

I settled down some after I met my husband, got pregnant, had some kids and had really mellowed down. I was “re-evaluated” and was told that I don’t have bipolar or BPD. I felt like my entire life was a lie because I had SUCH a mental struggle growing up. I had parents that loved me and supported me, friends, I would cry and be sad for no reason, have these manic episodes, hypersexual episodes, so I was incredibly confused. I haven’t had a manic episode in about 7 years. 

Fast forward to now. I have two children, 1.5 &amp; 3.5 and they’re both autistic so things have been stressful. I’m a stay a home mom and I have health issues myself. The second pregnancy really took a toll on me and I ended up with Hashimoto’s, POTS, fibromyalgia and neuropathy. I had PPD with both children but with the second, it really manifested badly into anxiety and untreated of course. My anxiety spiraled out of control for almost two years. 

I have been in and out of the doctors almost every week due to POTS related issues and anxiety issues so last Sunday I was having legitimate gastric issues. I went into the ER shaking and nauseous, doubled over in pain. I had been in pain the last few nights prior but I HAD to go in. As soon as I walked into the lobby, I was vomiting everywhere, almost passing out. They had me doped up on morphine, observed me for about 10 hours with morphine every 3-4 hours and sent me home with a Norco prescription. I had never taken opiates before except one time when I had an endoscopy. I had taken the norco as prescribed every night for my gastric pain and was soon to be following up with my GI dr. I was trying to go to bed when I started having visions of killing my children. I know, it sounds terrible, and I cannot stress how much I am not that mom. I LOVE my kids and it shook me to my core. I started sweating because I kept seeing the fleeting images of them dead by me. I had this overwhelming deep feeling to hurt them. I was crying and googling if norco can cause these feelings because I had never in my life had these feelings before. 

The next day I checked into a psych ward because I couldn’t even look at my kids. I couldn’t even be around them because I was scared. Because I didn’t know what I would do. I had declined medication for 10 years but it was time to maybe try it out again and actually stick with it for 6+ weeks. I checked myself in and they kept me for 7 days. They called them intrusive thoughts and the only reason I wasn’t on the psychosis unit was because I didn’t have a plan, I didn’t have a method, I recognized it was wrong, and I am getting help. I keep seeing the images in my head every time I look at my kids like a PTDS survivor deals with their trauma. I’m literally afraid and nauseous when I look at my kids. I was told I have bipolar disorder. Is this possible? Can you have bipolar disorder and not have any episodes for years? I was discharged today and I’ve been on topamax for a few days and I feel so out of it. I feel like I have no feelings to anything. I feel no love to anything. No love to my kids. No love to my husband. No love to my animals. I just feel nothing, like an empty shell. What is wrong with me? Something happened when I went into the hospital with stomach issues because I had feelings and now I feel nothing and I’m freaking terrified. Is it the meds? Will I feel this way forever? I have felt so out of it for days now, like I’m in a dream. 

I’m thinking back to my behavior the last few years and my husband and I’s relationship. We’ve fought a lot about my incredibly compulsive money spending, my obsession with clean eating and orthorexia, my crippling anxiety and health anxiety that has mirrored onto my kids, my binge eating, my gym obsession... can all of this be related back to bipolar disorder? It’s been a while since I’ve really had a major depressive disorder. I feel like I’ve really just been dealing with severe anxiety. ",17Aug2018,3

I feel like I have that",17Aug2018,1

78,"Hello. This story goes back to 13 years ago, when I started visiting therapists. My parents would take me to some psychologists because reasons I unknow, but the thing is that at that visit, she (the therapist) asked me where I lived. At that moment I felt terrified because I thought that if I told her, she'd come around my house and hurt my family. I denied telling her the address, so we eventually left the place (I was with my dad). Later, when we were going back home, my dad said ""Why didn't you tell her...?""


 That's everything I remember.


This makes me think about why am I like this, what leads me to be so paranoid about people since this happens to me and even at a worse scale nowadays. I just don't know. ",17Aug2018,0
