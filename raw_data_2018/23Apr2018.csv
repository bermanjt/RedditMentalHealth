1,"   The past year of my life has been one of those, you can't make this stuff up experiences.  I was locked in a hospital for 30+ days unable to go outside  because I was alleged to be a danger to myself or others.  Then when I was released to go home I found all my belongings packed in my car and the locks changed on me and a restraining order was filed in court so I could not step foot in my home without a police escort. I am ashamed to be a part of my family, but I am unable to make the changes to get them out of my life. The outright lying, vicious betrayals, and subsequent abandonment has got me living a daily loop of fear and loathing. I am trying everyday to break my cycle of despair.  I fear that being in these abusive relationships have ruined my ability to love and I will never have a healthy family. 
  I know ""we don't get to pick our family"" and I don't want to come across as ungrateful as some do not even have a family to begin with. Sometimes I fantazise about being adopted.   
  I was living with my little brother and his girlfriend for some time and the tension in our household was getting worse and worse.  I have been unable to work for several years now after several stomach surgeries and now a thyroid nodule my Dr has biopsied twice has shown follicular cells in other words cancer.  I may not appear physically disabled (despite being very underweight at times) and I think this bothered my brother and his girlfriend because they always were talking to me about how I should get back to work and if I wanted a girlfriend that I would need a job.  My brother is the type of guy who thinks he pays too much taxes and lives in a dog eat dog world and in his opinion all the degenerates of the world should be put on an island (by his standards I am one).  
   His girlfriend Jenny and I got along well until I guess because I made an off color joke about how since she had moved in they had put locks on almost every door in the house (excluding my room of course). I'm talking locks on the door to get to the door type situation, not just locks on bedrooms and bathrooms. This reminded me of when my father and step-mother used to lock up our food (pantry door, and refrigerator).  Jenny eventually started complaining about my brother to me about how he spent huge amounts of money on cloths, how he was a different person when they got drunk and he would show boat.  I tried to just listen and let her vent but I was very concerned about his drinking and his recent firearms purchases. Eventually she got abusive toward me telling me ""you think I'd let you take care of my dog"" and ""what a joke"" referring to my financial contributions to the house hold even though my brother used me as deduction on his taxes. I was just trying to fit in, get along, and get healthy. 
   My brother had just bought a handgun and an assault rifle (AK-47). I asked him what the guns were for as we lived in a safe neighborhood and they made me uncomfortable, especially a high-powered rifle in the house.  Despite what I thought he had a license to carry or as he called it ""my license to ill"".  Everywhere he went he was strapped, even to go to the bathroom.  His girlfriend even found the gun, loaded,  left on a table outside the bathroom and alerted me to take care of it. God forbid he left the gun out for any one of the number of guys who did work on his house to find.
  My brother used to dry fire the gun all the time and I would hear this from the other room. So I told him why it is bad to dry fire a gun, it might wreck the firing pin. You might not believe me but he also pointed the gun at me while dry firing it so many times I took a video to show my family.  I had no choice but to show my dad and mom but it changed nothing (I want to show the police but I am afraid of the consequences for my little brother) Later when I confronted him about the video which I texted him he told me ""that's a video you had me make as a joke"" worst lie I have ever heard, I mean come on. This is the problem with lying ""No good man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar"" Abraham Lincoln 
  Well, things were ripe for a conflict in that house. I was walking on eggshells. I even started waking up crying, something I had never done in my life. Like I would come to out of a deep sleep and be crying when I woke up. I was loosing sleep and had been up a lot. I tried staying at a hotel several nights to let things calm down and give them space but that got very expensive. This is were my father comes in. 
   My father has been how should I say this... a guilt-trip-dad.  His only motivation to being a father I believe comes from guilt, but maybe I am wrong.  Maybe he came from a horrible family I guess i'll never know why he acts like he does because he won't talk to me anymore.  
   I was at home one day back in September when my dad calls out of the blue and demands to come over and take me out to lunch.  This was odd because I could not remember the last time he came over to my place and I was busy playing guitar. I told him no and we hung up. Guess what? He showed up anyway and just walked into the house. He came in and was trying to bully me into going out to lunch with him. I think maybe he thought I would loose my temper.  When I told him to leave he called the police.  I am serious he called the police and told them I didn't recognize him, I didn't know who he was or what his name was. I think he said I was yelling, basically he told them I was acting crazy. I was not.  I let the police  and ambulance crew in they were cool, and I know they were just doing there job.  They explained they just wanted to check me out and make sure I was ok, they did and as I was not crazy or acting crazy they went on their way. 
   This is were things got real messed up, a day or two after my father showed up my brother came home in the middle of the day with two police officers and a section 12 order signed by my psychiatrist and a judge.  As I understand it my psychiatrist said I was ""being made out as some monster living at my brothers house"" and that my brother or father threatened his license if he didn't have me committed.  So the police put me into an ambulance, I had no choice it was like I was being arrested but the prison was the hospital.  At the er the doctor talked to me for less than 5 minutes and I was left alone in a room overnight in the er, they took my cell phone and wallet which were locked up. As far as I understood it if I tried to leave I would be shackled. No one told me anything about what was going on, I think the doctor asked me if I was thinking about hurting myself or anyone else but I never thought about hurting myself or others.  
   I was driven to some other hospital by ambulance the next day and forced to go into a psych ward for the next 30 something days. Being in there was hell, I cried most of the first few days. I was very disoriented, couldn't sleep, the windows had metal grates over them. The bathrooms were locked and you had to ask for permission to use the toilets. While I was using the toilet the nurse came in my room and grabbed the door out of my hands forcefully and I didn't let go (I think its my right to use the bathroom when I need to) she came back with a bunch of men and they held me down to the bed, pulled down my pants and gave me a shot in the butt of god knows what which is called ""chemical restraints"".  
   The doctor at this hospital never did an evaluation we talked for no more than a minute or two during his daily rounds, the level of care was abysmal.  There was no congruence between the care and medication I received outside the hospital and inside the hospital.  On the contrary the hospital was not a caring, healing place but a place where gross negligence and willful neglect were common practice.  The patients were treated more like cattle than human beings at times. I even heard a patient speak to his doctor about suicidal thoughts only to be released the next day.  Sadly he fell from a parking garage and died a few days later. Maybe it was the medication, it sounded like the whole unit was on the same medications, some on more some on less subtle variations but you get the point.
   I did whatever I could in the hospital to tell my family how bad things were for me, called advocates, and contacted the president of the hospital.  However, nobody cared or would do anything.  I was unable to keep up with the outside world as I had no access to my cell phone in the first few weeks to keep up with the world in order to pay bills, and stay on top of my responsibilities.  There were so many conflicting things going on, my outside physician was saying I was supposed to be there for three days at a maximum but I had been there for weeks.
   After a few weeks (what to me felt like a lifetime in there) I found out I could sign something called a three day.  This was some kind of petition to leave, I asked to leave against medical advice but was told I could not.  The staff and the patient advocate told me I would have to go in front of a judge, why I did not know.    I was conscious, awake, eating (though the food sucked) and taking care of all my normal things...bathroom, showering ect.
   When I went in front of the judge I had an anxiety attack, my heart was pounding I was so nervous I just wanted to get out of there and go home. My brother testified that I was seeing little green men, other lies about the past, and he said I threatened him and his girlfriend.  Then the doctor testified that I was having racing thoughts, and I wasn't attending groups or something. I was speechless and couldn't believe my dad sat and said nothing. The lawyer I was appointed was completely useless at one point before the trail he said ""maybe you could leave here with a broken leg"" I had no idea what he meant.  He didn't seem to have any idea how/what to object to during the trail either.  The judge found me ""unable to take care of myself"" and I was legally committed for up to 6 months. From then on my first priority was to get out of there. I started loosing my will to fight, which is exactly what I think they all wanted. They wanted me to submit and go along with the program. 
   In the hospital I lost a lot of weight, I cried more than I ever had in my life, I was not given my medication, at time I felt like I was fainting or loosing consciousness, I developed these headaches along with a pressure in my forehead that feels like a horse is standing on my skull.  I got really sick while I was in the hospital they said it was strep throat but the pain in my throat kept coming back months later so bad one day I couldn't eat. The only thing I got to ease my pain and suffering was an antibiotic.  
   While I was in the hospital I was glad one of my friends could come visit me a couple times he brought me pad thai and helped me spark my will to fight the injustice going on all around me. My other visitor, my dad, was not such a welcome site. Especially when he showed up with my step mother.  My step mom and I don't get along, she hasn't ever showed my any signs she cares about me. I remember my last birthday I went over to my dads and all they talked about was how my dad had to pay child support to my mom and how unfair it was and how unfair it was that she had to pay child support to her ex.  Seriously that's all we talked about for my birthday. This has gone on since I was 6 years old.  They bash my mom in front of me/to me and then i'm supposed to get along with them.  Sorry for the inconvenience of being born, sorry about the laws that society made that holds you responsible financially to your kids. Some people don't need a law to make them do whats right. And how do you think it effects your kids when you show them you can't get along as parents? Or that your more concerned about money than your children? 
    Clearly we don't get along, not like I haven't tried, but what is she doing at the hospital? Not only that but my dad walks in and says I said f you to my step mom over the phone and I have to apologize.  I told her calmly to leave, she left and waited for my dad outside the unit.  My dad went on to threaten to disown me in my hospital room and he kept telling me I could not go back home to live with my brother and his girlfriend.  He said he was going to help me with some money to get a new place, then he said ""all the money goes to my step mother""  
  3 months into my hospital sentence my brother called and kept trying to get me to admit over the phone that I threatened him, I never threatened him or his girlfriend. I told her to leave that is it. I am not a violent person and the people I am friends with and know me know that I am not violent. In fact, the violent ones in my family are my brother and father. If I threatened my brother he would want to fist fight right then and there.  
   So when I was on the phone with my brother he told me if you don't admit to threatening me ""I will get my girlfriend to get a restraining order on you"" I hung up told some people I was friendly with on the unit what just happened and they advised me to notify the staff which I did.  Sure enough the next mourning, after I had been in the hospital for three weeks the police showed up with a restraining order to serve me.  Real messed up stuff going on here, that means she lied in court just to make sure I could not return to the house I was paying rent at.  That is how they threw me to the curb.  I guess the whole thing was a way my family could use the courts/hospital/doctors to make me homeless and suffer.  
   I don't know what to do. I mustered up the courage to call the police to report a crime and tell them about my brother assaulting me but they told me I had to come to the police station to report a crime. I don't know exactly what I want out of this but I know what I don't want...move of the same. I keep going about my life like I should keep this all in and to myself and it keeps manifesting in so many different ways in my daily life.  I keep blaming myself. I don't know what to do...anyone have some solid advice?",23Apr2018,1
2,Dealing with really bad anxiety ever since my girlfriend went to Vegas to visit family for a week.  She been back over a week but I’m still feeling just as anxious.  We’ve been intimate but I’ve started getting real manic and one second I’m sad the next super happy and then next I’m so crazy it pushes my girl to have anxiety and be introverted. So I get paranoid that everything is wrong when I keep getting told everything’s okay. But my paranoid thoughts are driving us apart.  She’s never done anything to break my trust.  My mental health is just going downhill and I can’t control it. I have an appointment on the 21 of may for mental health meds but I can’t go any sooner. How do I control these thoughts??,23Apr2018,2

5,"I find that patients really enjoy being able to ask whatever questions they want about medications, how the brain works, etc to someone who is not directly involved in their care. Even the most health illiterate people I've interacted with seem to really desire these answers, and I really enjoy trying to deliver them in very easy to understand ways.

If I did a livestream like this, how many of you would be interested?

I'm by no means an expert or even a seasoned psychiatrist (I'm a resident), but I really enjoy helping people in this way, and I've never heard of anyone really doing something like this before. Maybe they'd be worried about legal problems, but I don't intend to give out medical advice. Just help break down complex topics and help people understand concepts that might otherwise require them to comb through the research literature.",23Apr2018,4

7,"I'm working on it, and it's a long, slow process. Been at it for many years, although to be fair most of that time was spent practicing the unhealthy behaviors with little jabs at wellness here and there, never really able to focus on ""it"" (them?) for long enough to bring about lasting change....

I'm probably light years better than I was, which is to say I still spend most of my time in brutally painful mental and emotional states of being, ruminating, regretting (oh dear lord regretting regretting regreetttttiinnngggggggg), imagining all kinds of persecution going on and having intense emotional reactions to these imagined (or overblown) slights. So much more...can't really transcribe all the sentences that the voices in my head spit at me on a regular basis (to sort've use an analogy), but it's messy and cacophonous....

I've had breakthroughs in the past year like never before...but the mind still snaps back to the old way and stays there...I feel prisoner to my thoughts and emotions, and that's with being diligent about cutting the weeds as they come up...it's just not enough. And it makes me feel like a bad person, because in many ways I kinda am being a shitty person (quick to anger, resentful, aloof, distant most of the time).  I feel so much love and I'm very generous and empathetic, but I'm so sick in the head most of the time that that light is blocked out by the pain. I hate it. Knowing that something else is possible and yet being stuck in these childish states of mind.

Obsessing over my regrets and flaws instead of putting it in God's hands and accepting myself and the fact that none of it really matters...spending so much time in bloody awful fear and sadness, when life is so short.

I've been crazy because , you know, I've got a couple days off, so that's of course when I'm craziest because I struggle to feel ""engaged"" in life and my mind has a full tank on which to feed...

I just want to grow the f*** up and not spend so much time in such petty, stupid, wasteful states of mind. ",23Apr2018,2
8,"Okay sometimes advice from the internet means more than advice from the people who know you best. My boyfriend of 6 years broke up with me in October 2017; he found out I’d cheated on him because I’m a vile and disgusting person. 

He kicked me out of the house initially (more than fair) on the Thursday. It took him till the following Monday to break up with me- over the phone whilst I was on a training course for work. 

He swiftly began to remove me from his life; he needed longer in the house so I paid for my half of the rent still so that he could stay until things were sorted. When I went round to box my things up, we watched TV, laughed, joked- he helped me load my car up. That to me was two people who still had something between them.

Why would somebody cheat on their perfect, loving, intelligent boyfriend completely out of the blue? Because despite what he says, I’m pretty sure he stopped loving me. 

I’ve always struggled with my mental health, however when my partner and I first moved in together in 2015, that’s when issues started. He was tired, working really hard on his PGCE- he’d sleep a lot and was snappy when he was stressed. Big deal? I love him. We stopped having sex. He was always too tired or stressed and he would lose his erection pretty much all the time. He was and still very much is, my first love; so when he said ‘I think I lost it because you’re too wet’, or ‘I lost it because you’re in a funny position’, and even, ‘I lost it because of where your legs are’ I believed it. I believed it was my fault. I thought being ‘too wet’ was a thing and that I was ruining something that was supposed to be fun for two twenty-odd year olds. So when I came home from work one evening and discovered lube and dirty tissues, I asked him why he could masterbate but not sleep with me. I was distraught; it’s only on self reflection that I’ve come to realise how much that effected me. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in February 2017; I’ve been medicated for it ever since. I also started to self harm and had been seeing a therapist. My partner was supportive, loving, protective however, was still losing his erection and it was still my fault. I’d give him oral for 20+ minutes; as soon as it was time for sex, it had gone. And that was the end of it. I very rarely reached climax with him and I regularly bled because of the friction during sex as I don’t think (looking back) I was ready for it- foreplay wise. 

I’d suggested us going to the doctors to which he declined. My friend offered to pay for couple’s therapy to which he responded with, ‘I don’t think I need to go to therapy. You’re the one with the problem, not me’ amongst other things. I’d also suggested buying some herbal medication that’s supposed to increase your sex drive but (despite what he claims) when I moved out I threw away an almost full bottle, because he never took the pills. 

At work, I’d been chased by a married man with a bad reputation for months. I repeatedly told him no; I can’t lie, we got on very well. But I wanted my boyfriend; I wanted to get married to him and have his babies- I still do. But after months and months of 30 second missionary that ended in his erection being lost because of something I had done, the affection and attention I wanted from my boyfriend, was coming from somebody else. 

It wasn’t until my boyfriend told me that he lost his erection because of my self-harm covered legs that I crumbled. I felt like I’d died. I hated me and what I had done to us. He wasn’t attracted to me and why should he be? I’m a disgusting, scar-covered, over-weight girl with zero confidence and low self-esteem. 

One person was waiting to make me feel better. 

I fucked up. For 5 years, I had never looked or had spoken to another man; and in one stupid and pathetic moment, I ruined my life. 

Since October 2017, everything has only gotten worse; that’s another story. 
At the current moment, my partner, my soulmate, my best friend, is posting about his fifth date with ‘a great girl’ who complimented him on his leg muscles. He’s also complaining to Reddit about how I used the wrong paint to cover up some stains in our rented house (I made the stains when we were playing and I chucked a t-bag at him); I’m sorry. I’d been there from 9am packing up the bed, the drawers, the fridge, the washing machine, the TV, the couch, the armchair, emptying the cupboards, cleaning the cupboards, mopping the floors, hoovering the floors, hoovering the cobwebs on the ceiling, washing the windows, scrubbing the toilet- because I didn’t want him to lose his deposit. He rang me the following day, laughing and calling me a fucking idiot. He told me he’d drop off my key so I could come back and repaint it; I told him no because even though I accidentally used the wrong paint on some splash marks, I’d been at the house till 1am sorting it out. There was nothing for him to clean. Just some bags that I’d left tied up, ready to go to the tip.  

Now it’s April; I’ve sat in my bedroom, alone ever since. I watch him organise nights out with our shared friends- he invited an ex-friend who told me that I need to keep my suicidal thoughts and depression to myself. He tells me he doesn’t want to talk, he won’t hear my voice. Our cat that we picked together, he doesn’t give a fuck about. No contributions to the kitty nor to the couch that I’m still paying for monthly, that’s in his name. 
He won’t see me so that I can return his spare car key. 

Please can I have your thoughts on this? Because the other half of me is acting like I don’t exist. And posting about some girl feeling his legs. And I’m stuck. Not moving forwards. He’s the first thing I think about in a morning and the last thing I think about before I fall asleep. 

I feel so unwanted and lonely. I hate me. I love him. Does he really not want me, think about me, or love me anymore? ",23Apr2018,1

10,"This will be long, as I don’t know where to start, maybe I just need to vent. But I hate my life.

I had kids early, found out my now wife was pregnant the day I mentally decided to break up with her. 
Being raised in the society now I had to be a man and stay for my kids, give them the solidarity of a Mom and dad home. 
But she’s not the one. 
She’s great no lie, but I’m holding her back, I slack off because I always tell myself that I can do better, someday I’ll do/get better. I’ll get a better job, live a better life, go back to school. My life wasn’t supposed to end up like this. And each day I just do the same thing over and over again. 
She’s a complete opposite of me, outgoing, super friendly, social. I view myself as awkward, antisocial, introvert. And I feel that she can’t enjoy life with me straggling along, she needs someone like her to be outgoing, enjoy the things she does, because I stay a an event or family outing and want to leave an hour in. 
I have anxiety and depression. To top it off I’m insecure, today she went to work and got off 1 hr later than usual, so I assumed she was cheating, she got home and I asked to have sex before she showered and she said yes, but went to use the restroom, I waited and with the thoughts of cheating still lingering I said nvm. 
I’m an asshole sometimes too, I don’t mean to be, it just happens, something doesn’t go my way or things don’t go as planned I get into a bad mood, I try and suppress it but it comes out sometime in the day. 
I don’t want to go on because it feels like I’m whining about my life when someone else would love to be in my position but I don’t see the light in this lifestyle. It’s boring, it’s time consuming, you do things you don’t want to do. 
I don’t know where to start or how to get my life together. It’s over whelming me how not in control of my life I am and I feel like I’m going to just explode one day and everything will come out in such an ugly manner. My dad used to be like that.

He’s an alcoholic and the most negative person I’ve ever known. I remember my younger years him getting drunk and doing something embarrassing or mean then people mostly my mom getting upset than him going away moping and id always worry and follow after him. He would say things like they’re awful and I’m going to move away or kill myself. My whole life I have always been anxious and worried about him. He got really bad tonight and I wanted to take him to the hospital and he said if I call he will get a gun and kill himself. I just don’t know what to do anymore. He is miserable and he makes everyone miserable. Can you diagnose him? Or help me understand how to help him. Thank you,23Apr2018,2
14,"My wife's mother has schizophrenia. It went undiagnosed for years, and therefore made everyone's life a living hell. She's now living in a home where she has privileges to come and go as she pleases (there is a curfew, but it's reasonable.) She takes herself to doctors appointments, etc, but recently I found out she has not been taking her medicine properly. She's convinced that the capsule is plastic and poison so she breaks them open and pours the contents in her water, this has evidently been going on for years, and she has episodes of irrational paranoia fairly regularly. My wife is the only family that still talks to her, and we spend every Saturday with her. After talking to her case worker, she talked to the psychiatrist and changed her medication to a white pill that Mom was comfortable taking. Then we find out that her home is closing down, and she's freaking out, refusing to go to doctors appointments to address her high blood pressure, or for an appointment for a check up that is necessary for her to get placed in a new home. I really want her to be as independent as possible, but because of her choices she's about to lose her placement and just be sent back to the metal health facility where they will have to start over with her in terms of having a case worker, getting her placement, etc. She's been there before when she went off her meds and is terrified of it, but, you know, her illness makes her not able to come to rational conclusions at times. I don't know what to do. I hate watching my wife deal with the stress (mom calls her 5+ times daily, sometimes bored, sometimes just to go off about how the neighbor is a communist and trying to get her killed, or today it is that her case worker is going around telling everyone that she's a murderer and ruining her reputation.) We both try to be as understanding as possible, but this is very trying. Any advice? Also, if she's properly medicated, should she even be having these episodes of paranoia?

I am struggling with understanding what people mean. I think it’s because I’m not trying to listen? I do keep forcing myself to listen, but I can’t grip what reality feels like.

19,"Hello y’all. My first time posting but I’ve been subscribed for a while.

I’m 26 years old, female, and at a language school, already graduated from university, so no stress from college (except loan payments LOL).

So here’s the deal, I use to see a psychiatrist in The States and was put on Zoloft 100mg for Social Anxiety Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Depression, and a mild case of OCD. Wonderful stuff, that medicine, love it. Doesn’t completely help with my anxiety, but it levels the playing field for me.
Now I’ve been in Tokyo for a few months and my supply is dwindling. I’ve been cutting the dosages or skipping in order to preserve it, and I’ve been feeling real shitty—constantly tired, socially withdrawn, terrible mood swings, you name it! 
I’ve finally found a doctor, but it’s so expensive and I’m still not quite sure if I’ll get my meds refilled.
I have about 20 days left of full doses.

I won’t be back in The States until, the earliest, next April (unless I can afford to visit).

I work a few days a week after class and on weekends, so most of my time is occupied. I’ve been having a very hard time focusing lately, and I’m here on a time crunch, I want to learn as much as I can.
I’ve also been sleeping between 9-12 hours most nights, I’m assuming due lack of meds. It’s eating up my free time.

So what are your suggestions? If I can’t get my meds, what’s a good way to ween off? How can I keep myself awake? I’ve been trying to drink black tea lately which helps a little (hate coffee). 
I don’t have a lot of money and can’t really afford to go on vacations and such either. But I have a stellar boyfriend I’m here with! 7 years strong, so he’s a good support. But I want to stop dragging him down with my bad mood/tiredness all the time.

23,"PTSD, flashbacks constantly, nightmares every night, severe anxiety and depression that causes physical pain. For as long as I can remember.

Vivid memories and flashbacks that cause intense anxiety and pain to the point where I shake and feel like my heart is going to explode. Simple things like a song or ringtone even. Anything that reminds me of the past even if it is extremely abstract.

A mind that is always hyper analyzing everything. Imagining all outcomes, every variable and vividly feeling emotional feelings as if it was really happening. Fear of the future hells.

Anxiety so bad it causes me physical pain in my chest, neck and throat to the point where even thoughts are painful but cannot be stopped.

I’ve institutionalized myself multiple times but it’s always hell like being in jail. No freedom. Stuck in a box.

I’ve tried numerous medications over the years. All of which either don’t do much or give me a new version of hell.

Venlaflaxine made me lose my mind to the point where my reality has been forever shattered hallucinations so intense, so real that I still question reality. So mind bending that i will never be able to fully describe the months I was hallucinating.

My now ExFiance’s mother physically assaults me. Leaving marks on my face. All because I told her father about his daughters suicide attempts so he could understand what she is going through. They both deny it and our relationship ultimately fails once my depression and anxiety reach new levels. The pain is so intense every day I can’t function.

Become homeless mid winter. Only own what can fit in a backpack.

Police officer physically assaults me while I’m hallucinating from venlaflaxine. I never touched the man but yet he is trying to charge me with assaulting a police officer. I was threatened with pain, verbally abused and physically assaulted.
I was manic. They thought I was on drugs.

Refused medication in jail. Begging for help while losing my mind even more to  venlaflaxine withdrawals. You cant miss even a day. Hung myself in the holding cell because of the hallucinations. I was in the depths of hell.

Wake up in isolation. Naked with a smock covered in my own urine in a room for all to see. They kicked me. Stabbed me in the foot and picked me up and dropped me on my tailbone.

Got a DUI over a year ago because I was pressured by a friend. No prior criminal history. Now I’m scum. Lost my job, my new car, my home, my pride.

Lost all my friends to drugs and conflict with no resolution. Watched my father die before my eyes a few years ago and now I forever hold regret from never fighting my anxiety and getting to know him. He went to the doctor with pneumonia died a week later due to undiagnosed stage 4 carcinoma cancer. 


Mother can no longer work, her House is falling apart, is on oxygen gets little money each month. No savings or retirement. I’m unable to take care of her. Refuses to get outside help. My sister who is on/off meth constantly is her caregiver. No other family.

In well over 10,000+ debt from lawyer, car, future fines etc.

No bank account, no job, no vehicle, no family or friends.

Dropped out of highschool due to depression and anxiety. Been suicidle since 12. Parents never got me help.

Every day is agony. Every second is pain. To be alive is torture. Even my dreams cause me pain. There is no escape.

 This isn’t even a fraction of my story.


I’m in pure agony. So much physical and mental pain to the point of madness.

The pain never ends.

It never ends.


Im in a desperate need of help. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.

24,"I'm 27 year old male and there are some stuff happening to me, I wanted to check if they are normal or not.  

I always talk to myself, but it used to be just in my head and oddly always in English ( it's not my first language ). But it has developed to another level that I was talking to myself and moving my lips. But now I talk to myself to a point that I can hear it.

But things have been escalated a little bit. I think about stuff without intention. For example when I'm in a taxi, out of no where, I think about opening the door and jumping out. It feels that it happens for less than a second or so, but it feels like someone else telling me to do this. I get super sexual thoughts as well. for example kissing a random guy on the street ( I'm not gay ) and alot of other stuff. They happen so fast, and then I have to try hard to push away these thoughts.  


I feel anxious lots of times, without a reason and when I have a reason I don't feel stressed at all. I feel my heart is beating faster and it gets warmer.  

I am kind of scared of these. and going to a psychologist is a taboo in my country.  

Are these things normal? or do I have to be worried? Is there any name for the condition that I have so I can look into it?

Then I became aware of the fact that everything we have, we have on a sphere floating around in space for all eternity, then the question came to me, how it all came to be? I am now looking at a metallic object, I know that the metal came from a star, but how the fundamental matter itself came to be? And I (kind of) know it for a fact that probability of being a creator out there is very low, then how it all happened, the next thought came to me is of the high probability of the existence of multiverse, gigantic universes floating around in higher dimension in infinite numbers, these universes pop in and out of existence, like bubbles in an infinite size washing machine.

34,"I have no clue what’s wrong with me. Throughout my entire life I get depressed, anxious, and I think really moody to the point it effects everything in my life from my relationships to my work. 

I’ve taken tons of different anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medication in the past 5 years. All different doses and different pills. They have had no affect on me and tbh they probably have made things worst, since I had a psychotic episode that lasted a year long that ended about a year ago. I stopped taking pills not that long ago. 

The thing is growing up and even in adulthood doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, etc have all disagreed with each other with what’s wrong with me. They threw diagnosis at me like it was candy when I was young. Or they just wouldn’t know. When I was a kid they said PDD then backtracked and said actually no. Then they said anxiety, OCD, SPD (sensory processing disorder), depression, and ADHD. I grew out of the SPD. I also think I grew out of the ADHD or maybe never had it. The depression and anxiety always stayed around and my I think moodiness. The thing is I also had abusive parents. So I became very adept at hiding my feelings, changing my mood, and putting up facades when I was growing up. I also became adept at disassociating. I also abused substances (mostly in my 20’s, but a little bit in my late teens). I also isolate myself a lot. 

Now in my 20’s I still don’t know what’s wrong with me. When I look up mental illnesses I think the most likely four possibilities are depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and/or borderline personality disorder. I also probably have a eating disorder.

But I guess the point is there is definitely something off in my head, but I have no clue what it is. And the medical professionals have done nothing for me except made things worst and also confused me. I was wondering if anyone else has had experiences like this. Where you just feel it’s hopeless to find out what you have or suffer from. Where you also feel like you might never escape your mental health issues. Where you feel you’ll never get the correct help. Sometimes I wonder if I just don’t fit into any box of disorders and might just be a conglomeration of a few or many. Or maybe, but extremely unlikely it’s something unheard of. 

I tried not focusing on the issue for many years, but when I left for college and the stress rose all my problems became worst and I was forced to seek help. I just never really received any good help. ",23Apr2018,1

37,"Hello. I'm almost 100% sure I have some form of psychosis or schizophrenia. For years I've had mild  auditory hallucinations (mostly people calling my name, mumbling on the other side of walls and types of music when it's quiet). 

It hasn't been problem, and when I tell my parents they usually say it's normal (because they can't send us to the doctor probably I now know). However, now, maybe because I'm under a lot of stress, they've gotten more aggressive. I have almost constant auditory hallucinations now, like every 10 minutes at least and almost always when it's quiet, and I have daily visual hallucinations too. Very vague ones and they usually last just a fraction of a second, but I still panic.

I don't have access to a doctor or a psychologist. Maybe I could get access to one in 6 months but not before that. My situation isn't urgent but I need to know what to do to mitigate the problems so they don't develop further. Also, if there is medication I can try that isn't very expensive maybe.",23Apr2018,3

But it has become so bad that I can't do or say anything around him as he just flat out copies it.

43,"So, I'm convinced that I had a panic attack yesterday night but I want confirmation that I really had one, and need advice on how to avoid this in the future. This was the first time this happened to me and hopefully, the last because this shit was the worst.

Story is, I purchased some ""Purple Star Dawg"" and keep in mind, this shit is really strong. I normally smoke puries so I made a joint and went out for a night walk after finishing work. I've been smoking cannabis chronically for more than a year and this has never happened to me. I smoked it slowly and went back to my house to basically browse the net and watch some videos.

So, I have no clue how this started, but an hour and a bit into my high, I started to feel a little sick and I had this weird numbness that traveled to my arms. I was ready to grab the nearest bucket because I'm sure I was going to vomit (and luckily, I didn't, I kept telling myself I was fine). Only words I can describe is feeling ""disconnected"" and although I didn't freak out, I started to panic in my mind and it was so bad to the point that I had to chew some gum and take my shirt off (because I was getting the sweats). I really wanted cold air or someone to turn up and hold a fan near me. I was breathing pretty heavily.

This went away after what seemed like a minute because I calmed myself down pretty fast and knew I was OK. I went to the bathroom and noticed how pale I was, I looked terrible as if I was doing other drugs. I never drink and don't experiment with other drugs.

A career advancement opportunity came along in the form of a side job / second job, but it's asking me to do what two otherwise unemployed people did but by myself in half the time. I very eagerly signed on because the more money I make and the faster I get my career with my actual degree going on, the sooner I can get the fuck out and live my own fucking life.

What's happened now is said side-job takes the only few hours of personal free time, and this is making me very very stressed. The job itself is easy, the kind of thing I did in college. It's being run by pleasant people, and overall I can't see why a ""normal"" rational person couldn't accomplish what I'm trying to do in terms of workload. My sanity just isn't having it though. The person who gave me the opportunity helps recovering addicts.

 For 2 years now, I have emotionally attached myself to certain characters to an incredible extent.
The main reason I am still alive is because of them, and because I don't want to disappoint them. But there is a thought poking at my head, and it's telling me that I could meet them when I die, that I'd change worlds or dream forever. It doesn't make sense, but something is telling me that all those stories, worlds are waiting for me in death. That I only need to leave this body, and it'll be ok. If I could, I'd sit in a corner and imagine them all day long, but of course, I can't. So there is hope that they can become real somehow, or that I can become part of their universe. I don't need real friends, family or love, because they are enough. I've lived in so many worlds already, I've been so many people already, and every world is enough except the real one. So I imagine that a coma or death could help me, set me free and let me be with them. Real life feels like a movie passing by.
I'm afraid to let go, because I'd have nothing left, and I wouldn't know how to function. Whether it was the world in a videogame, anime, movie, doesn't matter.

51,"I don't get much time to make a well put together post in private so I will keep it summed up and straight to the point.

  For the past month I have had crippling anxiety that has made every aspect of my life unenjoyable. I grew up having small brief waves of depersionalization and derealization that would only last a minute at the most and only happen every so often. Also most of my childhood, with having a religious family, I was constantly worrying about the end of the world and things like that but after many years I eventually got over it and started to enjoy my life.

  But now that anxiety is back but in a different form. A few different forms. I suddenly have a fear of reality itself. For example, neither the universe being infinite, or there being some sort of edge of the universe and existence ending makes sense to me. It pretty much has to be one or the other but I realised how I can not comprehend ether option and that deeply disturbs me.

  Next, there is death. I fear death for anything currently living, especially my family and self. Somehow I find both the idea of my conscious just not existing one day, and the idea of a enternal life after death both terrifying. I feel trapped knowing that no matter what success I have in life, no matter who I love or loves me, no matter how much we put in to living we will one day die. I feel like cattle. It literally makes me feel like existence is pain. 

  Then there is age. Similar to death but not exactly. Recently I had the sudden feeling as if I had aged 10 years. As if the past 10 years of my life didn't happen until it did all at once and it overwhelmed me. I realized that almost every aspect of my childhood is now gone,dead, or a broken version of what it used to be. No childhood home or location is there anymore, my family has become separated and isolated from eachother, my parents are not like they used to be and things like that. I have no familiar comfort zone to go back to if I need it. I would expect most people to experience this around being middle aged but I'm not that old and it's already like this and those things will only fade further and further away as I get older. When I remember things fom my childhood something just doesn't feel right. It's sort of like a feeling that those memories are not my own but at the same time it feels like those memories is actually where I'm supposed to be and the time period I'm still supposed to be in and everything going on now or since then isn't real. Also knowing that one day I will be elderly and approaching the end of my life and thinking back to those things will only be more bizarre greatly bothers me. 

 I'm sorry if I have rambled and don't make much sense. It's hard for me to put this into words especially on here. I feel right now more than I ever thought I would that I need to see someone about this but I simply can't afford it. Any advice that any one can give or chat about will be greatly appreciated.

In my left ear there’s a calmer voice that is either male or female- I’m not sure. But it’s almost whispering, and like the woman in my right ear I can’t really tell the words they’re saying that often.

We had a good talk. I basically told them that I have mental health issues and that it’s something I’m dealing with. They were incredibly supportive but that I’ll still have to speak with HR and a couple of the other executives. 

One of my immediate managers who has been with the company for many years told me:

“Do not get specific when you speak to HR. I know this isn’t the politically correct thing to say but I’ve been with the company a while and they pick and choose what they can live with”

62,"Hi, I’m 18 now and have had enough courage to finally try and sort out whatever may be ‘wrong’ with me. I’ve been to 4 different counsellors in the past year and they’ve all suggested different disorders that I may have. Two suggested I have depression, one suggested I have schizoid personality disorder and the other suggests I have borderline personality disorder. I’ve decided to post everything that’s ‘wrong’ with me on here and see if anyone is similar and can give me an indication of what I may be suffering from. I’ll write it in bullet points to make it easier to read.

- I was abused by my father from a baby up to age 9

- I feel that if I ever have a child I will abuse them too

- I want to live alone forever but yearn for closeness with someone

- I am friendly but have no interest in having/making friends as I see it as a waste of time

- I also cannot maintain friendships

- I cannot understand people’s feelings. This one is a hard one to explain

- I have no empathy at all towards anyone

- I feel very aggressive sometimes for no reason and have homicidal thoughts (although would never kill anyone)

- Although the only people I identify with are serial killers

- I have suicidal feelings but would never kill myself but would not care if I had to die

- My thoughts and behaviour are erratic

- Whilst I like them, I have no attachment to my family. It’s like these strangers I see every once in a while, but would feel indifferent if they died.

- I wish I could leave everyone/everything behind 

- When I do not feel aggression, I feel nothing

- I feel like I have to engage in risky behaviour to feel alive

- I constantly focus on the negative

- I can hide these thoughts like they don't exist and constantly put up a facade

- I find it very easy to lie and I pretty much lie about everything

I’m sure there’s more but these are all the things I can think of right now. If you have any questions I will always reply. If you could help me in any way that would be much appreciated",23Apr2018,2
63,"For the past while I have been struggling with depression. Lots of people have it much worse than me, and I have a lot to be thankful for, and I am in no danger of hurting myself. But I am often feeling hopeless these days. I have also had many negative thoughts and feelings that are unwelcome and irrational. I am becoming a worse person, making not only my life difficult but also the people of those in my life. There is lots for me to work on.

I have tried counseling in the past with some small success, but these days things are so overwhelming I find it very difficult to imagine starting the process of finding the right counselor. While it's not ideal, at least with an online counselor / therapist I could get some professional evaluation. 

Anyway thank you for reading. If you have any suggestions for online therapy sites or any thoughts to share in general I would be grateful. Thanks for your time.",23Apr2018,2
64,"I recently downloaded my Facebook data for a weekly blog assignment I have to do for grad school. In an effort to understand why I had a random list of 300 advertisers targeting me, I logged onto Facebook to see my ad preferences. From here, I discovered a list of bizarre “interests” that influenced the Facebook advertisements I was receiving.
 
The one that stuck out was “Serotonin,” which is listed under “Hobbies and Activities.”  I'm just curious, has anyone else come across this in their ad preferences? My friends/family don't struggle with depression, so I thought I would come here to ask.

65,"I just need too get this out of my system because I feel like I can´t really talk to anyone else about this. 

I was diagnosed with ADD at age 11 after quite some testing. along with being diagnosed with an emotional disorder (nobody bothered to explain what kind of emotional disorder, but I wo
ould figure it was either a phobic emotional disorder or one with social anxiety). Soon as I went to middle school, I had quite some problems. Not paying attention in class got worse which made some of the teachers be really unfair to me (one of them even called me names in front of my parents). I was always a bit socially awkward and introverted, I was definitly not interested in other people, but it got worse. I made about one friend throughout my whole middle school time, but I was never bothered by it. 

I have no idea what caused this development, but I think it could be my ADD, seeing as some articles say that people with ADD can have trouble interacting with peers. Maybe I´m also misdiagnosed but I have no idea what else I could have, and I really don´t want to go to a therapist (I don´t trust therapists and I´m scared I might get a diagnosis that I would feel horrible with). 

I just needed to get this out of my system. Im not asking reddit for a diagnosis, but maybe someone has had similar experiences. ",23Apr2018,3
66,"...I think. I remember when I took piano lessons as a kid I would always try to prove myself, rather than relaxing and learning.  Like I was terrified every time I made a mistake and I would always say ""wait"", and keep trying.  I really liked piano and classical music but ended up quitting because my teacher would call my mom and tell here I didn't practice (which was true).  I liked it a lot, I just didn't sit down and do the work. I still do this sort of thing. It seems like deep down I think I'm perfect and don't need to be taught anything, 'cause you know I'm already perfect.  In all domains, lately, including the state of my relationships, I'm experiencing and extreme case of the dunning-kruger effect.

I don't know if this related to insecurity about my intelligence or something like that.  I have a hard time with verbal instruction, and paying attention. I'm a lot like my dad unfortunately.  I'm obviously not a moron. I mean, my study skills and discipline were as bad as anyone else, but I did great in school without much effort.  Just like anyone else I went home and watched tv and goofed around on my computer.  I never had issues, never needed tutoring and I was never diagnosed with a learning disability.  I'm trying to go easy on myself though.  I think I know my weaknesses, but it's way too easy to delude myself sometimes.",23Apr2018,1
67,"hi

im in a very hard place atm.
my fiance of 2 years left me without a warning, took half my stuff and blocked me and my family and my friends on everything.
everything went down while i was at work, when i came home my place was empty, she even took stuff that belonged to me for a long time, family gifts etc.


i dont know what happened
3 month earlier she had surgery where there was a complication with the narcotics, she woke up too son and had a traumatic experience.
everything went downhill from there.
we had a very very close relationship, spent every minute with each other, 
after the incident she said she needed more time for herself, locked herself up in our bedroom etc, we started sleepin separately.


she also got aggressive towards me, got angry when i didnt clean enough, didnt buy her stuff etc,
and then this.
i dont know what happene.
did this event trigger something in her or did she just stop loving me.
i could accept that, but the way she left me makes me woried somehow.
anyone got experience with that behaviour ?


i swear i didnt treat her badly in any way, nothing justifies what she has done, but all i want is an explanation",23Apr2018,1
68,"I'm always that quiet guy around my family, school and friends. People keep telling me i should be sociable and get to know people. But i just don't care. I dont care about my family, ive never loved anyone and the only reason im interested in girls is for lustful purposes. I have friends but i cant see myself being there for them. Also i'm Christian but feel going to church is a bore though i believe there is a God. 

But here is the problem i faced lately: When i look back at this ""uncaring"" nature of mine i feel bad with myself. I want to make changes but i can't escape this comfortable zone ive created away from society. It makes me feel terrible. So am i depressed??",23Apr2018,2
69,"This morning I woke up and didn't feel right. My brain felt all buzzy and my skin itched. I couldn't focus on anything until like 10:00. I was scratching at my arms, I couldn't really control it. I felt anxious, but not like a panic attack, more detatched. What's going on with me?",23Apr2018,1
70,"I reached out to an outpatient treatment center a few months ago, and the cost was $800 for the program, which us great. My insurance covered a lot to make it that amount. But I decided against it. Things have still been bad so I contacted the place again today to get info. I just feel guilty looking for treatment.maybe because its expensive and my parents will have to pay for it. My parents are well,off so 800 os not a lot of money for them. But, I still feel like I'm being dramatic. But also my situation is not the best. In not abke to function like others my age and have bad anxiety and am very deoendent on my boyfriend. I don't drive and have frequent outburst. I Also have boughts of depression every month and struggle to,leave the house by myself. I still feel like I'm being dramatic by looking into outpatient treatment. Ive been hosotitalized mutiple times when I was younger and it caused issues so I think this is were the guilt is coming from. Anyway, I have someone from treatment center calling me today.

71,"I'm just curious and was looking for some advice. Last week, I wanted to learn to type on a computer keyboard, as I'm an aspiring web developer, where typing speed would make you more efficient.

Last week, I was intensly practicing, upto 6 hours a day for 4 days straight. The first day, I had a mild headache followed by tiredness. The second day I had a mild headache, that wasn't bothersome, but again, tiredness soon followed. The thrid day, I got a mild headache, the same as the previous day, with no progression with pain. The fourth day, the headache was becoming annoying and decided to take a break for a few days.

Now, just over a week later, I decided to get back to studying, but After 15 minutes of typing I had a headache in the same spot that my previous headaches were present.

Just looking for advice as I think I over did it. Do I need to take a longer break, as I already had taken 5 days break?

72,"I have this really weird thing where whenever I get too stressed my brain randomly flashes images of things stabbing me in the eye. It’ll last for a couple seconds, as sort of a filter over my vision where I can almost see it happening from outside my head and like a phantom feeling at the same time, almost like an itch I can’t scratch. Usually it’s some sort of knife or needle stabbing me in the eye and then dragging down through my skin, but sometime it’s like things slashing my wrists and neck and stuff. It’s not like I /want/ any of that to happen obviously, it’s just kind of spontaneous and weird. I’ve asked my guidance counselor about it and she said that the only place she’s heard of anything like it is in ptsd when a certain situation or something triggers a specific image, but she’s never heard of it being stress-induced. Has anyone ever experienced something like this? What do I do?",23Apr2018,1
73,"So I was just recently told by my parents about it...as a child, I was in a class that was incredibly toxic and full of disruptive and rude people...i remember some bits of it...i got into an argument with a kid because he didnt like my book (it was childish...duh) but there was one event that I remember a bit more visually. There was a time where this girl who was at my age who wanted to bring me somewhere...I didnt know how to speak much at the time...and I was incredibly to myself. She started grabbing my arm and I got angry to the point of biting her arm so hard, she started bleeding and crying...I just went and continued playing in the park until the teacher told me to go to her...and I noticed she was mad at me...even though I didnt really care if she was hurt...just that I wanted to play my goddamn recess.

The next day came, and my parents went inside the classroom with me, the teacher, and the girl I bit. My father started getting angry at me, screaming at me for doing it and started hitting me for doing it to her...he made me apologize (I'm certain it's just discipline...but I genuinely didnt feel sorry for the girl). From what my parents said, the teacher recommended me a psychologist but my mother refused. So throughout elementary school I was bullied severely, left out, and just goddamn neglected. To this day I still wish they all fucking rot in hell.

Now I'll be honest...as an 18 year old, I am known as being short-tempered, violent, and just plain cold by how my parents describe me. Even though I'm mostly to myself, I love to fantasize and dream of a day where all the power and authority in the world is only for ME. I want wealth, power, and am willing to work hard if I'm interested.

Could this event have to do with how I am? I've been recently told by a best friend that It could be ASPD...but idk anymore.

74,"We always hear how obsession with social media is unhealthy. Whether its caring how many likes we get on Facebook or having the desire to post something interesting on you snapchat story, it is clear that our self image is affected by these things.

As a guy in my 20s who doesn't have Instagram, many people I meet give me some trouble when they hear I don't participate in the social media platform. My reasoning for not having one is that there are [multiple studies](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-39955295) that have shown it is the worst for young people's mental health and I feel that I would be susceptible to its effects.

On one hand I don't want to invest into another social network, but on the other hand I feel like I'm losing out by not joining in. I'm a very logical minded person and feel like having one would better connect me with people, increase the chance a girl I'm interested in would see cool things I do, and strengthen my self-identity. However, I know it would have a great chance of affecting my self image and cause me to care about something that I previously did not.

I already unconsciously do unhealthy things like check if someone viewed my snapchat story, or look up when the best time to post on facebook is. My question is, is all that stuff unhealthy or is it just pragmatic? There's definetely positive things to be gained by having a strong precense on social media, but is it all worth it?",23Apr2018,3

79,"When I was a freshman in high school I went through a pretty rough patch with depression/anxiety. It ended up getting so bad I had something of a breakdown, I couldn’t sleep and was somewhat delusional with my thinking. I ended up panicking in class and was taken to the hospital because people thought i was on drugs. I then went to one doctor who diagnosed a psychotic break, and then to a psychiatrist who prescribed Zoloft and Olanzapine. Nothing too serious in hindsight, but it definitely scared the shit out of me because I’ve always been scared I’ll develop schizophrenia, even though it’s never affected anyone in my family. It was kind of a blur and I bottled it in; keeping it in the back of my mind 

Fast forward a couple years when I’m graduating high school and the same sort of thing happens with delusional thoughts (pondering religion and how I’m “enlightened” even though I’ve considered myself agnostic most my life, general paranoia) though I was much more composed in how I handled it. Starting going back to the same psychiatrist and he chalked it up as anxiety and depression when facing changes in my life (leaving high school and going to college away from family).

I’ve been taking anti-depressants since then and been all around completely fine, with just some general anxiety here and there. This weekend though I went camping and got pretty drunk with some friends, and woke up with the worst hangover. I felt really out of it and melancholic/numb for most of the day, sort of similar to how I felt preceding these so-called breakdowns. I guess some advice I want is should I just be concerned that I’m having a bout of anxiety and it’ll pass, or will it lead to something more? I’m 21 and I’m aware around this age is when people start developing schizophrenia. I’m not sure why it’s such a huge worry for me, and just wanted to hear what people think of my experiences and what I can do to ease my concerns.",23Apr2018,1

This one came across my mind the other day and i cant seem to break it! The thought was, ""what if im in denial of my mental illness."" So my instant reaction was to search google (i'm a compulsive researcher) its one of my rituals. I do this to combat the anxiety. In long term it only creates more problems! I came across an article that was very triggering. It sent me into a huge cycle of worry and panic. In the article it says, Anosognosia ""lack of insight,"" is a symptom of severe mental illness experienced by some that impairs a person's ability to understand and perceive his or her illness. Does anyone else feel like theres some days of complete denial and others days aware of their illness? ",23Apr2018,3
