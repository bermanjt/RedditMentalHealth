0,"All,

I've been struggling with mental health issues for most of my life but have never addressed them.  In the last 3 months, the situation has escalated and not only have I been feeling worse, but I've completely withdrawn from my personal life and the issues I've been having are now becoming very detrimental to my overall livelihood.

I don't have a job, but do have limited health insurance.  This will not cover any therapy or counseling, but if I am admitted to a psychiatric hospital, I am covered for up to 10 days.

I've attempted to find sliding scale therapy options, but have not had any success finding a doctor I can afford on a consistent basis.

I've gone through MICA, I've looked into medicaid, I just don't think I'm going to be able to get any type of support that I know I need.

It seems my one option is to voluntarily admit myself.

Am I out of line or using the mental health system improperly?  Will this be something I can do on my own or do I need a friend to sign me in?

I have a lot of questions on this subject and would appreciate anyone to infinity who can provide me any sense of guidance.

Thanks",20Jul2018,2,
1,so i think i have to go back to the psych hospital for my depression. i’m 17 and i smoke weed and i was just wondering if they tell parents drug test results or if that’s confidential like it would be at the doctors office. i live in florida if that helps ,20Jul2018,1,
2,"I don't know if I'm a narcissist or not, but really I could give less of a fuck. I came on this subreddit because it seems like the only place I feel like it hits close to home. I really don't see why I have to ""improve"" myself to become a better person. There's no point to it. All my life, I have always been told I'm intelligent and have great potential by people, maybe not as often as I'd want, but I do. People screw over others all the time, I have every right to do so, and should be exclusive to me anyways.

Ever since I was a kid, I always LOVED the idea of just being able to screw people I hate over and have everyone I like admire me. Seriously, i could give less of a fuck about anyone, except maybe those I care about. I fantasize everyday about having so much wealth and power, I could just fuck up whoever the fuck I want without anything happening to me. It just feels perfect! To meet people who thinks I'm not capable or thinks otherwise are fucking idiots, I wonder why they are NOT in a position of power. 

Anyways I just wont lie to myself, I can't wait till I become successful, and I'll do whatever it takes!

My biggest obstacle is honestly my temper. My temper is keeping me from what I want. Any advice on controlling your anger that ISN'T therapy?

6,"I have what is essentially my dream life. I have a wife who I am totally in love with and who is totally in love with me. We have never, ever faught and she is never a source of stress. I am an introvert and I never get pressured to hang out with anyone. I spend a lot of time doing what I like which is watching movies, TV, and playing video games. As for work, I left America and moved to SE Asia so I could afford to work only 20 hours per week. My job is online so I never have to worry about commuting, bosses, or coworkers. I make enough for a comfortable life here. I am not lonely at all and have no desire to meet friends because I am content with just my wife for company. 

Despite my great life, I am stressing out all of the time. I stress about the future, about my job, about social interactions which would never happen. It's like I'm recreationally stressing! And none of my stressing even makes sense! I never have issues with my job and everything always goes fine, but I still stress about it. And I've long accepted that the future is totally unpredictable and never ever goes to plan, but I still make plans and stress about them. 

All of this stress is eating away at me. I grind my teeth and night and last night I had a dream that was just me experiencing stress for hours. To combat stress i have been trying, and struggling, with being mindful and eing fully present in the moment. I will keep trying at this. I also changed my subreddits to only happy ones so that my brain is exposed to more positive inputs. It hasn't helped that much yet lol. Does anyone have suggestions on what I can do to stop creating my own stress? ",20Jul2018,4,
7,"It does come and go. Sometimes I’ll think “you know, I’m looking okay,” but then I’ll see a photo (or worse, a video) that someone has taken of me and I’ll start stressing over it again. And it’s happened just recently. I had my graduation, and I almost feel like the images looked like a different person. Still someone I could recognise as me, but in a more “oh, god, is that really me?” kind of way. I’ve been described as “handsome” by a handful of friends. However, I just can’t help but every now and then get dropped into this depressive state where suddenly it seems I’m far less good-looking than I’d thought, (bearing in mind at best I consider myself as good-looking as the average person) and the more I think about it, the worse it gets. I can’t work out whether I’m really not so great looking or whether something weird is going on in my head.",20Jul2018,2,
8,"I have left many relationships behind on my quest to pursue one of my goals. The goal also stemmed from a problematic stay in my family's home, due to some serious mental health issues going on because of which I am extremely worried of ever stepping towards my home for the sake of mental health.

This has left me with severe isolation, and I have not found a therapist who can fully understand the complexities of the situations yet. Some therapists are even reluctant in placing an abusive trait on me.

Generally, the time has come where I have become extremely disappointed said therapists would not mind the abuse coming from external sources - potentially family, a relationship, and pretty much everyone who has not supported me when I needed to, when I'd expect them to, such as friends or family members.

Yes, I was selfish, but I also deserve to be selfish like everyone else is. Besides, it doesn't seem I would ever be a welcome party whether it was at home or with friends. The friends would not even care about me or how I feel, so I became hesitant about maintaining the relationship.

It seems that when I became as selfish as everyone else, some people started forgetting about me, and I started noticing how much they do not care about me. One friend I had said they will support me in my goals, which they haven't done.

Family neglected my goals, didn't want to nourish them. Otherwise I would've succeeded and would not have complained here.

The therapist I go to right now belittles me and demonizes me. Suicide hotlines only end up hurting me more.  
One woman said a hurtful statment and when I confronted her about it she decided to calmly shut the phone in my face.  
Another man would dismiss the conversation without my consent, and I confronted them about it at least two times (I just asked why they do that, and they would say they have nothing to say and that I did not give enough details despite having giving them every possible detail). At one point they repeated their pleasantry goodbye and shut the phone in my face. It was not even a heated conversation, it was rather very calm and they just disrespectfully shut the phone in my face. I would expect more from an open hotline, and I do not care if they volunteer. It's their choice to volunteer, they probably have valid reason to open up a suicide hotline and I do not deserve to get such maltreatment just because they are considered ""volunteers"". I almost wanted to commit suicide after those calls",20Jul2018,1,
9,"So I've been through a bad breakup recently and the stress is getting to me. I have started to do things I haven't done in a long time, and I'm worried about my own behaviour. It's not healthy and it needs to change.

When I was a kid I had anger issues that resulted in physical fights with my siblings, and SCREAMING tantrums - well past an acceptable age. It was so bad that my parents sent me to taekwondo to get the excess anger out, to huge success. I guess my anger bursts were just my way of handling stress as a kid. Taekwondo gave me exercise and something to focus my anger on, which helped a lot.

Later in life (20-21) I developed a habit of compulsive crying. I wouldn't be 'sad' per se, but my BODY just needed a cry. I hope that makes sense. I guess it was my new form of stress release because I didn't want to be ANGRY again. If I was too tired I would cry. If I was too happy I would cry. Ironically, if I was sad, I was never quite sad enough to cry. This was a pretty good time in my life, so I was very worried about the crying. It seemed to come from nowhere. I knew it was abnormal and I wondered if it was a symptom of something worse than stress. But it never interfered with my life and I always felt better after 'letting it out' so I never saw a doctor about it.

However, it DID affect my partner sometimes, so I developed some coping tactics to make things easier on him (and myself). I would laugh at myself when I felt teary, and if I caught myself tearing up, I would do a crazy little boogie to distract myself. It made him laugh, and that always cheered me up. If I was overcome by the tears, I learned to excuse myself to cry until I felt better. And it worked. Once I developed a routine to prevent and deal with the crying, it got easier. Over time, it stopped entirely. I am now 22 and I no longer have these outbursts.

However, because of this recent breakup, I'm dealing with a LOT of excess stress again. We broke up last week and it has been nothing but nonstop tears and frustration for me. Occasionally we'll both be in a good mood and we'll talk and watch movies or something together, trying to keep our friendship healthy, but even that is painful for me. Recently I had a full-blown meltdown in response to an argument. I started screaming at him (something I've never done before), and muttering under my breath impulsively (something I SPECIFICALLY STOPPED myself from doing all those years ago as a kid because I knew it wasn't ok behaviour). I slammed doors and threw shit. It was fucking embarrassing, and very unlike me. Normally I try very hard not to be a dick. I failed miserably.

I have since apologised.
He's living in my house for another two weeks and I do NOT want to have a repeat of that tantrum. A sincere apology means nothing if I don't work on my behaviour.

I think the stress is the biggest issue for me here.

Do you guys have any coping mechanisms that you think might be useful? Especially anyone with anger issues or depression. I'd love some advice.

NOTE: My crying/anger issues are NOT why he dumped me. We had a perfectly good relationship. We talked about getting married and our future together quite a bit. He dumped me because he wanted to fuck other girls, despit our sex life being great. He just wanted variety. Didn't want to talk things over. I had no warning this was coming. I think you can see why that might be a bit unhinging for me.",20Jul2018,1,
10,"I've recently noticed this alot more but I find that I'm always angry regardless Im angry with no reasoning. I also find that I lack alot of emotion in the way I go about day to day life. There can be bread fleeting moments of happiness for example, however I lack any form of long term significant emotion such as sad ect I just always feel disappointed with my self and just don't have any emotional say in a situation its always just ""this is a moment in my life"". I hate social situations and just manipulate my family or friends into thinking I'm happy or the relevant emotion for the situation. Also with the anger thing I'm just recently finding alot of hateful thoughts towards things and negativity that I don't express but is always there about any situation. ",20Jul2018,1,
11,"Idk how long it's been going on... maybe a week?

I feel like maybe dissociated? Not my usual dissociation tho... maybe this is normal life? Idk I feel.... odd...

I feel pretty anxious. If you've read my previous posts, I have these seizure-like episodes (I don't remember what the doc called them. PNES or pseudoseizures). So with my anxiety this high, I feel like I'm gonna have an episode pretty constantly. I've had two or three episodes in the past week. The anxiety keeps me up at night. I hate nighttime, it feels so lonely. Like I'm lonely during the day, but this is like worse cuz I feel like my room is a jail, that I can't leave it after bedtime. Which is almost true, cuz if I'm not super quiet when I do decide to leave my room for some reason, then my mom could hear and then she'll get up and question y I'm up and worry that I'm not doing well and stuff so it's just simpler to not go out of my room. Since mom has all my meds locked up, I have to sneak some out of her hiding spot or stock them up after she gives me them so that I have a stash for bad nights when I need extra help to sleep and I feel awful for doing that. Nighttime sucks.

Also, I've been feeling kinda impulsive. Like especially verbally. Like I've had no filter. I'll say something and as soon as it's out of my mouth I'll be like why da fuq did I just say that? And also like I see something around the house I should do, so I start doing it and completely forget about something else that needed to be done, that like was more important. Or I like chore hop, start one thing and then get distracted by another, leaving the first half done.

My memory feels off too. Like today, I was getting ready, like doing my hair and washing my face and stuff, and I was like ""oh I need a washcloth"",  so I opened the cabinet and looked at it like ""uuuuuh, what did I need in here?"". When I'm working outside in the yard, I'll go to the shed for something and stand there like ""um, I needed what? Oh yeah"". I mean I was listening to stuff on my phone (show or audiobook) at the same time as these things but I feel like it's worse than ""normal"" people. And I hate doing chores in silence cuz the quiet raises my anxiety, so I can't not listen to something to help the memory thing. 

Idk I'm  scared something bad is gonna happen, like I'm gonna go down the vortex into a bad depressive episode or something.

12,"My boyfriend and I are going through some rough times. We moved in together but he and I are kinda just existing together rather than living together. I recently got back in touch with an old ex of 7 years because we have gone through a lot of shit together. My boyfriend asked me to leave the apartment for a few weeks and I told him that was fine and I was going to go hang out with my ex for the weekend. He didnt really care. While I was there my ex and I basically fell back in love. But he is very bad for me. I told my boyfriend right away that something happened between us and now we wont speak to me and all my stuff is in the apartment. I dont know why I dug myself into this hole. I feel stupid and immature. I know the love is gone with my boyfriend and I but I am still really sad to let it go. I know deep down it wont work out with my ex, we have too many things preventing us from working. For one, he used to be a girl (not that thats a deal-breaker but it just adds to the drama). Two, I almost killed myself over him and three, it would be long distance and that never works.

Sometimes I can, but sometimes I can’t bc my parents will get so mad they might kick me out or disown me or even if not, they are still my parents and if I am living under their roof, I have to respect them to a certain level. Like I can stand up for myself about somethings, but there is a limit. Especially since my family is Indian, and

14,"Hi. My name is Hope. I am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (bi polar type), PTSD, stimulant use disorder, and some sort of cannabis addiction.

I don't at all want to lose weight, I just am afraid of insect contamination. I have a theory on this. See I came from an abusive family, and because of that, my family didn't help me with a lice infestation at 15. I had thick hair and I kept asking my aunt who I lived with to help. She would always say she would do it 'in a day or two' or she would just 'keep an eye on it' even after finding a bug in my hair. Her husband molested her daughter, who then molested me at 6. The whole family would play psychological tricks on me such as this one. Now whenever I see flies, I just get terrified. I hate eating rice.

18,"Hello there folks!

I am a 22 year old man with a decent diet and regular exercise. I was quite popular in high school and now I've got a wife and son, quite a few friends, people I can talk to in general and quite a few personal hobbies like reading/writing stories, spending time with family, making dumb reddit comments and playing video games. Overall I'm genuinely quite happy. I didn't really want to post anything here because to be honest I'm more than a little embarrassed by this. 

However, I've realised that it might not be quite normal for someone to be talking to themselves in the mirror occasionally. There's not really any pre-requisites for it to happen, it kinda just does. When I initiate the conversation I see myself in the mirror and then end up thinking ""this is another person"" but I KNOW it's me, I know that there's not another person there but I feel like they're there. I feel like it might just be me being introspective, my other self (when we talk, which has only been three times this year, it only happened this year in the mirror) is more logical, asking me how I would handle something and then presenting me with another option- but it's never destructive. I also kind of just encourage myself in the mirror, having conversations about always trying to do better for my wife, son and friends but I'm very concerned that even though it's always a positive/logical conversation it's still with my reflection in the mirror and in the moment my mind always thinks ""this is another person"" but I KNOW it's not. 

A few things about my mental health history that might help solve this:

1. I grew up with night terrors and sleep paralysis to the point where I'd be half-awake looking in my room but full of terror thinking something is there when I've trained myself to know that nothing is there over the years- I often yell to fully wake myself. When I was younger they'd also be accompanied by auditory illusions, though that's never happened again in the last 8 years and it was only a handful of times.
2. I have synesthesia, it's triggered mostly by sounds and intense emotion but it's nothing that genuinely bothers me. Seeing weirdly shaped colours used to be distracting as a child but I thought it was normal until my teachers and professors talked to me about it, though they said it was nothing to be afraid of and I never was. 
3. I suffered from depression a lot, especially during sunset. I'm at my peak at morning and I'm fine at night but when I'm alone or even seldom with my wife I am met with melancholy during a sunset. I was often beaten by my parents as a child with their hands and thick leather belts, though this is incredibly common in the Caribbean where I'm originally from. Sometimes my mother took it too far and locked me in a hot garage one night for a while for disobeying and always put a tonne of pressure on me as the elder brother for school. She'd often find different ways to punish me, though the expression they'd both say ""if you can't hear, you'll feel"" taught me both discipline when necessary and rebellion where appropriate. I'd often come home to see my dad, but my mother would always lock her and my dad in their room and not have him spend time with us as children after work which I understand being with my wife wanting some alone time but this happened every day which didn't help my already depressed state as a child. Because of these things, I always felt more at home outside of my house, especially at school where I had a lot of friends, but I'd always end up feeling so alienated in my own house. My parents would fight often every other week and my mother would yell and be physically violent with my father to the point where police would be involved at times- my friends parents believe it's because he had no spine to set her straight when she was out of line and I was the only person to ever really do that. Things were fine when we had no money but after my father's company took off and my mother began working as an accountant I guess the stress built up in her and she took it out on my brother and especially me. One day, when I was 15, they had a particularly vicious fight and I left the house on bike with my dog to the beach and had a conversation with myself to cope. Most of the time before that, conversations with myself were to just help me solve math equations and literature essays.

\- I believe this might have been some of the contributing factors as to why I tried ending myself in my second year               
of uni overseas. My mother was straining my relationship with family members I was living with in Canada and I was torn in the middle as well as receiving constant threats by her to end my academic aspirations time and time again. She had asked me to deny the government scholarship in order to give it to someone who needed it as they had enough money to pay for my uni. I won't go into full detail about the rest but I felt like I was just making everyone suffer around me for no reason and wanted a way out, I tried slipping some things about what I was doing to my friends to see if they could pick up on it and help me but I should have been more direct. It was during that month of October 2015 that I met my wife who would help me to regain my confidence, optimism in life and see that there was more to life than my current list of situations. She's been a big inspiration to me, she's a shy woman and we make an odd pair but she really helped me to be extroverted and upbeat again, I know for a fact that if I were to lose her and our beautiful son tomorrow God forbid for whatever reason I could still be happy with myself and continue on. 

\-When finding out about my girlfriend, my mother gave me two options: 1. Break up with her and keep my education and money or 2. Stay with her but lose my education/living in Canada (which meant never seeing her anyway) but still get to live with her and my father. I left and I haven't spoken with them since, at first it was hard but after getting a job and having some loving family members help us out things looked better, and ever since then I haven't been depressed unless there's a sunset (which only depresses me 1/5 of the time it used to).

But back to my original point. Are the conversations that I'm having perfectly healthy? Should I stop them? Do you think the events/issues above are what triggered my recent ""conversations""? I've only done it maybe a handful of times (including 30 mins ago) but when I do it goes on for a good while (15-30 mins) and my reflection registers as an actual person to me in front of me, like I was in the same room as them- but the moment we say goodbye they feel like just a reflection to me. Also remember that I've only ever had encouraging or introspective conversations with my reflection, \*I haven't been suicidal or seriously depressed in years.\*

I also wanted to say that I don't want this to be a tear down with my parents. My wife and I know they were pretty bad even for our standards here in the Caribbean. I just wanted to see if anyone else had this kinda thing going on or see what you all think about it.   


Sorry about this being so long! This is my first time talking about talking to myself in the mirror to anyone besides my wife.

They all say they’ve been through more things than I have, they work harder, and worse things are happening to them.

I get sad over the past, hanging out with old friends, school things, family, etc. the list goes on. I have parent problems too.  I’ve been told I shouldn’t get sad over parents screaming at me because they don’t physically hurt me, like my boyfriends parents do to him. 

People have also told me I have it a lot better than them. I have a little bit of money. My family is in the middle class. We live in a small town, a lot of people are in the low-middle class. People have told me I shouldn’t get sad because I have money and I shouldn’t take it for granted.

33,"tl;dr @ bottom

i went off prozac in march. i still have my last bottle, i keep it on my trophy shelf. i was diagnosed with severe clinical depression, ocd, aspergers, and c-ptsd. i was on wellbutrin for two years and prozac for a year and change. 

i notoriously have awful summer deprssion. i just sit alone and wear my sweaters and watch crime dramas until i get to go back to school. even with medication, by august i was always very close to ending my life. its always hot, and always miserable. 

my assumption was; no pills, the sadness goes up tenfold. i stocked my room with junk food and downloaded sad movies. i was super, duper ready to wallow. but then i surprised myself and got accepted to a special academy for global studies. then i got a job as a summer reading volunteer and student mentor at the library. ive never had as few friends as i have right now, but this is the best i've ever done.

i dont have people around me who dont listen to me anymore. i dont just sit around and stare into nothingness, i found friends in podcasts and in books. it had been three years since i read for pleasure and now it's all i do. i play with my new dog and dream of my dog that passed away and i know he's happy im spending my summer like he's right here with me. 

im shocked. because im not happy artificially. sure, im still stressed and tired, and yes, i have flashbacks and obsessions, and i have lapses in my social abilities, and my gender dysphoria beats me up every day. i can look past the summer and see a future for myself. its not a death in august, just back to school shopping and my puppies ear's standing up. some days, i dont get out of bed. but after that, i get up knowing i can do it. im better than summer depression.

tl;dr- i went off my medication and assumed i would die. i started listening to podcasts, reading, working and playing with my pets. im friendless and still kind of a mess but im a mess with hope for the future. having my best summer so far. ",20Jul2018,9,
34,"I am 17 and have been going out with my current girlfriend (16) for over 8 months, during this time she has had self harm ""relapses"" (it used to be much worse), a suicide attempt involving large amounts of advil and tylenol, and dozens of nights where I stay up with her until 3-4 and keep her calm and talk until she falls asleep. I've tried broaching the subject of getting help with he mental health, either through a therapist or getting medicated, but she has been raised to believe that doctors, therapists ect. are not there to help, and are mearly there to drug up and medicate people so they can get paid. Whenever I broach the subject about seeing a therapist is goes down somewhat like this

1: Big event happens, relapse, depressed day, anorexic tendencies

2: I talk with her and get her ""down"" or sometimes just stay on the line with her.

3: I ask or question about seeing a therapist or some sort of medical specialist

4: she turns off immediatly and goes on a rant about how if she goes they will tell her parents about her suicidal tendencies and then her mom will get her admited and abandon her. (unfortunately this is something that seems likely to happen if she does get admited)

5: either we keep talking and she goes to sleep eventually or she hangs up and wont respond to me in any way.

Last time she tried to kill herself she ended up in the hospital, got her stomach pumped, and had social services come in, but nothing got followed up because of her and her moms attitude and demeanor about getting her help (Mainly a therapist), her parents don't seem to care about her mental health, and this causes more problems when I ask about finding independent help without her parents knowing.

Whenever I bring up a therapist and she rants her thought process goes like this 

1: She goes and sees a therapists

2: they contact parents since shes underage about self harm or similar, want her admited

3: her mom is willing to do so because it means less work for her and she is admited

4: they take her in and shes drugged and treated and isnt herself anymore

5: her mom wont take her back and shes moved to some sort of inpatient facility indefinitely. 

She believes that doctors and therapists want you drugged and medicated and will falsely diagnose you ""because that's how they get paid""
tonight she tried to get high off of advil and tylenol to deal with something and this is what she sent after she hung up on me, I dont know how to help her and I need to find out how I can.

    Sorry I'm not the perfect girlfriend and I do db fucking shit like overdose and try and kill myself and I cut myself. Sorry that I cause you pain and anxiety. Sorry that I refuse to see a therapist because I don't deserve help. I feel as if I'm faking it taking up problems to be noticed and hurting myself so people can feel sympathy for me but that's untrue because I tell no one and I hate telling people because they'll look at me and say because I'm not skinny I don't have an Ed. Because Im not on meds I'm not depressed or because I cut I seek attention and I feel those stereotypes are true. I am a fuck up who honestly doesn't care if she ends up as a heroin whore on the streets. And sorry I won't impatient myself for you. I don't deserve help. And I'm sorry I did this too you tonight.

He’s got this “it’s all in your head, if you believe you have it you convince yourself” type of mindset. 

I never really thought about getting tested until my gf said that I may have bipolar disorder since I show some similar symptoms that her father has. I didn’t think much of this until I was talking to my best friend who said I should get tested since I have a history with depression and suicidal urges since I was 13.

I know this all may seem weird or crazy but I just want to know why I’ve been losing my mind recently. I can have these high peaks of happiness but then one little chip at it and it all falls down. I’ll get really angry to where I lose thought and become very aggressive or I’ll get very sad to where I think of committing suicide just to end all the problems in life. I also tend to be very childish and selfish when I’m making decisions under these conditions and don’t seem to care about anything. I start believing that nobody loves me and that the world starts hating me and that there is no such thing as happiness. I don’t know how to really explain how I just lose my mind in these moments.

38,"Hi, half a year+ ago I had a first episode of psychosis. When psychotic I had delusions that weren't fixed beliefs and would last 1-2 days. I had many different delusions, some persecutory and others grandiose. I was out of hospital in three weeks. I was psychotic for over a month but probably under two months. I'm on medication and not experiencing any psychotic symptoms.

When looking back, I'm wondering if some thoughts I had are just creative/visionary, or psychotic. In the years before my psychotic episode, I had a period where I would daydream about a plan to set up a kind of economic cooperative system on my street. I pictured myself being well known in my local community and respected.

46,"So, I have this friend that I've known for nearly 10 years. We both have struggled with depression and anxiety for many many years, and by and large, we experience the same daily struggles. Over the past few months I have started cutting her out of my life because I started getting really furious and hurt about the fact that she is not as loyal a friend to me as I am to her. This is something that's always bugged me about our relationship, and always I excuse her with her depression holding her back from being able to fully commit to our friendship, but I snapped and decided that I'm not putting up with it anymore. I often get this guilt trip that I'm cruel and I should be more understanding, so I'd like a little insight from you lovely people.

So let me give you the backstory to how I came to the point where I couldn't actively be a friend to her anymore. We met at school and got on well. She was new, I was newish, and I really wanted to have a ""best friend"" and I thought it would work since we got on SO WELL and lived in the same town. I asked her if she wanted to do something after school, and so any time I made a suggestion we'd hang out and have a great time. A wonderful friendship ensued. During this friendship we had many honest conversations, in one of which I told her that it upsets me that she never asks me to do anything together, it's always me who initiates everything, and that I'd appreciate it if every once in a while the invitation came from her even if we wind up doing the same thing as ever. Nothing ever changed. She had a boyfriend and I was understanding of the fact that she was putting time aside for him too, but still I was upset.

Fast forward several years. Though we were seeing and talking to each other a lot less and things got pretty distant at times, we remained friends throughout college and uni (she went to uni, I went straight to work). Any time we met up we had a great time and it felt like no time had passed. I was still frustrated that she would never reach out to me unless she needed something, but at the end of each of our meetings she said to keep in touch and do something again soon - and then I didn't hear from her. 

June last year - she's not feeling great about herself, she lacks confidence in her career, appearance, social life, etc. Her boyfriend ends their 7 year relationship out of the blue. She is devastated, near suicidal. She texts me throughout this and the day after he broke up with her I go to see her after work to keep her company and to let her talk. I'm there for hours, I let her vent, I speak my mind about what a douche he is (I never liked the guy and spoke about it a few times, but it annoyed her so I just said I think she could do better and dropped it) when she wants to hear my opinion, I hold her as she cries and stroke her hair. She thanked me for coming over, her mum thanked me for helping, her brother (whom I had never met at that point) messages me to thank me for the support - overall I feel pretty good about myself as a friend to her, I feel I've done a good job. I keep in touch with her over the coming weeks, meet up every now and then, try to build her up and take her mind off things. A few weeks later she learns her mum has cancer and I support her through that too. She is very grateful, she tells me I've been the best friend to her in that time she has ever had and that I've done more than she ever could have imagined or hoped for. She apologised for getting distant while we were at college/uni and for always putting her ex before me and for neglecting our friendship. Things are looking like I might have my ""best friend"" after all.

August of that same year - something happens at my work that completely derails me. I break down and am unable to go to work because I'm crying literally every second of my day that I am alone. The day after it happens I text my friend and tell her I feel terrible, could she come over and hang out (we still live in the same town, walking distance apart). She says she can't, but I'm welcome to come to her if I want. That stung, but I tried not to think about it so much and I went. I filled her in and she offered her support etc. I'm a complete mess for the next several weeks.

September of that same year - it's my birthday on the week when my parents are going away on holiday. I'm still a mess and anxious about being on my own for a week because I get very dark thoughts and unhealthy behaviours when there is no one around to keep me in check. My friend knows this, I told her explicitly about my anxieties. Not once does she offer her company. Not even on the day of my birthday. One evening I write to her to ask if she wants to come over and have a movie night or something and again she tells me no, but I can come to her if I want. This really really hurt, I said no and I cried for hours. 

After all this I'm very deeply upset that after all the effort I've been putting into looking after her and supporting her when she was at a seriously low point of her life she couldn't do the same for me. I felt that I deserved much better and at that point I chose to not engage with her that much, just be a little bit more casual. We still talked and met up frequently, but I stopped putting in all this effort like I did before. The only times we met up after her suggestion were when she was upset about something and wanted to be comforted, but never just to see me and spend time together. 

The last time was the final strike for me. A week before her birthday in April she texts me asking if we can do something on the day of her birthday because her parents won't be at home and she doesn't want to be alone as she's feeling very low. I said yeah, I was gonna come to see you anyway, but I can take some time off work so we can make a day of it. This makes her very happy and we make it a date in town at around 12ish. She's late because she's ""having a slow day"" and is trying to put some time into making herself look pretty to boost her confidence. I'm all for that, but her tardiness really annoys me - I take time off work and she can't honour it by being punctual? It's not like we were meeting at the crack of dawn, she had plenty of time to get herself ready. She literally just got out of bed, had breakfast with her mum, did her makeup, and her mum drove her into town. I was annoyed that she was wasting my time and also money, but I dropped it soon. We have a great day and it ends great. She's really appreciative, especially of me taking time off work to be with her. The next day I ask her if she wants to hang out again and she says yes, and again she's late because she's ""having a slow day"". She kept me waiting over an hour. She shows up eventually, we go around having a nice time and we part our ways. A week later I ask her if she wants to meet in town where she's working and have lunch together. She says yes, then no, then yes again, and keeps going back and forth. We settle on yes and by the time I arrive in town she texts me that she's already on her break because she's too stressed. 

After that I decided not contact her anymore. I've responded to her contact but didn't engage in conversation. She never asked to see me or do anything together. She'll always hint around that it would be nice to do something together and not make any concrete plans, as though she's waiting for me to make the move - as always. I don't reach out to her anymore. 

So what do you think? Do you think I'm right to be annoyed and not make the effort anymore? Or do you think I should be more understanding of her personal struggles, be as forgiving as I always have been and carry on as we were? I'd love your insight and opinions.",20Jul2018,1,

50,"I've been through a few more bramble patches than the average person. From the death of my mother, to childhood abuse and neglect, to being socially rejected throughout school for being the weird kid, to having a complete mental breakdown in college, to [having the CIA beam thoughts directly into my head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia), it hasn't always been easy. I've just gotten out of the hospital from a recent breakdown, and it's still the hang over phase of recovery, but I'm doing alright. If you're just joining me and my writing, my core philosophy revolves around how free will is a skill. I believe pulling oneself up by their bootstraps is a stupid phrase (a juggler must live in a reality with gravity), but without putting their own effort into recovery, it doesn't matter how great of a support system a person has; they won't even begin to touch the parts of their psyche which need help the most.

To understand this, we must take a look at what healing even is. Healing is not something a doctor can do for you. A bandaid does not heal a wound, it merely makes it easier for the wound to heal. Healing is a natural process which is perpetually ongoing in the body. Entropy is a major force of the universe, and our bodies do a damn good job resiting it. Moreso, the human brain is a product of countless generations of recursive evolutionary improvement. Some people get the idea that evolution is truly random. While there is a great deal of randomness involved in natural selection, the selective filters and extinction events ensure that species keep accumulating the best traits for the world's environments. By extension, this means that the mind developed to be it's own self-regulator. As complex as it is, the brain and all connected components of the nervous system have an inherent balance that keeps everything working so we can survive well enough in this world to claim the title of apex predators.

Just as the body can mend a cut, the mind can mend an emotional wound from trauma. This isn't always easy, nor is it always automatic. Usually, with the most extreme trauma, the brain will ""isolate"" those memories so that they can be processed later. It is not beneficial to grieve for the loss of a loved one when the saber tooth tiger that killed them is right in front of us. Often in our modern world, which has grown increasingly impersonal and detached from the truth of the human condition, this means that traumatic memories get buried under layers of new memories as we go about life. This results in us ""losing sight"" of what is causing our pain and suffering. Sometimes, an event can trigger us to vividly remember these events, but ultimately, if a person chooses to deny the source of their mental anguish, they will remain blind to it. It doesn't matter how good a therapist is, if a person is unwilling to look within and do the work to unbind themselves from these unprocessed emotions, then they will remain unprocessed.

The self is the only source of support that can be relied on 100% of the time. We may have the best friends in the world, but to throw all our hopes of recovery on them is not only foolish, it's also selfish. Regardless of how badly the world has broken us down, we will always have the ability to make progress on ourselves. We may not be able to heal our inner wounds in a day, but we can always make an effort to chip away at it. Incremental progress is still progress. As long as someone is willing to make an honest attempt at the work, they will eventually find themselves in a better head space. By all means, we should have an external support system to help us. But, no one can see behind our eyes like we can.

So how is this done? First and foremost, it takes a bit of honesty and bravery. We must cast aside all our defense mechanisms which hide our pain behind layers of distortion. Once we can look in the mirror and truthfully see a person who wants to heal, regardless of the pain involved, then we can start the work. After this, it really depends on the person.  Yoga, meditation, mindfulness, breathing (pranayama), contemplation, affirmations, focused journaling, and so much more are means for us to travel inwards and perceive what is there. Likewise, when used properly, in the right mindset and environment, and with an experienced sitter, psychedelics can give us immense insight into ourselves. Some people think psychedelics are healing agents. They are not. We are the ones who heal ourselves; psychedelics only act as another lens to refract our inner light in a new way. For some people, this may jump start their recovery in ways that may not have been feasible otherwise. I know I was resistant to looking within to my deepest, darkest traumas, but psychedelics acted as one of many steps leading me to a place where I could do so. 

My journey to recovery is long from over. Yet, I've noticed that it gets easier over time. It's not always linear. There are many twists and turns where new memories pop up, and old ones resurface to remind me that I am not done with them. Alchemy calls changing the self the great *work* for a reason. This should not be seen as a deterrent, rather, we should see it as a journey that will lead us to a beautiful place. We all have the ability to reach our highest potential. I'm striving to reach mine, and I hope I can help you reach yours. Thank you for reading this, and more importantly, thank you for being you.",20Jul2018,1,
51,"I (m27) need help in how to be supportive with a SO (f21) with mental health problems.

She is aware she has problems, she’s been on several types and doses of antidepressants for 8 years now but still has meltdowns where she wants to kill herself.

At the beginning of our relationship I was supportive, I got her doctor appointments, CBD oil for her anxiety, created daily plans with small things that she felt she had control over, wrote everything down so she could see her progress and what she could work on etc. However the past few weeks she reverted back into not helping herself which caused awful arguments.

Few examples - getting incredibly drunk, talking about wanting to kill herself, got angry when I took her alcohol away for the rest of the night, then when I was in bed she proceeded to get a can of beer from the fridge and drink it while lying in bed with me, just purely disrespectful. She also has missed 2 doctors appointment for counselling because she couldn’t face it, which I get, but she always talks about how good she feels afterwards and how she enjoys talking to someone. I got angry at this because for starters that’s a session wasted where someone else could have used it, and secondly it was short sighted to just not go, and she knows she needs to go to help. 

It just feels like sometimes I’m talking to a brick wall, and I don’t know if I can help her anymore if she won’t help herself. Every time we talk about it, I unfortunately get angry because of all this, even though I’ve tried not to, she’s just stubborn and it winds me up.

We discussed everything and she has rightfully told me that my getting angry doesn’t help anything, so I agreed that I will stop pushing for her to get out the house daily, or or try and exercise, or to make doctors appointments because apparently that’s making it worse for her - but now I don’t know how to be supportive? I can’t just sit there and tell her that it will all be okay, because it won’t. Not without help, and if she won’t get help then how will it work out?

53,"I've been on Lovan 60mg and 15mg of Avanza to treat severe depression and anxiety for the last year or so. Still on the same meds, but I've noticed some changes. I am losing interest and enjoyment in the hobbies I usually enjoy, am finding it hard to motivate myself and becomming increasingly concerned and anxious over my bodyweight. My mood drops quickly after doing an activity and good feelings don't seem to last long. I feel empty, and like this is different from the person that I have been for the past year or so - happy, thankful, enthusiastic, idk.

56,"I’ll add a little bit of backstory first. I’m a 22 year old female and I identify as bisexual. I’ve been married to my wife (23, lesbian) for almost a year now. During the time we have been married, the following incidents have happened: - My wife has called me names such as piece of shit, bitch, crazy, psychotic, piece of shit of a wife multiple times. - Took our marriage status off her Facebook when she got mad at me - Has given her wedding ring back to me on multiple occasions (the last time she threw it at me) - Destroyed our marriage certificate - Threatened to break my car windows, call the police on me, or call my parents - Attempted to drag me down the stairs to lock me out of our apartment - Accused me of doing sexual things with my male friends or accused me of cheating on her (neither is true) - I caught her having an emotional affair with another woman - Made me delete an ex-boyfriend who I haven’t talked to in years off Facebook, however she was talking to her ex-fiancée on Facebook (not who she had an affair with) - Told me she would “knock me the fuck out” - Made multiple comments about me having secret boyfriends - Threatened divorce on multiple occasions - Got jealous when guys have liked my Facebook posts - Told me she wouldn’t feed my dog or cat - Has told me that when she divorces me, she’ll go back to the girl she had an affair with - Has taken my phone and keys to prevent me from leaving the apartment - Threatened to shoot herself in the head - Held a knife to her throat - Has said she regretted marrying me - Has gone through my phone and Facebook - Knows all of my passwords but I know none of hers

And that’s not everything. I could write a book on how the last 6 months have gone. Before we got married, it was not like this. She had a little bit of jealously but never to this extent. I feel trapped. I’m her second marriage, and her ex-wife was abusive back to her. I have never physically or emotionally abused my wife. I pretty much just take the blows. I feel trapped because things aren’t always bad. We will have weeks at a time where things are perfect and no arguments whatsoever. It’s like she literally just snaps all of a sudden. Last night she threw her wedding ring at me because we got into an argument. The argument was over a high school best friend who called me the other night for the first time in two years. I’ve told my wife about this friend before and how we just drifted apart. My only current friends are the friends my wife has and she’s always telling me to get my own friends. However, when I tried to rekindle my friendship with my high school best friend a couple of days ago, my wife called it “weird” and “random” and acted like she had a problem with it and an argument started. My wife made jabs like “go hang out with your ‘best friend’” meanwhile my wife visited her hometown last week and hung out with a friend she once wanted to have sex with (this was before we got together and it never happened and they did hang out in public at a mall). Normally that would hurt my feelings but last night I felt nothing. Nothing at all. Not anger, not sadness. Nothing. I’ve noticed that each time we have a blowout, I feel less and less. I’m afraid I’m going to become this emotionless human. I feel so emotionally detached. I used to be so in love with life. I honestly think my wife has mental issues like borderline personality or bipolar disorder. One minute my wife is happy and the next she just snaps. I feel too embarrassed to tell my family what’s going on. I feel too embarrassed to get a divorce. I feel lost.",20Jul2018,2,
57,"I have a class project due in awhile. I've gotten multiple extensions on it claiming delays and difficulty, but really it's because I can't quite seem to do it. Just thinking about sitting down and doing it makes me queasy, anxious, and gives me racing thoughts that cling to the nearest distraction.

I've lost several nights sleep, repeatedly pissed off multiple project partners, generally made an ass of myself, and somehow been completely helpless to... what exactly? It's not like I'm partying, or playing games. I just spent the entire night listening to music and pacing around, and only after 24 hours of wakefulness is the anxiety starting to decrease enough I can kind of sit down to work on it. It's like I'm locking up and can't complete the assignment, but can't do anything until it's done either. It's been over a full week now, I'm getting 3-4 hours of sleep per night, I haven't hung out with friends or even had a drink, I'm beyond bored and have everything to gain from just doing the assignment. I'm literally suffering because I can't bring myself to do the assignment, but this seems to make me avoid it harder.

59,"I've been struggling with eating disorder tendencies  (I never talked about it to a psychiatrist so I was never diagnosed) since I was about 14. Every time something stressful or heavy happened in my life, I would automatically binge and purge. My family never understood why because my weight is notmal, but it wasn't because of wanting to lose weight. I just felt like it was something that made me feel a lot better. It was mine and for some reason that was important. I never went to a psychiatrist because my family is a traditional Mexican family who said only crazy people go to therapy and take pills. Around the time I started bingeing and purging my self image changed and just got more and more scary. It's at the point where every single time I look in the mirror I see a 600lb woman with a unibrow and a chin, cheek and jaw deformity. I hate looking in the mirror and sometimes cry if I feel like I've eaten too much. My husband who's the same way as my family thinks all I need is some positive thinking and it will all go away. He says I'm just stressed out and it will stop when I learn to relax. I don't think that's the case though. I've taken so many measures to reduce my stress and my face is still disfigured. I've taken up journaling, baking, playing guitar, yoga, meditation, knitting, and dancing but every time I finally feel calm I'll look in the mirror and my face will still be horribly  disfigured and I'll not want to leave the bathroom so nobody will see me. I'm applying for better insurance and told my husband I need to see a psychiatrist because it just hurts too much. He said he doesn't believe in that stuff and I just need to relax. I'm not sure what the next step should be. I feel like maybe he's right and all of this is something I can deal with by myself, but every time I see my face I feel so horrible and want to be alone. I measure my body frequently and work out to reassure myself that I'm not obese but even when I look at the numbers I write down, it seems like a lie. Like I'm betraying myself.

61,"Like a lot of students, a couple of years ago, I found myself in a bit of a rut. I seldom lived for the present moment. I was forever looking forward to the weekend, wishing my mundane work-week away for the moment I could lose myself in the hedonism and excitement of the weekend. In the process, I was destroying my body, my dignity and my bank account on a weekly basis. I felt as though the lifestyle was a part of my identity, and so it was difficult for me to shake loose. When I look back, it seems crazy that I was so nonchalant to my unhealthy and destructive lifestyle. Although it took me a good while to get to where I feel I am today, I can confidently say that it was the small steps like reading self-help books which paved the way to the significant changes I see in my life every day. In my quest to change my destructive habits, I turned to books which can help anyone who feels unsatisfied with their life or their decisions. The books I am to mention can enrich your life by helping you to feel more calm, peaceful, focused and happy in a world of noise and distractions. I’m not suggesting that there is an algorithm for happiness, which can be boxed up neatly and put into a book, as it’s not that simple. What I am saying is that each of these books, in their own individual right, can help you learn about how to control any demons you have in your mind and encourage you to make any much-needed changes to make your life happier and more fulfilling.

64,"Background: self-diagnosed depressed 18 year old, possible a bit on the autism/asperger side of things.

I can't handle when the few friends I have do something with someone else or go to a party without me.

When Friend X talks with her friend at a table in school, it instantly makes me hate her friend's guts and I sit there just grinding my teeth waiting for it to pass. After that, I can't really recover for a certain amount of time, so I'll hold a grudge, not talking to them, which makes them talk to others and repeat the circle.

Also, I want everyone that I socialize with to conform to the way I ""think"" living works, which is sitting alone in my room when I'm not at school, feeling miserable and don't speak unless spoken to. If they even have 1 hobby or passion and casually mention that to me, I'll feel inadequate and avoid contact although I still like them.

My default stance on all new social things and circumstances is EXTREMELY negative, the reason for that is that I never really felt as a part of the groups which did normal things growing up... I didn't have a clothing style, meaningful personality or any interests and motivation as long as I can remember.

Does anyone have advice how to get out of this mental dead-end, and start socializing like a functioning human being?

I'm 27 now and I notice when I sleep, I do go into deep rem sleep.. Very vivid dreams.. I wake up.. Groggy for only a bit.. Go to work.. Then I'm good. 

I noticed on days I work late.. I oversleep.  Assuming I'd feel refreshed, it's quite the opposite..

Can over sleeping do that? Everyone loves to fall back asleep when they wake up 4 hours early... I can't help it either. Even if I sleep earlier.. I wake up.

I also workout 5 times a day for an hour or two. And I'd be so tired. When I sleep, I still wake up very early. It makes me feel like I didn't have enough and I feel kind of grumpy.

I ended up loading up on NyQuil, sinus meds for the migraine, and more pain relievers and I was finally able to sleep. 

Today I feel numb to everything. I'm not fully depressed but I'm also not happy or even satisfied with life. 

There are days where I want to end it all and think while I'm driving by myself about all of the different ways I could do it (driving off a bridge, driving into an 18 wheeler, taking all of my medications at once, etc.).

67,"Okay, I'm just here to vent. But maybe someone can add some insight even tho I firmly believe no one in this universe can ever help me anyway.

I'm 24 and I've spent my entire life living in anxiety, fear, confusion and self hatred. And honestly I have no reason to. 

I can consider myself intelligent, I'm usually very resourceful and a good problem solver when it comes to logical/technical things. I've even been considered attractive (which I refuse to believe).

But mentally and socially speaking, I'm a fucking train wreck. I can't remember a time where I ever felt ""normal"".

I've always had trouble with making friends. And due to moving with my family from Eastern Europe to a properly civilised country (Australia) at the age of 6 - made everything a lot worse. 

Not knowing how to speak English initially, and being in this foreign ass world with no one to be comfortable with - I simply grew into just being that weird foreign kid that no one likes. The only people I ended up associating with were other weird autistic kids like myself.. 

Obviously I didn't understand any of this or how it would affect me at the time, so I guess I didn't even realise anything was wrong because I simply didn't know any better.

To dig myself into a deeper hole, I ended up going to an all boys high school. I always thought ""eventually"" girls would just fall into my lap and that's must be how sex and relationships work. 

I did hear about guys at the time, started dating girls and losing their virginities and so on, which absolutely baffled me. I didn't understand how they even met girls in the first place, let alone date them and fuck them. Girls were still some distant fantasy in my shit defective brain.

Eventually my hormones started kicking in and I wanted to do the same. To meet girls, to date them, have a girlfriend and have sex. Very quickly found out it was fucking impossible.. Couldn't even think about talking to a girl without crippling fear and anxiety met alone doing it. 

I did end up in a co-ed school because my all boys school was part of a campus who all join up for year 11&amp;12. I actually met this one weird girl who was in some of my classes who I committed to do everything in power to hook up with her and lose my virginity. 

And as sad and pathetic as this is, I really didn't like her much at all. I just wanted to fuck and she was the only one weird and low status enough to not ignore me.. Anyways it took something like 7 months of manipulation and essentially begging her for sex until it happened. 

It was amazing to finally do what they do in porn. And the novelty wore off quickly to reflect back how absolutely pathetic I am and what I just went they to have some shitty sex as a teenager.. 

Anyway high school ended and so did my hopes of getting girls because my source of 1 weird girl per school life had expired. 

I did go to uni but it was so much worse. So much more strangers and all my anxiety and fear amplified. There was no way I could survive in this. 

I eventually quit uni despite getting some pretty solid results, far beyond that ""yay I passed!!"" bullshit. Because I honestly really hated it and hated being so alone despite being surrounded by thousands of people every day. 

Eventually I reached a boiling point where I decided I need to make some huge change and get this social shit downpat. 

Pathetically enough I got hooked into that weird pickup artist shit. Trying to learn how to approach girls and lead interactions to sex. It really appealed to my autism that there actually might be a methodical way to learn and perform this whole social dance to meet my sexual needs. 

And I even met up with other weird autistic cunts who did this sort of shit, so I ended up going out to approach girls literally 7 nights a week to ""practice my game"". 

6 months in I finally got laid after approaching literally 5000 girls or something ridiculous. I was too blind to see how pathetic that was and was conviced that if I continued if eventually become comfortable and good with girls, and even become a social savvy person. Plus I got into all that self help rubbish circle jerk bullshit thinking my negative thoughts would be cured by telling myself I love myself. Cringe. 

Anyways.. the trap was that I actually was able to get laid consistently. But it was a LOT of work. Going out day in day out desperately trying to find a girl whose willing to fuck me. And eventually I would of course and wonder why I was empty and still hated myself. 

After years of doing this, and having fucked something like 100 girls it all came crashing down. I began to realise that I haven't changed one bit. I still had no self esteem, I still had heavy anxiety and pain when it came to socialising and trying to get girls.

All I really had was a process of brute force I was conviced was somehow improving me and getting me results with girls. It was fucked and I wish I never did any of it. 

Anyways, after I couldn't lie to myself I started to uncover how truly mentally fucked I am. And to top it off, I couldn't even get laid anymore because my fake front crumbled altogether. 

Like, I actually spent a number of years literally mass approaching girls until I came across an equally desperate girl who was usually unattractive anyway. All to realise nothing's changed. Other than developing extra autism. 

Then all the anger and hatred started building. I hate myself, I hate women and I hate anyone who has social success - even more so when they don't have to climb mountains to have a girl or two like them.

And now I sit at home I'm my only comfort zone, being constant triggered at anything resembles anyone having success that I can't. 

And before anyone tells me to accept myself, or change my mindset or whatever circlejerk self help terminology you come up with - please don't.

I'm sure that advice is valid, but I simply cannot comprehend any of it. Like how does once actually ""accept themselves"", do you just say it and its done? Cos it definitely isn't. No matter how much mental gymnastics I try to do, there no way I can look at it and simply forget everything and be like yep, everything fine and I accept it now.

The best way to describe how I feel about all this is with an analogy. It's as if;

I'm a paraplegic and have no legs. I wanna be an athlete and win Olympic medals. But no matter how hard I try, it's not happening. Then people tell me accept it and change my mindset as if gonna grow legs back but I refuse to accept it. 

Basically, I'm broken as fuk.. And I can't even begin to imagine where to even begin to fix this bullshit. 

I don't know..

69,"Im not sure if this is the right place for this. My fiance has a mental illness. I grew up with a bipolar mom so i know what that looks like and what im getting myself into. Hes amazing most of the time. Sorry about the length, i just wanted to give background to fully understand the situation.

I have 4 kids from a previous relationship. Their dad is trash. He was extremely abusive. It took me a long time to get out and it messed me up really bad. So i have some issues with being yelled and kind of panic when it happens. My current fiance has really stepped up and treats my kids well. They all love him. Hes been around since my youngest out of the 4 i had was 8 months old. We also have a baby together on top of my 4.

Hes been diagnosed with manic depression.  He has huge episodes where he blows up. He was an inpatient at a mental health facility a few years ago. They gave him medication and set him up with counseling. He stopped taking the medication a few months after he started. He screams at me and says really terrible things. Yesterday was my birthday. I told him he didnt have to get me anything, just not to treat me bad. Literally all he had to do was be nice to me. I explained that my ex used to go out of his way to ruin my birthday every year. He said he would never do that. He did. I spent the night bawling ans getting screamed at. My kids stayed with his mom so they werent around it. 

The problem is he has these huge blow ups, and says things that are very damaging. I can't talk to him when he is like that but he doesnt let me stay quiet. He pushes and tries to bring me into it. I hate fighting. I dont do well with it. He yells at me and follows me around. I dont do well with being screamed at, especially if i cant get out of a situation.  Like if he backs me into a corner and i cant get away. My ex almost killed me a few times and i panic. I know its his mental illness but i dont know what im supposed to do when he refuses help. I feel so bad for him because i know it must feel terrible the way he feels when hes in his mood. He apoligizes after but it never changes and sorry really means nothing when it keeps happening. I know he needs help and there are moments he admits it but wont follow through. What i want to know is if there is anything i can do to help him finally get the help he needs. I try and be as supportive as i can but when someone is constantly shitting on you its hard. I am willing to support him emotionally and mentally through this. When we fight i dont say anything mean because i know its damaging. I dont want to make him feel bad and i dont want to do what he does because i know once those things are out there no amount of apologies makes them go away. I want to help him but i dont know how. 

I know he can only get help if he wants to. I know i cant force anything on him. I just dont know what i can do to try and help him get the help he needs. I dont want to have to split up over this but i cant keep getting torn down like this. I love him, but i dont know if im hurting the situation by forgiving him because that feels like im enabling his behaviour. I understand that he has an illness but i dont believe that its an excuse to treat people poorly. It also bothers me that he knows this is such a problem and just refuses to get help. I feel like if he was really sorry he would actively take steps to try and address the problem.

Tldr; fiance refuses help or treatment for his mental illness. Im trying to see what i can do to try and help him get the help he needs without making him feel like im forcing him. I would also like to know how to deal with it when he is in the manic state to try and pacify the situation. Would it be wrong to give him an ultimatum about getting the help he needs. I dont want it to come to that but i also dont know what else to do.

I’ve always been the one to look after people and just push down any emotion or turmoil and put others problems feelings and mental health above mine. It was doing me well. I even got through a serious illness and maintained that stance of putting people before me. I started to resent people who tried to put me and my feelings first. My treatment usually has a huge amount of side effects, I was lucky and avoided most of the common ones, but was hit hard after treatment by all the less common, potentially more serious ones.

75,"Hello /r/mentalhealth,

I am currently not sure if I am in the right place, i browsed a bit through this subreddit and most posts I saw were about suicide, and if you are reading this currently dealing with suicidal thoughts then all I can say is; 

“keep fighting, life will get better, you will start to feel better, work on yourself, get someone you love and start to eventually live you life”

Anyway I am here for a somewhat different reason.
I hate myself, not to the point of depression or anything I guess but I have problems, my thoughts work weird and sometimes feels like I do not have control...

I have been fighting negative thoughts and agression problems for the past 1,5 year.
I have partially beaten my agression problems, i can still get mad at the world when everything on my day goes wrong but i guess thats not the weirdest thing ever...

my problem with negative thoughts are different though, they still seem to slip through frequently;

before writing this message something happened that made me think I need help to get through the last bit. 
this is what happened.

my girlfriend was eating with her father and always after eating she writes me, asks me how work was but she came online read my message left again, i felt bad ignored and tried to tell myself; all is fine probably a good reason, nothing bad has happened before this, everything has been amazing for a long time so probably a good reason. Then I started to ask myself what would this reason be and I started to go almost crazy over this; i couldnt figure it out.
So i ended up writing her asking why.
then I saw her online on Steam and I wrote her there saying kinda sarcasticly like yeah hope dinner was fine enjoy your games bye.

And idk why I would ever write something this dumb, I make her feel bad, I make myself feel bad, I ruin things for myself.

I do know about myself that I overthink EVERYTHING and I worry about completely useless things.

I worry about getting fired at work because I am bad and 2 weeks later I get a raise
I worry about my girlfriend not loving me anymore soo damn often and it completely brings me down. I learned that when Inwould ignore these thought for long enough that eventually I would see the exact oposite. but I cant stop overthinking and worrying about everything and it ruins my life...

I hope some of you read through this extremely long garbage and are able to give me some tips or methods I can use or maybe chat with me to help me stop this almost paranoia nonsence.

Thanks for reading,
toosafe.

i spent half my fucking life listening to my sister go on about how i have an eating disorder and u kno what i might actually have one but i don't want to tell anyone because i want to lose WEIGHT and telling someone would require me wanting to stop but !!! i don't !!! not yet i don't want to yet i'm not even that bad right now i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine. and then my sister spends the other half of her time telling me i have ocd or some other shit like that because i'm constantly cleaning. like all the time. like sometimes i cant sit down and just relax because i'm cleaning everything i cleanly the entire house. i don't think i have ocd or anything related to that. but she's scaring me so badly i'm still a child i've been depressed since i was 11 i don't want to live like this i don't want to be so messed up i just want to be normal i want to be normal i just want to sleep and never wake up i can't do this",20Jul2018,2,
77,"My previous doctor took mental health quite seriously and knew a lot about it, but my current doctor just doles out gems like ""turn off the lights early for insomnia"" and literally said in my visit yesterday""why are you so nervous, stop being anxious"" like it was something that I can just turn on and off like a switch. I feel that minimizing these kinds of issues is really dangerous, telling someone who has diagnosed major depressive disorder and PTSD that they just need to get outside and get more sun etc. and says ""stop taking all that garbage"" in reference to my medications... has anyone else dealt with doctors like this? I feel I should state this new doctor is Indian, for some reason Indian doctors in my experience brush off  a lot of things as minor, especially mental health issues.",20Jul2018,6,
78,"Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/6bLIJVm](https://imgur.com/a/6bLIJVm)

Book website: [http://breakingintomylife.com/](http://breakingintomylife.com/)

I grew up with a mother who could be unhinged, morose, manic, (occasionally) loving and often deeply depressed and mean.

My mother had bipolar disorder. She would be admitted to a psychiatric hospital every so often, but our family was never able to effectively treat her.

Unfortunately the result was a childhood where the caretaker role was reversed: I was forced to take care of my mother.

I suffered many lonely and sad days and nights in which my mom kept me in the house and away from friends, berated me for minor or non-existent mistakes and occasionally hit me.

I decided to write a book about my experiences with my mother called *Breaking Into My Life: Growing Up With a Bipolar Parent my Battle to Reclaim Myself.*

If you've suffered from an abusive parent or struggled to care for a loved one with mental illness, I hope my story provides some inspiration.

**Please ask me anything you want about my childhood, my mother, bipolar, mental health, the process of writing a book or anything else that comes to your mind.**",20Jul2018,5,
79,"Hey I'm new to this, and I'm not sure if this is a good place to post this, but I figured it would be, if not I'm sorry.

I have suffered from depression and anxiety for about 7 or 8 years of my 24 years in life.

I wrote poetry and listened to sad music to cope.

I recently decided that I want to actually make music to try to express how people with mental health feel, because in my experience, some people who don't have it, stigmatize those that do.

I've been called lazy, an attention whore, all kinds of names.

So below I want to attach a few rough drafts of songs I'm working on to get opinions and feedback.

[https://soundcloud.com/user-292613731/slit-both-my-wrists-vincent-van-goth-prod-kube](https://soundcloud.com/user-292613731/slit-both-my-wrists-vincent-van-goth-prod-kube)

[https://soundcloud.com/user-292613731/nihilism](https://soundcloud.com/user-292613731/nihilism)

So some songs will just be like how I feel, I'm going to work on some that are more uplifting, trying to show all sides.

My goals are trying to express what it's like living with mental illness, so that people know they aren't alone, and that others who don't have, can get a better understanding.

Sorry for the long post, it's just something I'm very passionate about

80,"Happened yesterday, I work overnights as a CNC Operator. first time doing so since I started working at this company back in March. Called in sick with some BS excuse because I just needed a day off, I couldn't get out of bed and when I finally did I was constantly on edge, far more than usual, just paranoid about everything dreading the worst with every action yet at the same time just lethargic and had no desire to do anything. Slept all night and all of this morning on and off and once I finally did get up today I feel more or less like I usually do which isn't great but is far better than I did yesterday. Its a habit I have recognized that I do every 3-4 months where I call into work and just sleep the day away doing nothing. Guess I am just wondering if anyone else ever calls in randomly for a day off to yourself.",20Jul2018,1,
81,"after falling massively behind in school because of my mental health. I suddenly had a spur of energy to do my work and try and get into uni. Admittedly this was brought on by my dad being a dick to me and me realising I need to get out of the house. I stayed awake for nearly 3 days straight working. But I got in. I got the grades, I will be going to one of the best universities in my country and I am so happy and proud!!! I don’t really have anyone to share this with, so posting it here. 
If anyone else is like me and thinks there’s no light at the end of the tunnel, there is, it just takes a while to be able to see it :) 
If anyone needs to talk to me about anything at all, I’m open, please message me if you want to vent:)

82,"Yeah it may sound weird but when I move awkwardly/ stretch I get a weird feeling. This ""weird feeling"" is get can be summarized with how I can't feel, I lose sight and touch. I don't understand what is happening, I can't comprehend reality and it feels like i'm behind a blurry distorted screen without a body. it's hard to explain but this video is basically what I feel [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j\_rEBKxW3qE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_rEBKxW3qE) but I have some added symptoms like what I described earlier in this paragraph. I'ts also been getting worse and I get into how it gets worse later.  


Yes I know what depersonalization is and it's effects and stuff but what I want to know is why this happens when I make certain movements and how I think this is linked to when I hit my head really bad. I just want an explination and to know if this is serious enough that I should get further help from a doctor.  


By I can't feel I mean that I kinda go numb, it's hard to explain but to my best of efforts to describe it, it's like I can't tell where my body is in relativity to my limbs and my skin feels like it's really fuzzy and is gone. By I don't understand what's happening, when i'm in the weird state I kinda stop thinking, like I just blankly stare and can't control my body but I kind of know that I've lost senses. And my vision gets really weird, it spans from going completely blind to everything looking psychedelic and weird kind of like when you put sharp filter on an image and put it to the max.  


I'm only posting about it now because I actually thought this was normal but today I had one of my worst feelings because for like 10 seconds I just basically lost consciousnesses and I told my friend don't think think it's weird how sometime when you stretch everything goes weird and they told me that never happens and I was like... oh. They also told me that these are the same effects of depersonalization and when I watched some video on it, the effects of it are basically exactly what I get.  


Over the years it has gradually been getting worse, like at first like once a week I would stretch and just for a couple of seconds I go cross eyed or something until now where for like 10-30 seconds I lose all my senses and detach from reality. This all started from when I went skate boarding and I hit my head on the concrete and when I went back to my friend house, they said I passed out for a big but I vividly remember my vision blanking, losing my hearing and my sense of touch for like a minute.  


Because it's been steadily getting worse I though I should get it checked out so... here I am, asking people on the internet what the is wrong with me. Thanks for reading through this and if you know any reason or any information on this happening then please tell me !",20Jul2018,1,
83,"Hi, I discovered it's possible to get free psychotherapy sessions through various Unis that offer this service.

The one I self referred to was https://www.salford.ac.uk/health-and-society/facilities-and-services/counselling-suites/university-of-salford-counselling-and-psychotherapy-centre - so check your local Universities. After an initial phone consultation, they can offer up to 20 sessions with a qualified therapist (a previous student at the Uni).

Just thought I'd share, as I stopped private therapy a couple of months ago due to financial issues so I hope someone else can find this helpful too.",20Jul2018,1,
84,"I’m getting kind of scared for my partner. He’s under a lot of stress, doesn’t cope very well, and refuses to seek help or decline when people ask too much of him. I would say that he’s had two complete breakdowns in the last month. 

He has vaguely mentioned suicide, but as far as I’m aware, not “seriously” (eg with a plan and a timeline). The mentions are more frequent though. Four times this week alone. 

Men are 3-4x more likely to die of suicide than women. It’s in the top 10 for causes of death for men in the United States. 

What can I do to help him? I try to keep things low key so that our home can be a haven from some of the things that seem to trigger him. I also try hard not to criticize him for talking/venting, about suicide or otherwise, because I don’t want him to bottle it up and try to hide it from me. Thankfully we’re not “gun people” — apparently that’s the leading method of suicide for men. 

He does actively work on self care. He puts a lot of effort into keeping a positive relationship with his parents, we participate in a sport with friends at least once a week, we eat fairly healthy, and he will work out at home one or twice if he can’t make it to practice more often. Since things are particularly bad right now, he’s also withdrawn a little into his one hobby, which I occasionally can participate in. And he self medicates with weed (it’s legal here), which I honestly think may have saved his life, since it interrupts the circular self talk before it drags him down too much. He said a few months ago that his withdrawal and stress level is temporary (his work does have cycles, which we’ve weathered before) but I worry that he won’t remember that in the moment, when everything else crashes down on him at the same time. 

What else can I do? Do I just need to try not to freak out too much? What warning signs should I look for and what should I do if they start to happen? 

Am I overreacting?

And yes, I am going to seek support for myself, probably a family counselor of some kind. I keep finding myself trying to steel myself for a future where I’ve lost him, because it ... just seems less unlikely these days. Plus, he obviously has no emotional support to give me, certainly not in response to something that he would decide to feel responsible for. My own mental health routine involves the activities above plus mindfulness meditation and occasionally a short hike in the woods. ",20Jul2018,1,

87,"First time poster here, but I read sometimes and also have been posting for a while to /r/raisedbynarcissists as... well more on this soon.

So I have been in pretty bad depression nearly half of my 34 year life. Am a disabled little person (and by little I mean only around 3'6"") who has had a life of crap, tantrums, manipulation, belittling, lying, stealing, mental abuse, near total isolation at the hands of my psycho mother and completely useless father. Adding to this my own disabilities and lack of movement, power and strength and you soon see how I attempted suicide in late 2014 and as you can see failed spectacularly. Thing is I knew this would never end and the only way it would was in my eyes, if I died, she died, or I moved out. The latter two didn't really scan as I'd never had an aide or lived on my own so it was super duper unrealistic to me.

Flash forward to 2018 and somehow I find a subsidized apt with accommodations for wheelchairs (wide automatic entryway, space for feet under counters, HUGE bathroom (speaking of which my parents' house had ZERO accessibility and my bathroom was so tiny you had to turn sideways to enter) and so on). Got a couple things (I just winged it but rightly so) as far as additional accessibility goes and they installed them for me (grab bars, touch faucet) but having no access to services I paid out of pocket for everything and I'm sure didn't know the best way or items I should be getting. I literally just winged it with a measuring tape.

Special thanks to my visiting aide, a good woman, who seems to have very similar outlook on many items in life (people, TV shows, cleanliness, cursing, foodstuffs and so on)...

And recently I also decided to take a chance and see a therapist locally because I get panic attacks and pretty bad anxiety when I have to do something, or go somewhere, or call someone, and I was frankly hoping for some meds, but also to talk to someone, see if that helps. My brain fog isn't helping at all from the 30+ years of inflammation in my joints.

I started talking to her. A nice enough woman, who said she started trembling when I started laying out (I can over share sometimes) the horrid conditions I lived in before... but I am not really having fun talking to her. I saw their psychiatrist and got some blood pressure pills as it turns out for extreme panic attacks, but I am not wanting to take them.

Now obviously I signed a lot of paperwork before we talked about not being suicidal and so on... but look I knew to lie about being off the wall depressed because what can I do? I don't need her to make my life 100x worse with a mandatory psych consult.

I will say this though. I talked to a therapist before where I lived for a while after my suicide attempt and I liked her. She seemed to understand how toxic and narcissistic some people are. This one talks about us being spirits and so on and I just facepalmed mentally because I don't go for that.

The visits just didn't blow wind up my skirt.

What should I do? Try to find a different therapist? Continue going there?",20Jul2018,1,
88,"A lot of times someone may be telling me something that usually triggers or ignores emotional reactions from people. Like for example, someone passing away, a friend falling in love, a new baby being born in the family, birthdays, weddings, parties, graduations. All sorts of things that make people happy or upset or excited. But for me, I just stand there motionless and blank faced. I feel nothing. I feel as though things like birthdays and graduations are incredibly overrated and people put too much money and details into them and I just cant see why. My sister thinks I’m crazy for not reacting like “normal people” and thinks I’m a stone cold monster. 

HOWEVER I also get emotionally triggered incredibly quickly. Like when someone points out something I screwed up I feel ashamed and embarrassed and run away. I sob during emotional scenes in movies. I cry every night over my ex boyfriend. I laugh at the stupidest jokes. I get angry incredibly quickly especially if someone jokes around with me in an aggressive manner like if my siblings were to tease me over something I said or did I’d get incredibly angry and give them the cold shoulder. 

I don’t know I just really don’t get myself. Am I over emotional or not emotional enough...",20Jul2018,1,
89,"To clarify, its not that I've been experiencing a lot of sleep paralysis. I've experienced maybe 5 times in the past year but never before then. I've been having nightmares about having sleep paralysis itself. That's shits terrifying and I hate it very much. I haven't had any in like a month at least, its just been nightmares about it happening again.

90,"I lost the one stabilizing factor in my life today, and now I see no reason for anything.
I know that everyone won't understand, and I'm not gaurnteed to be going through with anything, but I don't see the point anymore.
All I've ever done in life is love and not be loved, and it's left a void in my heart that I just can't deal with anymore. I've been able to act fine for others for years now, but I can't even see the point in that. I've built an image for myself that I'm the strong one, unable to be brought down, always in a good mood, and everyone I know only sees that as who I am.
It's not, and now I have no one I can turn to who can truly understand. The one person I even felt remotely safe turning to is gone, so now I have no one, I never said what I should have said and now it's too late. I want to scream but I can't, I keep crying but I'm not feeling anything from it, I want to just say something to them, but I'm too scared and don't know what to say.

91,"It could be just hypochondria. But ever since I had an collapsed lung&amp; had to call the ambulance myself, had an intervention done &amp; 4 weeks later it happened AGAIN.. I started to become obsessed with dangers to my health. I'd stop wearing contact lenses. I'd be afraid when driving next to a recently burned down building, I'd be afraid of pain in my testicle, etc. I had ""panic attacks"" where I spaced out for two minutes and felt like passing away immediately.

I've had an instance I was afraid someone was going to bomb the college building (just a weird looking dude that entered, the lecturer was someone who catched a bomber).

I dunno. It seems like hypochondria. The only times I've hallucinated was upon waking up. 

Really I wasn't afraid of things like this, before my health problem started. It all feels like it's fading away, but anything can set it off. Recently I went for an STD test, the doctor seemed off/weird and I was afraid he was drawing blood on me with an HIV infected needle on purpose.

I feel like I'm addicted to being sad. I cannot stop feeling this way. It's really frustrating. I see other people happy and full of energy and I get so mad that I can't be like that. It just doesnt work. Like a switch is stuck in down mode. I feel like I'm always on edge and like one day somethings going to set me off. I only listen to sad music (not trying to be edgy). Happy music just pisses me off. I have no hope with women. All I want to do is be quiet and do nothing. I still enjoy things like bowling, fitness, and going into town, but my problem keeps me from having people to go with. Nobody wants to hang out with a boring person. I constantly zone out and people always ask me what's wrong. Nothings ever wrong when they ask, I just can't help how my face looks. I do find that the only way I can be social and enjoy time with people is when I drink. A lot of times if I'm meeting with people I take a few shots just to loosen up. I know how unhealthy and dangerous this is. My family has a bad history of alcoholism. I wish I could just be loose and happy without it but I find myself drinking just to do basic things like go grocery shopping. I dunno it's hard to explain and my thoughts are all over the place.
