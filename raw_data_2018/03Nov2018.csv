0,Ordered something to my old address what should I do I'm having anxiety attack ,03Nov2018,1
1,"Hello , i work online from home and i was wondering if what I'm experiencing is anxiety .

The symptoms are me being depressed and super worried scared of the unknown when it comes to work and I'm in constant fear of failing to the point where everything became super HARD no matter how easy and simple the tasks are.

2,"A counselor once told me that ""everyone is mentally ill in some way"".  I know that cognitive distortions are commonplace in society, especially today.  Many people have a sense of unfairness in their lives and feel that they need to do something to even the odds of success.  I'm all for equality, but I am more for simply dealing with what hand I have been dealt today.  I will work on bettering the world starting today, but I will not despair over how bad it is, especially when my mood takes a dive and I need to find reasons to go on living.  I will not die because of broken rules and a false sense of justice, as I am a son of Adam as well and I know my sins that are before me.  The following is a post in my blog about fairness and how things work out in spite of how unfair life may seem.

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm a 21 year old female INTP to start off) I've struggled with depression &amp; anxiety my entire life but lately it's taking over and I'm not sure what to do.

I've never been good at making friends or talking for that matter but it's gotten to the point where even the thought of hanging out with people stresses me out to no end. I live with my boyfriend and he likes to hang out with his friends, go to parties, etc etc and every time I go with I get anxious to the point of shaking and then I get mad and stress even more because I dont WANT to not be able to socialize or make friends and then I fall into a pit of despair and pretty much have to remove myself from every social situation(and cry). Also when this happens I'm irrationally irritable always fighting with my boyfriend and being mean because I'm just so angry at how incapable I am to be normal. I'm constantly up and down like I have had multiple breakdowns this week where I just feel like there's no way out because I hate myself so much everything I do feels wrong and no one ever likes me because I'm so quiet and anxious and then I get mad at my bf because I'm just so emotional. I can't explain to the extent I'd like to but you just need to know- it's really bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried going to a therapist and I found having someone to talk to didn't do anything for me because tbh I feel like I understand my emotions really well I KNOW I have a problem and every therapist just tells me to ""breathe"" or to try not to react the way I do but I really feel as though I have some kind of disorder where I can't not react negatively it's this kind of tick in my brain that once I get kind of anxious over anything I'm sucked into a never ending pit.

I don't look forward to things anymore and I'm scared for my future. I've tried taking meds and honestly I still didn't feel like I could act normal. Sorry if I'm just shouting into the void I just don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is obviously more to me and my mental health but this is what I could come up with to share thank u :/",03Nov2018,1
4,"My doctor prescribed me Pristiq and wants me to try it before I go to inpatient. (I am looking for another doctor since it took 4 days to even get her to prescribe anything to help me.) 

I took my first dose today and it’s given me a huge headache and my jaw is tight. I googled and it seems normal. Anyone else try it and can give me an honest opinion of it? How it worked for you? I know everyone is different but I’m hoping I get some relief. I’m trying not to go to 7-9 day inpatient after my son’s birthday party coming up.",03Nov2018,1

6,"I was molested by my brother for six years. I think I'm over it for the most part, but occasionally, my husband will lose me during sex. I'm also currently pregnant, and getting depressed with some suicidal thinking. 

Tonight, I did something I've never done before. We were having sex, and the last minute of it or so, I wasn't there at all. Plain as day, I was 12 years old and in my brother's room again. My husband did not exist. When I was being abused, I'd do what I was told, and I wouldn't move without being told it was okay, so I'd ask, ""Are you done with me?"" after his orgasm. So tonight, I said that, but I swear I thought I was saying it to my brother. And once it was out of my mouth, I realized where I really was and what was happening. I separated myself from my husband and threw on my robe while I tried to get a grip. 

He said he realized at the very end something was wrong, but he didn't know how long I'd been like that. I think it was less than a minute. When I looked up disassociation, it didn't sound like what happened. When you dissociate, you leave a bad experience, your mind doesn't run to it. So what happened to me? I'm afraid the depression might be turning into something worse because of the pregnancy, and I could have had a full blown hallucination. ",03Nov2018,1
7,I saw on Instagram that someone dressed up as a doctor and her bf dressed up as a patient. The location was tagged @ psych ward nd the caption was “he’s not getting cured any time soon” anyone else think it’s a bit insensitive? ,03Nov2018,1
8,I have a guy that I like and he likes me back. He does all of these fun things and        Has all of these friends and is so popular and all I do is go home and do homework and watch tv because I have no extracurricular things to do and I feel like if I dated him I’d be dragging him down,03Nov2018,1
9,"So yea. I've had this friend for a couple years and they get REALLY depressed, theyve been suicidal in the past and probably still are. 

When they were in high school, they were legally required to go to therapy, but because of a legal trial and a subpoena, they couldn't disclose a lot of their real DEEEEEP psychological issues to the therapist for fear of some negative consequences.

So basically, they have had REALLY bad experience with therapy in the past. However, they are aware that they have PTSD, they have major depression, they have seasonal depression, and they have non-clinical social anxiety.

Nonetheless, they have absolutely given up trying. Like 100%, they have no plans to do any kind of treatment. In their words, they are ""content to live their miserable life in silence"" which is an absolutely horrendous life view to have. I am not convinced that they dont have an active suicide plan.

i have even talked through their intentions with them a bit, and they are also 100% aware of the fact that going to therapy would improve their life, but they still dont want to go. They put themself down saying ""I'm just such a lazy loser of a person that i wont even go to therapy"" and  i never know what to say. I dont think theyre lazy, im sure it's just another symptom, but I have no idea whwat to do!

Does anyone else have experience with this kind of thing? How do you handle people that just refuse treatment? It's not because they think it wont work, it's not because they dont know they have a problem, it's not because they are ashamed of it, it's not because they dont want to feel vulnerable, they are not scared of being dependent on meds, and even when i asked ""if money wasn't a problem,"" they still said they wouldnt do it. 

How do you even respond to that??",03Nov2018,1
10,"As some one with metal health i will always advised people to stay of social media (i have made this mistake myself previously and only retain Facebook to delete my history ). Your mental health will become people's entertainment (i laugh often). Never seek approval or recognition for the way you feel, keep it to yourself or privately to your friends (this is where your support should be, tho for me family is not an option). Personally become more accepting of the loneliness, it has helped me gain inner strength. Social media in my experiences only made things worse...

11,"I just had to cold turkey Zyprexa because I ran out and they took me off it as well becaus eof weight gain. The withdrawals have been hell. I've been incredibly paranoid that I'm going insane and that there's something very messed up about me. (Nothing specific) I can't shake this thought, no matter how many times I tell myself I've done nothing wrong. Could I be going crazy or has anyone else experienced this?",03Nov2018,1
12,"I have an 83 year old grandmother. She'll be 84 at the end of December, but somehow she ""lost"" a year and insists that she's 82 and will be 83. If you attempt to count up the math with her, she does it incorrectly and willfully won't listen to simple math.

For most of her life, she seems to have exhibited signs of mental illness of some type. As a child, she described playing hide-and-seek with other kids and said that one time she was counting and ""it was like she was counting over her head"" looking down at herself or something dumb. Since I was a kid, she has been paranoid schizophrenic, I think. Decades ago, she was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic with high anxiety. Oh boy is it high, like ringing her fingers high and about to shake to pieces/drop stuff on the floor high. After the passing of my father when I was a kid, she moved in with us to take care of her (she was homeless and living in her car in a plaza parking lot). She was homeless because she quit or got fired from her jobs earlier on in life and never saved for any retirement. She made poor decisions for her whole life and never owned her own home. When her 3 kids were young, she has mentioned that she ""couldn't afford to pay rent"" in apartments and would move them from place to place and school to school because she was always behind on the rent. She would get a car from a car lot and take it back every time it needed repairs/common maintenance and get another car until something else was wrong, then repeat.

She hear a man's voice and is convinced that it is a man from 2 houses down that she supposedly called the police on a couple of decades ago. According to her, he has speakers/microphones set up all over the neighborhood and plays loud music, loud sounds, says sexual things and all sorts of things. There are times when she has thought he was ""under the floor"" in our (locked with a very secure door) crawlspace and will stop her foot or kick her heel on the floor while sitting on the couch. Other times, she thought the ""ground was jumping up and down."" For her entire life, she seems to have been unable to wash dishes properly. Oddly enough, in some of her younger years (50's and 60's), she had some jobs as a nurses aide/sitter watching old people in their homes. There were complaints that the dishes had food on them. She does the same thing at home to this day, will drink out of dirty cups, etc. 

I can't think of much that she does that is ""normal"" for someone to do. As of the past year or two, she suddenly started running and looking out of the window literally every 1-2 minutes all throughout the day, night and morning. When her daughter leaves for work early in the morning or comes home late at night, she opens the door and sits in the dark ""watching for her daughter"" like she's waiting on a child to come home from school. Her daughter is 60 years old. 

She wants to sleep with the curtains open next to her bed all night so she can stare at the neighbor's house. When he sets his car alarm and it beeps, she goes tearing over to the window to look out. Among other odd things, she likes to sit on the toilet while using the bathroom with the light off and door halfway open. No idea why. Unable to do basic things like open a package or solve basic issues in life. She'll literally bring me a package with ""open here"" printed in bold on it and say, ""I don't know how to open this.""  She will go fix some food in the kitchen, but then she'll go the couch and then get back up a minute later and act like she's about to choke and say that she needs to go get some water. It never, ever occurs to her to get something to drink beforehand.

She is extremely difficult to get along with even for family, rants at the news and picks certain people that she just hates and makes up complete lies about for no reason whatsoever. There are times when she paces the floor from one room to the other for 1-2 hours for no reason, stands up watching tv a few feet from the screen and will turn on you if you disagree with anything and claim that you ""just want to argue"". I'm wondering if it isn't dementia mixed with paranoid schizophrenia and high anxiety on top of it with alzheimer's on the side. I have never met anyone like my grandmother, have never seen anyone on any show/documentary of mental illness like her, either. The doctors, psychiatrists, etc., that she has seen...they couldn't do anything with her. She's ""there"" enough to refuse any treatment or meds and by law they're unable to help her. Quite literally, I'm not sure that she has ever done a single thing in her life the ""right"" way, be it a job, a household task, a simple purchase at the store, etc. Her entire life has just been a jumbled mess. Even her sneezes are so high-strung that she screams in them. 

Does this sound like multiple instances all at once? ",03Nov2018,1
13,"I haven’t been in contact with her for a long time. We live in different cities and I just figured we were both busy but that she was ok. I got a message from her ex a few days ago saying she was sick and to contact her. Her phone is turned off but I was able to contact her sister. She told me my friend has been hearing voices and is convinced the Russians are plotting against her. She also wasn’t feeding her six year old because she thought the food was poisoned. They interned her into a mental clinic and they’re making her sleep for 72 hours (I’m sorry I don’t know the name of that). What I’m worried about is she’ll be released on Monday and her mother is a very abusive person. Plus my friend is very -very- new age hippie and I know she’ll try to get out of taking any medication they give her. She’s in my city now, staying with her abusive mother (I can’t stress what a piece of shit she is enough). What should I do? I don’t want her to think I’m conspiring with the Russians, I just want to convince her to take whatever medicine they give her. Any advice is helpful, I know nothing about this condition.

15,"I’m 17 right now and I first started struggling with my relationship with food and bulimia around 14. 

The bulimia was pretty bad when I was 14/15 (I was severely depressed at this time and had other issues going on too) but it dwindled down for about a year.

I thought I was recovered and doing so well since I’ve been working out and eating so healthy but recently (within the past 2 weeks) I’ve been relapsing pretty bad. Every few days I’ll binge/purge multiple times a day. My mouth is sore and I feel so discouraged, all my hard work is going away.

I bought my grad dress today and I’m terrified that if I don’t stop this cycle soon, I’ll gain back all the weight I worked so hard to lose and I won’t fit in the dress anymore.

I feel like my world is falling apart and I’m losing interest in everything. I feel like I’m turning into the 14/15 yr old me who felt hopeless. I’m so uninspired and losing my determination. I barely even had to willingness to write this out.

Please help me cope. I need to stop this but I feel like I can’t and I don’t know why. It’s just food, yet it takes up my thoughts and actions and ends up determining my whole mood.

I don’t want to hit rock-bottom again.

Tl;dr I relapsed w/ bulimia and I feel like I’m not in control of myself. I need help coping and I need advice before anything bad happens.

16,"**I'm new to reddit and need to vent; therefore, I hope this is the correct thread to do so.**

&amp;#x200B;

So, lately I've been thinking about my childhood and how it may have affected my life. 

In third grade, I was put into a class for children with learning disabilities (+ mentally handicapped children) for an hour or so everyday. I never knew why I was put into that class, but I concluded that I was slow in some way or another.

From then on, I'd be tested on my learning abilities and emotional health every three years. If I was ""up to speed"" with the other kids, then I'd be able to stop attending the special class. 

I never got out of the class from the testing, but certain laws in my state changed and made me legally ineligible. This was confusing because I was slow, right? I mean, I avoided group work and dreaded sharing answers/papers with my classmates because I felt so inadequate.

&amp;#x200B;

In my junior year of high school, my academic counselor told me that my mental health issues would make college hard for me-- more specifically, my anxiety problems. With this in mind, I began asking questions and found out that I was never told what my problems were out of fear that I'd use them as a crutch.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Should this still affect me? I mean, I understand the reasoning behind it, but I've felt depressed throughout my entire childhood/teenage years (especially) because I felt like I was too stupid to get far in life. Why didn't the answer boost my confidence?** ",03Nov2018,1

I'm in the honors program for my college and I'm surrounded by all these people who are amazing and can handle taking so many credits so many time, while I can't seem to handle taking 15 credits and I had to drop a class just so I could handle college.

I basically need advice on this whole college thing because I have no one to ask because I am the youngest in my family but I'm the first to go out of state. ",03Nov2018,1
18,"Alright, so today I went over to my ""boyfriend's"" house (I use quotations because technically we were on a break- which was heavily influenced by my friends, and was also due to me admitting I need help from counceling for mental health issues) and I surprised him with a cake, celebrating our one year Snapchat streak. when I showed up the first topic of conversation was about this girl I dislike, who he had a crush on in the past. He wasn't talking about her in a positive way, but I was still uncomfortable. After this conversation was done, he said ""oh yeah thanks for the cake too"" and started eating. 

This kinda sank my mood a bit, but not enough to where I was noticeably ""depressed,"" I shrug it off because I was really tired from work, so I thought that was just it. 

I mentioned I got promoted at work, which is something I've been working on really hard, and then we went back to talking about him. which made me feel unimportant and like I should just not talk. 

I said I was hungry and he offered to make me food, which was really sweet of him, but after it was done, he wanted me to take it upstairs into his bedroom. I didn't want to be in there because, in all honesty, I didn't want to have sex with him, I just wanted to kick back and relax. I said I was really tired and I didn't want to lay down because I would fall asleep. He said I should take a nap, so after I finished eating, we ended up in the bedroom. No sex, but I did fall asleep.

 I woke up and went to the bathroom. After I finished washing my hands, I was fully awake again, and I felt all of the uncomfortable feelings from before rush back. I felt unsafe and I started to feel panicked. I made a post on Instagram about how I wish I could just feel good all the time. 

I went back into his room and said I was tired and I wanted to go home. He didn't say anything when I said I wanted to leave. Which was weird because it felt like he didn't care if I stayed or went. He didn't stop watching the TV as I got up and when I opened the door, he said ""see ya."" ""I said yeah, I guess so"" and then he said ""You guess?"" and I said  ""yeah, I do.""

I went downstairs and got cake leftovers from the fridge. As I was leaving he went down the stairs and watched me leave, telling me how to unlock his door. I didn't say anything else to him in person. 

I got home and saw he responded with an emoji to my Instagram post. I couldn't see what it was because I have an Android. I asked in a comment what it was. 

I then texted him and explained why I really left, and explained that I don't know how to react in the situation that I feel mentally ill in front of him, so I just left- for context, he has told me in the past that when I force him into dealing with my mental illness it puts too much pressure on him and is unfair of me- and he didn't respond. 

here's a link to the Instagram post and the texts we sent eachother: http://imgur.com/gallery/Rv1A6jq 
I just genuinely don't know if I'm responsible for the shitty evening, when all I wanted was to give him a cute surprise. 

I feel like my anxiety ruined everything :/

19,"People keep suggesting depression, but I can't think of a time I didn't feel like this. I don't feel like I have free will. I feel like I've been watching someone else. The older I get the more I need to be doing... but the harder it gets to force myself to do what I need to be doing. 

I thought this would get easier the longer I worked at being an ""adult"", but it just keeps getting harder. I've hit a point in life where I'm juggling so many things that I'm dropping the ball on everything... but I'm still doing less with my life than most of my peers AND they manage more free time than I do? It's like everyone grew up except me.

 I just want the world to stop moving for a week so I can catch up. I'm not even out of my 20's, and it feels like everything is moving faster than I have the energy or willpower to keep up with. Once the weekend hits I just want to sit and stare at a wall all day while my peers are out socializing, working on hobbies and personal projects, or getting ahead on chores. My ideal day is apparently just fucking around for 18 hours, forgetting to eat, bathe, or sleep.

20,"So, a friend I know is having trouble.  They are in their late 50's and have to work 40 hours and take public transportation. They have a bad knee and are overweight. The knee is very bad and at one point they were getting hundreds of pain pills a month. They now receive 60 vicodin 10s and trazodone to sleep.

Here is my concern. Without any medicine, they are always feeling like they can't do it. They constantly have a doom and gloom outlook on everything. They justify this mindset by claiming exhaustion and pain. They are negative and behave worn and beat down and create an obstacle to problems instead of being open minded, receptive, and optimistic. 

Now, after about a week on both medications, they are cheery, more lively, in less pain (obviously) and overall have ideas about how to make progress in life. 

I am not a doctor but I think they are having an issue with mental health. Not bipolar or sadness but I think this could be an issue solved with an MAOI. I am open to all ideas and suggestions.

They would never agree with any of this however I know their is a huge difference in their mindset once the medicine has been in their system for a week or so.  I'm not saying their points are not valid. They have had a hard life and are definitely in pain and most certainty exhausted but my point is that many people live this life and at that age could even be considered quite average and to be that unhappy is a tell tale of a greater issue. Especially once the drugs come into play then a greater sense of well-being creates almost a completely different person.

And before anyone says anything about them being high, they have in their past used many many pills, as many as 300 pills a month of oxycodone, and now they are on 20mg a day of hydrocodone.  If anything, the drugs provide relief not a high.",03Nov2018,1

I'm constantly seeking out new things and experiences, often to an extent that's not exactly healthy and I wind up involved in things I shouldn't be. The last couple months it feels like I'm living in groundhog day and I'm finding it hard to push through

I had to move back in with my parents because my mother was ill. Im 25 and before that I'd been living the dream essentially in a major city abroad.  My home town is much smaller and everyone knows everyone (biggest city in my country, no option to move to a bigger city here). During this period a bunch of really traumatic things happened, then I started this big corporate job here.

Admittedly, the job I have here is pretty great and is amazing for me careerwise , but at the moment I'm on this  6 MTH training course for it which leaves me with endless free time. I just spend hours and hours getting stoned alone in my room to try to fill up the time. I feel completely hopeless about moving out because of the property market here. I have basically no friends outside of work and it's really hard to meet new people. This feeling got worse after I started the course but it's been there ever since I moved back home.

I just can't deal with my own thoughts anymore. I can't talk to anyone because I find them incredibly boring, but not out of any fault of their own. It's like I can't connect with anyone anymore. I don't know what to say. I'm just swallowed up by this sense that nothing is significant or interesting anymore and that things could just go on this way indefinitely.

23,"So my brother has been in the military for a long while now and lived in a few other states for a long time. He recently moved home with me and things have been going well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently his dog peed in the floor several times without being cleaned up. My girlfriend has been upset that the house smells like pee, we talked with him about it and we all agreed to clean the floors a bunch, but they smell didn't go away. The past week or so my girlfriend has said the floors smelled and complained a few times, and then asked him to vaccuum the other day, he didnt, so she got frustrated with him a little. 

&amp;#x200B;

I text him today and while we were talking asked him to try a certain cleaning method or googling a few things, he said he was going camping and he and his dog would be gone soon. He ended up buying a tent and taking all of his things and is now in the woods somewhere and no one knows where. He said he is leaving the state or something and that he is going to come get the rest of his stuff later. We don't know what to do or why he could possibly be this upset over a request. Does any one have advice on who to call or what to do? I don't even know if he's still in the same city right now or not.

24,"I am not a forgetful person nor do I misplace or lose my stuff. My memory is actually really good for certain things. But it's like some things no matter what I can never get straight. I can't figure it out.

&amp;#x200B;

Example: There is a cupboard on either side of the sink. The left has large plates, small plates, and a few glasses. The right has large cups, small cups, standard sized coffee mugs in the middle and on top a bunch of random coffee mugs.

&amp;#x200B;

ALMOST EVERY FUCKING TIME I go for the wrong cupboard or I have to stop and try to remember which is which and it literally takes me like 5 full seconds to remember. Sometimes I still get it wrong. I can't control the cupboards it's not my house. Otherwise, I'd have every cup on one side and only plates on the other. I think it's because there are cups on both sides but like still. Usually what trips me up the most is the plates. I should know the plates are on the left. I go for the right almost half the time. It's always been this way with these cupboards.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example of this is certain light switches. The ones that control 3 things. It's like a game of trial and error every time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or the multi-remote control. I only use two buttons to switch, There are 5 mode buttons, but I only ever use 2. Audio and TV. Audio is the middle one and TV is to the right. I just can't seem to make the memory in my brain that audio is the middle one. I always have to look.

&amp;#x200B;

This makes me feel stupid. I  do have a sort of mixed up thinking process and it affects me in ways that I don't fully understand. I feel like if I could figure out what causes these things it would let me figure something out about my brain and clear up a lot of other troubling thinking habits.

Thanks.

25,"4 years ago after my best friend commit suicide, my therapist suggested i get a dog. I convinced my parents and got my new best friend. My dog, Rooney. He was a saving grace to me and i attribute me being alive still to him being in my life. 

Well, tonight one of my family members left a massive chocolate bar on the table and left him alone. He ate it. 

Now he is in an animal hospital overnight hooked up to an EKG potentially fighting for his life and potentially spending his last hours alone and i can’t be there with him. 

I honestly do not know what i will do if i lose him. He’s my sunshine on my darkest days. He’s the reason I’m still on this earth. He’s my best friend. And i May never get to see or hold him again.

26,"My entire life I have been always full of optimism, full of hope, full of love. There have been pains along the way and I have gone through some troubles but I always held on to hope, love, and just the full hearted belief that there was true good in this world. Last year I lost my grandparents, my grandmother was very important to me but my grandfather...my grandfather was my hero, my beacon of light that showed me there was good in this world. While going through loosing my grandfather the woman I was with couldn’t handle my nervous breakdown, and I do understand as she has had a hard past due to situations like I put her in, so she ran...she was and still is my heart. Well those two things have been hard enough and then a month ago I was trying to help a homeless man and he got mad cause I couldn’t help more, I was willing to give him the shirt off my back. So now after all that I have lost the good in my life, the beauty of this world, and the hope for a better tomorrow. Now I don’t want to know people anymore, I have cut all ties with everyone I knew, I purposely burned bridges. I don’t feel that warmth of love, or hope, or beauty, or goodness anymore...I just feel empty hatred for humanity.

33,"Hi guys I haven't really told anyone about this except my boyfriend who accepts me and loves me for it but it kind of worries me so I have to ask. Theres two things I need to address. Any advice or comments would be appreciated.

 1. Since I was a little kid I created these imaginary friends but it was like a real world or a fantasy to me I would act it out and I had all these different friends who helped me and talked to me and even sexually. They all have different names and even when I'm acting this out im a completely different person. I have super powers and many talents and I go by a different name. As I got older I created new friends and they've stayed the same since and I still act it out and talk to them and go into this different world (I am 21) I've never gone to a therapist because I dont really think it's a huge problem nor do I think theres any medications to help. I dont necessarily see them more than visualize them being there but it's so real to me and it helps me with everything. I've had many imaginary boyfriends as well who I use my irl relationships to process things in my world if that makes any sense. While I'm aware they're not actually real it's almost real to me that they mean something to me and I couldnt bear to never do it again. Its almost like it's a way to cope. I do it hours throughout the day almost every day, mostly when I'm alone. When I was a child I remember that it started that I was at an orphanage I would go in my back yard by the well and talk to them I had made a list of 100 different orphans there who were all my friends as well. I once tried to tell my mom but she blew me off as crazy. 

2. Another issue I'd like to address is that I act like a literal child towards my boyfriend. I baby talk and ask him to do all these things for me that you would for a child. It just comes out of nowhere. I'm sure this is normal and that it's a sign of affection or something but I also feel it may tie in with what I said above. Multiple personalities or something like that (not diagnosing myself because I dont believe that but I'm just curious If theres a word for it)

I contribute to maintaining the household when I can because nobody else does, and other than myself, only one person in the household works, we struggle to pay rent.

40,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post (direct me to the right one if it is) but I need some advice because I am at my wits end.

So I think my boyfriend is a major hypochondriac and I’m losing patience. He wasn’t always like this but for the past year and a half he’s convinced himself of having many problems that cause him to have panic attacks. The latest one which just started up about a week ago is he’s convinced he has diabetes but won’t make a doctors appointment. I fully support him in getting healthy and seeing a doctor but at this point it’s like he does it to make others feel sorry for him and it’s gotten so bad that it’s like he’s fully convinced himself that he has some disease or another and I just can’t take the constant “woe is me I have cancer or diabetes boo hoo” attitude anymore when he probably doesn’t. The reason I think he’s a hypochondriac is because every time he gets slightly sick he immediately researches and self diagnoses himself with brain tumors, cancer, diabetes etc... which is just so so so ridiculous to me but he gets very mad when I tell him he’s being ridiculous. He throws fits and wants me to feel sorry for him but I just can’t anymore.

So my question I guess is for anyone who has or is dealing with a hypochondriac. Is there  a way to break him out of this and how do you support him/her when you know they are being hypochondriacs?

Also side note: I’m not the only one in his life who thinks he’s a hypochondriac, his close family believes so too.

41,"Trigger warning: self harm and suicide attempts. Also lots of cussing

I'm really posting here after being majorly triggered by a random post in another subreddit, and I'm hoping someone understands what I'm going through. I'm probably just going to trigger myself more, and people in the comments are just going to say I deserved it or am lying or something. Whatever, here goes.

When I was 14 I was committed to a psych hospital. I was a cutter, and I decided to go to my dad for help. But before that in my mind I convinced myself I needed to make it ""worth getting help"", so I cut myself more and deeper than I had before.

Long story short despite not being actively suicidal and genuinely just looking for help now that I had come clean about it the piece of shit psych evaluator had me committed.

The 1st psych hospital I went to I had a psychiatrist who told me I should try harder to kill myself next time (even though I hadn'ttried to kill myself at all). Oh yeah and she overdosed me on Seroquel because she wrote 50 mg instead of 5 or some dumb shit like that. I was one of those Guinea pigs who was prescribed Seroquel for MDD and ended up all fucked up.

I came home a complete fucking wreck from the Seroquel. I couldn't focus on school anymore (the only decent thing in my life anymore considering my family was poor and homeless). In the end I took my psychiatrist's advice and tried to kill myself. This started a repetitive cycle of hospital admissions, more medication, more severe side effects /""symptoms"" and more hospital admissions. I was admitted 7 times in 2 years.

In the hospitals I was told I may as well kill myself once I got out several times, witnessed a 300 pound man slam a 130 pound girl's face into the floor to ""restrain"" her (laughing while doing so), threats from guards, and a guy somehow managed to jump out of a window on a floor above me and land about 30 feet away.

I have PTSD now. I go into full on flashbacks when anything even remotely reminds me of the experience. As well as having had to detox from all the meds after FINALLY refusing them when I lost my sight from a side effect. Thanks mental ""health"" system you fixed me.

And now I feel like I can't be fucking sad without thinking I'm going to be locked up and mentally and physically abused. Moreover these people who like to lock people up despite not breaking any laws have the audacity to say/believe shit like ""Its for your own good"" They can burn in hell. Maybe they're decent people and that feeling is unwarranted. But I don't care I hope they burn in hell! I hate them, and I think I'm owed that.

After detoxing it took months to gathee up the courage to go to therapy (I'll never go to another psychiatrist) and learned to cope with my depressive spells. Years later it turned out my misdiagnosed Depression/Bipolar Disorder was a very severe case of PMDD. I take a birth control pill and go to therapy to deal with the PTSD and some self-esteem issues I have.",03Nov2018,1

50,"I am a hypochondriac in the USA. I have had this anxiety since the age of 12. I think it started because of numerous things, but one big one being that I had felt run down for 4 years and I kept asking my parent to take me to the doctor, but he would not. I went to the doctor who did blood work based on me feeling so run down and she put me on iron and thyroid medication, I felt fantastic after that and have been OCD over my health since the age of 12, it was worse after menustration started and reading the scary TSS warning tampon packet, but after those actual medical problems with my thyroid and iron the anxiety was worse. I had my mother die of an allergic reaction to a medication at the age of 3, and my uncle I watched die of alcoholism just a few months ago. I never feel comfortable with meds I remember after my mom died I asked my father if taking my seizure medication would make me ""die just like mom"". It has seriously made me fear any new medication, even Xanax and Ativan I fear taking outside of a hospital setting. I just don't know what to do anymore, I always fear I am dying, medication related fear or not.

52,"I've been diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, having previously suffered with bouts of what was (at the time) deemed to be PTSD and associated OCD. I had a really rough couple of weeks last month, where I couldn't actually leave the house for a few days because I was too anxious (of being spotted by a particular person from my local area, even though in reality they've never done anything threatening towards me, they just really put me on edge and I panic about situations where I worry I might encounter them). I've been finding it particularly hard to travel home from work on the train by myself. I've always been unable to go places by myself at night, because I get too worried about all the things that could happen (mostly about being mugged or attacked). I had about eight months of CBT a few years ago after the incident which started my PTSD, which helped somewhat, but I still get periods where I really feel on-edge and like something terrible is going to happen and I'm unable to use any of the coping techniques I've learned to get relief.

I've been seeing a therapist weekly for a few months now, for a mostly unrelated issue (relationship / sex counselling), but we've also talked about my anxiety issues and coping strategies.

Two weeks ago I explained the situation to my GP who prescribed pregabalin (Lyrica). I specifically requested not to go on an SSRI or SNRI because I don't feel ""depressed"" as such, and I was too worried about how it would affect my personality, plus the side effects and withdrawl issues. Pregabalin sounded like a good compromise. I've been putting off taking it because I've had a big project on at work and I didn't want to be affected by the side effects.

I've had a pretty good couple of weeks, mainly because I've avoided traveling to or from work by myself, and I've not seen the person in the local area who stresses me out. I also think that having received a diagnosis and put a plan in place to start treating it has made me feel more positive about the situation. I've also been busy with work, which has helped keep my mind of the worries.

I'd fixed today's date as my starting point, but when it came to start taking it, I pretty much had a panic attack worrying about all the side effects and how it's going to affect me. I'm particularly freaked out by the possibility of it making me feel suicidal, which utterly terrifies me. I hate not being 'in control' of my feelings and emotions, and I was in tears this morning just trying to decide if taking the medication was the right thing to do or not. I'm also really worried because I work as a DJ and I have some pretty big bookings coming up, including several weddings in a few weeks. I'm really stressed out that if I take the pregabalin and it makes me dopey/unable to focus/dizzy, I won't be able to DJ well enough, and I'm going to ruin someone's wedding day. If I start taking it and the side effects are unbearable, I don't want to feel trapped into taking it until I can go to my doctor again to reduce the dose and avoid withdrawal symptoms, which I've read can be pretty horrible for a few weeks. Then with the stuff like weight gain and possible suicidal thoughts... it just seems like it could be a very bad decision to even start taking it, especially because I've had a good couple of weeks and feel like maybe I've been over-thinking the whole anxiety problem altogether, and maybe I'm actually fine and don't need to take anything at all?

So I guess I'm looking for some advice. How did people who have taken pregabalin / Lyrica find the side effects? Is it something that's going to ruin my ability to do my job as a DJ? I feel like the illness (the anxiety) is playing a trick on me, and stopping me from taking something which might actually help me - but at the same time it feels so rational to be concerned about all the potentially horrible side effects and withdrawal complications. I just feel a bit stuck.

I tend to have friends of friends who I don’t contact alone, I tend to get tagged along to things.

This is my first Reddit post so please forgive me if I don't get it right.  


It might help if I explain a little about myself, and then we can get to the reason behind my posting here.  


I'm in my 20s, male, currently unemployed and I'm going through something that I don't quite understand.  


I'm usually very sociable and outgoing however in the last few years I have felt as though my soul has seeped away and now I'm nothing more than a husk, I find no joy in life, I have lost all interest in women, the things that I used to enjoy I now consider a burden, and I haven't been sleeping or exercising.  
I've always been very active, I swam/gymed daily for around 12 years however in the last four months since leaving my job I have confined myself to a small room much like a prison cell and haven't left it apart from 3 trips to the shop on my bike. I don't know why I have done this, however the idea of going outside, speaking with people, getting a new job is causing me massive anxiety.  
I was severely bullied growing up and come from a broken family, my mother left when I was 13 years old and took my sister with her, my father locked himself away and barely contacts myself or my two siblings, in fact my family hardly speak at all, and I don't have contact with my mother whom i loved dearly as a boy, these days she tends to bring out the worst in me, although we haven't spoken for two years.  


I tend to break all and any relationships I have with people in one way or another so instead of entering into anything more than being an acquaintance seems pointless to me, I feel as though everything I do is a ruse to fit in, as though I am faking being normal and content when beneath it's simply not true.  
I often see people describe themselves as feeling alone or isolated when going through what I think I am, but for me I don't feel that way even though I haven't interacted with anyone in the last four months, I just feel nonchalant and uninterested.  


I've never had suicidal thoughts and I have always maintained that life is precious and hope for better can never be extinguished, but the light for me in the dark has grown so very small I'm struggling to bring it back, there is a great quote in one of the more recent batman films it goes something a little like ""why do we fall, so we may learn to pick ourselves up again"", I think that is a valuable thing to remember, but this time I'm stuck on the ground and have been for so long, I'm not sure what to do.  


I don't like talking about my problems with people usually, in fact I'm considering deleting this whole post but I think I need some help.

I was sitting alone in my room with a cup of coffee; I was crying for the first time in ages (I usually cry all the time but for some reason I haven't been able to for the last few months). So as I was sitting there my mind suddenly started to go really foggy, I couldn't think properly and my thought process was unusual. I also felt pins and needles throughout my whole body. It took me a few moments to realise that my entire body was shaking. After I became more aware of what was happening I stood up and immediately slumped down on the floor as my body stopped shaking.

Unconscious, in shock etc) they know to be careful with what drugs they give me and how to treat me in general. It's also very helpful in a mental health emergency, (ex. Severe panic attack, delusions, suicidal etc) so they can save time by knowing I have a history of mental health issues, and that it's not being caused by an issue with my thyroid or an overdose on drugs or alcohol.

67,"Hello all!

I'm looking for an excersise that my therapist did with me a long time ago and I'm hoping that someone is familiar and can help me find it again.

You start by writing your entire family tree on a piece of paper. Then she read out different letters and their meanings, and you had to write the letter next to anyone who experienced that thing. For example, ""Ab is for Abuse"" and you write AB next to your Dad's name because his father used to hit him in a rage. Or ""A is for Alcoholic"" and you write that by your mother and aunts name, ect. In the end, you write a C by everyone who lived with someone with a letter, and it's supposed to show you that everyone is impacted by everyone else's struggles. How could you not have challenges of your own if you grew up in a home like this?

Well, I was answering a message today and it required me to look up the DSM-V criteria for my disorder so I could make a point (I haven't read this criteria in a long while now) and the website I found was actually one I had never seen before. It said basically the same damn things that I already know, but it included this:  


""Due to the potentially dangerous, or even fatal, consequences of pyromania, not to mention the possibility of conviction and incarceration for arson, individuals should remain in lifelong contact with qualified psychiatric personnel.""

I am a pyromaniac for life. I guess I have always been one, so that isn't a new thought at least...but still...wow.

72,"I’m 23 and I keep having anxiety about not living long (past 30). I feel like I’m old and that I’m running out of time. A lot of my childhood friends died early and I’m a lot more aware of my mortality than most people my age. I’ve seen many people I know work hard and spend their whole lives in school to prepare for their future just to do die shortly before graduation. It’s to the point where I literally don’t picture myself growing old.
 
Here’s a few examples:

I work as a bank teller and I feel like a failure, but people keep saying “you’re only 23. Life will work out for you,” but I just keep  imagining myself as not becoming old. I genuinely feel like I’m at the end of my life.

This ideology keeps me from doing any long-term investing in myself; 401k, stocks, etc. I also buy expensive things because I feel like I might as well enjoy life for the few years that I will be here.

I rush having a family because I’m afraid I won’t enjoy it at 40 like most people can. I wish I could find a girl to marry and have a family now since I didn’t experience that growing up. Most guys my age don’t want that because they have the rest of their lives, but something in the back of my mind makes me believe I won’t make it to that point to actually enjoy it.

I bought an expensive Camaro for myself, even though everyone warned me against it. I’m not an idiot. I believe in living below my means and not going into heavy debt over frivolous things, but I thought I would never be able to full enjoy it any other time. Everyone is always telling me to start small, then work my way up to the things I want, but I was so worried about not being able to enjoy it later, I went and bought one now.

Family-wise, so far so good, slowly but surely me opening up about my experiences and struggles has been receptive but rarely any follow up from them. 


My experience with friends has been a fairly positive one, especially those who still stuck by me through my episodes and my grievances. 

Except for the ones whom had an incredibly negative response, we just drifted away and have just become “friendly to each other” when we meet in the streets or at events. 

For me, I’ve shared with them what helps me, especially the little things like: instead of asking me to think of happy thoughts, or think of something else, involve me in an activity like “I Spy” or care games that I like, or even phrases like: instead of saying I’m a bit ocd, say I’m a bit anal on things, or I like things to be organised? 

These little things along the help opened discussion between my friends and me, my illness and mental health.

77,"Ok so this is not an easy thing for me to speak about but I have to talk about it.

Last year I was at a friend's house (let's call her A) and I invited another 'friend' over because he was messaging me telling me he was bored and wanted company. Let's call him B. A and I had been heavily drinking before his arrival and when he arrived A and I decided it would be a good idea to take mdma. I had taken it before but never when i had been drinking so I didn't know what to expect. A and I ended up absolutely fucked whilst B was sober. I remember him asking if either of us had ever had a threesome before the drugs kicked in to which I replied ""no, I don't think my boyfriend would be that into anything like that"" and gave an awkward laugh but didn't think much of the question at the time. I remember A and I playing drinking games and B kept coaxing us into drinking more by saying we had to comply with the games rules and to hurry up and finish the game. The drugs hit and after that I don't remember much at all, my mind is completely blank at certain points however some memories have come back to me over time that I think I was suppressing however they are hazy and unclear. 

I 'woke up' it felt like, or rather snapped out of my intoxication, naked lying beside A and B who were also naked and having sex. I immediately ran out of the room and went in for a shower and had my first real panic attack. I thought I was having a heart attack or something similar at the time. I couldn't remember how I had ended up in that room, naked with them and I didn't know what I had done. The only thing I knew for sure was my hair was matted and there was a crusty substance all over my face, a horrible taste in my mouth that could only be cum. Not like this is too relevant but I had never in my life let anyone (not even my serious partner) cum on my face.

I went downstairs and lay on the cold floor in the conservatory trying to breathe. My thoughts were racing around in my head and I was in complete shock. B left quickly and A sat with me in silence. 

I spoke to A about what had happened in the morning and told her I couldn't remember anything. She told me that we had had a threesome and she felt really gross about it. She said she thought I was into it or she would have never let anything happen. 

Fast forward a couple of days, I was in A's house again. B had been messaging me and I felt obligated to respond out of fear he would tell my boyfriend what had happened. I called him and pleaded he not mention anything to anyone about it and he just said ""huh, ok"" in an obviously insincere tone. I got angry at him and told him I never wanted the threesome to happen and that I couldn't even remember what had been done to me. He responded with ""don't make out I'm a rapist, you never said no"" to which I replied ""but did I say yes?"" He just repeated the fact that i didnt say i didnt want it. I then went on to cry and tell him I thought I could trust him before it happened and if he ever was a friend or ever did care about me he wouldn't have taken advantage when i was completely out my face and not thinking clearly. He then turned nasty and told me that this was my pay back for not wanting to sleep with him or be in a relationship with him a couple years back when he had a thing for me. He had pretended to be there for me as a friend for years when he only wanted one thing and went out of his way to get it that night. I couldn't speak to him any more and hung up the phone. Shortly after I ended up telling my boyfriend what had happened, he was disgusted and felt betrayed but he told me he wasn't angry at me for it because I wasn't aware of what I was doing.

I know it was my fault for taking drugs and putting myself in that vulnerable situation but 1 year on and I still have sleepless nights because I don't know how to think or feel. I hate the word rape and I tense up whenever I hear it, as i am writing this right now I am finding it hard to breathe properly. This has had a huge impact on my state of mind and also my relationship. I don't even know what to do anymore and I can't help blaming myself for what happened. I found out he told people, like I knew he would, when i received a message from one of his friends saying he heard I liked to have threesomes. I then found out that it was actually B who sent the message to me from his friends account on the work computer in the staff room. (We used to work together but I left a few months before the threesome happened)

Long story short: my mum's a psych. nurse and is taking a course on something called Open Dialogue. It's something that's been in effect in many regions (Finland, Sweden, Canada, etc) for decades and the UK is starting to adopt it too. It's a revolutionary approach which has been described as life-changing. It has a 75% success rate over 2 years in Finland for psychosis and can be applied to a range of conditions with similar success rates. Anyway, there's a petition about it now, calling on the UK to adopt it nationally as standard practice. Please sign it as it may have immense consequences on the future of the NHS and MHS.

88,"I wrote this this morning as an outline for a productive conversation with my doctor. Sorry for length.

1.	HISTORY
For as long as I can remember, I’ve worried. There is always something to worry about. I don’t have to look hard or long to find it. It’s always available at my fingertips as an immediate conjure. When I was younger, an infant of maybe 3, my mother would leave my favorite VHS movie playing during the night — I would cry and whine otherwise. I can remember this pretty vividly actually, it was how I coped with not being able to sleep.  I was either too scared or too worried. I would have horrible recurring nightmares, around 3 or so that I can remember now. They would haunt me to my core and I remember many nights sprinting down the halls to my mother’s room to safety from the different imagined beasts. They had names, and they were SCARY... So when I discovered I could fall asleep to a good movie and sleep soundly, the prescription wrote itself... To this day it’s still used as my means of keeping away the demons and monsters and fears and worries and thoughts that come in the night. I believe that is my first experience with what I would come to deal with everyday for the rest of my life. It has shown itself in a hundred different forms and in some way crept its tendrils into everything I’ve ever done, anyone I’ve ever known, and followed me everywhere I’ve ever been. One of the more alarming realities of this situation, in my case, is that its taken me 27 or so years to fully realize I even have mental health issues. So many things in my life have been so unreasonably hard to cope with, so challenging and intimidating that I pretty much gave up trying to achieve any of the things I’ve ever aspired to do. I gave up on life at around 16. Before I even started... 

2.	ANXIETY 
This little word/emotion, has without a doubt been the single most omnipotent and omnipresent force in my life. I don’t know what life is like without anxiety (being high and thus, anxiety free does not count.) I’ve self diagnosed, and self medicated in every way imaginable looking for the answer, for relief. A lot of the time (&gt;80%) I run, hide, or ignore whatever situation I’m being faced with. It’s as if I’m in a constant state of fight or flight, and I can RARELY muster the courage or motivation to fight anymore. Because of that, my life looks like a long series of false starts, half-try’s, give ups, missed chances, and wasted potential. I am crippled by it sometimes - paralyzed from the neck down. I end up worrying and projecting and panicking my way out of any and all events in my life, big or small. Like I said earlier, most of it is out of fear of some sort and it very easily and very often renders me useless and hopeless. I’ve been unemployed for around two and a half months or so and I feel completely incapable of getting a new job without someone’s help. I’ve started plenty of new jobs in the past and survived but each time it feels like an insurmountable obstacle and usually a friend comes and saves the day with a foot in the door somewhere, you know, “the hookup”. The job situation is eating me alive currently and has been for the past couple of months. Constant mental struggle trying to solve this problem: Minimum wage is not enough to support me, I should be making 80k yearly on the low end, why even bother for a $160 paycheck once a week, the right job will obviously change my life, can I even handle working at Walmart with 80 coworkers I don’t know, I will never be happy working outside of the IT industry, that’s my passion and dream, anything else is torture, WHERE CAN I WORK THAT PAYS ENOUGH???  I’m so stuck, everyone thinks I’m a worthless lazy POS. They all think I don’t want to work and I’m just making excuses because I won’t wash dishes for $7.50/hr. Only bringing home $5-600 a month yet working hard full time is not right. I would rather die. Why can’t I get paid reasonably like everyone else in my peer group. It’s because there’s something wrong with me..... I am hopeless.

3.	DEPRESSION 
Not existing has been a fantasy of mine in the past. I’m not suicidal, but I’ve been so miserable at times that I’d rather just cease to exist. I’ve get so plagued with anxiety from problems I’m dealing with that something just flips - a circuit breaker - I lose all power and I’m stuck sitting in the dark, lost. It’s a feeling, and a state, and I feel it deep in my chest. This doesn’t make sense but it’s a void of infinite weight in the core of my body. It’s a black hole and the rest of my body is left fighting against its event horizon. The worst part about it for me is that it feels like no matter what’s going on now, (e.g. content as could be with my new job) *that* feeling, will always be waiting for my next try at a happy life to fail so it can consume me again. It’s a source of anxiety and well, anxiety unchecked is a source of depression. They are a chain locked to my ankles, one end tied to the others beginning, dragging a barely movable stone just a little ways behind me...

4.	SOLUTION! SALVATION!
I want to go back to college. I figured out what I want to do. At 28, I finally found what I want to do with my life and I feel so good about that. But I think I should go to college. I think I need the degree to be taken seriously in the job market. I also am extremely passionate about it and truly want to learn everything I can about it. I definitely need to be educated, I barely know anything about it and there is so much to learn to be successful at a professional level. I have a lot of IT experience but this is the next level. I want this so bad. I can see a happy future as a result. For years I could only get depressed thinking of the future. 

I’m really afraid that I’m not capable of graduating college. I’ve believed that since high school in one way or another. I never even tried to go because of it. I’m scared I’m not smart enough. I’m scared I won’t pass math, with even harder levels mathematics to come. I’m so sick of wanting to do something so badly and not doing it because I’m afraid I can’t. Am I college graduate material? Could I have a prosperous career working as a private or military cyber security expert? Am I smart enough???? I don’t want everyone I know to watch me try to go to college and fail yet again at something else. Then everyone will have evidence of my low intelligence and I’ll never recover from that. I’m really afraid I won’t have enough energy to do it. I ALWAYS worry about my energy and how tired I constantly am. How can I be a college student when I struggle so hard to do simple tasks. This is another stupid fucking idea that I’ve come up with to make me feel good for a half a day, I’ll never fucking be anything but a fucking loser.

I don't even think anyone will get to the end of this post but here goes nothing... 

I'm 18 and I've been struggling for the past four years with a lot of ups and downs (mainly downs).

At 15, I suddenly lost interest in every thing I ever loved (like going to swimming practice and going to school)and my grades were going dooowwwnn. I don't know if it was just hormones but I was doing soooo good at 14 in school and swimming and I still don't know why I had that shitty mood phase.
After a year of struggling with my parents and with literally all of my friends, my mood started to get better and I felt like every thing is going to be okay. I had this surge of confidence and I was on my way to achieve a youth olympic b-cut at 16 years old. I was also very confident (more like cocky tbh) in school and I was doing really well. I also  got in a relationship which was really rocky. That is when I just started going down again.
At 17 I was skipping school days and I was feeling empty and so down that I didn't have the energy to do anything. Life was such a burden. I just wanted to graduate and get the fuck out there. I hated all my friends. I was blaming every one for abandoning me even though they weren't. I felt quite useless.
I would lay for hours on my bed wishing that god would just take me because I didn't have the guts to do it myself.

Right now I'm feeling a little bit mixed. It's like I'm depressed but I feel like there is hope. At times I would think that if I had a bottle of pills I wouldn't hesitate to put an end to this bullshit life. At times I feel like I can do this. 

I realized this was the second major depressive episode I had in my life so
I went to a psychiatrist and after a 30 minute session she believes I am bipolar. The problem is she didn't even get to know me better and it was so quick that I feel like she rushed it. I told my parents and they where like.... lol no you're not

I literally don't know what to do know. I'm done. Fuck this.

I do not get along with my stepdad, I moved back home and asked that my stepdad doesn’t speak to me so it wouldn’t be a hassle for me to stay there for a bit. He gave me 3 strikes and then kicked me out again. 3 of the strikes were caused due to him being rude to me and me reacting. My mother has said it wasn’t my fault in the past, however, because he has PTSD, his behaviour is excused. I have no diagnosis for any mental illness but it has been clear to my family for years that I struggle with it. So my question is, is it wrong of me to feel like shit because nobody’s takin into consideration how I feel? Am I being over dramatic? Is it wrong to ask that my stepdad doesn’t speak to me? Is it wrong for me to react?


Full story: 
I recently moved back home with my family because my boyfriend and I lost our jobs. Prior to moving back home, I asked if my boyfriend could stay as well (I figured, since we were living together 9 months prior to and we planned on staying for a month, only, it wouldn’t be an issue). My mother had no issue with it, but discussed it with my stepfather whom said no, therefore said no. I should also mention that the reason I moved out originally was because my mother wouldn’t tell my stepfather I was still living at home. 

The first week into the month, I got into an argument with my stepfather about my showers. I had shaved my legs for the first time in 6 months (and all of you who have not shaved for months will understand this) and took 20 minutes in the shower. When I got out, he questioned why I took such a long shower, then kept questioning and saying little things like “you are the ONLY person I know who takes 20 minutes showers, it’s ridiculous”. Normally, I take 5 minute showers. Him saying the little things caused me to react which is when he decided I had three strikes and then I was put on the streets. 

Another incident was when my aunt and mother were complaining about the smell of marijuana. I cracked a joke with them, saying “funny how those saying they hate the smell, smoke weed”. My mother and aunt didn’t take it personally, however, my stepfather did. He lashed out which caused my aunt (who has cerebral palsy) to lash out at me (my stepdad taking it seriously, caused her to believe I was insulting her). However there was no strike for this one (I’m assuming he realized I wasn’t speaking to him, even tho he wasn’t even interacting in the conversation so I don’t know why he would).

The second strike was when I took a five-minute shower and my sister complained to my mother that I was “taking too long”. She had just woken up, I was out of the shower when she asked to use the bathroom and had asked for 2 minutes to get dressed. Which she complained about. I then got upset and yelled at her because I felt as though I could never enjoy a shower without people rushing me. Which caused my stepdad to say, nice and clearly, “ahhhh shut the fuck uppppppp” and therefore caused me to react. 

The third strike, I gave myself. It was Halloween morning and I had just done my sister and brother’s make up and was eating before work. (Halloween is like my birthday, may I add. I take it seriously, my whole family knows this. My parents do not celebrate Halloween (they’re Christian) so I take the kids out trick-or-treating every year, I decorate my bedroom, etc.) as I was eating, my mom and I were discussing my aunt coming out with us this year. I was complaining because she doesn’t like walking and I already had to wheel around my brother who doesn’t like walking. Then my stepfather chimed in, saying he would take her and my brother trick or treating. I reacted but not as badly at first, however he kept repeating it, which caused me to eventually fully react. I then knew I was going to react terribly therefore claimed the third strike and packed my things. 

Child’s services used to be involved with us. They tried to remove me because my family was telling them I was violent and threatened to kill them — I was thirteen, and had grabbed a hammer and other things out of my parents room after saying “I’m going to grab things out of your room too then since we’re all just helping eachother to each other’s things”. They decided to twist the event into “she threatened us with a hammer”. 

Prior to them getting married, he asked for my forgiveness because prior to getting married (and finding Jesus), they were violent. For example, my mother had to travel 2 hours to go to court one morning (she punched him in the face at a bon jovi concert because he was flirting with another girl, on my mother’s birthday) and he went out drinking the night before and never came home until 9 am so I had to stay home with the kids. He then told me to get ready for school (even though my mom said no matter what he says, we didn’t have to go to school) and as soon as it had been 10 minutes, not even, he started banging on the door to tell me to get out. To the point he busted he door open. 

He hasn’t been as violent since, except for the one time he threw a pan down the stairs last year because I didn’t wash it that morning (I had school and no time to wash it).

It has been getting worst since, mentally. Social services was involved last year, however told me there was nothing they could do because it was only unhealthy for me, no one else. 

My mother honestly doesn’t seem to care and I just need to know if I am overreacting because it really feels like I am. And if I’m not, please give me tips for boundaries because I’m trying to stick to my boundaries and keep my family blocked but I also am truly afraid of being homeless, however living at home makes me want to die.

94,"Hey guys, 

I came to this sub because I need some advice that is unbiased, maybe some coping mechanisms to help me. So i recently found out two of my friend are currently abusing meth. The one I expected it, she believed the cops and all her friends were out to get her. The other, i did not, he told me on my birthday. I wasn’t expecting it at all, and i asked my mom for some advice because she’s been in this situation. Well, bad decision because they work together and my mother told her coworkers. Today that friend ended an almost ten year friendship with me and I’m devastated. 

I confronted my mom about it and all she did was belittle my feelings. Actually the first thing she said to me when she found me crying was ‘were you crying this loud so i would wake up?’ Then began to tell me all the problems she is going through, how her life is hard too, that all my friends do is use me, and how she’s ‘not trying to belittle my feelings, but you need to buck up and get over it because that’s what I do.’ I feel so manipulated emotionally by her.

I know I can’t fix my friends or my mothers attitude. I just need to know how to approach this whole situation because the past couple months everything has been so difficult with school, money, and relationships with people in my life I’ve been having frequent passive SI’s. Honestly, i don’t want to talk to my mother for a while. I don’t live with her, I’m only dependent by taxes because I am in college. I feel like the world is falling down around me.

96,"So I was in the er for three days, then triage for two before I actually got a room. Triage is basically a fish bowl full of patients needing mental health for various reasons and who are waiting to be accepted. You sleep in recliners, get fed if you're awake during the right hours, and have anti anxiety and sleep meds pushed on you. It's a mess. Also it's the place for detox.

So I finally get a bed and find out that it's just a fancier version of triage. One of the patients yells at others and accuses them of stealing, another bangs up against his door calling people every name in the book while throwing chairs, and yet another screams randomly and or points and laughs at everyone. I understand mental health comes in every form but usually they try to keep the same levels together.

99,"So I started dating this girl about 4-5 months ago. Things started off great. We treated each other great, got along great. She is kind of a homebody and some am I, so we didn't go out a ton, but when we did, it was small and quaint and we had so much fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day out of nowhere a month or so ago she just... changed. It didn't come off of a fight or anything. The night before was just like any other night. She just started to get mean, and nasty, and short-tempered. And since then it has gotten worse. She will text me out of nowhere just calling me an asshole for no reason. Like, literally having done nothing to her. Nothing. She will tell me she doesn't want to speak to me. Then a day later she will want to speak to me again, and then the next day she will tell me she wants me out of her life and then ignore me for a few days. Sometimes she will call me and she will just be RACING in her words. Speaking a million miles a minute and other times she will break out into crying sessions for no reason. I keep asking her to tell me what's wrong and to talk to me and she refuses. She won't explain anything, just basically tells me to fuck off. Then a couple weeks later, she'll be normal for a couple days and then back to being mean and cold and going on random tangents against me.

&amp;#x200B;

It's basically now a daily roller coaster ride. Highs and lows. And through it all, all I've been is a really caring and loving person. We never even had a fight. This is clearly not normal behavior, and how do I operate from here? I can't imagine someone is going to take kindly to ""You need to see someone and get some help, something isn't quite right here.""

&amp;#x200B;

I did some googling on mental health disorders. Some she shares commonalities with, but I'm no doctor. I just don't know what to do. I don't know if she needs help or if I just started dating an asshole. My gut feeling tells me something just isn't quite right with her mentally, but again, I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not asking anyone here to diagnose, I know she needs a doctor for that. I'd like some advice on what to do. Your average Joe would tell me to just kick her to the curb, but I figure people here would be more sympathetic to mental health issues(if that is indeed what is going on) so I might get a more diverse set of opinions here from understanding people.

100,"My brother is 24 and he was diagnosed with Schizophrenia for a couple years ago. He rarely leaves the house or his bed unless my parents force him. The only time he goes out is every Sunday for Church and when my dad forces him to take a walk outside. He is so completely different from the boy he once was, but also, he's better than he was before the meds--he had no prior issues until like 19 or so but after that it was kinda downhill.

So, today, we're waiting for my parents to come to the car and I strike up a conversation. His eyes really hurt because of the shots but he never says it unless you ask him directly. But I see his eyes wandering up and he explained to me that the shots do that to him--his vision gets screwed up and they just drift upwards. He didn't explain to me in more detail because he's not a talkative person and because he has bad English (I tried to get him to talk our language but he didn't want to).

We talk about me graduating soon (I always ask and he answers); I ask him what he wants me to buy because I'll give him my laptop once I leave for college but did he want something now?

His response: \*chuckles\* Don't tell \[our parents\] this....but....death.

me: what do you mean death?

him: \*smiling\* good death (he smiles randomly or laughs which was creepy when the symptoms first started appearing but now, it's just a part of him and I love his quirks. But that scared me when he said it with a smile)

me: what are you saying? what do you mean?

him: nothing...nothing...just like, good death....not bad, but good, I don't know

me: you want to die?

him: I used to be so strong before...I don't know...nevermind

I'm absolutely silent for a couple of minutes before tears just start running down my face. He tries to comfort me in his own way, tells me to stop before our parents come and see, to stop because it makes him feel worse.

I don't know what to do. He's never had any suicidal tendencies (other than the schiz stuff), he's never attempted or talked about it. I know if I tell my parents what he told me that he will never trust me again; he rarely talks anyways. But I am so scared of losing him because I love him so fucking much and I....I can't. I'm beating myself up for acting like a dick towards him all the time but that's just how my siblings and I (there's 6 of us) act towards each other. I gave him my iPad before (it broke), then my phone (he has it now), then my school laptop, etc. because that's the only thing that ever interests him.

I would never forgive myself if something happened to him because I didn't say anything but I will also never forgive myself if he never utters a word like that to me again because I say something.

I'm not your friend, I'm not your family who you can tease. I'm your goddamn co-worker. Shit should me mutual, yet you are all outright disrespecting me and treating me like shit. 

I struggle with standing up for myself sometimes. This has been due to me wanting to avoid conflict, and letting myself live without worrying about it. This has been a common theme since I was a child, it was hard expressing how I truly felt about things. I constantly suppressed my emotions until they blew all over the poor soul. My way of handing others who have wronged me is just detach myself and try to distance myself from everyone on purpose, giving me time to think for myself. I go as far as to think that the person responsible has no worth, that he/she practically does not exist to me. But I nevertheless have mental breakdowns and constantly feel like I'm crying, when I try not to in front of others.

Its noticable when I'm mad and depressed, but I try to brush it off. Worst part is when someone I knew in particular started asking me every 5 minutes if I was okay, oblivious to the fact that they caused it in the first place. And no this isnt a specific event, this is multiple events that slowly wear me down. This happens at my job that is filled with coworkers who like teasing. I legitimately have been told I look like the type to kill others, when clearly they fucking start it in the first place.

I hate how I act towards confrontations, because while I try to be aware that I should be more direct like how I usually am with other things, I cant help but to shut down and think to myself. I'm always told I daydream or I'm too slow at my job, yet expect me to fucking work normally while being teased about it. I DONT suck at my job, I just dont give a shit about some minimum wage job with a bunch of shitty coworkers.

I'm not sure if it's some mental illness that I have in which makes me prone to easily get hurt, or maybe I just suck at expressing how I feel often, but I feel like I'm constantly getting fucked with and my goals are less probable if I keep acting the way I do.

112,"Disclaimer: I am not trained in this field, a close family member is, so I have some insight after speaking to them, but if I am incorrect with anything here, please (kindly, if you will, as Reddit can be a brutal no man’s land) educate me! 

TL/DR: can people diagnosed with AntiSocial Personality Disorder/ASPD with Psychopathic Features love somebody else? Do they feel or experience “love” as people capable of empathy feel it? Or are family/friends/romantic partners treated more like materialistic possessions or inanimate objects in the mind and heart (referring to the emotional symbolism, obviously, since we don’t “feel” with our hearts) of those with ASPD? I’m asking those with ASPD how they experience love for others, and possible definitions/examples for those who professionally treat ASPD about how those they treat: “love”? Can they be taught through behavioral therapies to “pretend to care” to meet the emotional needs of those they profess to love? What are those therapies called? If the person with ASPD has been abusive in the past, can that behavior be stopped without the ability to experience empathy for their victims? Finally, is there books published for family members or those that love people with ASPD to accept the situation and deal with it appropriately? 

Long inquiry: 

I realize that often people with Psychopathic Features with AntiSocial Personality Disorder are often misdiagnosed or assumed to be “Sociopaths” due to their lack of empathy towards others. I understand that’s an incorrect diagnosis usually seen across social media as a presumption, much like “narcissism” is currently being tossed around flippantly by people who are not licensed, nor educated enough in psychiatry to be diagnosing *anyone*, especially Narcissistic Personality Disorder. It’s Psychopaths, not Sociopaths that truly lack empathy for others as I understand it. I also realize that psychopathy and sociopathy can be used interchangeably to describe AntiSocial Personality Disorder, under the DSM-5. However, when it comes to criminal profiling, their respective definitions become more defined. It is my understanding that one of the big differences is that sociopaths don’t care about other people’s feelings because they are often using them for financial or personal gain, so they don’t want to care as it would impede whatever physical/monetary gain they’re after. Whereas psychopaths *cannot* care about other people’s feelings because they are legitimately incapable of feeling empathy towards others, that they do not comprehend other people actually experience emotions, or to them it’s an abstract realization. They’re inherently selfish, but “using people” is often done over-all to meet all needs, and not just for financial gain for those with “psychopathic features”. They are not always violent — but unfortunately even muttering the term “psychopath” in proper company leads to presumptions a person might be homicidal or a serial killer. Plenty of people that have Psychopathic Features haven’t physically hurt anyone. Or they will occasionally physically harm someone in their immediate family, but it stops there, often with regret for the trouble they find *themselves in*, and doesn’t result in murder. That is not a justification, that is a statement for the status of those diagnosed *as I understand it*. Again, please correct me if I am wrong. Sometimes intelligent people with Psychopathic Features have a deep sense of morality and justice, even if they lack the emotional empathy that is often an impetus for said morality and justice for the general populace. 

I am asking Reddit so I may have an array of answers and opinions to help me understand my inquiry. That is: can people with AntiSocial Personality Disorder with Psychopathic Features, specifically those who absolutely lack any sense of empathy towards even the closest of family members’ feelings, experience “love”? Or what the average human being with a capacity for empathy experiences as “love”? 

If you have ASPD or have treated someone with it, can you explain to me what that “love” looks like/feels like to the person diagnosed? Can they actually experience feelings of love towards others, such as a spouse or children? Is it actual feelings that they understand as “love” due to what music/movie/books describe it as, or they feel when hearing/seeing/reading love stories? Or is it a feeling of ownership/entitlement to another person much like that individual is a *possession* of the person with ASPD rather than an independent human being with feelings of their own? Is it somewhere in between? Do they acknowledge their loved one’s emotions only when it benefits them? 

If you are curious for the reason for my inquiry and feel like reading a small novella today, I will go on. If you aren’t interested and just want to answer the questions I posed? Please do! Skip this part! Only continue if you’re curious! 

Backstory: we have a family member I’ll call “John” that is on the cusp of an AntiSocial Personality Disorder diagnosis. Obviously, the diagnosis is very serious and will only be made after further testing and appointments with his psychiatrist. It was initially considered as a possibility of John having Aspergers, as he fails to pick up on social cues or facial expressions, and does not react AT ALL to the pain — or joy — that he causes in others. He also doesn’t utilize mirroring in a social setting. He doesn’t pick up the emotional status of a room full of people (for instance the light-hearted and joy-filled group at a family reunion vs. the sadness and mourning of a group gathered at a funeral wake. Both groups are the same to him in terms of his own mirroring behavior, which is largely “anti social” anyway, so people rarely notice he isn’t mirroring social behavior like most people do). In the meantime, my daughter and I happened across a description that suits our John *perfectly*. It was described in (unfortunately) an FBI profile for an “unknown subject” that murdered three children. We only came across it due to a personal interest in all things true crime, and my daughter is a Criminal Justice Major, but here we are! We both had a jaw dropping moment of “OMG that’s John to a T!” Our family member hasn’t murdered anyone, nor do we believe he would, but the description/profile is unsettling and perfectly apropos: 

~ “Our killer is a psychopath. People that know this unsub know him as manipulative and self-serving. The only person he truly cares about is himself. He can present the appearance of caring relationships, but when push comes to shove, his needs will always come first. He will likely have very few friends, and the friends he does have will likely be for his own gain. He will NEVER sacrifice his own happiness for anyone, ever. This pattern of deeply-rooted selfishness will be apparent in all areas of this man’s life. While this unsub is manipulative and even charming, he has a dark side that anyone who has spent a lot of time with him has witnessed. Casual observers would describe him as a “nice guy”. He knows how to control and manipulate, but those close to him know that when things don’t go his way, he has and does resort to violence. He’ll also be good at convincing his victims that the violence was actually *their fault*. “They made him do it.” Women, children, it doesn’t matter to him. He’ll always justify his violence and never feel remorse for it. 

Somewhere in his life, possibly in military or law enforcement training, he has learned to block out distractions and danger in order to focus under pressure for his own self-preservation. People that know our unsub would recognize this characteristic in him. When everyone around him is freaking-out and panicking? He’s the one that is stoic and calm. This is partially due to his background and partially due to his psychopathic personality. Whatever is happening, if it doesn’t affect him directly? He literally doesn’t CARE. Now if it does affect him: he will have a plan. . .”~

Our John is the crowned King of Gaslighting. I’ve come to realize through careful observation recently that honesty is not important when he’s manipulating any given situation that he’s caused, to make himself a “victim”, and someone else the “bad guy”. John’s typically a very honest person, and it’s been distressing catching him in plenty of lies recently, only told in order to manipulate or control myself, his ex wife, or other family members. More importantly is the realization/epiphany that he’s very good at pretending he will care about our feelings (as an example) “next Wednesday, when *my stress* goes down.” I’ve spent hundreds of Wednesday’s with John, and my turn to be “cared about” never seems to come around. Sorta like Wimpy never pays for his hamburgers “next Tuesday” in the Popeye Cartoons. I took a self-imposed-break from John for a few years, which was critical for me to finally see him clearly, when we’re both not deeply mired in him manipulating me. Hence the reason I came to clearly see that he’s very good at pretending to care, or that John plans on caring about you “once my own stress goes down”. He uses this as camouflage in societal and familial relationships to appear to be like the rest of us, but with an excuse for why he can’t care *today*. I often wonder if he believes this himself? For instance does John tell himself “maybe when my stress level goes down, I can care about my wife/kids/siblings/coworker/friend next week?” but then he never does care, not realizing he literally can’t, but tells himself the situation has already resolved because the aforementioned people already reached out to people that have empathy to meet their emotional needs. How frustrating would that be? Wanting to care about someone, lying about it as a false promise you will “next Wednesday” and then never being quite able to feel anything about-or-for them at all? Sadly, John lost the love of his life because obviously he cannot and does not care about her feelings at all, nor does he consider them. In fact, he used the withholding of attention and affection to control her for many, many, years, telling her he would only hug her or care about her if she didn’t bother him with her “annoying” human emotions and needs. Hell, he even refused to sleep in the same bed with her, in case she dared to accidentally touch him when he was asleep. If for instance, she accidentally touched him with a toe when she was asleep, it would be met with swift and sometimes violent punishment for doing so. He told his wife that his sleep was more important than her’s, his work was more important than her’s, his peace, his time, his needs, that basically *every aspect of his life was more important than her’s*, and he treated her in the exact way to make sure that she understood that was truth. Naturally she could only tolerate so much of that rather cruel treatment and left, despite truly loving him. She stayed longer than she should for the sake of the kids, but the moment she realized it wasn’t good for the kids either, and John’s lack of caring was seriously hurting them, too? She left. Add to it the physical abuse was becoming more prolific and more violent. Sadly, a lot of people blamed her, or were harsh towards her, because she didn’t put John on blast all those years. To everyone else he seems like a very caring and “normal” sweet, husband. Only those close to the family on a regular basis could see what was really happening in their home. 

Some of their closest friends when staying over, had moments of grabbing a phone to call 911 when John’s wife accidentally touched him while he was asleep, as stated his response was terrifyingly loud, angry, and violent. His wife tried to leave, or threw him out numerous times before finally escaping (a normal domestic abuse trajectory, unfortunately). He would work his way back in employing the same manipulations. He promised he would finally show her he cared about her feelings. Would finally help her at home or with the kids. Would finally hug her every once in a while. . . And of course that lasted maybe a week, a month tops, each time. 

The important feature here outside of what is considered a ludicrous level of selfishness or in hip-lingo “narcissism”, is that John cannot and does not care when he is responsible for other people’s happiness, either. So it’s not like “only my feelings count so I don’t care if you’re upset because I was upset first/more.” Or John’s typical inability to feel empathy nor even pretend to feel empathy when he’s hurt other’s feelings. Nope. He literally does not, and cannot, enjoy when he’s done something strangely unselfish and kind. Like, actually thought about one of us when we weren’t around. Did something sweet like purchase a small little thing of his own accord, that a family member needs for say: their health. John has recently been committed to “change for the better, stop being abusive, and to be less selfish”. Just the simple act of buying something truly needed by someone else without being asked to do so, read: *thinking about them when they aren’t right in front of him* is a HUGE deal compared to his typical behavior. So he’s clearly trying! To him this is a huge change, and he’s frustrated it’s “not enough” for the people he wants in his life on a full time basis. But I feel sorry for him in such a way as you would feel sorry for anyone that truly cannot conceptualize, process, or react-to-without-excuses: somebody else’s feelings. Because he sometimes seems to experience his own joy, and more-so: sadness. 

John realized what he lost in his wife. She only recently became available, so he is doing everything he can to change and show that he cares for her, and their children. He’s not abusing her, yet. She knows without help, he will eventually. Meanwhile, there’s this huge stumbling block of inability to empathize or even enjoy the happiness he’s occasionally responsible for providing her. He went through a terrible bout of depression when she left and became even more anti-social than he normally is. He’s very intelligent and very high functioning, as stated, capable of manipulation and of camouflaging his inability to empathize with false promises that “he’ll care later. Just as soon as he can.”. However, he withdrew from all society, including family, for a few years there, depressed and lost without her. I believe he feels love, and sometimes I believe he only views her as “toy”. A toy he doesn’t want to share, and he gets ridiculously jealous if anyone else tries. A toy he only plays with when he feels like it. The rest of the time she’s expected to sit on the shelf with the rest of the Knick knacks, silently, and not bothering him. However, of course the reality is she’s a human being, and she was the social butterfly in that family. 

This pretending he’ll “care later” has eventually caused him a huge issue in his career, because they too noticed he isn’t ever going to care. It takes desire/care to insure his team at work completes tasks as required, and the “only pretending to care” eventually caught up to him. False promises caught up to him. I suspect the implementing of a female supervisor may have had something to do with that. She noticed he doesn’t care, as women will. He’s now facing a major career change. Yup, he is being fired from a job he held for nearly twenty years. 

John’s wife is at least opening up to the possibility to show her he’s changed, but I fear it’s not enough. She runs 100% on emotion (that’s probably what he finds so attractive in her, am I right? If he has none for anyone else, he has her do a lot of the “feeling” for him, or at least expressing it. Especially with their children) and she’s just done with his lack of it. As stated, John’s behavior was initially theorized to be Aspergers, as he cannot pick up on social cues, either. Eventually it came out through the observations of those of us that love him: it’s a lot bigger than a spectrum issue. It’s not that he can’t pick up social cues, then understand them once they’re explained to him. He literally cannot care about the cues at all! Albeit, he might suffer from both simultaneously, as he has other Aspergers-specific features: like obsessing on something for a period time. A music band. A television show. A genre of book. A blend of all three. Each of these obsessions last roughly 6 months - 2 years at a time. He buys everything he can about whatever he’s obsessing on at the moment. Also note: John has spent his life since childhood trying to express his love and/or feelings for others using music. He has one of the largest music collections I have ever seen. He dedicates music to people to tell them “this is what I think/feel about you.” I have seen him employ this recently with a close family friend who’s wife left him for his best friend. “This song is for you, Mike.” Naturally people are touched when anyone dedicates a song to them. He has relied on this to make him appear caring (and maybe he does care) for as long as I can recall. Naturally, this is less charming or sufficient in middle age as opposed to the teen years when expressing that you care about other people using music is quite charming. Now it’s sweet, but lacking. I have my own collection of “John’s songs” that tells me he “cares”. I noticed that he seems to care about certain people in his life, but refuses to interact with them socially. He’ll speak highly of people but when given the opportunity to spend time with them, he rejects the mere suggestion. Instead he plays music that reminds him of said-friend-or-family. If you don’t make the effort? He sure the hell won’t. Unfortunately for John, his wife didn’t “want another damn song” when she was elbows deep in dirty diapers, and school events, and family trips without him (he often abused everyone on family trips for not making it all about him, or what he wanted to do, or his comfort/sense of entitlement. So his wife started taking trips without him!) and she just wanted a hug. Or a break. Or for John to care that she was overwhelmed. She eventually came to understand it wasn’t a maturity issue. It wasn’t a simple selfishness issue, either. That it wasn’t “getting better” or he “might care in his 30’s”. Their twenties came to a close: nothing changed. Their 30’s came to an end: still nothing changed except to say it got worse for her. She knew by 40 that her husband wasn’t going to “grow up” or “care about her, maybe next Wednesday”. So God bless her, she left for her own safety &amp; sanity, and that of her kids, who were maturing enough themselves to start really hurting that dad did not care about them, their needs, or their happiness. Worse yet, he chose a favorite amongst their kids. Go figure, the one who required the least amount of “emotional investment” or parental “love”.  It broke the hearts of the others. Ok enough of story time, this is a really sad story. . . Let’s get down to the questions we have: 

Do people with this disorder feel love as people with empathy feel love? John says he “needs his wife and family back” but it’s not stated “because I love them”. In fact, the kids and the ex wife are all rather cautious at this point because the love isn’t expressed to outsiders, and it isn’t shown to them. She doesn’t believe he loves her, even if he says it to her often now. In fact, people close to them have warned her repeatedly “remember John is very good at winning you back! Once he has you back, it’s same John, different year.” Due to his efforts recently, and coming out of his self-imposed, anti-social turtle shell, we’re ALL now realizing what the problem is. Hat’s off to his ex wife, she’s the one asking the right questions — and using his willingness to do *anything* to win her back to actually get him help. Her efforts are altruistic, after-all she greatly encourages a healthy relationship between John and his children. For all his talk of “love”, he still can’t show her, and now, finally, she sees it’s because he’s not capable. She got a bunch of new songs dedicated to her, but obviously that does not a stable marriage make, and bravo to her for saying “thanks, but not enough. Psychiatry. Now.” Another warning given to her as sage advice from her BFF “Yeah he’s all ‘Team John &amp; Jane’ when he needs you, and needs your support! But whenever you need him? He blows you off. Goes to bed and tells you not to bother him because remember his sleep is more important than you are! And you’re left hurting, alone, and depending on your family and friends to offer you comfort and support.” John heard this and admitted that it’s true, he also promised that would change. Can people with ASPD actually get to a point of faking/pretending or caring about someone they say they “love” through practice, in private situations or the family home, away from what the public at large sees? If they’re actually incapable of caring, can they learn to pretend enough so that the people they deem important in their lives: stay, or feel at least somewhat loved or cared about? Even if they know he’s not truly capable, can the behavior be taught to make them feel cared about? 

Is there a type of behavioral therapy they can receive to at least respond to someone’s feelings? Or to partially fulfill the emotional needs of their spouse/family? Would it be a Herculean effort that would require a lot of practice to implement? Can a behavior be taught to people with ASPD, even if the emotion that typically instigates that caring behavior isn’t present? What about the abuse? Is anger management dependent on a person having empathy for their victim? What if he has no empathy — how will that work? How about John’s wife? Is there a behavior therapy she can employ to accept that he “loves” her but is literally unable to care about her feelings at all? At what point can she trust that the inherent abuse won’t manifest again? Should she trust that at all? I care about them both, but I cannot get behind her being abused again. The children aren’t physically abused by John. They’re not mentally abused, either, he’s rather calm and encouraging of them, especially in promoting and teaching the arts and pop culture. Their pain is largely based in the abuse of neglect and the withholding of affection. John will flat out ignore his children while he’s busy trying to win back their mom. That frustrates everyone, and of course, hurts the kids. 

Has there been books published on this topic, for those that have ASPD and for those that love people with the disorder? If so, can you provide a link or title/author for one that is actually helpful? Thanks in advance! ",03Nov2018,1
113,"A little background info, I started taking Celexa for my anxiety and depression about a week ago. Everything has been getting better until it’s not. I’ve noticed my anxiety has decreased significantly as well as my depression, up until the other day. Some of my triggers have popped up this week and it hasn’t really hit me until now. I’ve been uber depressed and just keep sleeping to avoid everyone and everything, including my thoughts for the past few days. I try to tell myself everything is going to be okay and it’ll pass but that’s not working. Not sure if I’m looking for advice or just need to vent this out but hopefully I’ll feel better about getting this out in the open. 

I’m currently going through legal issues and it’s a pretty big deal, I can’t stress this enough that it’s always on my mind and something I’m constantly thinking about, whether or not I’m going to jail or just get a few years of probation (multi-drug related). Money is constantly reminding me that I’m a failure and the only thing I can think about are the ways I can get myself out of debit and securely on my feet without the help of my parents, I feel that I’m 21 and I should have my shit together by now. I hate being alone, I miss living with my friends and being around people all the time. I know it’s good to be alone for a while, I’ve gotten used to it over this year, but it’s always coming back to me of how much I don’t like being/living by myself anymore and I can’t change this right now. I want to be tied down with someone who I love and guys in my town aren’t about that, I’m tired of the pointless and anonymous sex and I want something real.

115,"I know that the majority of people on here have real mental health problems like myself. I've been an advocate for mental health awareness for as long as I can remember. It's something that I take seriously because not only has it affected my life but i see a lot of my good friends struggle as well.

Most of you guys share your real problems but every once in awhile I feel like there are 100% trolls on here. I never call anybody out because I don't wanna be that guy that ends up being wrong and someone actually is thinking about killing themselves but once in awhile I see these posts that are too crazy for me to think they're true. I wish I could recall one post specifically but I just remember a few times thinking ""this person has to be trolling"". That's not something I say very often because I have mental illness and I take it seriously because I know what it does. But a few people have seemed very suspect in things they say in their post.

If there are people on here that are posting fake stories for whatever reason i want you to take a long look in the mirror. Suicide is not a joke. Mental health is not a joke. You're the reason that people like us are told we're just being drama queens or we're making it up or to ""suck it up"". As if there is an on/off switch we can press at any moment to make our mental illness go away. I was always made to feel like the crazy person because i wasn't ""normal"" by society's standards.
