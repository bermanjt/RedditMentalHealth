I'm 21 now and i've been struggling with depressive episodes since i've been 14 or 15. Nothing extreme, but sucked nevertheless. After some time in therapy my therapist diagnoes me with ocd. Once again, nothing extreme.

i coped with it and when i was 17 i was feeling better. The joy of finally growing up and out of this ""childish,depressive state"" filled my heart and i was full of energy to get things done. Last year, when i was 20, i started to get this strange depresing feeling of forgetting who i am or what my motivations in life were. I lost all appetite and lost about 15kg until now i'm struggling with insomnia to a point where i'd consider it luck to fall asleep before 6am. 

I don't know if it's *just* because i'm tired or because of something else but almost ever aspect of every day life started to feel like an impossible task.. it feels like now something like just doing the dishes is more tiring than a 12 hour workday was just years ago. 

Even though my loving, and in every way perfect girlfriend tells me how much she loves me every day i feel like everyone around me would hate me, or try to ""trick"" me into something. I know for a fact that thats not true but it doesn't matter. 
It feels like my thought ""come from another person"", for lack of a better phrase.. like i have no authority about my brain and anything that goes on in it. My mind feels like a haze lately and this worries me.
Any ideas whats wrong?

I hope this is the right place to post this to, much love",20Oct2018,1

2,"I‚Äôve been having mood swings recently where I think that our world is better off destroyed and everything on it (not me doing it). I just had one, I feel like everyone is against me and will betray me. I feel like every human has bad intentions and are greedy, selfish, liars, money driven, etc. I think that this is because I‚Äôm currently growing up with none trying to talk to me. That, and I feel like if the world is destroyed, none would have to expect too much from me (I feel as though I‚Äôm pressured to do my best or I‚Äôll fail or let others down). I‚Äôm too scared to open up (especially about this) since I feel like I‚Äôd sound like a psychopath. Is this normal? This time it was different though, since I started crying out of nowhere and thinking of how ‚Äúif the world blew up, I could stay in my favorite place, outer space,‚Äù and how ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt have to be controlled by others I hate anymore.‚Äù Also, related to the crying, I also start laughing whilst I cry.",20Oct2018,1

4,"Hey guys I'm new on Reddit and a 24 Year Old male and have been going through rough depression since 2011. I was on 4 different medications for depression and anxiety and I was prescribed pills that stabilized my mood. The medications were Paxil, Trazadone, Gabapentin, and Ziprasidone. I've roughly been on those medications since 2011 when I was hospitalized 3 times over the course of 2011 for depression and haven't been back since. Recently around the month of August I suffered a bad TIA like stroke where my dad and I went to the movies *on his birthday* and my mouth was drooping and I thought I was honestly going to die. I seen a new therapist because we had missed a previous appointment and we were about to be kicked from the office and went with a new therapist and he prescribed me some new medicine called ""Rhisperidone"" and he took me all off the rest of the 4 pills and it made me feel worse and zombie like. I felt super bad as we were about to see a movie for his birthday with my dad with him and my brother and immediately had to go to the hospital for these symptoms and man was it a depressing birthday. It hasn't been easier on my parents and myself and brother since they divorced around last year and have been together for 20 plus years. So I stopped taking those and just continued taking the Paxil but haven't been taking it as of late and when I go to bed I have very vivid dreams and wake up more depressed and sweaty/hot. Needless to say even though those pills gave me multiple TIA Seizures I was at least able to have a manageable sleep schedule and not sleep all day and felt good about myself but it was my fault entirely for not taking them causing me to have the stroke mentioned in August. Now I'm currently not on any medications and my mom wants to go with the medical marijuana route but not taking any pills at all has made me very lethargic and exhausted and makes me not wanna do anything and if I pull an all nighter and finally sleep I become knocked out for 16 hours or more and wake up depressed with vivid and scary dreamsüò≠üò≠. I'm not entirely sure what's going on and it seems that nobody can help me but I'm always feeling so lethargic and defeated, I only work two short 8 hour days on weekends and off the rest of the week, But it's so bad somedays that I actually have to bang out sick and can't manage two days. I apologize this post is so long but I really need help and don't know what to do or where to turn to as to why I'm always lifeless and tired?",20Oct2018,1
5,"It's autumn, days are getting very short and I'm home alone for the first time in a very long time. I have midterms (but no exams, only essays to turn in) and I'm very anxious about it. And my levels of anxiety are so high that they trigger my depression even harder and thus I hadn't left the house for 3 days straight, didn't eat properly and stayed up the whole night and slept until noon. And did absolutely nothing while I was awake. Until today. 

&amp;#x200B;

First day, SO left and I didn't really do anything but help them pack their stuff and after they left, I did absolutely nothing, played games on my phone and napped. Felt how I was anxious about them leaving and being alone. Sort of knew the cycle was about to begin but ignored it. I usually break the cycle by making plans ahead (I hate to ""betray the plan"") and that always works. (Ha ha, using my anxiety both against me and with me). But this time I ignored my growing symptoms and didn't make a plan and thus, they cycle began. And it is a great deal of pain in the nether regions to break out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been spending the nights constantly checking if the door is locked, if everything is turned off that should be turned off and also checking my mail to see if I'm forgetting about something important. That is a by-product of me not making my list. I think I must have forgotten something or messed something up.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been spending the days doing absolutely nothing, then getting mad at myself for not doing anything, then get anxious because I didn't do anything and then fall deeper in depression and questioning my self-worth, my intelligence. I suffer from impostor-syndrome as well. So. Last night (like, at 4 in the morning). I made a promise to myself. To leave the house today. It didn't have to be much. I knew I had a package at the post office but I wasn't in a hurry to get it. But I decided that it would be my task of the day.   


So today, I was in my pyjamas and still in bed until 14:00, then I decided it was time to leave. Made lunch, took a shower, and walked to the bus-stop to go to the post office. Once I got there I felt *ecstatic* about it. The weather was nice, I was glad that I got dressed so I decided, since I already was out of the house to visit a relative that lives nearby the post office. They were happy to see me and we had a nice half an hour of chat. Then I had to catch the next bus home so I left. Thinking I'd be so productive and spend the rest of the day and work on my essays. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once I got home I fell in the cycle a bit. But I made dinner, and made sure to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. (Which means I have made a plan for tomorrow: eat leftovers). And now it's 2 in the morning, and I actually got some, not much, but a little work done, in one essay, and have a vague idea of how to finish it tomorrow, which means a task has been added to my list.   


I know my lists might seem a bit too much, but they are my anchor to a functional life. They are never too detailed, and they often include silly things like ""wear lipstick"" or ""take the trash out"" and even, sometimes ""chill and enjoy"". Keeps me occupied which means I am less depressed, and they also are my tool of managing around my anxiety, to make sure I don't forget something and make sure I have enough time to finish ""big-deal"" tasks like writing essays and help my stay focused on my tasks and goals.  


I'm also thinking if I should put ""goals"" on my lists. Maybe make one goal for each week or month, depending on how I feel, and every day make one goal for the day, like ""managing my anxiety better"" or ""eat properly"". I think it would help with self-reflecting and making reasonable assumptions about myself, to help with my distorted self-esteem.

6,"recently I've been hit with the quick one two mental health issues and I really think I'm not gonna be able to go on. I don't have it in me to make this all professional and whatever, but here's what's up

-hallucinations
sometimes I hear someone speak to me clear as day about what I'm doing or talking about, but there is nobody there to say that.
I have tinnitus but no ear problems according to  doc so that's weird and I'm wondering if that's a symptom or not
I see movement or figures out of the corner of my eyes that I feel compelled to look at
I saw a picture move and talk about me to the other person in it when I was younger

(Probably should add that this is all over a long period of time but it's ramped up recently)

I saw a face in the door reflection but turned around to find nobody
Bugs on skin

-delusions
(Keep in mind that I'm usually able to tell these are delusions but it's still really hard to shake the feeling that it's true while in the moment)

I sometimes feel someone I love has been abducted and replaced by an imposter
I sometimes feel like someone in my family has turned against me or has killed someone else in my family
I feel like im like a ""superior mind"" sometimes and am seeing the world as it really is
I sometimes have this image of a campfire scene where I murdered somebody and feel this is my punishment
I saw a shadow man in my room and I thought he was communicating through clicks and didn't want me to talk to anyone about this
someones in my head talking to me about my day to day
I sometimes feel even when all calls are ended and camera off that I'm secretly being streamed to the world
I sometimes believe nobody likes me and they're all just laughing about pretending to be my friend

7,"Wasn't sure where to post this. I've been at college for about 2 months now, and I love it and it really does feel like my home. However, sometimes when I'm just lounging around in my room, and a situation arises where I would have to leave (to go to the bathroom, fill up my water bottle, etc) i find myself having severe anxiety. I'll change my shirt 3 times even though I'm in my pajamas, brush my hair, and I'll keep looking through the peep hole in my door to make sure nobody else will be in the hallway when i go out. It just took me two and a half hours to get the courage to go to the bathroom. I know I'm being stupid, but I cant help it. I don't know why I feel this way. I can get up and go to class just fine, so why does it bother me so much just to go to the bathroom? Am I ignoring a bigger problem? This isn't normal. Sorry if this is long or rambley. I'm just feeling a bit confused right now. I'm not sure what to do about this.",20Oct2018,1
8,"Have you ever actually thought about how well you‚Äôre doing or could be doing in life? No matter what, your family will give you unconditional love and support, and you should always consider that a blessing because some people don‚Äôt even have that, but you can‚Äôt depend on them to push you and allow you to grow. You of course have to do that yourself.

I‚Äôve always been socially awkward, shy and not only cared, but I‚Äôve been afraid of what other people may think of me. That‚Äôs always been the core of my weakness: my own thoughts. My inhibitions and insecurities. But I don‚Äôt want to be afraid anymore. I don‚Äôt want to mentally be stuck in a mid-teens‚Äô state-of-mind. I don‚Äôt want to have negative thoughts about what I should‚Äôve done or how I should‚Äôve done things in the past. It‚Äôs good to acknowledge your faults and imperfections, but I‚Äôve always let that kind of thinking in the past get in the way of me. It feels like I trapped myself inside a room and the door is locked and I need to find a key ‚Äòin a large room with no light‚Äô to unlock my inhibitions. I think I have finally found that key.

The key is simple: fear. Let fear go and actually think about how other people may view you. Not specific people, but in general.

And so I had this thought a while back. If I were another guy, just some other man, and met myself who I am today, I would not respect me. I just wouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd say to myself, ‚Äúthey guy is nice and means well, but he‚Äôs not a risk taker. He‚Äôs weak and a procrastinator. Also not very masculine‚Äù.

If I were a woman (I know that sounds weird), I wouldn‚Äôt want to go near me. Maybe polite conversation, but I wouldn‚Äôt view me as a potential guy to date. 

So with that in mind, and starting with those thoughts, puts me in a mixed mood. Bit sad, but mostly motivated and determined to improve myself and simply just stop being a degenerate f@qq√∏t. Be greater.

10,"Hi. I don't know who to talk to. And right now I'm on a trip and can't immediately talk with anyone. 

I have been experiencing serious 'loud' thoughts as of late, possibly triggering when highly stressed. The first time that it really made me think something new was happening. Multiple people wanted my time, family and friends, and I chose the friends. Family wasn't happy and I got an earful from the parents for not prioritizing correctly. I'm 30. I felt as if I were still a child being chastised by my mom and couldn't talk for a good day without crying. Trying to sleep had to be accompanied by a beer and some Netflix as I drifted off, drowning out the medium volume of my wandering and self-deprecating thoughts.

Last night was a big one and the reason I'm writing it down. I had planned a big trip, camping and such, and was on my first night, set up, fed, and getting ready to sleep. Laying in my camp bed, the volume of that incessant voice got louder and louder, and faster and faster. Finally, it reached the a level I couldn't ignore. I drove to a hotel and proceeded to have in and out bouts of crying. Couldn't talk without breaking into a new set of tears. 

Today, after a fitful night, I attempted different methods of calming down. To prevent a new set of oncoming tears, I was working on breathing, in and out, with intermittent holds. When that wasn't working, I turned off my music and listened to an audiobook. But when it came time to talk with people, I was still a wavering, weepy mess. 

What I'm curious about, is in your medical or personal opinion, I have anxiety? I'm pretty sure I do, I guess I just wanted to tell someone who didn't know me, and wasn't face to face. I'm having issues speaking whats wrong without keeping my eyes from leaking tears. 

ALSO, do you have any tips and tricks to keep those negative and loud thoughts from taking over? The audiobooks help, but I can't constantly be plugged in, you know?

Thanks for any help you can give!",20Oct2018,1

15,"I know that intrusive thoughts - to a degree - are normal but I'm not sure if what I am expericing is normal.

A bit of background: September 2017 my dad had a heart attack. It was sudden and serious but he survived. One of his older brothers died of a heart attack in 2011 so it was very scary. 3 months later his other older brother had a heart attack and a stroke, had the whole left side of his body paralyzed and died after 2 weeks. 3 months after that his mom, my grandma died. She was very old, she died in her sleep. In 2011 and 2015 both of my grandparets on my moms side died. My grandma (moms mom) died of a sudden heart attack. My grandma (moms dad) died a slow death of dementia related complications.

I wasn't super close to any of these family members other than my moms parents but I was 'over it' and had accepted it. My dads heart attack is what scared me the most.

I am **terrified** of losing him. I probably have 3-5 thoughts a day thinking about what his funeral would be like, what my family members would say, how I would get married without him there. I started having these thoughts of my sister (my best friend, basically my mom, the person I have the closest relationship to in the whole world) now too. I think about if she died about the funeral, how I would take care of my niece etc...

I DO NOT want to think this! It is so upsetting. Tomorrow my dad is driving a friend to the airport and my first thought was 'what if he dies on the way there and no one is there to help him'. These thoughts are getting more and more stressful. I don't know if this is a normal reaction to death (as I never really dealt with death before except in these past few years) or if I need to seek help over it?

Thank you for reading this I truly appreciate it,

I've never had any real friends, they've all used me for money, or possessions, ever since the second grade, when they would come by for lunch, or to steal my Yu-Gi-Oh cards, I was a reject, an outcast, I contemplated suicide, harmed myself, abused harder and harder drugs. At 15 I lost my first love to suicide, I haven't been right ever since. For years I rejected women and relationships, and any interest I would take would use me for gifts and money and leave like a parasite when it ran dry. For a time I was happy, I was succeeding, but I fell into despair and loneliness, I started severely abusing cocaine, shooting up, and smoking crack. When I graduated, I put the needle down, found a girlfriend, and thought I had it good, but she used me for drugs, and got me to start smoking crack again, and got me into heroin, when my heroin habit got so bad, that I went back to the needles, she used it as an excuse to leave me.

I've been clean from heroin and cocaine for three months, but every day is hell, the memory of her haunts my mind, she's killing me from the inside out.

It's a long story, but my childhood was filled with extremely traumatic experiences with therapists. I'm not going to go into it....but I was adopted by white people with white savior complexes. I had a few issues when I was young. Looking back on it, they were pretty normal childhood issues, but my parents blamed everything and anything on adoption when they weren't saying that I just needed to find God. They took me to horrible therapists that traumatized me, and when I was older, traumatized by those experiences with therapists, I was sent to a residential treatment center for troubled teens in Utah (check out /r/troubledteens) that was incredibly abusive. Seriously, it fucked with my mind. It really, really did. That was the middle of high school then, and when I got out, I was seriously fucked up. Before, I was a good student. After, I was almost expelled on a number of occasions. Before, I didn't even know what self harm was. After, I had an eating disorder, multiple suicide attempts, and a lot more. 

I somehow managed to get myself to college, even after all that shit. I was a lot better after going off to college. A lot of my problems just disappeared - the eating disorder, suicidal thoughts, and all that. For five years, I wasn't depressed at all. Sure, I had my bad times - sometimes, really bad times. But I knew after having experienced ""real"" depression that I wasn't ever depressed. 

Now I have graduated college, and have pretty much settled into working life. I have a good job that I enjoy, and a comfortable apartment. 

But I don't have any friends. I feel like I can't make any friends. It's impossible. Whenever I get into a new place - whether it's college, my job, really anywhere - I'm always that odd one out that people just don't want to become friends with. I'm not socially awkward. People enjoy talking to me. But it's like I have this giant wall up, and I can't even pinpoint when I use it. I don't even know what it would mean to ""break down your wall"" or any of that. I have never been in a relationship. I have never even come close. I don't mean to brag or anything, but I'm an attractive person, relatively. But no one asks me out. I rarely put myself in positions where people would even ask me out. I don't know...I just don't know how to make close friends. Part of it is that when I look for friends, I look for really good friends - I'm someone that has a few really good friends rather than a lot of friends. But I just can't make friends! I can't make friends who I can ask for support when I need it. 

It's gotten to a point where I'm so closed off and I can't trust anyone that when someone does show that they care about me, I put everything onto them, and I totally fuck it up. 

I can't relate to anyone anywhere - at work, in any social group - because I have such a weird life. I feel like so much of my life is defined by the two years I spent in that hell hole residential treatment center, where we were abused so badly, but no one would ever understand it. No one would ever understand the way our minds were brainwashed and we were abused, but we truly believed that it was okay and we deserved it. No one believes that those kinds of places even exist. 

Since I left there, I was in survival mode. I got myself to college, through college, and now I'm not in survival mode anymore. I have a comfortable job and a place, and so I don't know what life is all about now. What's the point of life when I'm not trying to survive?

I need friends desperately. I don't think anyone is as lonely as I am. Even really lonely people have parents or friends. I don't talk to my parents (please don't tell me to - there is so much I'm leaving out here, but they were so abusive in some ways, I can't). I don't have a single friend to really talk to about what I'm struggling with, only my struggles with stupid everyday things. I want a family or a husband so I can have that support - that built in support that only family brings, but I can't imagine getting that when I can't even make friends. 

But to make friends, I need to get out of this funk where when I start to trust someone, I end up obsessing and putting everything on them because I'm so relieved to have someone to trust. Because of that, I don't trust. It's not that I can just decide to trust - I don't know what that means! I don't know what it means to get to that point. So much of interactions in day to day life are smalltalk. 

What is wrong with me? I have been depressed before, and so I know that I am not depressed like I was. On a day to day, I enjoy my life. I look forward to the next day, to things that are going to happen in a few months and where my job may go in a year or so. By all means, I like my life. But I have a sense of hopelessness for the long-term future. How long can I keep this up, all alone? I don't see any escape from this loneliness, and it's not in my head - this has been going on for years, and so all evidence points to that it will keep on going in this direction. I don't want to kill myself now, but I don't like living. I'm not enjoying where my life is heading, and don't know what I'm living for. 

I seriously do not know anyone as lonely as me. People say they are lonely, but they have people. I have no one, and there is no one in sight.

And after all that trauma with therapists, I can't see a therapist. I know that you may have had really nice therapists, and that not all therapists are like the ones that have traumatized me all my life....but I just can't. Maybe part of what I need therapy for is therapy...so many Catch 22s in my life. (Like...I need friends, but I need to have support/friends/family to give me the confidence with which to bring to relationships.)",20Oct2018,1
19,"Hey guys, i really just want to get this off my chest. I have been diagnosed with multiple disorders (ADHD, SA, OCD, BDD) And i have been constantly thinking about this girl that went to my school last year. This girl was showing me lots of interest in me, and the final look that she gave me is the one that got to me the most. One day while walking home, I saw her and her boyfriend kissing right in front of me, this made me extremely mad and sad at the same time. So then summer break starts, she pops up in my mind once in a while, but then goes away. But when this school year started, my mind went into this insane state where my mind was consumed by fantasies and dreams about her, I was going through periods of depression, extreme anger, and crying, and immense energy without caffeine, knowing that I will never see her again because she graduated. I know it sounds like infatuation, but the emotions I felt are too much for an infatuation, it was almost like a lost a loved one. I have always suspected that I might also have a personality disorder like BPD  or a mood disorder like bipolar. I am now in this mindset where I seemingly am trying to let go, but always get back to thinking about her. Now, don't label as a stalker, I would never do such a thing, in fact, i would never even harm an animal, so don't get the wrong vibe, I just really want to know what I should do besides going to the therapist. Her last look was attraction to me, but it was such a look where she seemed sad too, and this really got to me, and that's what fucked me up the most, knowing that a loser with social anxiety, can't approach any girl.",20Oct2018,1
20,"I would like to ask about how others with schizophrenia cope with auditory hallucinations. 

For years I've had them, but I've recently started spending most of my time alone or at work. Until now, it hasn't been much of a problem. But its starting to annoy me greatly. Ill be home alone and hear my roommate call my name, or at work and the same will happen. It'll always either sound far off, or sometimes sounding like a very quiet voice right next to me. Sometimes ill hear someone start talking to me from another room or across the store at work, but its not real. 

I can only tell the difference by asking somebody if they or somebody called my name or started talking to me, or by situational awareness (where I am, who's around, am I alone or not. A little checklist). its not so much of a problem, I'm a pretty calm guy even when it happens, its just annoying to the point that if I don't build some kind of coping mechanism, it'll start to affect my general mental health negatively. I've never been to a doctor for it (it hasn't started to be something i take seriously until recently), and therapy or anything like that arent options I can afford. Maybe in the future I will. But for now, i have The Wonderful World of Reddit. 

I do also have concerns on how I can effectively get through to my boyfriend what is going on in my head. Its not easy to explain, or I would have by now. And also how it could potentially affect our relationship on the long run, but that's not my concern now. Hes very understanding, its not going to negatively affect our relationship in any way I can foresee. I just don't know how I can really get it across to somebody who doesn't actually experience it. 

I appreciate any insight y'all may have. ",20Oct2018,1
21,"I really don't know what is wrong with me, and I need some kind of help. I don't think that it is professional help, but I would appreciate any input. This is one of those wall-of-text posts. I appreciate anyone who can get through it with all my heart.
It's a long story, but my childhood was filled with extremely traumatic experiences with therapists. I'm not going to go into it....but I was adopted by white people with white savior complexes. I had a few issues when I was young. Looking back on it, they were pretty normal childhood issues, but my parents blamed everything and anything on adoption when they weren't saying that I just needed to find God. They took me to horrible therapists that traumatized me, and when I was older, traumatized by those experiences with therapists, I was sent to a residential treatment center for troubled teens in Utah (check out /r/troubledteens) that was incredibly abusive. Seriously, it fucked with my mind. It really, really did. That was the middle of high school then, and when I got out, I was seriously fucked up. Before, I was a good student. After, I was almost expelled on a number of occasions. Before, I didn't even know what self harm was. After, I had an eating disorder, multiple suicide attempts, and a lot more.
I somehow managed to get myself to college, even after all that shit. I was a lot better after going off to college. A lot of my problems just disappeared - the eating disorder, suicidal thoughts, and all that. For five years, I wasn't depressed at all. Sure, I had my bad times - sometimes, really bad times. But I knew after having experienced ""real"" depression that I wasn't ever depressed.
Now I have graduated college, and have pretty much settled into working life. I have a good job that I enjoy, and a comfortable apartment.
But I don't have any friends. I feel like I can't make any friends. It's impossible. Whenever I get into a new place - whether it's college, my job, really anywhere - I'm always that odd one out that people just don't want to become friends with. I'm not socially awkward. People enjoy talking to me. But it's like I have this giant wall up, and I can't even pinpoint when I use it. I don't even know what it would mean to ""break down your wall"" or any of that. I have never been in a relationship. I have never even come close. I don't mean to brag or anything, but I'm an attractive person, relatively. But no one asks me out. I rarely put myself in positions where people would even ask me out. I don't know...I just don't know how to make close friends. Part of it is that when I look for friends, I look for really good friends - I'm someone that has a few really good friends rather than a lot of friends. But I just can't make friends! I can't make friends who I can ask for support when I need it.
It's gotten to a point where I'm so closed off and I can't trust anyone that when someone does show that they care about me, I put everything onto them, and I totally fuck it up.
I can't relate to anyone anywhere - at work, in any social group - because I have such a weird life. I feel like so much of my life is defined by the two years I spent in that hell hole residential treatment center, where we were abused so badly, but no one would ever understand it. No one would ever understand the way our minds were brainwashed and we were abused, but we truly believed that it was okay and we deserved it. No one believes that those kinds of places even exist.
Since I left there, I was in survival mode. I got myself to college, through college, and now I'm not in survival mode anymore. I have a comfortable job and a place, and so I don't know what life is all about now. What's the point of life when I'm not trying to survive?
I need friends desperately. I don't think anyone is as lonely as I am. Even really lonely people have parents or friends. I don't talk to my parents (please don't tell me to - there is so much I'm leaving out here, but they were so abusive in some ways, I can't). I don't have a single friend to really talk to about what I'm struggling with, only my struggles with stupid everyday things. I want a family or a husband so I can have that support - that built in support that only family brings, but I can't imagine getting that when I can't even make friends.
But to make friends, I need to get out of this funk where when I start to trust someone, I end up obsessing and putting everything on them because I'm so relieved to have someone to trust. Because of that, I don't trust. It's not that I can just decide to trust - I don't know what that means! I don't know what it means to get to that point. So much of interactions in day to day life are smalltalk.
What is wrong with me? I have been depressed before, and so I know that I am not depressed like I was. On a day to day, I enjoy my life. I look forward to the next day, to things that are going to happen in a few months and where my job may go in a year or so. By all means, I like my life. But I have a sense of hopelessness for the long-term future. How long can I keep this up, all alone? I don't see any escape from this loneliness, and it's not in my head - this has been going on for years, and so all evidence points to that it will keep on going in this direction. I don't want to kill myself now, but I don't like living. I'm not enjoying where my life is heading, and don't know what I'm living for.
I seriously do not know anyone as lonely as me. People say they are lonely, but they have people. I have no one, and there is no one in sight.
And after all that trauma with therapists, I can't see a therapist. I know that you may have had really nice therapists, and that not all therapists are like the ones that have traumatized me all my life....but I just can't. Maybe part of what I need therapy for is therapy...so many Catch 22s in my life. (Like...I need friends, but I need to have support/friends/family to give me the confidence with which to bring to relationships.)",20Oct2018,1
22,"I'm a 21 yr old guy. I've gone through multiple therapists since middle school because finding someone I could trust/like has been difficult. I've been seeing my current therapist for a little over year and there's some trust between us, and because of it, I want to bring something up with her I've been experiencing for years but it's something that really terrifies me and I've never shared with anyone: that sometimes, I look at the people around me (my family) and I don't recognize them, my mind flags them as ""fake."" It happens to myself, sometimes, too, when I look in the mirror. It's a brief thought and I get over it quickly but it's terrifying.

I hoped by waiting longer than most to discontinue I would see some long term improvement, but that never happened. What gives?

25,"I'm sorry for the confusing title. I was about to go to sleep and decided I'd rather write it now than after sleep, when it might go away, and I'll feel so vastly different then that I'd probably ignore writing about it again and ignore the problem.

For my mental health, I'm epileptic for close to 15 years now. Two years ago I went to a psychiatrist to seek therapy for, what I assumed was depression. The therapy didn't help much, I got some medication and was told I might have a bipolar disorder. Maybe. Kinda. He didn't know and kept asking me to come for more therapy sessions that seemingly didn't help, but did cost more money, and somehow he didn't want me to visit through my healthcare, only privately.

I stopped at one point, but I also found new work and felt a bit better thanks to medication he gave me, that apparently helps keep endorphins in my brain for a bit longer. I still had problems where I needed a lot of sleep (I might have sleep apnea? Maybe? I sometimes slept a whole night and took a power nap instead of a lunch break at work, drinking a ton of coffee on top, and was still tired).

Recently I lost my job with no reason. I was a great worker and everyone was shocked, with me getting only 4 days of notice that this would be my last payment etc. And for a while I somehow.kanaged mentally, stocking to the meds on my own and just working to make ends meet.

But for years now I had these weird outbursts of pure anger. Now they come up more often than ever. It feels as if something is grabbing my heart, I feel this pressure on it, all the time. I feel pure anger, I could scream, I can't even write to my gf I love her, I tell her bad things, I'm negative and worthless, nothing makes me feel better, I don't know why this happens or what stops it. I don't know what to do. I feel pure hatred for no reason, I would attack anyone, but oh boy so I wish someone told me something that I could get angry about so I could throw it all at them. I feel it now, I feel this pressure that blocks me from sleeping, in the past I lost a lot of people around me due to them thinking I was an asshole, it took me so long with the help of my gf to gain some.of their trust back, she tries to take my bad days into herself, but I want to know why they are happening more often, what can it be. Does anyone here feel it too? I sleep too much, I have a huge imposter syndrome, I lose motivation on bad days and yet, with all of this, I still feel like myself, like I could work and fix it. But once this something grabs my heart and I once again have this hatred, nothing makes sense, I don't see a way out, I don't care, I just get angry about trivial things and fight myself to not jump onto someone randomly and call them names, do whatever, anything just to somehow maybe feel a bit better.

Please help me. I lost my health insurance, I'm looking for work to get it back, but for now I just lost all hope and I at least want to know what this sub might think, if there's someone like me, if there is a way out of this craziness.",20Oct2018,1
26,So I've been noticing lately that from time to time I feel like I could just burst out into tears for no apparent reason. Things that normally wouldn't emotional bother me that much make me feel like I'm dying to cry. For example I hate driving with my dad because I'm still learning and he acts like a dick. Multiple times throughout every car ride with him my eyes start watering up and I feel like I'm going to start crying. What makes it worse is my eyes watering makes the road less visible which increases my anxiety and only makes it worse. ,20Oct2018,1

The second one was winter before when my dad was driving and i saw a very pale.. possibly faceless man in the middle of the road, and started yelling and grabbing onto my dad becuase i thought he was going to hit him... and then he just vanished,
And other small ones through my life of waking up and seeing something for a second, shadowy figure or such.
I just have concerns about it becuase ive questioned if i could possibly be bipolar since i was in a very... well my friends even described it as a manic state when i had heard that scream, and i am only able to talk to one friend about it becuase when i tried to talk to my other friend he called me crazy. 
But even talking to my best friend about it (the friend i called the night i heard the scream) shes so good about it becuase shes helped take care of her schizophrenic aunt, and while i accept possibly being bipolar, im terrified of possibly getting diagnosed schizophrenic, especially while working towards getting a gov job that im banking on to pay for college.

34,"So I'm in a bad situation right now, I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for months, including a suicide attempt 3 months ago. I spoke up to my friends about it and I'm still alive with a sole promise to get myself back on track.


I'm still in the process of trying to get myself back together, but my poor mental health and academics makes it difficult for me to get my back to where I am.


&amp;nbsp;


To give a background of myself: I'm an 18 year old with Aspergers from the Philippines and currently studying in grade 9.


The reason why the title says something about academics, I've been trying so hard (Even up until now) with my situation to get out of high school as most of my friends are already in college or in senior high while I'm still stuck in grade 9 and it'll take me 2 or 3 years before I graduate.


To combat that, I have 2 tests coming up (One from the Department of Education and one being an Alternative Learning System). The DepEd test (If I pass Grade 9 and 10) will take me to Grade 11 while the ALS test will take me to college right away.


Since then, I've been highly concentrated on passing and going to college, but unfortunately, what I explained earlier (Including my Aspergers) and me being a full on English speaker (Started speaking Tagalog) are my problems right now.


&amp;nbsp;


Background check on the ALS:


It's a system where you study ALL of the lessons you've done from Kinder all the way to Grade 12.


The lessons I have to study are Math, English, Science, Filipino, AP, Health, and ICT (Computer).


It is a multiple choice test (Shading from A to E), including some parts where you have to write down answers of the questions given or solve some solutions.


As for the DepEd, here it is:


GRADE 9
[Science, Math, English, and Filipino](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/290164399937814539/503147848875900928/unknown.png)


[AP](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/290164399937814539/503147931369734154/unknown.png)


GRADE 10

Funny thing is, I'm committing suicide if I fail both of them. It's not an option, it's a primary and it cannot be changed.


In short, my life is on the line.


&amp;nbsp;


Now some people are gonna say ""Why not just be happy with what you have?"", I'm sorry, but no, I'm not happy with what I have because of my friends and families.


This year, my brother has graduated from college, my friends are in their seniors or college freshmen, and I'm an 18 year old turning 19 soon, and I wanna get myself back together so I can be who I wanna be and be happy for the rest of my life.


Simply saying ""I should just be happy with what I have"" is not gonna help and never will.

42,"You guys are my best support system that I have right now, and I ran like a scared child. I had deleted my post from yesterday because I was freaking out over everything. It all had hit me at once, and it hurt and made me almost have a panic attack. My thoughts were racing a mile a minute and I was trying to make sense out of everything that had happened, but it was like trying to understand someone speaking Chinese. None of it had made sense at all, and that scared me. I can safely say I DO have Anxiety because once I took my Clonidine (for Anxiety), I had felt much calmer and I was able to think more clearly. So that is a pretty strong indicator that I do, indeed have GAD. I was able to sleep too, though with the hour I had dozed off and the rest of the time after I'd gotten into bed (around midnight), I only really had gotten a few hours sleep. I was back up at 3 am. Got back to sleep at 4 am and I woke up just an hour ago at 7 am. I am still so confused about everything, but I am not, if that makes any sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could go look up Impulse Control Disorder, but I can't bring myself to do it (so if anyone can please throw any info my way, that would be great). I love how the doctor had gone for the generalized disorder first, and then said the specific disorder after that. I have read every single article and every informational link on my specific disorder that is possible (not lately though--when I was first wondering what was going on) and I just don't get it. I mean...how does it pop back up in someone MY age. I know what the trigger was, but why me? I guess I've already had the Impulse Control Disorder for a long time now since I have the self-harming and Alcoholism in my past.  


I am so upset and, now, even scared. I have mixed feelings aobut going to therapy. I don't want to go. In a way, I really don't want to ""get better"" because the disorder brings me so much pleasure. I know there are other ways to feel pleasure but I have found something that truly makes me happy. I started to resent the kids and hubby last night because if it weren't for them being around, I could do whatever the hell I wanted to do and not have to worry about ""endangering"" anyone but myself. Yes, I know if I were to engage in my behavior outside that I could endanger the public too, but I would only have to answer to myself and wouldn't have to put up with judgement from family.  I would be able to be free. I know that sounds so bad, but it doesn't change the fact that I felt that way. That hurt me to type, but I had to do it.  


So here I sit, both wanting this disorder to go the fuck away and loving it with all my heart, confused, sad, excited that it is the weekend and I typically can go out and do whatever I want since hubby is home 24/7 now to mind the children and I don't have to worry about getting them from school...  


I don't know what to feel. Honestly. My heart hurts. My mind is calm for now (still feeling the medicine)...the cravings/urges are there but not strong enough to make me act on them right yet.

44,"How likely is this to happen to a normal person? I've had obsessive behaviours all my life, such as phases of obsessions with things and people. However, I feel like, the older I get, the worse it is. I can find an interest (be it a hobby, an activity, a person, a movie, a band, etc) and obsess over it for months then lose interest in it almost instantly (in one or two days). I know it's normal to change and people can't stay the same forever. I know it's normal to grow apart from things. But I feel like there's no consistency in my personality at all, I feel like I could just lose everything I've ever loved in the blink of an eye. For instance, when I was little, I used to love a TV show (this was approximately 11 years ago) and now I found it on YouTube and started rewatching it and obsessing over it - which is absolutely BIZARRE because the show is aimed at a relatively young audience (kids) and I'm 21 now. I know this will pass but I just find it very odd how I can just become obsessed or lose interest all of a sudden, for no reason at all. A few months ago I used to be obsessed with a band. I loved them and would listen to them 24/7, to the point where I was actually ignoring my personal hygiene and responsibilities because I was too busy listening to my favorite band. Turns out all it took was 2 days for me to become completely uninterested in that band, for no reason. Now I can't even enjoy their music on a normal level anymore. I don't know why this is happening but it makes me feel weird. Also, I kinda feel bad for becoming obsessed with things and then dropping them like they never meant anything to me - because I become attached to them and when I lose interest, I find it incredibly hard to cope because I can no longer enjoy that special something that has previously occupied all my time and energy. I just wish I could enjoy things on a normal level instead of suddenly being obsessed and then dropping things like they never even existed. Right now I'm going through a really shitty time because I'm not currently obsessed with anything and I miss the high of being infatuated. I'm literally having both physical and mental withdrawal symptoms such as intense, debiliating anxiety, clinical depression, nausea and all kinds of random pains in my body.

46,"I'm 18 years old and I've just started college. It's kind of stupid, but I've had this habit ever since I was a kid where I'd imagine that anyone could see exactly what I saw, as if it was some kind of livestream. My brain always comes up with weird ideas randomly and this was one of them, about 6 years ago, but even though I just thought it was cool at the time, for some reason it stuck with me to today, and with the coming of the various problems which late high school and adulthood present, I think it's really damaging me. After all, it's as if everyone can see exactly what I'm doing and hear exactly what I'm saying at every moment, which seems pretty creepy.

 The creepiness isn't the problem though, the fact is that I've never really been outgoing or willing to make new friends (I spent every holiday alone in my room), and despite my family being extremely caring and having at least a few close-ish friends, I'm not really the happiest or most cheerful of people.

By the time i started developing crushes (which I never knew how to deal with properly), then working and being forced to meet new people, things started to go pretty downhill. I play out a sequence of events in my head, starting from my current situation and leading on to some impossible circumstances or results (like in movies), either good or bad depending on how I feel (sometimes I want to feel like shit). All this based on the fact that my crush or my friends are watching exactly what I am doing, I feel like I am truly insane.

Maybe I just want people to know how I feel, at one point I started imagining that they could read my mind and know exactly what I was thinking, how I was feeling. This coupled with the fact that my life just seems kinda dull has only made my situation worse by distracting me from what I need to be doing. I mean, I've never dated or traveled far, and generally there are a lot of things that I want to do, the excitement and confidence is there, but the motivation isn't so I'm stuck in a standstill.

Has anyone else had a similar problem? I know I have plenty of time to think things through as far as my life is concerned, but I'm interested to hear what other people have to say (I feel utterly useless talking about serious problems regarding mental health to most of my friends so I'm asking here for that reason, also it's embarrassing, i guess).",20Oct2018,1
47,"I have issues with emotions. Feeling them, expressing them. Most the time I am just void. 
My closest friend told me I have sociopathic tendencies, I just dont seem to ever care about someones feelings or well being. I dont say what's on my mind to people who come to me in need because I seem split. 
When it comes to decisions, thoughts, I almost always get two answers or feel two completely different ways. That is making decision making very difficult.
So if someone comes to me and are injured or upset I would immediately just think of how stupid and annoying they are. Even if the situation is neither. But I would try to give them some advice if I'm having a good day. 
But it seems I go in and out of feelings. 
I never stay happy longer than a few moments. If someone gets me a gift that I like I'll be happy and thank them and I'll be void again. 
I dont feel anything unless provoked. I tend to keep myself busy to avoid my thoughts because I deal with self harm, self hate. So I just try to keep my mind occupied with a task. 
But of course you cannot keep that up forever. But when I finally break and the thoughts come through I feel complete anger and sadness . 
And sometimes in these moments I can see how much I am an ass to people. 
I told my boyfriend once that I dont know if I love him cause I dont feel anything. 
Something is blocking my emotions and my memories. But I dont know why",20Oct2018,1
48,"I get this issue sometimes when laying in bed trying to sleep with my eyes closed, or sometimes when i've woken up but not opened my eyes yet. what happens is that I can't remember where I am, where I am sleeping. I can remember the bedroom and house that I grew up in as a child and I can picture myself there, but I cannot visualise my current environment. I have to force myself to try to remember because I don't want to have to just open my eyes, I want my brain to remember and often after a short while of concentrating it comes back to me. I don't know what this is called? its kinda hard to search google for it, I realise it might not be mental health related and might actually be something regular people get but just don't talk about? any ideas?",20Oct2018,1
49,"I wasn't sure which subreddit to post this in but I hope this is good here..  About two years ago I started modeling and quit school. I knew that it wasn't going to be my future but ended up doing it anyway because I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life and I was getting a lot of opportunities and money so I went on with it. Then I really started to feel like I had to find my true passion because I want to have a real impact on this world and do something that really matters. I started reading tons of books, everything from philosophy, astronomy, history and physics. After a long thought process I completely quit modelling and decided on electrical engineering. I took a lot of pre-physics courses, and have now started my first semester in this program. When I told my family and friends that I was doing this they were really surprised and subtly (but obviously) hinted that they were not sure that I could do it.. I can see that my friends have been talking about this because they all ask me the exact same questions like are you sure you want to throw your career away for something that is really hard and many smart people can't even do.  I know they don't mean this in a bad way,  but seeing my friends (and family) low opinion of me  lighted a fire in me and i was so excited to show them that I'm not some stupid pretty model but an intelligent person who can achieve anything. I set a goal to get a research position next summer that only the best students get (you have to have A's in all of your classes) and hopefully transfer to MIT. I know these goals are very high but I was ready to put all the work, power and all my soul in it, no matter what it would take. I didn't go to any parties or anything because I was so determined to do everything and thank myself later when I would be a scientist, making the world a better place. I have been studying from 6am to 9pm every. single. day.  I know in my heart that this is the major for me but two weeks ago I got my first test results and it was 60%.  I was devastated. I cried for 5 hours, and felt so stupid, i felt like all of the low opinions that everyone else had about me, i had them now too. Seeing that the people who I know also want the research position got A's made me feel so bad and like a complete failure. Now I feel so paralysed and intimidated that it's giving me anxiety. I wake up in the night fearing I would fail a class or thinking I forgot to turn in an assignment, even though I know i already turned it in. My self confidence was high when I started but now it's so low that it's ruining my growth. How do I get over this fear and set my mind for success? I don't want these feelings to ruin me and take my dreams away. ",20Oct2018,1
50,"I'm only 16 and in grade 11 and I started a grocery store job at the very start of grade 10, and honestly the past year there has been the worst time of my life. It's not because of working too much. But there are 4 managers in the store, and one particular manager has made me feel so awful about myself and all I've wanted to do for the 13 months i've been there so far is cry. I always have constant headaches at the thought of being there. I just hate everything because all that happens is I'm either in school, which is fine actually. Going into work and getting screamed at for doing what I'm told, and going home and crying in that never ending vicious cycle. I actually tolerate a lot of bad people. But the bad people I tolerate are rude to everyone. This manager targets me and only me. Nice to everyone else. No matter what I do, it's wrong. Like I'll set up a display, but once customers take stuff off of that display, apparently I never did it and I get screamed at for it. The other managers are nice to me, but they're hardly in. She's around 24/7 and just loves to follow me around and do everything she can to get me in trouble. I can't keep doing it. I've been there so long cause my mom wanted me to stay. I never told her about the manager. But school started back up and I'm already on a rough start because all I do is worry about having to go into that store and get yelled at and I can never focus on the task at hand. My mom would never approve of me quitting but I think I should just pull the plug and leave it behind. I actually never worried so much before until this job happened. I don't think I should worry so much about this. But it's terrible I feel like a little kid scared to go to school because of bullies when I have to go in. I just want a job where I'm not made to feel worthless and still be able to focus on school. This job makes it so difficult to focus on ANYTHING. should I just quit and tell my mom afterwards? I don't wanna stop working. I just don't work there anymore. But i need help with the decision",20Oct2018,1
51,"My parents are great people, always caring for me and trying their best.  But, especially my mother, was only supportive on the things that SHE thought were good for me, i.e.; education.  From when I was 13 to 16 years old we were always fighting, every day, because I was playing a lot of video games and I hated school, I never studied anything (for some reason though I was doing really good at math :P ).  We even visited a therapist as a family due to our fights.  Things got a bit better but not that much.  When I because 16,  I even self harmed, I told my parents about it (I read online that if you self harm you should ask for help and so I did, yes, it was really hard to tell my parents about it, but i had cut my self really deep once and I needed to go to hospital).  I went to therapy and fortunately I didn't have a mental illness (I even visited a psychiatrist), but  I needed help and so I stayed for 1,5 years.  During that time (high school),  I suddently developed a big love for physics and mathematics - I became from worst student in school to a top one in those 2 subjects in a matter of months.  Suddently, the teachers in school were treating me differently (even those who I didn't study their subject), our classmates were treating me differently (They stopped making fun of me and moking me, yes I was being bullied for some time), I found a gf who was 2 years older than me and I got a reputation for it (she was pretty hot), and last but not least, my relationship with my parents became better.  That change happened over the course of 1,5 years.  By the time I was in the last year in high school everything was pretty good (though i broke up with my gf, but that turned out to be great as I found a beatiful girl that makes me blissful).  I'm now studying aboard in one of the top 10 universities of UK, Theoretical Physics.  Pretty amazing how things can change in a few months/years.  From a kid who fought with his parents and was bullied, was an awful student and didn't know what to do with his life to someone who now studies Theoretical physics.  You could argue that my life now is pretty great, and it is, I'm happy for that, and my parents did a great job to have me here, I'm very thankful to them.

But you see, there is one thing that makes me extremelly sad, and that is, knowing that nothing of that was ever going to happen if my passion was something that didn't have to do with education and school.  I was fortunate to have a passion in physics and people respect that.  My mother would never support me if i told her that I wanted to do something that didn't have to do with ""education"".  That makes me really sad.",20Oct2018,1

**I am searching for individuals in Canada who have experienced the same debilitating side effects and withdrawal effects from being prescribed antipsychotic mediations and other psychotropic medications with the intentions of approaching CBC to propose an investigation into the complacent prescribing of these medications and the destructive aftermath of taking these medications.** 

**The text below is a ""condensed"" letter I wrote to the Canadian Association of Mental Health (and others) describing my disturbing, perpetual ""journey"" on psychotropic medications.**  

**The complaint process was difficult in that I had not completely discontinued all psychotropic medications and was ""scattered"" missing an opportunity to address additional concerns regarding the prescribing psychiatrist.  As psychiatric patients, we are often psychologically  and physically vulnerable to the medications we are prescribed and the assumption is that we will be taking psychotropic medications for a lifetime and will never be ""cured"".** 

**Respectfully, as a woman who works in health care, I know that there is a population of individuals that benefit from these medications and will have to take psychotropic medications for their lifetime.  Please understand that I am not critical or judgemental of these healthcare scenarios.**

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose in sharing the exhausting, and often consuming, chemical psychotropic medication cycle that affected my reality ¬†is to highlight the consequences of mechanically prescribing   psychotropic medications, such as Risperidone, and  the associated, and often disconcerting symptoms patients experience when these medications are changed or discontinued. ¬†Ill advised, I found myself running from one medication to another  with the development of each new and troubling symptom contributing to increased physical and emotional discord.   My quest for answers was ‚Äúfrantic‚Äù as my body and mind failed me. ¬†To my detriment,  this ‚Äúfranticness‚Äù was witnessed by the prescribing psychiatrist and a host of other healthcare professionals leaving a permanent impression of madness that is not easily erased.   

Listening to CBC radio and reviewing this conversation online provided links to numerous studies conducted and documented by reputable sources confirming my initial belief that many of the physical and psychological symptoms I endured over a 5 year period were primarily from psychotropic medication dosage changes, switching from one medication to another, discontinuing these medications completely and the painful emotions from having many of my concerns dismissed with condescension and evident irritability within a small healthcare community. ¬†¬†I would find myself being labeled as a difficult patient and diagnosed with numerous psychiatric syndromes I had never been associated with in the past.   

I have a history of an eating disorder decades ago and received treatment at the Toronto General Hospital for 14 weeks beginning in January 1988. ¬†¬†I experienced decreased, yet intermittent binging after receiving care at Toronto General Hospital.    I found myself moving to a smaller city to be closer to my ‚Äùdistant‚Äù ¬†father in September 2003 and obtained an unreliable casual cashier position at a local hardware store.    I arrived with a small supply of the antidepressant Prozac and considered discontinuing this medication when the supply was exhausted. ¬†My attempt to discontinue Prozac was unsuccessful and I was referred to a psychiatrist in March 2004.  

The prescribing psychiatrist has a private psychiatric practice with full privileges at the local hospital, staffs an outpatient rapid response clinic and is also a clinical assistant professor specializing in mood and anxiety disorders at a reputable university typicalling seeing approximately 700 patients per year since 1997. ¬†These credentials suggest a mental health care professional with significant knowledge of the vast and diverse psychotropic medications he prescribes to hundreds of his patients on day to day basis.

I was prescribed a different antidepressant in March 2004 that was later determined ineffective and replaced with the ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù Prozac ¬†in August 2004. I was then prescribed Risperidone in September 2004 to augment the Prozac for depression.  I was not aware that benefits of Prozac required time to be achieved. ¬†I returned to this psychiatrist‚Äôs office requesting higher and higher doses of Risperidone on three separate occasions specifically for this medication‚Äôs sedating properties and I was never advised of the potential irreversible side effects of Risperidone and the difficulty discontinuing this medication when this medication was first initiated and with each subsequent requested dosage increase. ¬†

Literature reports that many patients will not experience the full benefit of antidepressants therapy immediately and the benefits may take as long as 8 weeks. ¬†Perhaps Risperidone would never have been prescribed had I waited the course till the full benefits of Prozac therapy were achieved; and, conceivably, I could still be taking Prozac today. ¬†

I addressed my concerns about taking Risperidone with the prescribing psychiatrist in April 2008 when I discovered this medication was utilized as a chemical restraint in the elderly population with dementia often presenting with difficult behaviours. ¬†I did not want to take Risperidone after this discovery yet believed the prescribing psychiatrist--a paternal-like figure--‚Äùmust know best‚Äù.    I was both shy and timid when addressing my concerns about taking Risperidone only to end up being ‚Äúin agreement‚Äù with current psychotropics or advised to trial another antipsychotic such as Invega. ¬†I opted not to trial Invega.   I felt the onus of seeking alternatives to Risperidone fall upon my shoulders and my role in health care was insignificant when compared to the role of psychiatrist.  I felt very unsupported. 

A typical prescription would read Prozac 80-120mg and Risperdal 2-4mg or simply Prozac 120mg and Risperdal 4mg. ¬†The prescribing psychiatrist documented that I often reduced both medications and, at one time,  reduced the Prozac dosage as low a 20mg documenting ‚Äúrelapse‚Äù without ever investigating the purpose of my non-compliance. ¬†¬†¬†In addition, my medical charts reveal that a pharmacy had contacted the prescribing psychiatrist asking if they should fill an expired prescription for Risperidone and Prozac as I had reported having accumulated a surplus of medication. ¬†The prescription was filled and the prescriber made no inquiry into the surplus or stockpile of medication I had acquired or the notion of noncompliance.  This lack of inquiry hindered the development of a therapeutic relationship that was never really initiated. ¬†

The antipsychotic medications began to change in late 2012: ¬†from  Risperidone to Quetiapine, back to Risperidone *and* Quetiapine, to Trazodone, to Trazodone and Quetiapine and this chemical psychotropic medication cycle ¬†would continue to negatively affect my physical and psychological wellness in such profound ways leading me to believe that other psychotropic medications were ineffective contributing to increased medication changes perpetuating physical harm and psychological chaos for several years to follow. ¬†¬†Unbeknownst to me, I would begin an era fraught with somatic symptoms including increased body pain query fibromyalgia, fatigue, skin rashes, gastrointestinal issues query irritable bowel syndrome, nausea, numbness and tingling, cognitive decline, increased anxiety (GAD), ADHD, fatigue and insomnia coupled with numerous psychiatric labels that I can not seem to escape. ¬†¬†The newly acquired psychiatric labels assigned to me based upon  the symptoms I presented with were perhaps the most harmful and destructive eroding my self- esteem and self-confidence in tasks that I had become proficient in.  

Insomnia developed when Quetiapine replaced Risperidone and I began to struggle with the demands of shift work where I was required to work within a team environment in a role to care for others. ¬†¬†I would later  return to the more ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù Risperidone.   The prescribing psychiatrist documents in my medical charts that I ‚Äúdid not find the Seroquel as helpful as the Risperdal, and decided to go back on the Risperdal, in addition to continuing on the Seroquel. ¬†She was aware of the increased risk of TD \[Tardive Dyskinesia\]  by making the decision to go back on the Risperdal, in comparison to remaining solely on Seroquel‚Äù.  The irony in this statement is that I would not have found  myself in that uncomfortable predicament of having to choose between one antipsychotic over another antipsychotic--Risperidone or Seroquel--had the prescribing psychiatrist obtained valid informed consent when the medication was initiated in September 2004. ¬†¬†I propose this example of thorough documentation of informed consent is to avoid blame or responsibility for the prescribing psychiatrist‚Äôs failure to obtain informed consent when initially prescribing Risperidone and with subsequent dosage increases in the past. 

In addition, ¬†¬†I had to have older breast implants removed at the hospital I was employed at in 2013 and anticipated discontinuing Risperidone close to the surgery date. I was quite content with my body image in my early 50‚Äôs and opted for a simple explantation without additional cosmetic surgery and I had ¬†established very satisfying and financially rewarding employment allowing me to reduce my mortgage significantly. 

The unexpected and coincidental removal of ruptured and encapsulated silicone breast implants in ¬†2013  coupled with the current-day controversy surrounding silicone breast implants at that time contributed to an even greater sense of confusion within me as I began to experience the host of challenging physical and psychological symptoms . ¬†There is a specific group of individuals consisting primarily or women who believe that silicone breast implants and silicone products are harmful and contribute to numerous physical and psychological health concerns including breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. ¬†

I knew enough to recognize the onset of the symptoms I experienced presented quickly but I could not determine if the symptoms were from psychotropic medication changes, psychotropic medication discontinuation or from 28 year old ruptured silicone breast implants. ¬†I was confused and with increased anxiety I asked the prescribing psychiatrist if any of my pain could be contributed to various psychotropic medications and their corresponding changes. His response was ‚ÄúNot to my knowledge‚Äù.  There is sufficient documentation regarding the onset of the physical and psychological symptoms experienced in my medical notes from my local walk-in medical clinic; a medical clinic ¬†that would abruptly dismiss my concerns only to discover that genuine health concerns existed.    I vividly recall a  physician in this medical clinic, with great annoyance, attempt  to convince me that I had a complex chronic disease by utilizing a ‚Äútick-in-the-box‚Äù symptom checker sheet.

Loss of respect and faith in this medical clinic eventually replaced the painful feelings of being identified as a difficult and undesirable patient. ¬†

My coping skills diminished quickly with the numerous psychotropic medication changes originating from a conscious and documented attempt to discontinue Risperidone in 2012 leading me to believe that the Prozac I had taken since the late 1998 was no longer effective. ¬†I inquired about the efficacy of Prozac when taken for extended periods of time and the prescriber psychiatrist could not comment so I requested to switch to another antidepressant  in April 2014.  My ability to concentrate at work declined significantly as I began to soil myself with increasing frequency and I felt I had to ¬†transfer from an acute care position consisting of shiftwork that I truly loved to a disappointing and unsupportive part time position is residential care  due to the unpredictability of my bowels.   I was overwhelmed when, to use medical terminology, I was incontinent of a large loose, liquid BM in Walmart. This fecal incontinence affected my ability to manage at work and in daily life and I sought more frequent psychiatric counsel. ¬†¬†The prescribing psychiatrist was unable to connect the increased loose fecal incontinence I experienced with the medication he prescribed in April 2014 until late August 2014.    The prescribing psychiatrist suggested I consider the plant-based Vegan diet and implied that the ‚Äúaging process‚Äù may be contributing to my physical symptoms.   These symptoms exacerbated any mood disorder I may have had contributing to increased anxiety, depression and ¬†isolation coupled with feelings complete helplessness.

The prescribing psychiatrist did not consider a differential diagnosis and review the various psychotropic medication changes prescribed, beginning with Risperidone, as potential sources to the numerous side effects presented. ¬†I would learn years later that the medication causing fecal incontinence prescribed in April 2014 had been prescribed and deemed ineffective a decade earlier in 2004 and the prescribing psychiatrist  neglected to refer to my medical charts when inadvertently re-prescribing this medication for a second time. ¬†

I was very afraid as my mind and body began to fail me. ¬†The physical and psychological symptoms escalated and I called 811 in August 2014 and was advised to go to the emergency department in the hospital where I work. ¬†Emergency physicians often refer to a medication databank listing the patient‚Äôs dispensed medications to develop an understanding into the patient‚Äôs medical history and to gain potential insight into the cause of patient‚Äôs primary complaint leading to an emergency visit. ¬†¬†¬†My medication databank (Pharmanet)  listed numerous and various psychotropic medications dispensed over several months and I was ‚Äúhurt‚Äù to hear the emergency physician state that I was wasting his time during this isolated visit in August 2014.    Thoughtless and disparaging ¬†comments and attitudes towards individuals with mental illness are common in the healthcare profession; a profession that should display more tolerance towards individuals with mental illness.  Individuals holding positions of authority in healthcare should choose to be positive role models for others and lead by example. ¬†The emergency physician‚Äôs statement clearly implied I was a burden and this notion would be reinforced by health care professionals in my community for years to come serving to exacerbate any struggles I may have had with depression and anxiety. 

I have been privy to many conversations regarding challenging patients and I regretfully admit to participating in some of these conversations. ¬†¬†I distinctly recall caring for two women known throughout the healthcare facility as being demanding and unreasonable and it became difficult for me to care for them ‚Äúburdened‚Äù with the notion that I too, could be one them. ¬†To my surprise, one of these women was transferred to the local hospice facility for end-of-life care and I felt a sense of guilt as I watched her mobilize to the hospice dinner table.  

I terminated my relationship with the prescribing psychiatrist of 10 years, from March 2004 to September 2014, and received chastising comments for my actions ¬†from my GP at the time.  My GP‚Äôs disapproval  instilled feelings of guilt and the need for me to  make amends by sending a 2014 Christmas card to the prescribing psychiatrist.

I would connect with a new psychiatrist December 2014 and she suggested the mainstay of treatment should be psychotherapeutic in nature describing the purpose of this treatment format and how I would benefit from such treatment. ¬†I am saddened to read of the individual I had become as described in the ‚Äúnew‚Äù initial psychiatric assessment in December 2014.  The negative experiences from psychotropic medication changes,  discontinuing psychotropic medication and with healthcare professionals contributed to feeling ‚Äúlike she is constantly being judged...she is afraid of being humiliated by others...she struggles with feeling like a fraud and that they can see her dysfunction...and is worried that her co-workers can see it in her‚Äù. ¬†In addition, this initial consult reports  ‚Äúchronic pain in her arms, shoulders, chest, through her legs for the last year and a half and has seen doctors who believe it might be fibromyalgia...there are chronic gastrointestinal symptoms with a possible diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome...her thought content was significant for decreased self-worth and she spoke about herself with quite disgust and shame‚Äù.   

I had finally discontinued all psychotropic medications with the exception of a small dose of Oxazepam for sleep for well over a year when I first listened to this particular CBC White Coat Black Art podcast in May 2018. ¬†This podcast and corresponding website providing links to reputable academic sources strongly suggests that pertinent information regarding patient safety and the physical and psychological side effects related to  psychotropic medication changes has been known, present and available for decades. ¬†¬†¬†I find myself wondering why the prescribing psychiatrist, with all of his credentials,  did not consider the various medication changes as the source for the exacerbation of physical and psychiatric symptoms and the onset of new symptoms I presented with.  In hindsight, perhaps it is possible that the prescribing psychiatrist did suspect that some of my ¬†symptoms were related to psychotropic medication changes when he prescribed Nabilone for pain; he just never articulated his suspicions to me or the healthcare providers at my local walk-in medical clinic. 

In November 2016 I requested my medical notes from the psychiatrist who initiated the course of Risperidone more than twelve years ago ¬†with the intent of complaining to the College of Physicians and Surgeons after caring for an elderly woman who was prescribed levodopa/carbidopa three times a day. ¬†¬†Many patients are prescribed levodopa/carbidopa yet there was no mention of this woman having Parkinson‚Äôs disease during shift report.  It was discovered this woman presented with Parkinsonian symptoms as a result of taking Olanzapine for several decades. ¬†¬†¬†¬†I could be this woman 20 years from now.  This  woman was later diagnosed with Stickman‚Äôs Disease by the local neurologist.  

I continued to struggle with the physical and psychological symptoms that began ¬†when I attempted to discontinue Risperidone in 2012.   I had been diagnosed with ADHD the previous year and the physical and psychological ¬†symptoms persisted affecting my ability to focus and concentrate contributing to feelings of increased confusion and self-doubt.   Equally disabling is the the ADHD diagnosis/label itself. ¬†I now understand that I have lived with the same brain my whole life but I became fearful of ADHD‚Äôs presence with increased incidents of forgetfulness when racing thoughts regarding my failing mind and body would interrupt the continuity of complicated processes of established learned skill-sets and well laid plans. ¬†I began to identify strongly with the geriatric population and considered the possibility of dementia. 

In addition, I recently discovered I had renal health concerns during this time period learning that my kidneys were ‚Äúallergic‚Äô to Hydrochlorothiazide. ¬†¬†¬†I developed hypertension during this era of psychotropic medication changes and I was having an adverse reaction to this medication.    I began to experience neurological twitching in my fingers, increased numbness and tingling coupled with flank pain and my GP abruptly dismissed me without listening to my concerns ¬†stating  I had somatoform disorder because I had a history of an eating disorder decades ago.  

Perhaps one of the most humiliating experiences was returning to the emergency room in the hospital where I was employed--for a second time--to describe these symptoms noted above and to state with transparency that these symptoms, as per my GP, were symptoms of somatoform disorder. ¬†I was referred to a nephrologist who identified a legitimate health concern and who would soon adopt the same attitude as my GP.  I became a renal patient that day. 

With my medical notes obtained November 2016, I submitted a formal written ¬†complaint to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in February 2017 regarding the psychiatric care received and this complaint went unheeded. ¬†¬†I received the psychiatrist‚Äôs response to my initial complaint after June 28, 2017, and the content of his response confirmed:

* I was only provided with my transcribed medical charts and not given the handwritten medical charts when I requested my medical files in November 2016.
* The prescribing psychiatrist did not refer to my medical charts ¬†when inadvertently re-prescribing an ineffective medication for a second time in April 2014.

Receipt of my handwritten medical charts in July 2017 reveal and support the notion that valid informed consent was never obtained or documented until April 2008 confirming my original query to the College of Physicians and Surgeons when I inquired ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt \[the prescribing psychiatrist\] discuss the side effects with me when I began taking Risperidone when he first prescribed the medication to me?‚Äù 

I was emotionally scattered after receiving the prescribing psychiatrist‚Äôs response and had recently been approved for long-term disability through my employer benefit package. ¬†¬†A series of negative interactions with healthcare professionals accelerated my determination to discontinue all psychotropic medications at this time.   It was unsettling to observe a rheumatologist google the results of a pathology report of a recent skin biopsy after waiting months to see her and it was equally unsettling to have to request new bloodwork when a second nephrologist made reference to lab values from six months ago during a 6-month consult. ¬†¬†This same nephrologist would document that I had‚Äù discontinued all my medications with exception of oxazepam‚Äù underscoring my sense of ‚Äúmadness‚Äù.  This nephrologist  ordered new bloodwork, at my request, stating that a renal biopsy may be ordered if proteinuria and hematuria were present--and they were.   I considered relocating  to a larger city to receive healthcare realizing that all future health concerns would be met with familiar disdain within the small community I resided in. ¬†¬†

I believed the continual proteinuria and hematuria was contributing to the physical symptoms I presented with and sought healthcare at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, November 2017. ¬†My humble and pitiful admission of traveling to the Mayo Clinic indicates the continued presence of physical and psychological symptoms months after discontinuing psychotropic medications and my own vulnerable and determined quest for answers knowing that the symptoms I presented with began within a specific time frame. The distinct stigma ¬†towards individuals with mental illness that I experienced  in my hometown was all too prevalent at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona.    My body was changing and declining in so many ways and I felt helpless and isolated.  

I overlooked the advisement of the College of Physicians and Surgeons to provide any new facts ‚Äúto be of particular significance to the issues at hand‚Äù regarding my complaint about the psychiatric care I received for over a decade after receipt of the prescribing psychiatrist‚Äôs response to my initial letter of complaint and inbetween obtaining the other half of my medical chart. ¬†In addition, issues regarding abnormal lab values, disdainful healthcare professional attitudes, discontinuing medications and entertaining the idea of moving to a larger city also contributed to the oversight of the College‚Äôs advisement.     I could see the inconsistencies in the psychiatric care I received but did not possess the means to articulate these inconsistencies with appropriate medical and legal language ¬†nor could I present them in a timely manner.   I am a team on one with limited time and resources. 

The timing of listening to this academic conversation on CBC‚Äôs White Coat Black Art addressing and discussing the physical and psychological side effects individuals often experience from discontinuing an array of psychotropic medications on May 11, 2018 could not have presented at a more opportune time: ¬†¬†I was taking a lunch break from   writing a ‚ÄúStatement of Points‚Äù to the Health Professions Review Board,  at a local library in Vancouver, regarding the complaint I made to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia concerning the care I received from the prescribing physician over the course of 10 years when I first listened to this podcast. ¬†

I believed the content of this CBC White Coat Black Art podcast so significant that I included the link to this podcast with subsequent links to ¬†‚ÄúWhen it comes to antidepressants, getting to zero proves difficult‚Äù by Dr. Goldman,   ‚ÄúMany People taking Antidepressants Discover They Cannot Quit‚Äù by Benedict Carey and Robert Gebeloff of The New York Times, ¬†and   ‚ÄúAntidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome‚Äù by C. Warner and colleagues,  in my Statement of Points to the Health Professions Review Board.  I naively believed the Health Professions Review Board Panel would take the time to listen and consider the well researched and documented content of this CBC podcast that succinctly explains the source of the physical and psychological symptoms I endured for several years: ¬†symptoms related  to antipsychotic and psychotropic medications. 

The Health Professions Review Board decision favoured the initial psychiatrist and reported that the documents I submitted ‚Äúdemonstrates that the Complainant is not a reliable historian and that she has demonstrated an unwillingness to accept a diagnosis or treatment that does not accord with her own view of her medical conditions as she understands them.‚Äù ¬†¬†

Medical research and documentation relegated to medical textbooks in university and hospital libraries are now available online and it makes sense that I would search for corroborating medical knowledge to confirm that I endured numerous physical and psychological ¬†side effects  resulting from psychotropic medication changes. The evident holes in my medical charts reveal that informed consent was not obtained until I had become reliant on this medication‚Äôs sedating properties.  Online research will continue as  the well-known adverse effects from antipsychotic and antidepressant medications are now openly revealed and discussed on public platforms including radio and television in addition to internet sources. ¬†¬†To reiterate:  I naively declared in my initial complaint to the College of Physicians and Surgeons that I began to experience many uncomfortable physical and emotional symptoms coinciding with a conscious attempt to discontinue Risperidone in 2012. These side effects were validated when listening to CBC and researching the numerous sources cited.  

My original declaration was made without having obtained all my medical documentation and receipt of this documentation would confirm that I was not made aware of the irreversible side effects and difficulting discontinuing Risperidone when this medication was initially and subsequently prescribed until I addressed the issue of the inappropriate use of Risperidone as a chemical restraint in the elderly population in 2008. ¬†The Panel Chair‚Äôs response to my review request minimizes the physical and psychological symptoms I experienced when attempting to discontinue Risperidone and the chemical psychotropic medication cycle  perpetuated from this event for several years to follow.  In addition, this response explicitly implies that the symptoms I experienced are a result of my own negligence placing the fault upon the psychiatric patient.  

The personal nature of psychiatric treatment suggests that psychiatric patients are often emotionally and/or intellectually unstable and unreliable historians creating ¬†invisible barriers hindering the vulnerable psychiatric patient‚Äôs ability to complain effectively about psychiatric care they have received.  The invisible barriers intimidate, discourage and prevent the psychiatric patient from submitting ¬†formal complaints against the psychiatric healthcare provider to appropriate governing bodies who dismiss their concerns favouring the psychiatric practitioner. 

I did not possess all the essential medical and legal language when formalizing my complaints to these governing bodies and their responses simply reiterate my mental illness history based upon the psychiatrist‚Äôs documentation stating I am an inaccurate historian rather than acknowledge that: ¬†

* I was not provided with half of my medical chart essential to ensure greater accuracy in describing the historical events in my initial complaint regarding care received over a 10-year period; 
* the withheld medical charts ¬†indicates informed consent was not obtained during the first 4 years of care;
* the prescriber neglected to refer to my medical chart prior to re-prescribing an ineffective psychotropic medication strongly suggesting that he, too, is an ¬†inaccurate historian;  
* The combination of numerous psychotropic medication changes, beginning with initial prescription of Risperidone in 2004, ¬†followed by numerous attempts to discontinue this medication in 2012 contributed to the numerous physical and psychological symptoms I would experience from years to come; and
* the prescribing psychiatrist did not acknowledge the onset of exacerbated and unexplained symptoms as a result of psychotropic medication changes.

Addressing my concerns to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia and extending my complaint further to the Health Professions Review Board were ineffective. ¬†¬†On August 3, 2017,  I registered a ‚ÄúPetition to the Court‚Äù in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to set aside decisions made my the Health Professions Review Board and The College of Physicians and Surgeons ¬†with the intent of remitting the matter back to the College of Physicians and Surgeons.  I have enclosed a copy of the  ‚ÄúPetition to the Court‚Äù for your perusal.    

The barriers I experienced in registering this Petition were many and it‚Äôs contents may appear simple, naive, and lacking in both legal and medical expertise. 

I have cited and listed the same documentation I had provided electronic links to for the Health Professions Review Board to examine in an affidavit to ‚ÄúPetition to the Court‚Äù ¬†from the CBC White Coat Black Art podcast that aired May 11, 2018.  Some of the documents cited as evidence affirm that knowledge of the physical and psychological symptoms attributed to discontinuing antipsychotic and antidepressant medications has been known for decades and should have been acknowledged by the initial prescriber of Risperidone. ¬†¬†I would have also cited Dr. Richard Friedman‚Äôs article ‚ÄúA Call for Caution in the Use of Antipsychotic Drugs‚Äù had I been permitted to submit additional documentation. 

I exercise respect when stating that I am not physician, a psychiatrist or a lawyer. ¬†I am an individual, a middle-aged woman, a caregiver, and a patient with a history of mental illness who encountered numerous obstacles and barriers necessitating tenacity in attempting to access the legal system independently when others would simply submit and accept to living with the same ‚Äúconditions‚Äù believing themselves powerless, feeling voiceless and invisible. ¬†

The dismissive, and often humiliating, incidents I experienced from healthcare professionals occuring while under the care of the initial prescribing psychiatrist continued even after ending this patient/psychiatrist relationship. ¬†These incidents are not the primary issue in my legal suit requesting the Supreme Court of British Columbia to quash the Health Professions Review Board and College of Physicians and Surgeons‚Äô decisions in favour of the initial psychiatrist; rather, these incidents were a manifestation of preconceived notions and stigmatic beliefs towards individuals with mental illness attempting to reclaim their mental wellness and serve to underscore the necessity for transparency between psychiatrist and patient. ¬†There is a defined series of events that transpired when I  attempted to discontinue Risperidone in late 2012:  a 

medication I continued to request higher doses of without being informed of the potential irreversible side effects and the difficulting in discontinuing this medication. ¬†These events continued to undermine any legitimate health concerns I presented with in the small city I resided in and have affected the care and a diagnosis I received from a healthcare practitioner in the metropolis I currently reside in. ¬†It is fortunate that I acquire a GP here who is both an academic and a scientist.   Dare I say, these events may not have occurred had I been given sufficient information to make an informed choice about the nature of Risperidone in 2004 when this medication was quickly prescribed in the final minutes of a 30 minute consult. ¬†

I suspect that the initial prescribing psychiatrist recognized that the harm of his actions, or lack of actions, would require significant explanation and psychiatric care reflecting poorly upon him and his position in authority ¬†within a small healthcare community.   In addition, it was less problematic for him, and perhaps somewhat of a relief, when I sought alternative mental healthcare after losing faith in his abilities. 

The difficulty I experienced discontinuing Risperidone and subsequent psychotropic medications mirrors similar difficulties other patients have experienced exemplifying the ‚ÄúElephant in the Room‚Äù idiom: ¬†The difficulty discontinuing psychotropic medications, including the ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù Risperidone, is an undesirable fact that remained unaddressed and ignored until reputable sources such as CBC and The New York Times presented this serious problem identifying the physical and emotional symptoms patients have experienced and their vain attempts to discontinue these medications only to experience failure and to have these symptoms attributed to their declining ¬†mental illness.    I believe I have a legitimate complaint regarding the psychiatric care I received from 2004-2014 in that the prescribing psychiatrist and university professor had an understanding that I was physically and psychologically struggling to discontinue Risperidone and various psychotropic medications trialled when he prescribed Nabilone for pain.  Prescribing a medication without obtaining informed consent and re-prescribing an ineffective medication in error only compounds the harm done by not identifying the disturbing symptoms I began to experience in 2012 when I attempted to discontinue Risperidone. ¬†¬†¬†¬†

Relocating to a larger city for healthcare has revealed that I have ‚Äúthin basement membrane disease‚Äù, a renal aneurysm and a grade 2 rectocele in a relatively kind, emotionally ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and ‚Äúpatient‚Äù medical environment. ¬†Food has not been an issue for several years and this fact, in isolation, is emancipating.  I take less analgesic and continue to live with intermittent pain, headaches, GI concerns and hypertension coupled with numbness and tingling that began during my ‚Äújourney‚Äù. ¬†¬†I struggle at times with a misaligned circadian rhythm and my sleep quality, for the most part,  is moderate and I have been advised not to work nights shifts again.  I long to be  able to take that satisfying and re-energizing 20 minute midday nap that has been unattainable since discontinuing psychotropic medication well over a year ago. ¬†My cognition has evolved and matured since my initial complaint to the College in February 2017 regarding the psychiatric care I received for more than a decade and I can define my concerns with greater clarity.  

I recognize and even expect that my description of events may be, yet again, dismissed as a result of mental illness contributing to medical, scientific or unkind comments regarding my emotional demeanor. ¬†After all, I am a psychiatric patient and psychiatric patients are poor historians.  

The issues of mechanically prescribing powerful psychotropic medications, such as Risperidone, without providing adequate medication information in a manner easily understood by patients, ¬†medical complacency in continuous prescribing of large doses of psychotropic medications without inquiring into the patient‚Äôs logic and reasoning for their non-compliance,  re-prescribing ineffective psychotropic medication without referring to a patient‚Äôs medication history and not identifying and associating the onset of increased or new symptoms with psychotropic medication changes need to be addressed in a medical culture that often corrects emotional maladies with a pill. ¬†¬†¬†

¬†My mental health history clearly indicates the desire to discontinue the psychotropic medication Risperidone and I was prescribed this medication without appropriate medication information.  These facts coupled with experiencing the onset and continuation of very uncomfortable ¬†physical and psychological symptoms when attempting to discontinue Risperidone with insufficient support was both socially and medically undermining marking the beginning of sad and stressful chapter in my life that I look forward to closing.   Resiliency should not be this difficult. 

In conclusion, this journey has been one of isolation coupled with fears of being ostracized for burdening others with my concerns and linked hand-in-hand with suggestions and explicit statements that I was a burden, a waste of time, while attempting to have some of the physical and psychological symptoms I experienced from psychotropic medication changes addressed. ¬†I simply state that my journey has consisted of a series of experiences that have negatively impacted my physical and psychological well-being. I am apprehensive, yet clearly in need of returning to meaningful employment.  My thoughts are more clear and I recognize I have been provided with the gift of time and the opportunity to share my concerns with you and to register ¬†these concerns with the Supreme Court of British Columbia.  As mentioned previously, the tone of this letter is written calmly and is meant to be read and interpreted in this manner  and I hope to maintain this demeanour when I present to the Supreme Court.  

I have encountered many individuals who feel this endeavour will fail; however, the attempt has been made, the concerns addressed and the event recorded for others to follow as the inconvenient truths about psychotropic medications are revealed. 

I am presently unsure of how to reestablish a life with purpose and self-worth and trust I will continue to recognize and acknowledge unexpected events as opportunities to reclaim my mental wellness in a new journey towards self-discovery.

Signing off with appropriate affect, thought processes and cognition grossly intact. ",20Oct2018,1
53,"Hey guys 
I'm struggling with keeping my head on my shoulders and it's exhausting. I can barely concentrate anymore and I keep forgetting things (ex. My jacket at the restaurant, my keys in the house when going out, pay for groceries but forget them at the store, etc.). It's happening more and more frequently and I just lost a lot of confidence in myself. I'm 23 and I feel like I need a babysitter everywhere I go.

I'm also pretty stressed all the time and I keep getting angry, even at minor stuff like food not cooking fast enough. Sometimes, when I forget yet another thing, I get so angry that I can't control myself and I facepalm myself when there's no one around. 

I'm going to a psychologist or whatever after my next paycheck, but until then, if I get any advice from any of you guys, I would very much appreciate it. ",20Oct2018,1
54,"Hey guys, I really wasn‚Äôt sure where to post this and it‚Äôs my first time posting here so I hope I‚Äôm doing it properly haha.

I recently got diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and I‚Äôve started taking Fluoxetine, I haven‚Äôt left the house much aside from yesterday where I went to the Co-op (I‚Äôm in the UK) to pick up some cigarettes and juice, as soon as I went to pay and get the cigarettes I noticed that I seemed to freak out a bit, I was stumbling and couldn‚Äôt stop my hands from shaking to get my ID or cash out and I couldn‚Äôt get my words out a lot of the time, my heart started beating really fast and and I got really hot and sweaty and my head started to hurt.

Now before I actually went to the doctor or anything I knew I had anxiety anyway, I still had a tremor and whenever I got into any sort of a confrontation or anything I would shake, sometimes very violently, this has also happened in situations that didn‚Äôt even directly involve me. I am a security guard and so obviously there are times we have to confront shoplifters etc and most of the time I don‚Äôt even have to talk to them but just stand to one side or block them from leaving but even in those situations I would get these crazy shakes that would last up to half an hour after everything was said and done but it was never this bad.

I have been invited out by my best friends Dad tonight to go to dinner and go to the cinema but after yesterday I‚Äôm not sure how to feel. I want to go out and everything but I‚Äôm worried I might freak out again having to speak to any waiters/ waitresses and I don‚Äôt want to look stupid, my friend and his Dad are both aware of my situation and everything but I‚Äôm still really worried, would it be a good idea to try and get out and go or should I just leave it?",20Oct2018,1

59,"I see a lot of people come on here, who say they have issues feeling empathy or sympathy for others, and people are quick to label antisocial personality disorder or sociopathy. This has to do with a lack of ability to connect with others. It very well can be a type of ""emotional detachment"". A lot of times, it can come from trauma. This is a symptom common in many disorders other than sociopathy. Things like PTSD, Depression, Depersonalization/Derealization disorder, etc. It's a long list. It's just always been most associated with sociopathy because of the media, so it's what people are most familiar with 

Sociopathy involves things beyond just emotional detachment, like compulsive lying, inflated self- importance, inpulsivity, manipulativeness, etc.

61,"Hi r/mentalhealth,

Where do I begin?
I am currently curled in my bed watching a blank Netflix sign. I have expressed this to many other people but nobody has ever taken me seriously. 
I am 24, unemployed and struggling with money. I have a extremely dysfunctional relationship with my dad (parents separated) and mum had left the country for work. I look after my 9 year old GSD.  I have a lovely large family but I duno 
I am a qualified lawyer however am finding it absolutely horrific to find work.  The stesss is getting to me; I have given up on my dreams and want to feel good again. I have been in a relationship with my GF for 7+ years but recently I have changed. I am more angry, aggressive and tend to have horrible arguments and treat her like shit. 

I currently feel like my head is chemically imbalanced, my head feels like someone has wine Ina glass and is slushing it round. I don‚Äôt feel the same anywmore and I feel like I‚Äôm just pretending but want to cry. I haven‚Äôt felt this bad in a long time. I don‚Äôt know what to do, financial pressure is continuously mounting and I feel like I just want to disappear. 
I have contemplated before about suffering from MH but I genuinely think something is wrong. 
I don‚Äôt seem to feel happy anymore, I feel so negative and that everything is temporary but in a negative sense. I have lost hope really and live day by day
I want to gain help but don‚Äôt know where to start",20Oct2018,1
62,"I really put my mind to this issue whether I should post this or not and it'll probably be easier for me to write down words as I cannot talk about this problem out loud. 
So I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years. It's just getting worse day by day. There's none of the days going by that I don't think about death, specifically committing suicide. I even googled it so many ways but google just fucking showed results of this hotline and self-help stuff that I didn't need. I actually tried to live better, like buying and reading those self-help books hoping it would motivate me to live my life to the fullest. Well, I guess it did not work for me then. I even tried to talk to my close friends about my mental health, they showed compassionate, caring, and understanding, but again, things led to nowhere. In the end, even my closest friends couldn't save me anyway. I feel so bad for them, they could've lived happily instead of having to bear such a friend like me, who prevented they from living a good life. If any of my friends read this, I'm sorry, I should've not been your friend in the first place. Sorry for having to bear me for so long. I'm so sorry that you've wasted your time on a person like me, who did not worth it.
I also tried to talk to my parents multiple times. They are the ones that still keeping me alive 'til this day. You have no idea how hard it is to try jumping out of the window so many times, but then have to come back inside because my mind is full of memories of my parents, my mom's voice. I love them so much that I find it guilty if I die. Even so, I can't not blame them for giving birth to me whenever I question my existence. Why giving me life? Why? I just don't understand. I don't deserve this. Why giving birth to me and then you'll be disappointed at me?
I recall a time when my mom shared the same bed with me that night (because my dad was drunk and my mom hated his guts), I was in a really bad mood. I was not okay. I was not fine. My mind was full of suicidal thoughts that I wanted to get rid of but I couldn't. Still I had to sleep with her in my worst condition. I remember facing her back and screaming, yelling but none of the voices came out. I screamed to my mom that ""Save me, mom. Please. I'm not okay. I'm not fine. Please turn around and save me."" and kept repeating it in tears until I was too tired to do that. She didn't know what I was doing in the end. She didn't save me in the end. And I'm still here.
You may wonder why not tell your parents face-to-face? Out loud? I did. I did mention my condition to them that I thought I had to make an appointment with a psychiatrist, maybe he/she would help me somehow. They thought it was a joke. They thought I was being funny, like I always appeared. They said I was probably just a little stressed and there's absolutely no reason for meeting a psychiatrist. 
Well, they're wrong.
I was not fine then and definitely not fine now.
I already planned my future. Graduate, find a job, make money to serve my parents and when they pass away, I'll commit suicide. Until then, which is probably 40 years to come, I'll have to bear this all of my life and I don't know how much I can take it. I even think of living alone, not getting married or having kids, because if I want to die, why would I want to let someone else come into my life? Apparently, the perks of being Asians is that my parents would not let me being single the whole life. Because it isn't right. And now, I seriously don't know how to cope up with this anymore.
I don't post this to search for help, I want to have someone understand me. 
Thank you for reading.
Good night.",20Oct2018,1
63,"‚ÄùI always seem to fall for the girls with psychological issues‚Äù, ‚ÄùI need a little crazy in my life‚Äù, ‚ÄùBroken girls are just more interesting.‚Äù ... Yeah. About that...

You love her hypomania, her kinky sex and high sex drive, her willingness to do whatever, her fun impulsiveness. Her eating disorder makes her body look good and her personality disorder makes her treat you like a god. Her anxiety is cute, you want to hold her when she is sad and vulnerable, you want to protect her from the demons in her head so you can feel like a hero. You want her to need you. 

I get why you want that! It‚Äôs fine to like to feel needed and like you‚Äôre helping someone.

But you don‚Äôt like it when her problems stop being cute. When she can‚Äôt hold down a job, doesn‚Äôt leave her house for days, when her hair is a mess and her eyes have giant bags under them and she hasn‚Äôt showered in almost a week. It annoys you when she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone, her emotions are irrational and childish and she just feels too much. Sometimes she hates you. You have tried everything you can think of for the past week but she isn‚Äôt fine yet. It turns out her depression and anxiety aren‚Äôt cute and don‚Äôt go away with a hug. Her eating habits are terrible and you finally realize that bulimia and anorexia aren‚Äôt cute either. The sexual abuse she was a victim of for years as a child has more consequences than being kinky and letting you get off whenever you want. She has nightmares, flashbacks, trust and intimacy issues and her triggers are everywhere.    
Why is she still hurting herself and why does she want to die, you‚Äôre here, is that not enough for her? Even though she tries her best to be what you want she can‚Äôt live up to it.

You don‚Äôt want a mentally ill girl. You want a manic pixie dream girl who only pays attention to you but isn‚Äôt clingy, who wants to please you (and only you), who is impulsive in a fun way only and who doesn‚Äôt have any strong negative traits or behaviours as a result of their mental illness.    
Good luck finding her, if I were you I‚Äôd start in the young adult section at the library.

^^^^^-

Look, I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre bad people for being mentally ill (because we‚Äôre not) or that you‚Äôre bad people for liking these things. But mental illness isn‚Äôt a cute quirk or personality trait. And the disorders are attached to a human person with their own personality, thoughts, memories and experiences. They aren‚Äôt a DIY project for you to make the perfect person out of. 

You can definitely date mentally ill people. You can be there during recovery, relapses and more recovery. You can be support. But you cannot cure them and magically fix their issues, their illnesses are called illnesses for a reason and you need to realize that. 

Also, I think I need to say this so yeah, obviously it‚Äôs not anyone else‚Äôs responsibility to deal with someone‚Äôs mental issues. If you‚Äôre treated badly by a significant other, even if they‚Äôre doing it as a result of an illness, it‚Äôs not okay and you don‚Äôt deserve that. It might be more difficult for some people to not do bad things but that‚Äôs not an excuse.  Mental illnesses affect us but they don‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt be expected to treat people right.

Mental illness is a part of life. And sure, it‚Äôs good if you can love someone else not despite their issues but including them. But you need to understand what it is and get that romanticized verion out of your head. And please don‚Äôt go around saying you love broken girls. It just makes you sound like an idiot or someone who‚Äôs into vulnerability and apathy because it lets you do whatever unethical shit you want. It‚Äôs not cool.

66,"About 4 months ago, I started realizing I might be bi. I realized I had a crush on a guy I was moderately close friends with (I'm also a guy) and found it really painful when he moved somewhere else and left my life, and I sometimes feel star-struck by other attractive guys I see in public. I've also been dating my girlfriend for a year and a half, who I love and who has been so much more than I deserve. 

I came out to her a bit less than 2 weeks ago. Not because I wanted to or because I wanted to break up and pursue other relationships, but because I felt like it was unfair to her for me to conceal something like that. She was really understanding about it but understandably feeling insecure (I did have a crush on a dude while we were dating after all), and I just felt like a disgusting pile of crap. We talked about the stuff a lot and she seems to be doing alright with the situation, but I'm not. 

Since coming out, I've been stuck in a downward spiral. I feel disgusting and uncomfortable in my sexuality and body (negative body image stuff, not like gender identity stuff), and I've kinda been on and off hating myself since I've come out. She's the only person I've told, and I kinda don't even want to tell anyone else since I don't think anything good will come of that. The idea of cutting myself doesn't appeal to me, but recently I've pounded on my head and legs with the intent of making bruises and hurting myself, and I keep having thoughts about whipping myself in self-harm too but don't have the tools to do it. I feel like I deserve the pain, and it helps me cope with the agonizing emotions of self-disgust, self-hatred, and shame I sometimes feel. It's like watching an instant karma video. It's satisfying because they're getting the punishment they deserve. 

To make things worse, I can't stop thinking about this one guy I'm acquaintances with. I can't decide whether I even like his personality, but regardless I can't stop thinking about his appearance. He is flirting with this one girl he'll probably start dating soon and he's very straight. And despite the fact that he's almost in a relationship and I'm currently in a relationship, whenever I'm around him I feel like I wanna impress him. I want him to like and pay attention to me, even though being around him and even just looking at him is extremely painful to me, as it's a constant reminder of what I want and can't/won't let myself have, and of my feelings of disgust toward myself. I want him to want to be around me but bathe in self-loathing after the fact. And I've caught myself thinking on many occasions about flirting with his to-be-girlfriend as a way of idk, revenge in a way? Or maybe like the concept of ""marrying into a family"" if you will? Like, maybe if I make him hate me or be jealous of me, I'll get more attention from him (negative or not). 

The fact that I even thought about that is deeply upsetting to me, and I feel that anyone who would do something like that is a terrible person (sounds like me though I guess). Idk. I'm just so lost and confused and in pain, and my compassionate and amazing girlfriend is caught in the middle of all this. And to make matters worse, she's the only person in my life I'd feel comfortable talking with about any of this, except all of the details I just said are going to severely damage her self confidence and our relationship health, so instead I just keep it to myself, cry under blankets, and punch my head in self-harm.

I‚Äôve been a fuck up my entire life since high school I haven‚Äôt accomplished anything so I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I need some advice from someone who‚Äôs been through a similar situation and how they overcame it and pursued what they wanted, I need a reality check and please be brutally honest with me.

Basically what i wanted to say is i‚Äôve been getting better, I have a better relationship with myself.

So now i‚Äôm going off the pills i spoke to my doctor. He proposed February, but I really wanna just try and get off. My anxiety is not that bad and i think therapy has and will help.

75,"""Hyper and Hypo Arousal in PTSD

The common conception of PTSD from movies, magazine stories, and other social media is that it involves forms of hyperarousal such as memory intrusions, flashbacks, hypervigilant scanning for reminders of the trauma, excessive startle response, irritability, violent rage, and insomnia due to nightmares, anxiety or agitation. Hyperarousal is tied to living in or intermittently diving back into what Boon, Steele, and Van der Hart (2011) call ‚Äútrauma time‚Äù in their book¬†Coping with Trauma-Related Dissociation. In truth major traumatization gives rise to symptoms of hyperarousal and hypoarousal (Boon, Steele, &amp; Van der Hart, 2011). Hypoarousal is characteristic of dissociative disorders and PTSD. Hypoarousal is associated with the freeze response in mammal mediated by the dorsal vagus nerve when they face a threat to life which they cannot avoid by fighting or fleeing. Hypoarousal is manifested by features like amnesia, emotional and/or physical numbing, depersonalization (feeling estranged from oneself), and derealization (feeling as if the environment is unreal or dreamlike). Hypoarousal makes it difficult or even impossible to experience feelings of love, pleasure or interest. Hypoarousal exists in major depression as the wet blanket that makes the sufferer indifferent to love, friendship, and opportunities for play, amusement or entertainment. However the diagnosis of depression emphasizes the presence of great sadness, dark mood, recurrent thoughts of death, and so on, while the diagnosis of PTSD does not. PTSD is more a disorder of memory, physiology, and interpersonal behavior while depression is primarily a disorder of mood that influences cognition and functions like eating, sleeping, sexual activity, and movement. The neurophysiological key to understanding PTSD is that one and the same sufferer will show hyperarousal when living in or reminded of trauma time and hypoarousal (freeze) as a means of avoiding a return to the trauma memories that feel as if they are happening now. Hyperarousal and hypoarousal are both unconscious, protective responses to trauma that lie at opposite poles of the PTSD continuum. Just as a person with bipolar I disorder can shift back and forth from mania to depression a person with PTSD can switch back and forth between hyper and hypo arousal.""

Has anyone noticed that there is often a lot more focus placed on hyperarousal than hypoarousal?

78,"Sorry guys, this is a long post, but I needed to get it out.

When my therapist first told me what I was diagnosed with, two were no surprise. Major depression and EDNOS, those I expected. I was prepared to deal with those. I was a little shocked though when I heard the third one. I‚Äôm not really a neat person, my papers are messy, my room is messy, half the time I even look messy. I‚Äôm not a germophobe, I‚Äôm not the type to freak out about grades. Nevertheless, after I told her about my symptoms, the diagnosis seemed to stick. 

The specific symptoms that lead her to this conclusion were as follows; I have an issue with people touching me. The severity of the issue varies from time to time, but consistently I feel disgusted by physical contact. When someone touches me, I must scrape it off. I scratch my skin, sometimes to the point of breaking it and leaking blood on to whatever I‚Äôm wearing. The sensation sticks worse on my hair, and on clothes, I‚Äôve changed my clothes because someone touched them, and I couldn‚Äôt wear them again until they were washed several times. My grandmother touched my hair because I was feeling upset, I ended up scratching and brushing my hair until my scalp bled. It stuck to me until I showered. No one is exempt from the traces of stickiness, I don‚Äôt even let my boyfriend touch my legs while I‚Äôm wearing jeans. Denim holds stickiness the longest. This doesn‚Äôt simply extend to physical touch though, noises stick too. Chewing specifically, but also noises of bodily functions. I have to scratch my ear canal to get those out, again often to the point of broken skin. I can‚Äôt use a blanket that has been on someone‚Äôs bare skin until it‚Äôs been washed several times. I can‚Äôt eat or drink out of the same dish as someone else, no tastes of my family‚Äôs food without scratching my lips until I tasted blood. No one could taste my food without me promptly throwing it away.

My therapist said this sounded like OCD to her. I thought I was just overreacting. I didn‚Äôt know my repetitive and incessant thoughts about where I was touched were obsessions. I didn‚Äôt know my scratching, washing clothes, and bleeding were compulsions. I thought they were just overreactions. My family got mad at me for doing these things, everyone was upset when I reacted to their touch in such a negative manner. I knew they were right. I knew nothing was left there, but I could feel it anyways. I knew that I was hurting people, straining relationships. I knew my behavior was abnormal and inappropriate, but I couldn‚Äôt stop. I thought I was just being dramatic. I thought I just needed to get over it. I didn‚Äôt realize that this was a disorder. I didn‚Äôt realize that I could get help. 

It was because I didn‚Äôt turn the lights on and off exactly 37 times a day, because I didn‚Äôt care about orderliness or symmetry, because I didn‚Äôt excessively check that the door was locked before leaving, because I didn‚Äôt care about germs, that I didn‚Äôt know I had an issue. The media tells us that OCD is obvious to the world. It tells us that OCD only appears as an obsession with numbers, cleanliness, and lines. OCD has infinitely many forms. The disorder is extremely diverse, with as many obsessions as there are sufferers. Had I have realized that, I could have told my first therapist four years ago, instead of it coming up by chance after I had been ruining relationships for the past half-decade. 

Society‚Äôs knowledge about mental health comes almost entirely from how it is portrayed in the media. As such, the media has a duty to portray it accurately. To inform the audience that people with OCD aren‚Äôt simply neat freaks, people with schizophrenia aren‚Äôt simply delusional, and people with antisocial personality disorder aren‚Äôt simply monsters. We have real illnesses that need addressing. We are first and foremost people, meaning we are just as diverse and varied as any other demographic, barring the diagnostic criteria. Please stop simplifying, minimizing, and demonizing us as if our whole identity hinged on a disorder. Help us identify disorders, help us get the help we need. We aren‚Äôt the antagonists of your next horror movie, we are people. Just like you. ",20Oct2018,1

It got worse. At some point, I was barely hearing her and there were NO background noises. Just her voice. It felt like there was a huge glass wall between her and me. Her voice sounded ... kinda muffled ?

88,"The deep dark place

Recently I learnt about the deep dark place. It‚Äôs a place that people have heard about, but you don‚Äôt know about the deep dark place until you‚Äôve been to the deep dark place.

Space is to gravity what the deep dark place is to emotions. When you are in the deep dark place you feel nothing. Not happy, not nervous, not scared, not excited; nothing. You feel numb. You don‚Äôt want to do anything and you think that the shallow light place, the only escape from the deep dark place, is sleep. You feel like you can only be in the deep dark place or the shallow light place and that there is no in between. Both are very similar as you feel nothing in both, but, in the shallow light place you are unconscious and so whilst you still are numb you aren‚Äôt aware of the numbness. Whereas in the deep dark place you are completely conscious. You know that you used to know feelings and know that feelings exist but you can‚Äôt feel them. And you know that you can‚Äôt feel them. And you can‚Äôt feel frustration but you feel as if you should be frustrated. Well not feel, you know that most people would feel frustrated at this but don‚Äôt understand why you aren‚Äôt. 

Over time the deep dark place can become the same deep dark place but the room now has a few cushions in it that are comfy to sit, on so you think hmm I guess I could stay here for a little while longer, gradually a bed forms and a sofa and a bean bag. The deep dark place is cosy and you no longer think you should be frustrated at not feeling anything you think hmm I guess I could just stay here forever, so you do, because you think the walls are high and slippery and you could never get out, but now do you want to get out? 

People have heard of the deep dark place but they don‚Äôt know about it until they are in it. 

Whilst you are in the deep dark place you may call out to people you can see at the top and try and tell them more about the deep dark place, they‚Äôve only heard about it but they don‚Äôt know about it. And they don‚Äôt understand why you won‚Äôt just come out of it and then tell them about it. You try to explain that the walls are high and slippy but they say that it‚Äôs only a couple of inches deep and you could easily step out. You don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt see the deep dark place that you can its not a couple of inches deep its miles and why do they think its so easy to climb out when you see it as impossible. 

And so you sit, on the floor, on the cushions, the bed the sofa and you lay there. You‚Äôre in the deep dark place and you will never get out. Sometimes you cry, a lot of the time you cry. But not because you are sad. You just cry and you don‚Äôt really have an explanation as to why. 

Minutes can feel like hours, hours like days and days like months. You don‚Äôt know how long you‚Äôve been in the deep dark place. Have you ever not been in the deep dark place? 

Then one day at the top you see someone holding a candle looking at you. And they say wow, the deep dark place is miles down and the walls are slippy. And you say yes, yes they are. 

For once someone can see what you see. They don‚Äôt try to tell you to climb out, to tell you how easy to climb out it is. They just let you know that they can see the place; that they can see you. And with them telling you that, the deep dark place feels slightly less deep and slightly less dark.

For once, it feels.

She has more energy, she is healthier, and has more energy. Fast forward a few months and my wife has said she doesn't think our marriage is complete and looking back we have never had a ""flirty""lustful stage in our relationship. Thinking back I can't remember if we had that period either. We decided to live separately while our house is being built to try to create that aspect of our marriage. 

Through all this I have been at the lowest point in my life I am constantly switching moods for depressed, to happy, to hopeful, to mad. I have stopped drinking because even a beer gets me in believably low. We are considering ourselves to be boyfriend and girlfriend right now.

It seems like I can't do anything right it's only been 3 weeks but it seems like we haven't been going on dates and that hanging out and watching a movie or talking isn't really dating. I have had a lot of self doubt, insecurity, and low self esteem. I am seeing a therapist which helps tremendously but no matter what I find myself in a fog throughout the week. 

I'm just tired of constantly being sad, of being low, I wish I just knew what to do...

95,"Since graduating from college and working for a few months I've decided I wanted to start seeing a therapist again, but I contacted about a dozen that my insurance covers and all of them say that they don't have any slots open with my schedule, which is not very flexible and has to exist around my job and its commute (it can't be any time on a weekday 7:30 AM - 6:30 PM). I think this makes things kinda difficult because those are the hours when most therapists operate. How did you manage to find someone that works with your schedule?",20Oct2018,1
96,"Has anyone here ever asked themselves that question?

I find myself at a point in my life where I don‚Äôt really know who I am. I feel like nothing really brings me happiness or joy. I spend most of my time either at work or in my apartment alone. I don‚Äôt really know what I value, or what my real beliefs are. I know what I‚Äôve been told they are, and I‚Äôve been told what my personality is, but, I sometimes feel like maybe that‚Äôs all fake.  I suppose I should note that I have diagnosed depression and generalized anxiety disorder. 

If you‚Äôve asked yourself this question, or felt the same way, what did you do? Or how did you go about answering that question? ",20Oct2018,1

98,"A couple weeks ago I posted on here about not being able to do much of anything. I was depressed, anxious and my DID was pretty bad. Now i'm waking up at a decent time, making my bed, doing laundry, going out every so often and enjoying life.",20Oct2018,1
99,"I am starting to become worried my aunt has some sort of mental problem going on. She thinks her kids and ex husband are hacking her phone, stealing from her bank account, breaking into her home, and that acquaintances are going to kill her. Every time she calls or comes around any of us she will repeat the same things about all of this. It is a never ending loop. We have all looked at her phone and the things she complains about are apps that come with the phone. She messes with her phone so much she has it messed up. We can all see this. She has contacted several agencies regarding these matters and nothing has come about from it. She has been in a 72 hour mental evaluation at the hospital and surprising to us she was let go (this was after she told people she was going to kill herself). She has a history of drug and alcohol abuse and has some damage in her frontal part of brain from that, as well as thyroid issues. She has abused benzodiazepines in the past. I do not know how to get her the proper help. I am worried that she can be taken advantage of or hurt. This obsession that everybody is out to get her is ridiculous and it is all she ever speaks of. There is nothing there but that coming from her. Any advice will be appreciated.   ",20Oct2018,1
100,"I was diagnosed with depression when I was young and have had to deal with it ever since, it has ups and downs but during a perticularly bad down I had my first experience with LSD and although my experience was positive and I tried it multiple times after I started to notice that I had a need to control every aspect of my life and that ultimately I have absolutely zero control over anything, this realisation really fucked me mentally and I've been on a steady decline since. I can't tell if what's going on is some long term sideaffect of the drug itself or just me realising something I wasn't prepared to deal with. Anyone had or known someone to have a similar experience? Any help is appreciated ",20Oct2018,1
101,I can't stop think about somethings ,20Oct2018,1
102,"Background:

Ever since I was little, my relationship with my mom was rocky. Her expectations of me exceeded anything I have ever seen before. Every other day she would scream at me or whip me with a belt for the tiniest of infractions. I looked at her the wrong way, I would get beat. I had a funny smile on my face, so that meant I was thinking about boys. So, she would scream at me for being a slut. I just thought she was extremely strict and on a subconscious level that I was kind of a bad kid and deserved it. And no, sometimes I did do something bad. But I don't think mental torture or physical violence is the answer.

After I left to go to college, she still managed to control and manipulate my life indirectly. Usually using money to make me do what she wanted. This is around the time I started to realize she wasn't just odd or strict or not that American, but exhibited some kind of mental illness. 

Once I payed off my student loans and all my other debt, she started to get worse. I think she realized she had less control over me. 

Mental illness symptoms she exhibits:

1) Extremely paranoid - always thinking everyone is out to get her and at the slightest sign someone isn't perfect, completely writes them off

2) Completely denying she ever beat or abused me as a child. Almost like she has no memory of it. But it lasted for over a decade.

3) Thinking other people have mental illness if they don't do what she wants. Or assuming they are a bad person. Ex. Her neighbor is annoyed she makes him move his trash cans out of the driveway and he gets visibly frustrated with her trying to control his life...so she says ""he's not a nice person"". Next day it escalates to ""he's a jerk."" Next day ""he's abusive to me."" Next day ""he's a psychopath and I'm scared for my life"" - All from the one interaction 

4) I don't know how to articulate this, but I will give an example. She sees a former classmate of mine. Finds out that despite being well out of high school, he still plays the guitar, paints, and plays baseball in his free time after work. She realizes I don't do these things anymore (I work a lot and honestly even if I wanted to don't have the time). Ten minutes later she is yelling at me for not having accomplished anything. She continues this rant for an hour. I finally snap and tell her to leave me alone and that I cannot stand her. She cries and tells me I am a terrible daughter. Next day I do something good and suddenly it's ""I'm so proud of you"".

5) Contacts me about ten times each day, whether it is e-mail, calls, texts. Gets angry when I don't reply, but only talks about how much of a screw up I am and dictates what I must do. 

Anyways, any ideas? I feel like I need to figure out what exactly all of this is before I can do a whole lot about it.

103,"People are always saying guys just need to open up more and speak to people and get their emotions out, but whenever I talk to someone about my issues whether it be a therapist or friend I just feel like shit about myself and about the problems I have and it never makes me feel better it normally makes me feel worse. Anyone else feel this way or have tips to get past this?",20Oct2018,1
104,"So, this story starts out pretty normal. When I was younger, I would listen and listen and listen to music over and over and over. I grew older, and when I was 5, started to pursue the arts. I learned how to play the saxophone, flute, bass clarinet, piano, violin, and cello by the time I was 15. 

I'm a big fan of music like I said. One of my favorite bands is fall out boy. Whenever fall out boy released their new album and crank that frank did that crazy thing by dying himself purple and everybody started associating purple with fall out boy, I realized I was different. I was talking to my friend about what crank that frank did, and she said, ""Fall out boy is only associated with purple after this. They never had a color until now."" That confused me so much. I told her, ""Fall out boy has always sounded like an orange. The true purple is panic! at the disco."" She gave me a really confusing look and told me I was sick and crazy. Is this normal? Is associating colors with bands and music normal? I've always considered beautiful jazz music to be golden, like most of the brass instruments. They make a golden sound. Crazy jazz music is a neon green, it makes me want to dance and laugh and have fun. 

I've considered numbers and letters colors too. A is red, B is blue. 3 is red, 12 is blue. I thought this was normal?

I never told anyone any of those things until the past few years since the new fall out boy album because I always thought other people thought it too. But now that my friend told me that music can't sound like a color, I've gotten confused. I've tried looking on the internet, but nothing has happened! I haven't gotten any promising results! I've tried asking my doctors and my ADHD therapist, but they've gotten so confused. They all think I'm crazy. I've asked my teachers, my friends, everyone I can think of. But nobody knows, they all think I'm just a lunatic.

I've turned here because I heard you can solve mysteries, reddit. I know this isn't probably a mystery, but please help. I don't want to look crazy. Or am I just crazy? PLEASE. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP. I'm desperate because all my friends don't want to be around me. Everyone thinks I'm schizophrenic and that I'm going insane. AM I GOING INSANE? Please, reddit. I need to know if I need to see a doctor.

108,They've been planning for a couple of weeks now and they said that the place we just moved into a year ago that it was going to be the last home we have because we bought it. On top of that I got a girlfriend who I have been with for about a year too and she said that she can't have long distance and won't do it for 3 years (when I turn 18 to move back) and my parents is making me put the stuff I want in a moving box (it's only one box btw) and I have so many collectibles of movies anime games ect.

110,"I am having a bit of an existential crisis and I need to vent badly; my existance is, in the grand scheme of things, pointless, no matter how great the things I do. I could do whatever I want and in 200 years I will be forgotten. 

I have so many ambitions yet none of it matters, and life is only so long. If only I could actually socialise properly and actually find meaning in what I do. I feel like I am an outsider looking in on everything, and it's not great. Even at the most peaceful of times I percieve chaos, or my mind flutters idly towards dark thoughts. 

I even used to have dreams, when I still dreampt, where shapes of ungodly forms would just interlap and conjoin, and they would be massive, they felt massive, and I'd wake up crying because there was simply no meaning in it. 

I don't know what this whole buisness is of being alive, but it's not the best thing I've ever heard of, in my opinion, and I certainly find no entertaining value to it.",20Oct2018,1
