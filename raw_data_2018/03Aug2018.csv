0,"Title. TW: suicide. 

Context: been in therapy for 7 years, with about 5 different therapists. 

Depression, PTSD. Diagnosed about 4~ years ago. 

So. I just want to know what the point of therapy is because I’ve been doing this for almost a decade without much to show for it. I’m alive. That’s what I have to show for it, which may seem like a huge victory but I’m still left living a life where I’m so unhappy and full of pain. My suicidal ideation is more prominent lately (always there, but now it’s LOUD) and I’m very frustrated being stuck in this cycle of suicidal feelings—brief escape—more suicidal feelings—some reprieve—etc. 

I don’t know if this makes sense, but I want to know what I’m supposed to be getting out of therapy. Been doing IFS for about 2 months, but tried psychoanalysis for 3 yrs, and talk therapy with a LCSW for 2. 

Allow me to respond to common refrains: 

Reframing things. Doesn’t work for me as a healing or coping strategy because as soon as I step outta the therapist’s door, my head goes back to its usual bullshit of seeing shit in black and white and knowing I’m a failure, disappointment, and worthless excuse of a human being. 

Affirmation/validation. Okay—who cares if I’m heard? I know I’m right about my feelings. I know the situation with my brothers is unbelievable, I know my life is hard, there’s a lot of pain, and suffering, and so much abuse that isn’t being addressed, blah blah blah. Great. The pain is still there, and how we’re both feeling bad for me. What now?

I’m a bit frustrated. Feeling very hopeless and suicidal. Just want to know what’s the point of carrying on with therapy if I could just save myself a lot of money each week. 

PS: I’m safe and not a danger to myself right now, and if I need to, will go to the ER. ",03Aug2018,2
1,"I've been getting really bad health wise lately, really tired, fatigued, and it's been getting hard to stand up or breathe sometimes, I get constant headaches and migraines too. I've gone to the doctors about it and nothing. I'm perfectly fine apparently, nothing poisoning my blood nor do I have low blood pressure or anything like that. 
My SO mentioned that it could all just be in my head. He may be right I don't know, I'm legitimately struggling with this and it's frustrating me, and it's worse if it's something that I'm making up without knowing it.  I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do to prevent this and I don't know how to fix it. 
I'm just fucked up. ",03Aug2018,1
2,I love to just rerun my entire day to make sure I didn’t do anything embarrassing lol. It’s kind of obsessive. I do this a lot before bed. I can see why it may be a good thing in order to improve my personal skills but it causes me so much anxiety! I’ve always had anxiety about embarrassing myself in social situations. Perhaps any advice?,03Aug2018,1
3,"I wasn't sure how to phrase this, nor do I really know what I'm looking for, except to share my situation. I'm a man in my mid-20's living in Sweden. I have been dealing with recurring depression and anxiety since I was about 13, with on-and-off medicating. I also suffer from mild-ish ADD, which I medicate effectively.

But the bigger issue in my life is, in a sense, physical disability. I suffer from a super-rare congenital disease that causes me moderate-to-severe chronic pain, fatigue, and some other issues (e.g. wear-and-tear). It got worse in my early 20's and put some pretty heavy constraints on my lifestyle in order to manage the pain and fatigue. For the past four years, I have been pursuing an education in physics full-time. Because of my disability, I have generally been forced to do most of my studying from home, leading to a great deal of involuntary solitude. I have made various efforts to still make friends and keep touch with people, but I have found that it is largely impossible in that context as it's incredibly difficult to stay relevant in people's minds when you can't be present on a day-to-day basis. And now I'll be pursuing the last year of my Master's degree, so it's a moot point anyway. My plan after that is to work out a PhD position one way or another.

I have simplified some aspects of the above background, because what is really relevant is how the situation I've found myself in - an everyday life of making immense efforts to complete my courses without having access to lectures and regular interaction with other students - has drained me \_immensely\_ over the past four years. I've found myself in a position where my life essentially consists of trying to drag myself out of bed, trying to get through my depression fog, study for as many hours as possible, try to sleep, rinse, repeat. I have done my best to maintain \_some\_ other interests, mainly reading and videogaming, and I also play a bit of piano, but I can't recall the last time I really enjoyed doing any of that. Most of it is distraction. Often, it ends up being distraction late at night when my anxiety tends to be at its worst. And at times, it's distraction from the fact that my existence feels totally surreal. I've also done my best to maintain some friends I can text and chat with, but that has also largely turned into a reality check/emotional support as opposed to meaningful social interaction.

My anxiety and intrusive thoughts can get very, very bad. Often, it concerns particular events in my past, with the recurring theme that if I'd only done x, I wouldn't be stuck in this maddening routine. Or, what does it matter what I do or accomplish, nothing will ever make up for the fact that I'm disabled. Obviously, these have some grounding in reality, and also a dramatized component: I've made mistakes, and some (many, honestly) people have treated me poorly in various ways because of my disability. On the other hand, I've still managed to make the best of my situation and used the gifts I do have very effectively.

The maddening thing about it is, I can't seem to get out of it. I can't get out of this constant sense of mental an emotiional exhaustion. I've medicated my depression with bupropion for a number of years; it doesn't seem to dissipate. Objectively, I'm dealing with it well - I don't self-harm, I get everything I need to done, and I do my best to use the few opportunities for social interaction that I have. But I still find myself, after years of this, in a position unable to enjoy things. Often sleepless due to anxiety. Unable to feel pride or satisfaction about my accomplishments. Unable to get rid of my constant sense of unease about the situation. Unable to get rid of the frustration that my involuntary solitude causes. And also unable to really care that much about it.

I don't know what to do anymore except continue to try and complete my education (I only have my thesis left, which will be much less stressful than coursework since I can structure it differently) which is something I'll be doing just by habit. Having no ""work"" to do for the past few months over the summer has driven me halfway insane too, despite doing my best to pursue hobbies, consider it well-needed rest, et cetera, so I don't think taking time off would help me either. Relatively simple partial remedies like more exercise, trying to get out more, picking up hobbies is not really viable with my condition, or things I've spent the past few years doing with no real success.

I don't want to spend the rest of my life stubbornly pushing myself to work effectively despite my disease while being in a constant state of mental suffering or fatigue. I want to actually enjoy things, not just do them to distract myself from anxiety. But I don't know how to square that with the difficulties and demands life places on me, and the ineffectiveness of the remedies I've been trying over the past few years.

And that leaves me feeling nothing but empty, confused, and incomplete as a human being.",03Aug2018,4
4,"Tried asking on r/askwomenadvice but got nothing but snarky answers. So anyway about 48 weeks ago, I messaged this woman ""Rose"" on a social media site, I am in California, she is in Nevada. We talked for maybe 5 minutes and I sent the last message, but did not get a response. So I sent 4 follow up messages (44 weeks, 36 weeks, 30 weeks and 28 weeks) and finally get a response at 28 weeks ago. We talked for much longer this time and made plans to meet when I was in town to visit family. During our long talk, she mentions that "" I'm so sorry I've been terrible at keeping in touch with you."" and when I apologize for spamming her with those four messages she says "" And don't even think about saying sorry for spamming me. Sometimes it  takes multiple messages for me to even remember to get on and check this  site.""

So we exchange numbers and text a little bit where Rose mentions that she has a tendency to isolate and ignore without realizing, it is a depression habit. We meet in person and go on an introductory date when Rose reveals all of her ticks and her past. PTSD, depression, suicidal tendencies, trama and flashbacks. We end up going on another date the next day and end up spending a night in together. The next morning I take her to therapy and lunch, then head back home on Jan 31. 

We texted a couple messages daily about every other day until Feb 10, where I did not get a response. I send texts about once month or maybe two weeks and still do not hear back. Around Easter I call and leave a voicemail, because it was the anniversary of her trama, I said if she need to talk to call me and I mentioned that I care about her and have some feelings for her. About a few days later, I haven't heard back and send a text asking if she got the voicemail, she responds and mentions that date really doesn't cause any problems for her. 

Since then I have not heard back and still send a text a month. So given all the background and tendencies, I am being ghosted or is this related to the depression and other things",03Aug2018,1

6,"Hello,

 l was wondering if someone could give me advice.  I have been going to this place since 2016.  I am thinking maybe it's time to leave though.  I like my therapist and doctor  there,  but the place is disorganized.  They don't bill promptly so I have no clue how much I owe.  Also there have been times when I have gone there only to be told I didn't have an appointment even though my appointment card said I did.  Monday I went and didn't get to see the therapist bc my insurance requires a doctor to be in the building and there wasn't one there.  I didn't know this until I got there.  I really am thinking of leaving bc of the disorganization and its stressful, but am torn because I like my therapist and Doc but it sucks to go in and be prepared for an appointment only to have to go back home. Anyone ever dealt with this or a similar situation?",03Aug2018,1

I have enough empathy to feel guilt for these actions, but not enough yet to avoid doing them.

Though I can still ride a motorbike and not get nervous but whenever. But whenever I kneel, put pressure on the knee or take a sharp turn on the motorbike I get nervous and my mind takes me back to the crash. I’ve been thinking I’m imagining it but when I talk to people about it they say it might be PTSD, I suffer from diagnosed clinics depression and anxiety so I thought it was probably that.

10,"Everytime I think about it I feel sick. I've cared for the elderly and volunteered in a hospital but for some reason when it comes paid work I freak out. Everytime I'm looking at jobs my thought process is 1. Look for enough pay/hours to pay the bills. 2. Make sure I know where it is and how long it would take me to get there. 3. Checking to see how much training I would get so I'm not just thrown in and 4. Making sure no previous experience is required.
I get through looking at the job and deciding it's good but when it comes to applying my stomach goes crazy and it gets really hard to breathe so I just put it in the save pile.. There are now 26 in the last two days saved. I keep getting told that I'll get use to the job I pick which sounds like they're telling me to get over my anxiety just like that.

I don’t know when I became such a pushover. I used to be so headstrong and resilient. Now I just lay down and let people walk all over me and dwell on it for however long. I think I started changing when I was 15. I got into a relationship with a man who was 23. I let him abuse me for 6 years. I ended up with severe depression, anxiety and PTSD. Fucked me up. Stockholm syndrome is real. Once I left the relationship, I  realized how incredibly ridiculous it was of me to stay for so long. I blame myself for how I’ve turned out. I blame myself for letting that man abuse me for so long. I should have left. I just couldn’t though. He’d reel me back in and I was so young and so stupid, I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t know the turmoil I was causing within myself. I believed him every time he said he wouldn’t do it again. After that relationship, I am a pushover. I don’t want that anymore. I want to be my old unyielding self. I don’t know how to get back to that though. ",03Aug2018,1

16,I've held on to these grudges where I believe my manhood was tested. What I mean by that is for example in Highschool some guy punched me in the chest for no reason.

It just still hurts me to this day that I didn't defend myself. I have no idea why I am so hurt by it. Mind you Highschool for me was over a decade ago. I feel weak and pathetic and less of a man.

17,"This is gonna be a long one. I'm 18, miserable, and feel like I've reached a dead end in life... I almost feel empty, just really useless, I'm pretty apathetic, too. How I got here is still sort of a mystery to me... But I can pretty much tell where alot of it started. When I was 13 I saw this video by Vsauce, ""Is anything real?"". That's what it was about, that life could be a dream or some computer program and no matter how hard a person tries they can't really disprove it. This fucked with my head, I thought I was alone in the universe... I had 24/7 panic attacks and at it's worst nothing felt real at all. The benefit was that I never took my loved ones for granted, I learned how truly precious they were. After that I started suffering, and I really do mean suffering, with what I have now. ""What if I punched my dad in the face for no reason at all... Or my little brother."". Those are the tame thoughts... And they fuck with my head. Why would I think that? Does something deep from within me actually want to do it? It's gotten to a point where I can't even hold babies anymore for fear that I might throw them, I keep my hands in my pockets really whenever I'm around anyone so I'm not at risk of hurting them in some sort of psychotic break. It sucks. It makes work almost unbearable. It makes trying to have a fun time unbearable. I can't even see someone laugh without wondering what would happen if I punched them in their unsuspecting state, I fear it will happen. I really just envy my life before this all started, when I could just laugh and have a good time for real... This shit is on my mind all the time, and it's actually worse when everyone's in a good mood, because I know just how fragile and innocent the situation is, and how easily it could be broken with some freak accident. I hate going to amusement parks for this very reason, an innocent time can be obliterated with some roller coaster accident or kids falling off or someone getting trapped in gears... I just can't stand the thought of it. Is this how psychotic breaks happen? Some dude so freaked out of something happening that like an OCD tick he makes it come true in his dream-like state of terror? I'm losing sleep sleep because of it... I'm withdrawing socially because of it, and I'm already a socially awkward guy. I just feel crazy. And any monster on the news or in movies I fear becoming, I just can't fucking keep it in anymore, I need to tell someone. Please help. Anyone please help.

18,"What's the weird thing you ask?

I'm a 21 Y/O male, and just today I learned that I have an older sister. I currently live with my mom and stepdad, and my mom and biological dad had me, obviously. The reason I never knew about my sister was because my mother never told me about her, probably because of the bad memories of the breakup with her and my dad. My mom said my biological father was abusive, angry, and had anxiety issues. I think she said that he threatened to or actually did kick her? I obviously don't want to ask. My mom never told me who my dad was or what he did, because she wanted to protect me, I'd assume?

My mom and my sister (my biological father's daughter), according to my sister, had a good relationship. I want to tell my mother that I found out about her, but I really don't know how to. I've obviously never met my sister, but I mean what's there to lose? I will only agree to meet her without seeing my father.

Well, I don't have the best relationship with my stepdad. Even though I'm 21, he accused me of 'backtalking' him awhile back when I tried explaining my feelings and opinion. My stepdad has also threatened to hit me before over ridiculous shit. He's an alright guy, but obviously I don't deserve to be threatened. 

The sad part is, my sister thinks my biological father is psychotic or something. He was abused by his father, and my mom claimed my dad denied I was his son when a stranger complimented them on how cute of a baby I was. That's not good obviously. 

Anyway, I have some anxiety issues. I think I have OCD because of the ""what if"" thoughts and questions, and self-doubt, etc. I think I specifically have intrusive thoughts regarding morality and logical issues. For instance, one worry of mine is:

&gt;Oh no, I had abusive parents and I heard child/adult children of abusive parents are abusive themselves, so what if I become abusive?

&gt;I worried if it was possible to become psychotic or lose contact with reality because I heard my father was like that?

&gt;I worried if I got angry at someone, I could lose my temper and harm them.

I think all of my obsessions are just things I fear and I shouldn't read too much into them. We obviously know that people who are violent/abusive claim nothing is wrong with them, and I'm literally worried if it's possible to ever get to that point, so I think I'm just worrying too much. 

I'm obviously not a bad person, and I want to do good in the world, but I feel like my anxiety/OCD gets in the way. I think I suffer from the 'Pure O' type.

How should I handle telling my mom I started talking to my sister?",03Aug2018,2

20,"As someone how struggles with mental health I have always been very cautious about keeping my emotions to myself. This is part because of a reaction to the stuff that I have gone through since I was young, my culture and family, and part personality to be very secretive. In western culture at least we often all ask each other, ""How are you doing?"" as a part of a greeting or even if you're passing someone quickly in public sometimes. I can say that as a majority we often say either, ""good"", ""not much,"" or we just move on into conversation. During my more rough patches I was admitted into a program for severe depression and suicidal thoughts. This is not an exaggeration when I say they asked me how I was doing every hour. Now when someone asks me that relative combinations of words or thought in their greeting, I hate it and realized how often people are lying. Often times we don't (as a majority) answer that question honestly to the person asking, we just continue on with the conversation and never really answer it. Why? Sure it may be small talk but isn't dishonestly answering that question and person essentially lying to yourself and your truth. I guess that may just be my opinion. 

I personally felt even before going through that program that I felt untruthful to the person asking and myself. I tried answering honestly a few times to some friends and closer co-workers and having answered them during some of the most stressful times, you can imagine that it didn't go that smoothly compared to if I were to have answered with the typical reply options.

Although I feel wrong and sometimes annoyed when I answer with the normal responses, I understand why. Its just polite. Personally for me as well is that I do not want to be a burden to anyone.

I think that our way of communicating and understanding one another would be so much more different if we all asked only if we genuinely wanted to ask and answered genuinely. I think that we would all be more accepted of our emotions and that talking to others is an option in good or bad times. There would also be larger and more open conversations of who we are as people rather than hiding it from one another.

Have any of you tried answering that question of ""how are you?"" honestly? If you have, for how long? How did it go? Would you consider challenging yourself by answering honestly when people ask?",03Aug2018,1
21,"I always think to myself, “Am I being abused my my parents?” And the reason for that is because I don’t know. Almost everyone I know says I am but I don’t want to put my dad and step mom in a position where they feel like I do. My step mother is very...angry. I would often get hit the most and yelled at the most growing up. Once at 11 years old, my step mom bought a big bag of Hot Cheetos and told me not to open it or touch it because I’ve been know for taking food. I did touch it but I restrained myself from taking any. When she came home the bag was open and she yelled at me and forced me to eat the entire bag. I was crying as she constantly yelled at me and said if I didn’t eat it she would hit me. She got pissed off and I didn’t finish the bag and I ran upstairs crying. My sister came to the stairs and said that she opened the bag. But she was never punished. I would also constantly hear my sister and mom fight in my room. I would turn the tv up loud so I don’t have to hear it. When I was 13 I was grounded because of my performance in school and I wasn’t allowed to go the pool and was basically locked in my room for the summer. She would always say, “I’m leaving to go to the pool don’t leave your room.” There were times where I look out my window seeing my family have fun in the backyard and I can’t do anything. Many times I cried myself to sleep. Every Friday after school I had to vacuum the house and it was never good enough. I had to use a small hand held vacuum to clean the whole house and sometimes I would cry in the process. To this day at 17 years old she still give me shit for doing a shitty job. She makes sure to say shitty a lot. At 16 I tried to kill myself because I couldn’t take my parents constant yelling. Sometimes for no reason. Whenever anyone raises their hand next to me I always flinch, it’s an instinct because I would always get hit. And I was mocked for the way I tried to defend myself from the beatings. I still do it. I gave up on drawings because they never took my art seriously. In school no matter how much I improved they still were not impressed. Last year I had a 32% in math and was on the path for failure but I brought it up to a 60% and passed all my classes and Aced almost every final. They weren’t impressed because I still had a D. They prevent me from being at a friends house for a long period of time yet they tell me to go outside and talk to people. My father literally told me many times that he does not care and his job as a father is to provide 1 meal a day which he doesn’t even do that my mom makes dinner and sometimes she doesn’t even do that. I microwave everything. When my sister was still living with us my mom would buy McDonalds for her and my sister but I had to reheat leftovers from sometimes 3 nights ago. It dosent sound like a big deal but it was to me. I am mocked for how I feel. Even called a bitch for speaking up when saying to my sister to stop beating me down when I say something. I don’t get a chance to speak in my house. If I say something someone interrupts and if I do get a word in they tell me to shut up or call me stupid or what I have to say isn’t important.

23,"I have finally become aware of the dark, sad, lethargic &amp; unmotivated darkness I’ve had cloaked over my face the last few months, almost a year now. 
Before I fell into the place, I was motivated to attend a local yoga class; I really enjoyed pushing myself and watching myself find progress in my journey. Sometime in September something clicked in me that had me feeling anxious about leaving the house and going to my weekly yoga. So I kept telling myself “Okay, tomorrow you’re going to go?” And as soon as I were off work, there I go.. home to sit on the couch while my fiancé went off to work the 9-5 graveyard shift at a brewery. This is what I believe to have been the reason that I stopped doing things I loved, because I’d be going home to an empty bed and we wouldn’t see each other much because I worked 9-5 so it wasn’t a lot of time to catch each other up on their days. After he’d go to work, I still couldn’t talk myself into going to yoga so i put it off until we moved, four months later. He eventually got off over nights &amp; I still didn’t go. Now I’m terrified to go. I’ve allowed anxiety to overpower my actions; I could do yoga in my living room, I just choose not too. I feel more motivated going to on that allowing myself that option to give up in my living room. 

From here on out, I’m looking out for the best for me &amp; my future, with my fiancé by my side. 

I live in La Mesa CA if anyone has any cheap recommendations for affordable yoga classes in the area - it’d be much appreciated! Namaste

24,"I had a traumatic experience fairly recently that triggered a huge amount of anxiety. 

At first I was handling things fairly well, but then I began experiencing dissociative symptoms like brain fog. 

Over the year following the trauma I’ve become severely depressed, and anxious to the point that my thoughts are racing 24/7. It’s becoming very difficult to sleep and focus at work. The only way I can sometimes calm my thinking mind is through meditation or yoga. 

I had been getting by like this, but two or three days ago something terrifying happened. I don’t really know how to describe it. My brain just sort of started “thinking” by itself. Like my own thoughts were trying to talk to me. 

The first time it happened I was trying to fall asleep so I assumed it was just a weird kind of lucid dream, but the other night it happened again. This time I was awake and the thoughts were totally uncontrollable. I was cooking and they were telling me to hurt myself with the knife on the counter. It got so bad that I started thinking and talking back to them trying to get them to stop. 

I have no idea what’s going on. I’m so scared it’s going to happen again and I can’t make myself call to schedule a therapy appointment. I called earlier, but the receptionist said I would need to have a phone consultation with the doctor and I wimped our while I was on hold.

Is this serious? Or am I just overreacting? I don’t know I feel like no one is going to believe me if I tell them about this or they’re just going to think I’m doing it for attention. ",03Aug2018,2
25,"So I’m facing some anorexic tendencies, social anxiety and slight depression. I find that when I talk to other people who deal wit the same issues as me, we can both agree that we see the pain in the world and we try our alleviate the hurt from everyone and carry it ourselves. For example, I’m a really passive person because I just hate seeing people disappointed. So if they ask me to go somewhere, I’ll do it anyways even if I don’t want to just so that I don’t hurt that persons feelings. Or if things do go bad we always tend to blame ourselves, even if there’s no chance in hell it could be. 

Am I explaining why I’m trying to ask well enough??

29,"So long story short - I’ve been diagnosed with Body Dysmorphic Disorder and have been seeing my therapist for a little over a month now. We’ve had about 5 sessions and I *thought* we were a good fit but now I’m not so sure he thinks the same?

At my last session, we spoke about how I find it hard to believe I have BDD because I genuinely believe my face is extremely ugly - he told me to consider that others don’t see me that way, that my view of myself is totally inaccurate, etc. Then near the end of the session, he suggested I consider inpatient treatment or at the very least, going to a place that has a therapist I can see 5 days a week. I was pretty confused, because it’s not like I mentioned I was suicidal or can’t take care of myself. 

I figure if my case was too much or he was frustrated with my lack of progress, he would’ve just referred me to a different (outpatient) therapist so idk. He did set another appointment with me next week, so I guess I can get more info then but just curious for others’ opinions. Thanks in advance to anyone who comments. ",03Aug2018,2

39,"First of all hi.

I'll get straight to the point. I'm suffering from a very severe albeit flactuating disorder that got worse over the years. I am diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder although I worry that I am misdiagnosed, as I only seem to have compulsions that manifest in the form of a sensation of energy in my body, rather than an intrusive thought that I try to make go away by performing ritualistic behaviour.

I'm worrying that my disorder is neurological. Like I said above I experience a strong sensation of energy, really uncomfortable pent up energy anywhere from my tailbone, vocal cords, tips of my fingers, heels, knees or virtually any part of my body, which shapes the form of my tics accordingly. 

My tics contstantly change shape, and seemingly for the worse. A year ago I had begun working in England as a care assistant, not suspecting my tics would pose much of an issue as i felt fine, only to have a meltdown in midst of work and being politely told I can't work there anymore upon admitting my condition. Similarly I quit a job earlier this year and quit another 2 days ago because my urge to perform compulsions and the accompanying anxiety were too strong.

I feel humiliated and ashamed because I borderline cannot work, yet I want to, and don't want to hide behind my disorder. I'm searching for jobs where I will move around more, have more space to perform my compulsions and where eyes won't be upon me so much. Due to the nature of my disorder, I do not deal well with stress at all.

I am on medication that has been changed several times. I'm consulting my psychiatrist and taking my medication regularly, but my medication seems to have no effect at all, especially in stressful situations. It seems to be absolutely useless.

Please, if anyone could have an idea of what I could do or who I could turn to, let me know. If there are online forums where I could consult a professional for a second opinion or somebody with a similar story, as I see that to be the only alternative, albeit a longshot, do let me know.

I live in Croatia, and the full extent of the quality of mental health as opposed to the rest of the world is unknown to me, I can only get very sparse appointments with my psychiatrist and he tries out medication on me that does not seem to work at all.

I'm stuck, desperate, devastated and utterly afraid for my life. I can't live and prosper without work, I barely manage to keep myself sane and my tics in check when I am at home and free to do what I want.",03Aug2018,1
40,"I’ve always had anxiety problems, and my  2 siblings have strange social nuances as well. I know for a fact that my problems stem from my obsession with seeming normal and fitting in amongst my peers, and that stemmed from the fact that my home life was very violent and I wanted to hide it. From 4th-6th grade I was afraid of going home after school because I didn’t know whether or not my father would be normal or excessively mad when I got back. His anger almost always led to unwarranted physical violence against us. When my parents finally got a divorce, I was mostly glad because I no longer had to fear being in my own house. Unfortunately my mother changed soon after, also became physically violent, but would mostly verbally berate us and excessively control us.

I disregarded all of the hell that was my childhood over the years, but after meeting countless friends’ families and seeing how they interact, I can’t pretend that my family is just another “one of those” that didn’t seem to get along well. Neither of my parents knew/know how to parent or love us. They made it clear that their way of showing that they “cared” was by buying us things we needed, which I get and understand, but instead of feeling loved, I’ve always felt that I had a really big tab of things I owed them back. There was nothing heartfelt about anything, ever. Tbh I think my mom had children so she could become an American citizen (she’s from Trinidad and Tobago). 

Idk, this has been on my mind for too long and I need someone else to hear what I’m saying and believe me and understand that I am the way I am because of the way I was mechanically raised. There has never been a single instance where we had a full-family activity or outing that was for the purpose of being a family and/or didn’t seemed forced. There was no chemistry between the 5 of us. Additionally, I’ve never had an actual conversation with my parents that was more than 2-3 minutes long or about school. It’s like they don’t know how to have interest in my siblings and I. Or care to really.

To this day, we have “zones” in our house that we all stay in and never leave/intermingle, and I don’t remember a time where all 5 of us sat together and acted like we loved each other. Maybe I’m asking too much, I really don’t know. I don’t even know how to describe the complexity of the situation because it’s hard to illustrate with words.

I feel like I should talk to a therapist but Im afraid of being told that I’m over exaggerating or that I’m selfish for feeling this way. I don’t know what love is, nor do I think I’ve ever consciously experienced it, but I know that my home life back then, and even now, was completely absent of it. ",03Aug2018,1
41,"It's been more than 6 years. I just can't anymore. I know everything still looked normal from my end, but inside I was just crumbling for a long time. It's been so hard. So much energy lifting you up all the time whilst trying to do my work and take care of our home. 

I had to break it up... For so long I tried to be a better person for you, tried to get you excited about stuff, tried to understand when you couldn't leave home, when your anxiety and panic attacks got the best out of you. When you said you wanted to go out and then cancelled last minute because you felt unwell. For a long time, I really thought I could fight through it and get you in a better place.

But it's been so long... And the 'you don't understand me' and 'you don't help' broke my heart every time you said it. Because all that energy was all of the sudden being dismissed as something unworthy. I know depression is a selfish disease. I know you need to take care of yourself and it has to be you who gets you back up. But I always thought I could make a difference. I loved you and wanted to take care of you as much as possible and more.

For a while now, I haven't been able to feel happy inside. I was there for you and looked like so but that state seems so much like going towards a depression. I thought the Summer would make things better, with the extra sunlight. But not even that... Your day was divided into sleeping, time on the couch and working. I tried to have you exercise and eat better, but after all, you're the one who had to initiate that. 

And you didn't. And I know it's characteristic of a depression, but it's been so long now... I just couldn't anymore. And now you're heartbroken and so am I. For you, this came out of nowhere - it went from day-to-day normal life to nothing. Not because of something objective and defined, but because it piled up for so long. Because I wanted to be there for you and to be my best self for that. And the other day everything just became too much for me. I had to leave...

I was your first love and 6 years of it were so beautiful. I really loved you as well, we had plans for us, we wanted kids... But this was too much. I haven't been able to work, sleep or generally live normally for a while because of how much this takes away from me. I'm so sorry. You're heartbroken. You say you won't ever trust anyone. You say I didn't give us a chance. You say I'm like my father. And I know this was a one-sided decision, but I got myself somewhere I couldn't get out of. I need to be on my own. I need to find peace and regain energy and emotional stability.

You will get better. You will overcome depression. I know that - you're a beautiful intelligent person who will do whatever you want with your life. In a long term, I think we'll find peace and happiness again. But for now, it's just so hard to go through this and see you suffer like this... 

Please take care of yourself. I believe in you.

Always yours.",03Aug2018,229

44,"First of all, I don't mean all neither do I mean on purpose - but more on indirectly push patients to fit their initial bias. And actually I don't know if this is common, because I expect most doctors to NOT do this

Little background story: I started seeing a therapist in 2013 because of self-harm and depression, but there were more things going on that I didn't know about or couldn't put in words. I had been having some paranoia, more when felt people leaving me and hating me, and hearing some voices which I knew weren't real neither felt real, and would come and go, have them on a day and then go weeks without them. 2 months later, had a suicide attempt and got inpatient. There, got treated as having 'possible' schizophrenia, because apparently got asked if heard voices and answered ""yes"". I tried to explain to doctors how I didn't have symptoms anymore, how they never felt real, how it only came when I was alone - but got told multiple times how ""was psychotic, and had to come to terms with"". For 2-3 years I believed it, argued against anyone who told me I wasn't, became scared of possibly future episodes... but also because of the anti-psychotics I was on, lost my memory and have been getting it back slowly. 

I've talked to my current therapist about it, and seems was stress-induced 'psychosis' and paranoia. I am currently on process to being diagnosed with BPD, which does include those in its traits. And it's scary to think, those doctors almost forced me to believe I was psychotic and possibly have schizophrenia. Because, if I were to mention how it didn't add up or how I had other symptoms, like mood swings, the answer would be ""it's a sign your psychosis is still strong"". Also, about the voices, I can't pin point wether or not they happened or how they happened, my memories of that is my doctors describing hallucinations to me not my experiences. To be honest, for all I know could've been maladaptive daydreaming (tied in with paranoia), which I get as form of dissociation, and until I knew what it was, my mind confused it a lot. Because didn't feel like voices, but that's best description I could give at the time. I feel bad asking this to my therapist as hate dissing mental health care and professionals around her (which yeah.. sometimes.. sometimes it happens)

Conclusion: Has anyone experienced this or similar situation? How did you cope internally after you realized it, even when you didn't see such professionals anymore? Did it cause you fear to say how you feel or be honest with other professionals? Also: PLEASE don't let this discourage you from reaching out for help, seriously! ",03Aug2018,1

I am in the middle of being diagnosed with DID and have been diagnosed with Bipolar. I believe I'm in a manic episode seeing as I finally got some sleep after not sleeping for two days one being because I kept getting sleep paralysis and believing that men were breaking into my apartment. Of course my bf slept soundly because nothing was wrong.

When I was little I had four 'spirits' constantly harrass me. Two little girls who would cry or stare, a woman who would cry or scream and a man who liked to laugh at me, scare me and constantly appear during sleep paralysis. I would hear our tub getting filled in the middle of the night and these women getting murdered. Sometimes I would see him drag the bodies and bury them behind my house.

To help with this and other trauma I began to disappear into my mind where I had 'guardians' to help me. They would talk to me and comfort me in my made up fantasy world. I was hospitalized at 14 after a suicide attempt and told to repress them. When my aunt found out she hired a friend to gain my trust only to perform an exorcism on me. 

I learned to not talk about them.

Over the years I learned to ignore them but was hospitalized three more times for various reasons. Things are starting to get bad again. I'm hearing loud music all the time, seeing spiders again and again, I think I'll hear a conversation in a room when no one is there. Sleep paralysis has been an ongoing thing and I keep think I'm seeing the future was which something I fully believed in when I was young.

61,"TW: laxatives, starving, weight (no numbers) 

i dunno why, but i’ve been thinking about it for a while. ever since i was a kid i was never a big eater, not cause i was bullied or whatever i was just really tiny and only ate small portions. i a’s also a picky eater to the point where my mums friends told my mum that she should take me to a shrink at 9 (which nothing came up of that) 

speaking of my mum, she’s always been into dieting and i’ve never remembered her actually saying that she liked her body. 

now getting into me, i keep taking laxatives in a sorta ritualistic way, not every single day or whatever but i’ll take like 2/3/4 pills of some shit w senna for a way to like, clean out my body yknow? currently facing the side affects of taking 4 laxatives rn actually. lmao. 

i’ve never really hated my weight, the only time i can think of when i disliked it was when i was little and i had a small gut, which i soon realised was puppy fat and went away on its own. 

in regards to my eating, i don’t starve purge or whatever but i can never eat big portions. not cause i don’t want to but cause i can’t. the only time when i’ve purposefully starved myself was not too long ago when me and mum were in a fight, and part of the reason i did it was cause i didn’t wanna have to walk past her to get food, but the other part of me felt like i had to punish myself for being a ‘bad’ daughter

so people of r/mentalheath, whatre your thoughts?",03Aug2018,1

63,"Hi all, first time posting here (found the sub just for this purpose), I hope this is the right place to post this, if not, mods please let me know.

So my friend has had mental health issues since I have known her - Almost 6 years now - When we first met she described hearing the voices of people we know talking to her and telling her things - nothing dangerous or violent, but things about her, feelings etc. She has always been seeing doctors and going through different medications.

She recently spent 6 months institutionalized and was released early this year. However things have been spiraling and I am SO concerned, She is hearing voices of the devil (in her words - and she has never been religious) telling her she is a filthy whore sinner who has been cast from the kingdom of god, god doesn't want her, etc. 2 weeks ago a mutual friend called me saying they had been messaging all day and she was scaring him with all of this talk of the devil and god and he was worried. I was out of town but drove in, picked him up and went to see her. She was in her house despondent, hadn't been showering, her place was a mess etc. I told her we were bringing her to the hospital but she was SO adamant about not going because last time she went she was sexual abused by someone. We stayed with her until she asked to be alone - in which case what choice did I have but to leave? I couldn't physically force her to go anywhere. She called me yesterday saying she was in the (mental health) hospital again - on new meds, but is still scared out of her mind. The hospital said they were going to have the pastor come talk to her.

I am doing my absolute best but I am currently in the middle of a move and a bunch of things going on in my life and it has been hard keeping up with her. I text her when I can and I always answer as soon as I see her texts or calls. I just feel like I can't be there for her as she needs me but I am trying to be there as much as I can. Her parents aren't really in the picture and I know she has scared and pushed away a lot of people. It's so hard.

I guess I am just asking for some advice. Our mutual friend was indulging her delusions of talking to the devil but I am just not sure that is a safe route. I can't be there all the time and I am also moving 8 hours away. I just want her to be safe and feel loved but I also feel guilty because I can't make her as much of a priority as I feel she should be or needs to be. ",03Aug2018,1
64,"I was born and raised in South America. I recently moved to NYC and when I went to the doctor for my check up, she decided to put me on 10mg Prozac.

I always knew I had a ""problem"", but in the Latin community it's a tabboo. God, even my mom - who's a nurse- Didn't believe me when I said I'd like to see someone for my anxiety/depression symptoms. She'd only said ""it's okay, it's normal to feel that way"". Every time she said that it made me angry because, I felt like my feelings weren't really taken into consideration.

So back to the medication: I took a few days to think about it before actually going to the pharmacy. I'm not sure if she confirmed my anxiety or if it's depression, I mean I feel fine now. Also, I haven't told anyone about it. I understand mental health it's a real issue but now that it's -my- issue, I feel embarrassed. It makes me re-evaluate if my syntoms are ""that bad"" you know. I don't know if this is just me in denial of my diagnosis.",03Aug2018,1
65,"Forgive me for this post containing sexual content, I'm new to Reddit and tied finding a subreddit where this post might be more appropriate but failed to find one. If anyone has any suggestions that would be much appreciated, but let me dive into my feelings here and see if anyone has any advice.

I am 21 years old, currently attending a fairly prestigious university where I am an Accounting major, student athlete, and frat boy. When I am not competing or drinking, I work as a server at a local restaurant. I wouldn't say I love interacting with people, but I would be lying if I said I didn't judge my day based on how well my social interactions went on a particular day. Most nights, I come home feeling depressed. That doesn't take away my sex drive though. I love masturbating. Before bed I always look up erotic wrestling and find joy in placing myself in the shoes of the man getting the stuffing beat out of him and being made into a slave.

This is a nightly thing. Roughly 4-5 nights a week, for the past 13 or so years, I have masturbated to men being dominated. But not necessarily sexually, usually just the wrestling part of a video is enough for me. Recently, I have become concerned with how this is affecting my day to day relationships with people around me. I've had sexual relationships with three women in the past three months, and despite liking all of them I ended up ghosting them over text or social media after a couple weeks because I could no longer get hard when we had sex. At 21 years of age, it is VERY disconcerting that I can only remain sexually attracted to a woman for a week or two. The thing is, I don't really care about the sex, I enjoy the humiliation and dominance of wrestling. 

While I've been aware that my fetish causes problems with girls for a while, recently I've started wondering if it can be applied to my day to day friendships with other people. I don't have very many people I would consider friends. My daily routine puts me in contact with many different types of people, and I feel like instead of getting to know each other, I get to know them and act in a way I believe they want me to act. I think this is very toxic to my well being. I have the belief that my personality is sub par to everyone else's and as such I act in a very basic way towards people.

My main question that I hope someone can offer some insight towards is this: Do you think that my sexual fantasy causes me to think of myself as pathetic, and that's how I project myself to other people? Or is it because of some general anxiety that I have the fantasies that I do?

Thanks for taking the time to read about my problems, if you have any words of wisdom they are much appreciated. Also, please let me know if you think anything I said is just plainly not thought out. Everything I just told y'all is how I have thought about it on my own. I haven't talked about this to anyone so it is just my perspective you're reading. ",03Aug2018,3
66,"What are the consequences of normalising discussions on suicide and depression (and other issues) ? 

I’m a very odd person and I say what I feel most of the time. I also have my bad days and sometimes I feel that life is so unfair that the best way I can deal with it is to end it .

FIRSTLY, don’t worry because I am never gonna commit suicide because I’m afraid of the afterlife and that it is a sin in my religion. To have suicidal thoughts is already a sin because I’m already considering the possibility but fear not as I am still rather composed. 

One day my friends and I were venting about our frustrations in school (exam matters) and I casually told them “ You know, I’ve been having suicidal thoughts recently” They were visibly uncomfortable and they asked if I needed help. 

I tried to laugh it off and reassure them that I’m okay and that I would not go to such extremes but their reaction was something that I had not exactly expected. I know that suicide is almost taboo during conversations (esp given that I belong to the conservative society of Singapore) but I just felt like telling them about it because I trust them and I want them to know the ‘real’ me. I wanted them to understand that I’m aware of my own feelings (why do i want them to know? idk tbh but it only feels right to do so) 


SECONDLY, the topic of suicide and depression is ESPECIALLY more difficult to talk about since I am usually viewed as an overly-optimistic person who always seemed to find a silver lining in every cloud . I found it a little heartbreaking that my friends has reacted that way because I had expected them to understand that I too, have to deal with my own demons. So , is my approach to having a meaningful discussion about mental health truly unreasonable?? Should I have eased them into the conversation better?? ",03Aug2018,2

68,"Maybe it is stress or some other mental illness that I don’t know. But since I turned 18, I just have an urge to kill people. I fantasize about it. How I kill them, how would I deal with the bodies and how it would others.

Is this normal for my age? Do people want to kill others when they turned 18?

When I was smaller, I was always afraid of doing wrong or angering anybody.

I never spoken out, expressed how I truly feel.

I was hateful towards my father when I was 11 to 15 because of his constant beatings and my own situation. Although the situation is resolved and I understood why he did what he did.

So I tried forgetting it all. However, sometimes it may creep into some of my nightmares where they bring me back to when I was little.


I had friends, enough for me to not feel bored of life. They were fine, I don’t really feel the attachment I had with them but I guess that is part of growing up. 

I guess I started feeling detach to people when I was 16? I was just walking in a mall, sneaked out from the house with some lame excuse. And it just hit me. I just don’t feel any connection at all. 

Since then, I tried to turn around and make as much connection as possible. I tried being better. I tried to remove my past from me. 

I didn’t want to be some depressed f*ck who only thinks about killing his father or himself, hoping someone else will save him.

I became as positive as I can. I gained many new friends. They considered me to be annoying at some times. But they tolerated it. I was invited to things and stuff. I couldn’t go because of the fear of my father.

When I was 18, I became more positive. I rarely ever think about killing myself. I do have plans to just end my life at the maximum age of 50. I really hate to be like my father or his fragile patients.

How would I know about his patients?

I spent most of my childhood at my father’s private clinic. Him being a single father was really hard which contributes to his violent behaviors. So I pretty much grew up with the patients. Watched how he fixed them and all that. It was boring. 

My father has heavy hopes on me that I continue his legacy. I hated it. I hated that despite that I am legally an adult, I still have to listen to him.

Thankfully, I will move to the US (My birth place and where my mother lives) this month.

My father knows about it and has been really stressed about it. He wants to make sure my mother will take care of me and have me visit him every holiday.

I hate this idea. I hate the place that I grew up in . I admit it. Even if this is irrational emotions, I want to burn this whole city down. I want to see my father’s patients suffer.

No one cared/ knew how to deal with me as a child. I am pretty sure i was hyperactive. Probably still am. But the discipline that my father gave me made me hyper active in talking. No longer running around and all gat stuff. The teachers isolated me from classmates because I was talkative. Which means I have years to catch up with my social skills.

Funny enough, I never truly lacked friends. I always managed to get  one or two friends no matter the situation.

Where was I? 

I am going back to the US. Hopefully I can mature more there but weird emotions are starting to appear.

I have these weird urges to smash anyone’s head with a hammer in my way. I really want to stab my father in the neck. I want to choke my sister to death. 

I still feel disconnected towards people. I can no longer feel what others feel like I could when I was a kid. I can guess what people are feeling tho. So I can still react according to it.

I can always have the best smile easily, after I have practiced enough in front of the mirror. Some of the patients even said I looked happier. So it worked really well when I was just thinking to cut that person’s tongue out. 

Is this normal for you too? Should I change anything about me? 

Obviously this is a throwaway account. Someone in my family knows my Reddit account and I can’t let them know about my feelings. A man should never expose his true feelings to anyone.

To cut things short: I have weird emotions about killing people who annoy me. I can no longer feel connection towards anyone. 

Do you feel the same? Is this normal?",03Aug2018,1

70,"I just found this sub and I wish I had found it a long time ago. I want to share my story with you all. As a young man, my dad used hallucinogenic drugs (this was in the 70's) with his peers, and ended up in mental health and drug treatment. He cleaned up enough to join the Navy, where he met my mom. They would get married, and start their family which included me and my two younger brothers. When I was young, my dad started to experience mental health issues along the schizo-affective spectrum. He began to become increasingly detached from reality, and with three young boys, my mom was compelled to divorce and separate from him. I had become hopeless and unsure of my dad's future. He was not functional, and i didn't know what to do or how to help him.

With the help of family, my mom was able to relocate him to my grandparents home halfway across the country, where he would spend the next 13+ years living in the basement of their house; not working, with very little social interaction, scribbling gibberish in books and essentially living in his own world. He became hostile over time, and blamed his family for his circumstances. As a young man, it was incredibly frustrating to see him in this helpless state. On my yearly visits to my grandparents house, I had to witness his condition first hand, which hurt my spirit and pride. He would say things and behave in a way that confused people and make them uncomfortable, and he was my dad. It was tough. 

My deepest fear was that I would have problems like his and not be a significant part of my children's lives. In my teens, I began using marijuana which became a daily habit for over 6 years. In my last year of college, I had a psychotic episode which landed me in mental health treatment. I spent two nights in an emergency MH ward. The experience was very traumatic, emotional and grueling. I was forced to stop using drugs and alcohol, and give up a lifestyle that had become the norm for me. I received counseling which was extremely helpful. Still, I spent about two years constantly in fear of recurring episodes, feeling completely alone in my recovery, depressed. I remember wondering, ""Why am I here? What is the point of this life?"". Luckily, I had strong family support, and stopped abusing substances. Thankfully, my symptoms have been in remission since my episode and sometimes days go by without me thinking about what happened (I remember wondering if I would ever be able to put the experience behind me).

One day, when I was in my early twenties, I got a call from my dad. He was panicked, and convinced that his parents (who he for years denied were his real parents), were conspiring to poison him. I told my mom about the call, and she called the police, who went to my grandparents house and brought him into a mental health facility at a VA hospital.

There he received treatment, and was discharged. The facility began to rehab him and give him much needed counseling, support, and socialization. He slowly began to improve, and we all noticed the changes happening. It brought us all much needed joy. My grandfather and grandmother both passed on some time after he began to get treatment. Fortunately, by the time they passed, my dad's mental health improved significantly. He was holding focused conversations again! He was social and volunteering at the VA hospital. He felt that he had purpose, and it meant so much to everyone, and especially to me.

Our family has a history of substance abuse issues, depression and suicide. Over the years, it became very important to me to speak to my dad on a regular basis, because I loved him and did not want to lose him. Even though he was going through dark times, I desperately wanted a connection with him. And at the end of the day, he was and will always be my dad. I needed him to know he mattered.

Here's where we are today:

My dad has a full time job at the VA hospital. He helps veterans every day and is making connections and even some friendships. He has his own apartment, and although he lives on a tight budget, he is able to maintain a healthy, productive lifestyle. We are still many miles apart, but our connection is tighter than ever. I have my dad back, he isn't perfect, but he is to me, and he's mine!

Six years after my debilitating episode, I am starting a family of my own! I am sober, which sometimes results in awkward social interactions... ""you mean... you don't drink? Why not?"" LOL. I have a little girl on the way, and I am working in the real estate industry, getting ready to open my own brokerage. I own rental property and a small vending machine business. My focus has shifted over time from ruminating about my mental health problems to self improvement, and I am starting to reap the benefits.

I understand that when it comes to mental health, there is a broad spectrum. Every case is different, and there are certainly some people who struggle beyond what I have described here. But I want to say this;

Even when there is nothing else - THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE

I had to tell myself that everyday, ""I am getting better"". I had to love my dad no matter what, because he's the one God gave me. And lastly, I want to offer a resource that helped me find meaning and significance in my experience (found below). Thank you for reading.

72,"Greetings guys! It's me, Scarlett. Today I just wanted to make a quick post about CBD Oil and my experience using it for anxiety. 

So, here's a little bit of general info about CBD Oil: 

\- It cannot make you high in the marijuana sense. It doesn't contain THC, the stuff that gets you stoned. (be sure when purchasing that you get one that does NOT contain THC) 

\- You must have someone 18+ to purchase it for you (if you aren't an adult!)   
\- It is COMPLETELY safe to take for most people! 

\- It is true that depersonalization/other mental disorders can be triggered by smoking drugs like weed. This will ***not*** happen to you with CBD oil, as it is NOT the same as taking weed and does not include the components (THC) that trigger that reaction when doing weed. 

So, today I went to my nearest gourmet grocery store and my parents bought me some CBD oil. I was super excited to try it and see how it made me feel. I took about 1/2 a syringe full (be careful you don't take too little/too much). Almost instantly, I felt different. Not sure if this is a placebo effect or not, but I don't think it is because my other 4 siblings tried it as well, and they all noted a change. My muscles just felt *relaxed.* I felt as if everything was a little calmer, a little slowed down...not necessarily like the world was delayed, but like everything around me was a little more ""chill"" and just low key. The anxious existential thoughts i've been experiencing for like a month now seemed like too much effort to conjure...it felt like it would just be too much effort to summon them and ruminate on them. I just felt to calm to bother or care. The only negative is that my sister felt a litttlleee too dizzy because I think she took a tad too much for her small frame, but other than that i've so far experienced nothing but positive results. I felt not lethargic, but naturally more relaxed, almost as if I could just smile and take a little snooze right then and there. Even as I right this, my shoulders are relaxed, i'm in a calm and un-concerned state. I don't feel like ""reality"" is distorted, I just feel like I am less reactive and sensitive to every little thing around me. 

All in all, I would definitely go and give CBD oil a shot! ",03Aug2018,2

She doesn’t ever see them as an issue although her latest one cost her job. I wish there was a way I could tell her how she hurts me (emotionally) when she does these things.

79,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.  I have been suffering from depression since i was very little. I can easily recall times as a young kid where i would be so so sad and have these dark and twisted thoughts and bouts of sadness for no apparent reason. As i got older (18 y/o now) more mental issues have become prevalent. I used to go to the doctor for anxiety but tried hiding most of my problems from people because i didn’t want the attention nor the medicine as i didn’t want to change who i was mentally. A year ago before i met my soul mate ( the only thing keeping me here as well as our child on the way ) i was in the worst possible mental state possible. I would abuse very strong opiates and various other pain killers to ease the suffering. I didn’t care if i died because i had nothing to live for. My life is a living hell, i deal with suicidal thoughts very very often, i am extremely depressed most of the time. My anxiety has calmed down over the years but it’s still there for sure. I hate everything about this world. I always have. I hate the people, i hate society, i hate 99.99% of things about existence, i hate me the most. I have tried killing myself a lot. I tried overdosing on pills so many times but i always ended up waking up. That made it worse. I can’t even kill myself. Then i met my perfect little ball of sweetness. Now we have a kid on the way. I love them both so much. They are my only life essence but i am so tortured by my mind every day. I used to smoke cannabis which really helped a lot and i was doing a lot better, but i recently ran out and fucked up pretty bad and long story short i ended up in the hospital after almost overdosing again. Hats the first time people other than my S.O. for sure knew i did drugs. I only do drugs because i hate suffering so bad. I hate living like this. I started taking kratom a year ago as well and that has helped some but I’m also out of that. I have no weed, no pills, no kratom, no alcohol, no nothing. At this point I’m about to make some damn jenkem because i absolutely CANNOT handle this. I think I’m at the worst I’ve ever been mentally. My mind is racing every second of the day filling my head with thoughts that i just can’t get into and i literally feel like the only way out is through suicide. It’s nothing new but now i have nothing to calm the prison of hell that is my brain. I can’t handle this at all. I’m posting this because i have absolutely no clue what to do anymore. I don’t want to kill myself, i want to live a full happy life with my soon to be family. But i feel so overdue to die. I can’t get weed anymore because people knew i had that In my system as well thanks to the wonderful doctor that’s there to “help” me. He told me to stop using weed. Of course. ( i live in a illegal state ) My SO is too anxious to have weed in the house anymore and that makes me anxious about it too.  I can barely think straight anymore and I’m the most scatterbrained I’ve ever been in my life. I know there are so many things wrong with me and each second feels like three years. I’m so lost for words most of the time because my brain just doesn’t want to do anything except torture itself. I’ve been liek this a long time and i just sit and stare at walls fantasizing about suicide but then also thinking about how the love of my life who is pregnant would feel if they woke up to my cold dead body and that KILLS me. I love them SO much but i HATE BEING ALIVE so much. Every day is endless torture :((((( My thoughts are always conflicting. I feel like I’m stuck in this state forever and this is probably all over the place but it’s all i can do to just type it out even. Sorry if it’s hard to read but any insight would be great.

80,"I think part of this is a bit of an ego trip on my part, but I really feel these ideas are being neglected. I bring this up, because I saw an article that claimed sales of Barnes &amp; Noble's books on anxiety and depression have soared and a lot more people are going to therapists.

I feel we're neglecting certain solutions and problems. This is in part based on personal experience and in part based on research.

Here's the problems:

1. People are having trouble taking spontaneous action
2. People are having trouble being realistic
3. People don't know how to choose a career and a lot of people who have it as their job to address this issue aren't using science-based advice
4. People are focusing too much on time management and too little on energy management
5. People aren't managing their desire vs. action levels
6. People aren't truly paying attention to how they feel
7. People aren't aware of how frequently they experience increases in dopamine (YouTube, social media, smartphones, sugar, sodium, sugar substitutes, certain material such as erotic ads and those ""try not to get satisfied"" videos, certain music, masturbation, laptops, video games, mobile games, certain apps, and more) which can cause waves of depression.
8. They're not aware of how to use Skinnerian marketing techniques to their benefit
9. They aren't aware of the impact subliminal stimuli is having on them (e.g. trashy ads, YouTube videos that have a lazy or mediocre feeling to them, trashy music videos, depressing/garbage news, etc.)
10. They aren't paying attention to their external behavior and its influence on how they feel internally (e.g. smiling makes them happy, slouching makes them feel depressed, certain poses make them feel powerful, speaking quietly makes them feel weak, etc.)
11. They don't know how to use their brain
12. They don't ground themselves in reality to prevent them from getting caught up in their imagination, hence negative nihilism, political paranoia, etc.

17. Jungian psychology is neglected, though that's more of an academic issue
18. People aren't aware of the energy of their surroundings (a messy environment with a bunch of clothes on the floor is going to create a pull to the ground, causing a feeling of laziness and low productivity; yoga pants are going to create a feeling of laziness; stuff you've been positive conditioned to is going to have a pull while stuff you've been negatively conditioned to is going to have a push, a messy desk is going to distract you, etc.)

30. They don't know if they've experienced trauma or not
31. They feel unfulfilled
32. They don't know how personal value works
33. They have a false sense of reality and/or themselves due to propaganda, misuse of conditioning, and/or indoctrination
34. They feel unproductive, because they don't break things down into frames
35. They try to tackle too many things at once (unaware of that they lack the energy to do it) and feel unproductive as a result
36. They get poor sleep
37. They've been misdiagnosed with AD(H)D, anxiety disorder, Aspergers, OCD, SID, restless leg syndrome, etc.

I know some of these are getting some attention, but some of them feel neglected. What do you think?",03Aug2018,5

82,"I'm 20 years old. I have a fake page for Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat. For my fake pages, I have no pictures, I have a made-up name, and I just upload random profile pictures of anything. I make these pages to lurk people's lives. I've been doing this for five years now.

I mostly lurk people who I went and go to school with. I just like to see what they do with their lives. No one knows I have these fake accounts.

I don't want to make a real account of myself because I have no life. I would have nothing to post. But, I still want to see the lives of the people I go/went to school with, so I have these fake accounts instead.

I don't talk to any of them, I just lurk.

I've thought about deleting my fake pages, but I'm so reluctant to do that because I want to stay connected with these people.
I do want to delete them though, but it's hard. I want some advice to get the courage to stop doing this.",03Aug2018,2

84,"The World is a beautiful place. 

I'm a lot on the internet. I browse reddit daily, multiple times, i look at picture on Instagram and i scroll to my Twitter page again and again and again. 

I see pictures of beautiful beaches, sand so white you could almost think its snow, water so blue and green from afar and crystal clear up close. 

Pictures of dark green forests with mountains, you can not even grasp just how massive these structures are that the world has formed. 

Cities all over the world, really big ones with millions on millions of people. Everyone doing their part to keep the city going. Keep the lights glowing and the water flowing. 

We have laws,which, if obeyed are saving lives, every day. People get saved from dangers they dont even know about, dangers we humans have already sorted out and made rules so people in the future can think about new dangers. A beautiful circle that keeps on going, day in, day out. 

Who are these people that invent things. I always wondered. Who are these people that sit in their garages and think about things to help people. Their probably doing it for money, i figured. Everything is about money right? 

I am on twitch a lot. In the past you used to only watch people play videogames. It was live, so you could interact with the streamers via chat. Nowadays you can do all sorts of things there. You can be a part of someones life. Every part they want to share, except nudity ofcourse, its for kids. 

There is a special kind of honesty that those people emit. Remember, they just sit in their bedroom talking into a mic, some dont even use webcams. They just see a red number instead of thousands of users. If someone opens up to you like that, you become friends. Is it a real friend? No, of course not , but it feels like it. 

Some guy , talked about his depression he had, when he was in school. A teenager, playing games every day. He woke up, played, slept, on weekdays he went to school. Really smart guy, he had the highest SAT in his grade, a girlfriend and talent. He was the best at what he did, always in all the years he was alive, everytime he did something, he was the best. One day the game he out all his time and effort in, started losing traction. Faster and faster people lost interest in the game and that meant they lost interest in him. All those years of his life, Gone. 1st suicide attempt. 

I want to ask you. Was it right to attempt suicide? If everything in life you care about disappears, are you allowed to end your life? Am i allowed to kill myself? Laws say No. You cant. Laws were made by people who want to prevent other people from dangers. 

In hindsight of course it was wrong. This teenager picked up a new game. He became the best again. People recognize his name. Was it good for his mental health? After this new game lost traction he found a new game. He became one of the best.

It all fell down. He is bipolar so all the ups and downs of life. He feels on a level, normal people can not understand. I am a normal person. I don't undestand. 

I'm sitting here. Typing. No idea how long, i forget time when I am at the computer. Multiple times i thought about this. Am i typing this for me ? should i post this, 'cause I am trying to make this a real thing you can read. I have this thought in the back of my head. Maybe i get famous. Maybe i write so good, people wanna read more ? Why. In the beginning i tried to make paragraphs the same length, so this would look good. 

I want people to read, so someone can safe me. Im not made for this world. 

Is the world a beautiful place ?

85,"I am incredibly frustrated with my psychiatrist and want to vent...

I had an appointment with my psychiatrist for August 1st, but I had to reschedule because I made the appointment 2-3 months ago before I started my summer semester of classes. My practicum fell on that day and I couldn't reschedule my clients' appointments...not to mention, I need hours! If I called out that day, I'd be almost 8 hours short by the end of the semester. 

So I called to reschedule and they gave me an appointment date for mid-October...I'm like, ok...I can deal with that. She's pretty busy, I get it. I'm like...no big deal, just refill my meds until I see you in October. I know what my class schedule and internship schedule will be like around that time, so I should be good!

She says no...

I get a little frustrated and ask the receptionist why. The receptionist said that my psychiatrist wants to see me first before refilling any of my medication, so the refill request was denied. So I explained that I understand why she'd like to see me, but if that's the case, she needs to figure out something in her schedule! I'm willing to see her any time and any day that's not Tuesday or Wednesday day/afternoon. The receptionist says, ""Well, we'll see.""

I called back again today and I told them I was willing to see another psychiatrist in the interim until she can see me, just so I can get my meds refilled. She gives me this attitude about rescheduling, so I told her either someone sees me and/or refills my meds, or else I will likely end up hospitalized. I can't just *NOT* take the medication for two months! She fixed her attitude, but then said my psychiatrist is the only one.

I. AM. IRRITATED. And ANXIOUS as all get out.

Thankfully I have about a week before all hell breaks loose and I run out of my medication. But I really don't know what to do when that happens...If I go to the hospital and they try to admit me, that's going to be days of work, school, and my practicum I'm missing...

All I want is my damn medication...:(

TL;DR - My psychiatrist is refusing to refill my medications until I see her in October. I run out of meds next week. I'm anxious and just needed to vent. Thanks!",03Aug2018,1

For a long time now I’ve struggled with something. I never knew and I guess still don’t know what it is but all I know is that I have issues going on inside of me and I can’t stop them. I used to be so good at hiding them. But lately it’s gotten worse and it’s ruining my relationship with my family. I want to say something but every time I’m actually face to face with them I shut in. I close up and I can’t speak and just let them complain about how I don’t care about them anymore. I do. I love my mom but it’s been worse for her. I don’t know how to tell her I’ve been struggling all this time and I’m only beginning to lose my battles. It’s easier for me to tell random people on the internet than my own family. I’m tired of acting this way and letting myself lose but it’s harder to find the strength to keep going. The only reason I don’t leave is because of the stress I know it would put my family through. I need help but I don’t know where to get it. ",03Aug2018,2

92,"My girlfriend just graduated and developed a panic disorder due to the stress from graduating, the death of her cat and her mother being ill.

It has worsened in less than two months and it started with hyperventilation. 

I am starting a dual study for nursing soon and I recently observed myself treating her a bit as a patient.
It is something we both fear, but I am glad I noticed it early on.

I still take her to restaurants and movies, but sometimes it gets a bit hard for her to muster the energy, will and courage. It is taking a small toll on me since I am so emotionally invested in her and it hurts me to see her like this. 
We went to a movie today and she felt really good, but as soon as the movie was finished, she started feeling the symptoms again. Nausea, dizzyness, lack of energy and sudden feeling of catastrophical doom.

She thinks she's a burden, but doesn't seem to realise she is carrying the burden and the burden isn't her. 

My question is, how do I support her? How do I stay being her boyfriend and not her ""nurse""? 

Also, the movie was Isle of dogs for the curious.",03Aug2018,5

95,"So to make a long story shorter, I was with my high school sweetheart for about 5 yrs and we have a kid together. Thought-out the whole relationship we were on and off and broke up a lot. I was with people sexually during our breakups and wasn’t always honest with her. And I also talked to other people. Basically I was cheating and I know I’m a piece of shit. I didn’t know what I wanted and I didn’t want to make up my mind. Fast forward to present day. We haven’t been together for about 6 months and we are co parenting trying to raise our son. I’m leaving soon for the military and the truth is I want to make things right with her. I’m not the same person I was, and I know what I did was wrong. I’m slowly building a support group and becoming more in tune with my emotions. My question I guess is how do I go about it? I’ve told her how I feel and she said she doesn’t want anything right now. Emphasis on right now. Yet I feel that if I wait, I’ll lose her forever and I know I love her. Am I wrong to ask her to be back together ? ",03Aug2018,1

I don't have a problem carrying on conversations with people I know. I understand and respect conversational etiquette for the most part and can carry on meaningful conversations.  I get along well with good friends.  Sometimes I just creep people out though.  I'm terrible with small talk and I just get really really anxious, particularly around women.

I creep women out.  I could just settle for dating events. My conversations seem to go fine at these events, and the anxiety doesn't bother me much.  When I'm dealing with women at venues, I just break down into awkward mode. It's really bizarre too, because when I'm with friends that I know, I have no problems at all.
