2,"I'm a mental illness lifer. Diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and childhood ADD at age 9. Later therapists believed ADD was a misdiagnosis and that my inability to focus and lack of motivation we're actually symptoms of my other two diagnoses. I agree with this.

I consider myself a pretty intelligent person with decent common sense, but I can't go anywhere without leaving something behind, be it a phone charger, reading glasses, my wallet, etc. It's become a running joke with my friends. I also seem to lack spacial awareness and I'm always knocking things over, running into people and so on. I forget important dates and tasks often and walk into a room and immediately forget what I was looking for all the time.

My brother also shares in my clumsiness, not sure about the other things. It's funny because he's very athletic and a gym rat so his clumsiness is non-existent when he's playing a sport. Same goes for me. When I'm riding my bike or working out, I'm suddenly graceful. When I'm in a flow at work or on a project, I don't forget things, I don't run into objects, I don't have silly lapses of judgement. I'm just really on my game.

We both have anxiety and I feel like, for me at least, all this can be attributed to it. The worse I feel mentally, the worse the ""ditziness."" Any suggestions on what I can do about it?",02Feb2018,2,

6,"Lately, I have been noticing the following symptoms. 

1. Moderate mood swings (this may be an environmental thing though, as I get fear screwing up at school/work but when I don't screw up I feel fine).

2. Complete lack of desire to pursue any type of new relationship. 

3. I have no desire to really see/meet people I don't already know.

4. I've become socially awkward when I do meet new people.

5. I've been experiencing intruding thoughts of me doing/saying crazy things or past memories of me doing embarrassing things. I have to scrunch eyes or clench fists to make them go away. 

For the record, I have ADD and have been taking Concerta 72mg for the last year and a half. About a month ago, I ran out of my dosage and had to resort to using 10mg tablets of Ritalin (these were prescribed by my doctor but I never actually used them). I started by chewing one tablet a day but moved up to two because I could not focus. Concerta has worked well for me since I started in late 2016. 

Is this something I should be worried about? Or is it part of puberty? I am an under 20 and male.

8,"Short of it: I have Bipolar and I am high functioning. I'm never high up but I experience the lows something awful. (CMHT have sent me to ""support groups"" or projects in the past as a means of helping me, but it's with people who have very, very different mental difficulties and I don't feel I get any form of support from it. Not to mention that everything is during the average working day, so I can seldom attend due to employment). 


I had a crashing, out of nowhere suicidal episode in December, maybe down to a new medication that CMHT got me to try - I was fine, left a friend's housewarming party and on the drive home, it just smacked me out of nowhere - I needed to leave and I needed to get off the planet right then and there. Instantaneously deleted myself off of every social media platform and prepped... But didn't make it. A friend noticed. 


As a result of this, in the shame hangover after I've managed to fuck everything up. The dear friend I trusted and who saved my life that night suddenly froze me out and my anxiety went through the roof. Like a drowning guy might go for air bubbles underwater, that's how I viewed our communication. I needed whatever I could get, just to make things right again. To go back to the jesting and casual talk of a few weeks prior. I apologised for scaring her so many times - the guilt is still crushing my chest - and I was doubled up with worry about her as I know she gets down in similar ways.  At wit's end and absolutely on the floor, I asked a mutual friend after her. Mutual friend makes a point of it and turns it into an argument between the group of friends I game with (I wasn't there), I message her and get a scathing reply about how ""we never had this before"" in the group (applying to the fact that I finally recently got a console so we could game instead of me just hanging out on voice with everyone, therefore my presence is a problem) and it's because I asked said mutual friend after her. She also accused me of playing games, I'd guess inferring to that bad night - it literally had nothing to do with her aside the fact that she unfortunately happened to intervene. 


I messaged back rationally and calmly pointing out that I didn't know what she was talking about, that I had no part of any of that night's discussions other than asking after her two weeks prior and with that she blocked me on FB. 


I want to go back and beg myself to find my logical voice and not give in to the little voice telling me to leave. I'm screaming in my head because I've fought this for so long and one night (and the resulting anxiety/shame spiral) has cost me one of the most important things in the world to me. 


Why keep fighting if one bad night can in turn wreak this? What's the fucking point?


I've been drowning in shame, anxiety and prevalent suicidal thoughts ever since that night and losing my friend in the process and basically telling me my presence is a problem is the last straw. 


I think she's right. 


Usually I can fight it off... But with the losing my friend over miscommunication and anxiety (fearing something and then creating it maybe?), it's fully compounded this. I am a problem and I need to be erased. This latter statement has no emotion in it. It's just raw logic. 


And to boot, today I had a gentle inquisition with my P-doc and a nurse. Another medication to try (wunderbar) and I was honest about how I was feeling and there was mention of possibly going into hospital if they felt it was necessary. I believe at this time I have the option to do so voluntarily. 


Dies anyone know or have experience of the process in the UK? I personally don't feel that such an environment would be positive at all for me and can't see any benefit in it, aside keeping the P-doc's conscience clean but it would be really helpful to know what happens and what the experience might entail.


If you made it this far... Thank you. ",02Feb2018,0,

10,"Hi r/MentalHealth,

I've been suffering from MDD for about 3 years now. One of my biggest problems with medication has been that it works for a short period of time, then it stops. Eventually the dosage increase hits the maximum amount and stops working.

I've been reading about some experimental treatments using Amphetamine Salts (such as Adderall) to tread depression, and it having positive outcomes with people who have difficulty with traditional anti-depressants. 

Has anyone been prescribed any kind of Amphetamine Salts for treating depression and it been effective?

I'm worried to speak to my Psychiatrist about this because I don't want her to think I'm trying to get medication for recreational use. (Not that I have a history of doing so, I have Anxiety about things like this).

Any advice helps.

Thanks,
Scott",02Feb2018,1,
11,"My GF and I (both early twenties in the U.S.) have been together for about a year and a half.  She has severe anxiety, coupled with some depression.  I have severe depression, coupled with some anxiety.  

And with our powers combined, we have a pretty great relationship.  I've personally never been happier with someone.  We have our issues, of course, but we always work them out.  We both try to help the other cope with our mental health issues.  I think the fact that we both struggle with something like that helps us understand one another.  But she seems to be worsening lately.  She had been on medicine and attending therapy before, but stopped both a few months back.  She's very stubborn about not going back to therapy, as she had a bad experience with her last one.  I've tried to tell her it's not always bad, and she has to find a therapist that works for her, but she's against it.  She did however start taking medication again.

I know I can't ""fix"" her.  I love her for her and what she's dealing with doesn't change that.  I just want to do whatever I can to make it easier on her.  She's having near daily panic attacks.  She's constantly afraid that I'm upset at her, or that a random person she met during the day is talking bad about her.  Or that her coworkers or my family secretly hate her.  I do my best to reassure her, but I know that doesn't always make it better.  

I don't talk to her about my issues anymore, because she always thinks she's the one causing it.  And I think that it's making me a little bitter towards her (and I really hate myself for it), even though I know that she can't help it.  

So tl;dr,

Tips for having a relationship with someone with severe anxiety?  

Any tips to help someone through a panic attack?

Any ideas on how to talk her back into therapy?

14,"I've always been focused on male attention. As a kid I preferred male friends, I tried to get boys to like me, etc. As an adult I measure my life by which boyfriend I was with at the time, I look for male attention even when in a relationship, I tolerate romantic interests being less-than-fantastic, and everything is geared towards men. Even now, I moved so I need a job and new friends, but I can't help but think of these things as a route to meet men! 

To be clear: when it comes to getting male attention I don't dress provocatively and I'm not sexually promiscuous (nothing wrong with women who are!), I don't screw over other woman, I don't pander to men, and I don't act fake to win men. I'm okay by myself but feel more secure in a relationship, so it's not like it's desperation. 

I'm fairly certain this would be known as 'daddy issues'

Family background: I was a daddies girl but he was an alcoholic so he wasn't exactly there for me, my parents divorced when I was seven years old and he often wouldn't come to visit me due to getting drunk - he was meant to visit at 11am on a Sunday, I'd get excited to see him but I could go months without seeing him. My dad was abusive towards my mother in that he was controlling and emotionally abusive, after their divorce she didn't remarry...but instead had affairs with two married men, it only ever seemed to be about sex but she considered it to be about love. 

I mean, I guess that explains my issues with men...

I'm not sure I can be any other way when it comes to seeking male attention, it feels like a lot more than just a temporary thing that can be fixed, could this be part of some sort of personality disorder? ",02Feb2018,4,

17," So after years and years of Semi lurking on reddit, here's my first encounter of actually putting myself out there. Really I just am looking for an outlet to vent, seems I have no one to talk to in my own life. So for back story, I'm a 19 y/o guy who lives in a trailer. I grew up with two alcoholic parent's and an alcoholic step-dad to boot. My depression is something I have been able to come to terms with very recently, realizing that I need psychiatric help. My anxieties started when I was 6 years old and lost my grandmother who I was extremely close with to lung cancer. My mother is very adamant that her death changed me irrevocably which is something I, at first, completely denied. My mother tells me she has memories of me trying to jump out of her moving car so I could ""Be with grandma"". I have a very vague memory of something similar but didn't know the extent of it. Growing up I lived in a very small town of around 1000-2000 people, and was constantly bullied by a few specific peers for the entirety of my time in this town. Even my ""Friends"" would laugh and join in on the mockery, leaving me to feel like I had no one to really confide in.

 The death of my grandmother also deeply effected my father, who's alcoholism got rampantly worsened to the point where every night when I would hear he rumbling awake in his room I would hide anywhere I could. My father would harass and belittle me, humiliate me, and fuck with my head. Everything but beating me. I remember screaming that I wanted to kill him, and he'd look at me and say ""Do it"". One time this went as far as me really putting my hands on his throat and squeezing, causing him to thump me in reaction. This went on for many years, and my only source of sanctuary was at my grandfathers house. My grandpa was the one in my early years who was always there for me. I'd go to his house everyday both before and after school. He would cook my breakfast every morning, and forced me to do my homework after school everyday. If it weren't for him I would have failed the 8th grade. However I was not able to properly express my thoughts or emotions at this time (Still really don't, but I am better at it) and I was very distant from my grandfather. Often giving him one word replies and not paying him much interest, instead I would throw myself head first into books, YouTube, Reddit, video games, any form of escapism that would take me out of this realm.
 
 Freshmen year, my mother's addiction got so bad that my elder sisters came and took my mother and younger sister to where they lived to get her help. They got her into a rehab facility and my mother is not 5 years sober. When we lived in our hometown thing's were much worse with my mother, I was constantly cooking meals for myself and my little sister because my mother would be no where to be found. After they left I felt abandoned, and was left alone in this town with just my father. My grandfather was the only one keeping me sane during htis time. I decided I wanted to move to where my mother and sisters were, to be closer to them. It took many screaming vocal arguments with my father who did not want to let me leave, eventually I just went and made the decision myself. After a year of living in this new town I receive the news that both my grandfathers have died, within weeks of each other. This shattered my world, I had finally d=started to emotionally open up to my grandpa, and never got to tell him how grateful I was for him, and how great of a man I knew him to be. I think about him every day, he taught me so much and there is an infinite amount of actions that I will never be able to thank him for.
 
After my grandfathers deaths, I got heavy into drug use. Mainly MDMA, and Acid.I was friends with a few drug dealers and every weekend we would have all night acid parties just frying our brains out. This noticeably effected me in numerous ways that I couldn't even notice. Friends were telling me I had changed, family, and I would just shrug it off and say they were full of shit. And just NOT think about it. I realized my error after months and months of heavy drug use, never going past MDMA and Acid.

 Lately I have been having a lot of random thoughts about suicide again. This is something which I have dealt with constantly throughout my life, sometimes it's just an afterthought, nothing to be taken to serious, but sometimes I just imagine it and visualize it. I have been trying to take further steps to better my mental health, but I keep holding myself back. It seems every time I make progress my brain goes ""WAIT THIS ISN'T NORMAL WHY IS EVERYTHING GOING WELL"" and finds a way back into the familiar familiar chaos which is my life. There is a lot I have left out, since I'm not trying to post my literal life story. This is something I felt may help give me some sense of relief, putting my thoughts and emotions down somewhere.

18,"Alright, so as of late, my mood had been going down incredibly fast. I’d say the last year it has been like this.

It’s becoming consuming of me and I’m afraid I’m going to do something I’ll regret. I had began cutting myself following finding out my boyfriend had cheated on me.

20,"I've been interested in mental illness for a long time, and one question I have never been able to find a satisfying answer for is the extent to which it can be accurately diagnosed. To give a little personal background, I've never been diagnosed with a mental illness. However, I did see a doctor when I was around 12 or 13 (I lied about my symptoms because I didn't want to be put on medication), and am confident that if I were to see a mental health professional and be honest with them I could get diagnosed with a few disorders. Without going into great detail, I have moderately severe anxiety (mostly social) and depression. I also have a tendency to be paranoid and occasionally things I know aren't true seem to be very real (for example, as a teenager I once convinced myself that I had contracted rabies despite never having been bitten by an animal and displaying no symptoms). Not looking for sympathy, just want to give some context as to where I'm coming from.

In a college I read David Rosenhan's ""On Being Sane in Insane Places,"" where he essentially displayed the inability of psychiatric hospitals to diagnose schizophrenia. Based on this, I ended up writing a term paper entitled ""The Social Origins of Mental Illness,"" the central argument of which was that most mental illnesses are either just behavior society deems abnormal or are caused to a large extent by an individual's social environment. Building off this idea, I started to try to come up with my own definition of mental health, and have been very unsuccessful. This is largely due to the fact that I don't think I've ever met a human being that I think is sane, myself included. Some people think worshiping the sun is insane, but have no problem kneeling in front of a cross to pray and sincerely believe that they can communicate with a guy they read about in a book who supposedly died over 2000 years ago. To me, that seems to be an indicator of poor mental health. Humanity is destroying the planet that sustains us as a species and yet every day people pile into their cars to drive to a job they hate. I don't believe that any of those people are mentally healthy.

I guess my point here boils down to me not being able to take seriously any diagnosis of mental illness, at least not in this society, because I don't believe I have met anyone who is mentally stable enough, myself included, to make such a diagnosis. Has anyone experienced something similar?",02Feb2018,3,
21,"I think the stigma around mental health hasn't really improved. I mean, look at all the suicide awareness campaignes for example, yet we hardly ever talk about it. It's the least talked about subject in mental health, yet we hear ads telling us we can prevent suicide. Other mental issues get more of a mention, but still little is said because as a whole, mental health isn't something people want to talk about readily. The other thing I take into consideration is that mental health is so hard to analyse at times because people can choose to, or not to, talk about their mental health. And, their mental health care is determined by how honest people are too. Some people may simply give basic answers to their doctors without expounding their thought, or may simply evade the subject or outright lie for fear of being judged, or the person may not be interested in hearing what the doctor has to say, or may not even want help whether they need it or not. And since mental health is invisible, people can't just look at someone and accurately judge that someone has mental problems or mental illness, except when they happen to see the person when they're going through a mental breakdown. If you don't notice someone's behaviour, then how do you know they are having trouble with their mental state?",02Feb2018,1,

My partner has BPD, and is incredibly difficult to handle. Most nights she's not only highly critical of everything I say but also everything I appear to be thinking or could be thinking. Every day it's ""I'm just having a bad day today"" but everything from me trying to make jokes to having a slight difference of opinion is a fork in the road with consequences and hostility.

Has anyone here been with anyone with BPD or have BPD themselves?

I'm not sure how much of this is just garden variety depression or whether it's attributed to her treatment of me. When I first started dating her, everything was pretty ok she was just a bit fiery and I was a really calm, carefree guy who enjoyed pursuits of intellect and getting lost in books or games. Now I'm afraid to see anyone I know, make friends, change plans, or do anything I enjoy. I am in constant fear that I'm going to upset her or make her feel worse, because I love her. Sometimes she's great and the BPD takes a back seat but I'm concerned that this might be a result of exposing myself to controlling behavior.

About 2 years ago was the worst, when she was explosively angry, and emotionally and physically abusive. I again can't tell if its the rest of my complicated life or not but I'm so down all the time, so tense, and really tired. I feel like I have a child.

Is it possible to love harmoniously with someone with BPD or is it always going to be this hard? Has anyone gone through something similar where they've lost all sense of identity, and their own personal life from being so close to someone with BPD?

32,"I originally wrote this as a post on my blog (amiablepotential.com), but I thought I'd post it here after I found this page.

Through all the years that I've dealt with depression, I have too often let my pride stand in the way of getting help, but I also let it stand in the way of being empathetic with others. I hope this helps anyone struggling with the same things.

When I find a song that I really like, I tend to put it on repeat. All day long. I’ll listen to it in the car on the way to work and school. I put my headphones in and listen to it while walking from my car to my classes. I’ve got it on while I’m in the shower, while I do the dishes…you get the picture. (I do try to keep the volume low so my roommates don’t hate me. So far, so good-as far I know.) Luckily, this only lasts a few days to a week, until I have to avoid the song for a while before putting it back into normal rotation.

As I mentioned in last Saturday’s post, the song of last week was “Naked” by James Arthur. For the first day or two, I listened superficially. The song has a melancholy but lovely melody and passionate vocals that compelled me to listen again and again. Then, one night I was tossing about, praying for sleep to grace me with its presence, and I turned it on hoping his soothing voice would lull me to sleep. Well, let’s just say that it didn’t help with the sleeping, but it did force me to listen more closely to the lyrics. These words hit me in particular:

“I’m not gonna wait until you’re done pretending you don’t need anyone”

I used to be the person pretending that I didn’t need anyone. Whether it stemmed from depression, anxiety, or general shyness and insecurity, I don’t know, but for most of my life I kept people at a distance. I only let them see the shiny exterior (which one can only project for so long). I was so determined to prove I was fine on my own that I missed out on opportunities to get to know some great people.

That all changed in college when I made friends with people who didn’t take no for an answer. They just were my friends. January of 2016, when my mental health took a nose dive, I put up my usual barricades and tried to retreat into myself. I don’t think that I will ever be able to fully express my gratitude for my friends at that time.

I remember a particular day when my roommate refused to let me brood over my anxious and depressed state and coaxed me into talking about what was going on. At that point, I didn’t understand that I was mentally ill. I figured that if I just plugged along, doing my best to take care of my physical health and trying to be happy, my problems would resolve themselves. I definitely didn’t need any other human besides myself to “fix” my troubles. I was always more than happy to listen when others needed someone to talk to, but I didn’t need anything from anyone.

From that day on, I gradually began (with extensive help from my roommate) to see the value in sharing my feelings and experiences. At first, it was all for me. Keeping things bottled up only made me feel worse, so I learned to share with friends and family. Letting other people in on my mental state allowed my loved ones to direct me towards professional help and to provide the encouragement and emotional support that I needed on a day-to-day (let’s be honest: minute-to-minute) basis.

Over the next two years, I continued this dialogue. As my health improved, sharing went from emotionally vomiting to constructive conversations. I discovered that a number of people in my circle of friends had dealt with/still deal with similar struggles. The more I talked to others, the more I realized that I was not alone in my pain. Sometimes, I needed to listen, and other times I needed to talk.

The more I talked, and the more I listened, the more I realized how pointless it was for me to keep people at a football field’s length. I needed them, and they needed me. Pretending that I didn’t need anyone only isolated me and allowed depression to fill my brain with its lies. I couldn’t live off of keeping the depression at bay; I needed to fill my mind with truth, empathy, love, kindness, understanding.

“Getting half of you just ain’t enough”

We think that putting up walls shows our strength, but if we are strong we don’t need the walls. It takes strength to be vulnerable, to shed our facades. Pretending that my life was perfect didn’t make it so. Rather, it prevented me from being authentic with others. We don't need to tell every person who says hello about all our struggles, but we do have to let go of the need to appear perfectly put together. We all need at least one person in our lives who will listen to us and still love us even when we are a mess, even when we feel that we are worthless and useless. Otherwise, we are only playacting, only being half of who we are.

I see a great example of this when I watch certain selfish dancers. By selfish, I mean they dance for themselves, sometimes because they’re so focused on being perfect that they forget to perform and sometimes because they’re cocky. My favorite dancers to watch are the ones that give their everything. In the moment, they’re sharing a piece of their soul with their audience.

“I’m not gonna try ’til you decide you’re ready to swallow all your pride.”

While I was in the process of finding a strength in vulnerability, I met a person who had more walls up than I did. I make no claims of being perfect in the situation, but at a certain point I could no longer deal with the fortress preventing me from seeing the real person. I couldn’t wait around for someone who tried to overtly push me away yet subtly keep me around. My own personal progression required me to move on.

“Can’t you see that I’m naked”

Here on this blog, I am attempting to continue this journey of finding strength in vulnerability. In sharing my experiences, I find that I am able to make sense of and learn from them. I hope you find something valuable in them as well.

Thank you for letting me share with you.",02Feb2018,2,
33,"I’ve tried googling around to find others who have the same feeling I do but I must not be doing it right because I can’t find anything. Sorry if I don’t make sense or phrased anything weirdly. 

I feel like all of my senses are bugged somehow, that people can see through my eyes and feel anything I’m feeling, etc. My thoughts are being sent somewhere too, the same place that my senses are being broadcasted. Some of my pets probably have a camera in their eyes to spy on me, but I know for sure that most of them do not. 

When there are no bugs or cameras there are actual people, hiding in my house and watching. I just can’t see them for some reason, like they’re invisible. I have to do things like push the shower curtain all the way back to make sure nobody is in there, because even if I can’t see them then I’ll definitely be able to feel them. 

I don’t know who would want to spy on me and for what. I know that what this doesn’t make sense to a lot of people and most likely isn’t really happening, but I also can’t stop thinking it. When I don’t think this way, I feel embarrassed over it but then it’ll come back and I’ll feel stupid for being fooled.

We're expected to work and jump through hoops if we want to stand a chance of earning the money we need to enjoy a free, relaxed life, but we're caught in this societal torrent and life passes us by before we know it.

I think back to when I was a kid and how unappreciative I was of my easy life, complaining about small inconveniences like school or not having a girlfriend. It seems the more time passes by, the less time we have to simply enjoy life; the company of others, the feeling of lying on grass and the warmth of the summer sun, those precious moments when something makes you smile or laugh, those brief instances in your life that become crystalized in the fond memories you look back on, but we're told we have to move on from and focus once more on the dreary mechanical progression of our existence within the societal machine.

What's the point in anything we do in our daily life if we don't have the time to appreciate simply being? I'm tired of being just a gear in the endless system which appears to serve no purpose other than self-perpetuation. Why do we live in a world where those of us who simply want to enjoy life are called foolish or irresponsible? The world just doesn't make any sense to me.

40,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I have a history of social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression going back to my teen and early college years that has severely impacted my life and my ability to function normally as a person. But for the past six months or so my brain's been doing some really bizarre stuff I can't find any information on, and neither my psychiatrist nor my therapist has been particularly helpful. I figured I'd ask strangers on the internet about it, because what the hell. 

In addition to heightened anxiety (I'm having sometimes 3 panic attacks a day now without anything to trigger them) and a sense of high stress that won't go away, my brain keeps getting stuck in repetitive thought cycles I can't break out of. Namely, It's nearly impossible for me to think about anything BUT my mental health, and how I'm feeling in the moment. This is basically all day every day, and it impacts my ability to focus on anything else. My brain also seems incredibly focused on comparing how I am and what I'm doing in the moment to how I was and what I was doing in the past, to the point that it's incredibly difficult for me to be just in the moment. Sometimes at night I can break out of this, but it's getting rarer and rarer for whatever reason.

There's also this weird sense of stress surrounding all these activities I used to find enjoyable, which makes it very difficult for me in my leisure time. I can't focus on anything because of this weird deep seated anxiety and stress, and I have to be very deliberate in how I spend my time, otherwise I wind up staring at my phone mindlessly for several hours. It almost feels like I don't have any likes or interests at all at this point, which makes me feel very much not like myself. 

All in all, with these obsessive thoughts and inability to enjoy things, I just don't feel like myself and feel very divorced from what used to be my identity as a person. My psychiatrist is just sort of putting me on random meds at this point on the off chance that something will help, and says that because my brain is wired differently than other people's (I'm on the autism spectrum) there's not really a label he can put on this.

I'd be very interested in what anyone has to say about what might be going on here, or if anyone has any recommendations. I'm absolutely terrified about living the rest of my life like this. ",02Feb2018,1,

43,"Ill try to long story short this..

Didn't have the best of childhoods. Went through a lot of trauma including alcoholic parents, physical and mental abuse, grooming etc.

I've been through a lot, but I pulled myself through. I have a lovely flat, a good job, friends.

I do however struggle, I have problems and they are recurring problems I know are linked to my past and I need to deal with.

Whilst looking in to what might be going on with me I came across BPD. I fit (based on what the web says) most of the criteria. Although not all of them, its been enough to make me go hmm.. There might be something in this.

Im hoping to start seeing a counsellor soon to try and work out what my problems are and how to start having healthy relationships, particular with my partner now. We are rowing a lot.

Whilst I know I tick a few boxes, im very very reluctant to self diagnose and especially BPD. Im not qualified at all. And the more I read online the more it scares me. I dont think I am BPD I think I relate to parts of it.

My problem is I think its all been overload for my partner and he can't really understand my position or how to help.

I'm starting to feel like I dont have a voice in our relationship and he now only sees me as BPD. Even though I have never in any way been diagnosed. 

We had a conversation where I disagreed with something he said, in a response he said 'I think you're being irrational, odd, and not to label it, but BPD.'

I do not know where to go with this. Its been mentioned a few times in a row 'I am being BPD'. 

It shuts me down and makes me feel broken, put in a corner and point blank wrong / crazy. As if all my opinions now are BPD talking.

I've tried to explain I really don't like this being thrown in my face and I am at the point of considering ending our relationship over it. I don't want to, but as he is the only person I have who knows the turmoil im going through now trying to help myself.. It hurts he is so unsupportive.

How do I ask / explain to him I need him to be better / more helpful?
And more so in what way can I ask him to help? 


tl;dr: I have a few issues i'm trying to get help with, some elements of BPD resonate with me so I brought it up to the OH. Now he only sees me as BPD. I am not diagnosed with anything.

44,"I didn't know if this should go to /r/depression, but anyway; here's the story :

So I remember being in 6th grade, and basically being some kind of ""freak"", as others said. I always overreacted to anything, whether it be a prank or anything else. They'd always come to me, laughing at me for my unnatural reaction, and me crying afterwards. I think I was depressed, because at home I'd often sit on my bed, hoping for death or just something to end this pain. After that, I spent my whole 7th grade just pretending to be the ""normal"" guy, and after a few months, I became that guy. I got new friends, and everything went back nicely, I stopped overreacting, as I knew there were some people that cared about me.

I think it was some kind of harrassment, but really, I don't care about it anymore, it's the past and I'm not rancorous. (And let me clarify : I know harrassment is NOT ok, and that I should've talked to an adult about it)

Anyway, I'm in 8th grade now, and have gotten over this. What makes me bring this up is that a classmate is reacting just like me back then, and I think she is depressed. Perhaps I was one of the lucky ones to get over it quickly, but even if it takes longer for her to recover, I know how it feels like to constantly think about death and suicide (even though i haven't tried to). How can I help her?

47,"I hope that it’s ok to post this here. If not I’d be really grateful if you could direct me somewhere else.

I have a friend* Laura (not really Laura) who was ‘involuntarily admitted’ to a psychiatric ward sometime towards the end of last week during/after what I can only assume was a psychotic episode. I don’t know what the immediate trigger was (if there is such a thing), or what events took place to end up with her in there.

Nevertheless I have been in touch with her, and for the first time today she sounded more herself on text, so I offered to pop in and see her, which I did. It was great to see her, and I have to say she’s looking as well as can be expected. There was a certain amount of weariness in her eyes, and she certainly doesn’t seem to be massively stimulated by the activities in there, but on the other hand I gather she’s on fairly industrial quantities of Valium, so I guess that she won’t be too active.

What I’d like to ask is for any tips that you might have for me to be a good friend to her for the (as yet undefined) period she’s in hospital, and for once she is released. I took her in some snacks, chocolate and a magazine, but anything outside of that that you can think of that I can get would be wonderful.

Likewise, if there is anything I can do to ‘help’ with her care - I don’t mean in the clinical sense, but just in the sense of helping her to know that she is cared for, and that she has friends who are and will be rooting for her.

(Forgive me if the next bit comes off too strong - I know what I mean to say but I’m having trouble wording it!) Please note that I’m not really interested in a ‘diagnosis’ - I don’t really care if she’s suffering from psychosis or raging pink elephant syndrome. Unless it’s relevant that I know, I’m happy enough for her to tell me or not tell me at her leisure. For that reason I’d appreciate it if you could refrain from speculating on a diagnosis in your replies.

So, that’s it really. Any top tips?

(*) I left this bit to the end coz I’m trying not to make it about me, but this might be relevant. Laura isn’t ‘just’ a friend, but my ex. We split on good terms about 6 months ago, but have been in regular contact ever since, and I consider her a great friend. Where that might be a concern is that, from what I can piece together from texts, our relationship (both past and present) featured somehow in her episode. There was a particular text that she seemed to be reaching out for us to get back together. But, at the same time, I think that she feels part of a ‘conspiracy’ of some sort, whereby someone (maybe a group?) is trying to manipulate her, particularly through the Internet, computers and tv. I believe she also feels I might be a part of the conspiracy, and might in some way be trying to manipulate her myself. She said something today to the effect that she’s ‘not sure what my (as in me, not her) part in all this is’ and that I’m ‘difficult to read’. Please believe me when I say I’m not part of a conspiracy! Please also believe that, whilst I will admit that I have feelings for her and would be happy to get back together, I do understand that now is not the time to be thinking of that - indeed the time may never be right. Nevertheless, I do want to be a good friend, if that’s possible.

So, having said that, does the advice change at all? Should I engage with the idea of the conspiracy? Honestly, I think I’d find it very hard to provide any evidence that would help to PROVE I’m not trying to manipulate her, but if I can give her reassurance I would love to. Or, equally, should I try not to engage?
