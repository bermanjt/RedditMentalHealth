I am a thin, active guy, so I’m not sure if it’s because my body requires more to eat or it’s my anxiety? I usually eat plentiful and a variety of foods, so I’m not sure why my body can’t handle no food for several hours.",26Sep2018,2,

3,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I recently started seeing a therapist for some insomnia/hallucinations/emotional regulation problems.  Once I finish therapy, I was hoping to become a foster parent, but now that I’ve told my therapist so many things I’ve never told anyone, I’m afraid she’s going to tell the people who do my background check that I’m mentally unstable or at risk of suicide or something. I know there’s the whole confidentiality thing, but when kids are involved, does that go out the window? Does the fact that I’ve planned a suicide before and have occasional psychotic episodes(brought on by sleep deprivation) disqualify me? If so, why hasn’t she taken my daughter away? Or could she be planning to? I would  never hurt my child and she’s always well fed and cared for and loved. So I don’t see how it could be said that I’m unfit, but I’m still afraid because I just told my therapist last week about the suicide and hallucinations. Should I have not said that if I still wanted to be a foster mom? ",26Sep2018,3,

I know that should have to help him but I tried and it caused me stress. I don’t react well to stress and now the past few days I’ve wanted to kill myself, I feel ugly, I hate everything about myself. And this is all because I caused myself unnecessary stress by trying to find some guy some drugs. 
All I get told by people is that “I shouldn’t feel like this and I should be happy” but if I could just not feel like this then I would do that. I’m so sick and tired of feeling like the worst person alive and knowing that no one is ever going to love me. I just want to be happy. I want someone to tell me that I fucking matter without me having to prompt them to say it. I hate it. I’m always the person who tries to make someone feel better when they’re not doing okay. Always. But I feel like a fucking burden when I feel like shit so I cover it up and pretend I’m fucking okay. I’m not fucking okay. I fucking hate myself.

5,"I’m trying to figure out what I experienced tonight. I’ve been under a lot of stress and coping poorly. But managing. I also haven’t been sleeping well and last night was pretty bad. I’m feeling a lot of pressure to take care of a few things that are more emotionally difficult than actual difficult tasks (asking friends for help, trying to keep on task when I kinda want to crawl into a bed and give up.) 

A little while ago, I was trying to get in the shower, and I was feeling really low and apathetic. I wanted to go to a coffee shop because o suspected it would have enough people around me to help ease some of these feeling, but not so much intense contact as talking to friends. I was trying to keep in mind all the tasks I needed to do ie get in the shower, dry off, get dressed.... and I was hit with this overwhelming sense of obligations I had that I don’t really have. An example, I was thinking about how I would have to make sure I had time to get to my boyfriend’s place. Only he’s my ex, and we haven’t been together in close to a year. There were other things, but that one stood out the strongest because it was the first that made me think “wait, that makes no sense.”

If I could describe it, it was almost as if I became unstuck in time, or all my timelines were crashing into me all at once. 

The closest thing I can compare it to is how for a time after my husband died (I’m a widow), I would have thoughts similar/identical to the ones I had when he was alive. Things like “oh I have to remember to tell husband to pick up milk after work no wait a minute, he’s dead.” I attributed those thoughts to old pathways still being active in my brain. 

But I’ve never really had anything like that outside of my late husband. So this was really extra weird. 

I would guess caused by a combination of anxiety, sleep deprivation (I’m not sleeping much, and at most a couple hours last night), and maybe depression. 

It also left me feeling really weird and out of sorts, but not really detached. I thought maybe it was derealization, but googling it doesn’t seem to fit really what I’m feeling, I don’t think. 

It was strong and upsetting, and I want to figure out what it was to try and understand it better.",26Sep2018,2,

11,"Hi! New here. New to reddit really. This is a novel.

I am in a really painful situation and I would love some insight or help. 

I have been married to my husband for almost 9 years. We were 19 (me) and 21 (him) when we tied the knot. We were happy and until December of last year, I felt we had a normal marriage. 

I have been diagnosed with bipolar, clinical depression, C-PTSD and GAD as a teen. I have always been open about this and have been healing for over 10 years. 

My husband has never had a psychological evaluation. (This will be relevant once I get this story out).

In December my husband accused me of cheating with a friend of mine. Let’s call her A.
A and I were mostly friends because our kids were really close, she was new to town and we got along. If you’re a mom, you know how hard it is to find another mom who doesn’t make you want to gouge your eyes out. 

We spoke frequently but NEVER in an inappropriate manner. My husband saw that she had sent commented on something with a unicorn emoji and a Purple Heart emoji. Apparently, he looked up those emojis and they insinuated that we were involved in some sort of polyamorous relationship. 

This is 100% not true but I cut A out of my life almost immediately. I didn’t want him to feel he had anything to worry about. I regret ghosting her like that but I felt it was what I needed to do to keep the relationship with my husband healthy. 

I was wrong. 

The delusion has SPREAD. 

10 months later and he is still consumed with the *knowledge* that I have cheated in the past and continue to TO THIS DAY. 

I have yet to see any evidence that he could be sourcing but here are just a few details that will clarify the situation. 

1. We are both home 24/7. I work for myself, from home. I financially support our family. He is unemployed. (Doesn’t bother me, we are fine).We have been on the same house almost every single hour of every single day FOR YEARS. 
2. Whenever I’m not on calls with clients, I’m with my children in the living room. Playing with them and watching tv with them. 
3. I’m obese and wear make up like once a month. (aka, I’m not flashy and I’m not attractive by typical societal standards). 
4. He is fit, attractive, kind, intelligent. (Aka, he IS attractive by typical societal standards) 
5. My younger sister (23 yo) lives with us and helps us with the kids and chores. I pay her. 

Here are the beliefs that he is running as I’ve been able to gather them:

1. I have people sneaking in DAILY to have sex with me on the couch while my kids and sister are RIGHT THERE. And he is 15 feet away in our room. 

2. I have trained my kids and sister to pretend like my sexual partners are not here. Which is why they don’t acknowledge them or mention them. 

3. I have conspired with dozens of people who all hate my husband as much as I do so we can laugh at his misfortune. 

4. I get off on lying to him and watching him suffer through this (though I am literally crying and falling apart over this every day). 

5. I am polyamorous. 

These are all NOT TRUE by any normal interpretation of reality. And for 10 months I have been trying to convince him. 

Why wouldn’t I just leave when he “caught” me? 
Why would I have sex with people IN FRONT OF my children?? My sister? 

I’ve talked to a lot of people about this so for clarity: 

1. He may have had an emotional affair but definitely nothing physical. He is extremely antisocial and has no friends/colleagues. 

2. He is not violent but his behavior during arguments is erratic. He refuses to answer questions that would poke holes in his delusion. Refuses to clarify when I don’t understand. Refuses to provide details or evidence for any accusation. Stops me from expressing my pain constantly.

3. We do not have any history of infidelity. I once told him that I distanced myself from a coworker who was very flirtatious because I found myself enjoying it. This was in 2010 and I have never seen or spoken to this coworker since I set that boundary with him. 

So now, that we have the whole backstory, I really believe my husband is struggling with an undiagnosed mental illness. I have compassion for that. 

However, it’s been 10 months of hearing that I’m a serial cheating, lying, manipulative, sex addict. I’m OVER it. He fully believes this and is literally unable to hold an alternate view. I have tried to use reason, logic, proof, etc to change his mind. 

Nothing at all has worked. 
He just keeps waiting for me to confess. 
But that’s not going to happen because I’ve never cheated. 

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? I am beside myself with pain and confusion. I can see in his eyes that he believes the things he is saying. I am so sad that he doesn’t feel the love I’ve been giving him since 2009. He seems out of touch with reality. He shuts himself in this room day in and day out. He doesn’t spend time with the kids. He doesn’t help out around the house at all. I am carrying EVERYTHING while he sits and hurls these hurtful accusations. 

Oh and I’m pregnant with our third kid right now (unplanned). 

I just need some help. Some validation. I feel crazy.

21,"I’ve always been anxious in social situations, but usually not crippling, just shy and not really knowing what to say (fear of people judging me). 

However, the past month or two I’ve realized that I have become GREATLY paranoid, especially at work. I fear that my coworkers are ALWAYS talking bad about me, even though I’m friends with &amp; get along well with all of them. I often have intrusive thoughts that they’re actually against me but are pretending to be close to me to use what I say against me. But when I analyze it, i know I’m thinking irrationally but I can’t stop the loop of bad thoughts.

This happens in public too, with people I don’t even know. Like if I’m at the grocery store, I think people are talking about me when they’re on the phone or that everyone is looking at me and judging me. These thoughts trigger overwhelming anxiety, making it really hard to do anything outside of my house.

But my mind is like ""NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU HAVE TO ONLY DO ONE THING SO YOU CAN DO IT WELL"" It just feels like my brain is at war with itself determining what rules I am supposed to follow in life. I write lists of these rules almost constantly because I'm not very sure how to live life but I feel like I have to have rules to it or I feel disorganized and very bad. Someone please help. These rules can range from that I have to be perfect in every way possible or that I can't do anything but one thing because that is the most efficient way to live life. For some reason I have to put so many details in these lists because I'm afraid that I'll forget everything on that list and not live by the rules which gives me anxiety. Sometimes I try to delete the lists I make and try to live normally but then I start to feel very lost and have anxiety until I have a ""current"" list.

I saw this facebook post today that was a joke about how all my friends secretely hate me and that they only hang out with me due to pity.

26,"I have been feeling this stupid thing, that I want to be have someone else with me, be different persons, I'm over with socializing, I don't want to discuss it, the thing is that I don't want to deal with a friend quest ever again, human beings will always make me feel disappointment and will always get away from me because they don't like me, I'm not that weird, but it seems people just don't like me, and I won't deal with it ever again, if I get someone that can deal with me, I will have to deal with them, and try to make a connection, adapting myself to make my personality ""more accessible"" and that's just bothering and a pain, I don't want to try to make to meet someone again, (how are you? what's your name? it just makes me feel nervous, it will always get wrong at some point!) I don't want to feel alone anymore, of course, I have my family, but the family is a whole different context and you know it, they can give you a lot of support and understand you but there is a gap that their roles just don't fill, I want to fill that hole.

I'm also a very undecided person, I'm getting out of my nerves because I can't decide who I really am, I always considered myself a genius, not in intelligence but with an amazing personality that I think people will understand in the future, I think I'm great and even more great for letting being myself, I always felt so amazing energy and my emotions used to hold such big intensity in the past, it was incredible and it was the best thing ever.

Still, not everything has been good, in fact, in reality anything has been feel good at all, since the 10 years or so I have been experiencing socializing problems and a lot of reject, I am that kid who people say ""hey, is that kid, get the fuck out of here lmao"" and that has made me lost some vitality and will, I was mostly denying everything, feeling sad, going up again and acting hyper kinetic so I ended always doing a fool of myself and then going back again, and so on.

I don't think not acting hyper kinetic is not the answer, society always say be yourself and I will, if society doesn't accept me I don't care, I'm not doing anything bad, I'm just a bit spastic, rejecting someone just because of that is idiotic and makes me feel angry at people, people don't worth at all because they are all stupid for doing me this.

When I was 16 I had to accept I was a transgender girl since 6 years of dysphoria, including also my dad's cancer I finally fell completely into depression, later I started treatment and meds. But still, there is too much controversy going on today, and I can't bare it, I would live under a rock if I could, I don't like controversy and all the satire related to how we people live and the jokes people make to people like me, people is not worth it, and I would spit in all of the if I could.

I don't feel like being hyper kinetic again, for what? I can't show it to anyone, I feel with a lot of weight in my shoulders and no will to do anything at all, but I'm great, why it should matter?

I'm getting crazy because I can't see who I really am, I know I'm great, but it's just too much energy, energy that I don't have, and I can't do it.

**I can solve this if I split myself,** I can stop trying to hold the big mood, and let myself sparse with two different people, I present you to her, she is not as weak as I am, and she won't hold back when someone bothers me, she protects me and lets me, and won't disappoint me ever again (I repeat, I won't try to get a ""friend"" again, I already started over too many times) and won't make me feel alone ever.

But, in a way, I think is a wrong way to deal with the problems, because it allows me to be strong without suffering the consequences, it's wrong because by doing so I evade responsibility, but will I really do? Can just people address the problems to her and let her front the consequences at her way and with her strength? Is her somebody out of control that will free me of all rules? No, I think she knows the rules very well, she is just tired of all the bullshit, she will deal with all the problems, I won't have to repress my anger again, and feel safe, and have someone to talk to that understands me and doesn't discriminate me, it makes me feel better, my head starts to hear but I can feel the swap, but there is no blackout or amnesia so doing this makes me feel miserable, can I be two people? Would you consider her as a different person?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you can help me, I'm of course going to psychologist and psychiatrist, but I get appointments of 30 minutes only every two or three months, and in the end I can't really talk about everything because there is also my HRT and I don't want them to think I'm not healthy enough to keep it, so I hope to solve at least some answers here. I can talk with her too meanwhile the appointments come, so there is less pressure, she is really a big help.",26Sep2018,2,

I thought of this idea of sharing our experience to one another. It is scary to get diagnosed for some, or might be relieving for others. I am curious how was your first day when you were told you have been diagnosed with a mental illness or disorder? What was your reaction?

Mine was a mixture of relief and guilt. Guilt because I always had this image of perfectness, I never thought I would be having a mental illness or that it would be so severe, and I had no skills to cope with it.

I've seen therapists about it but I always find a way to skirt around the issue and close off, change the subject, talk about them, and because the pills work so well I don't feel like I've made enough progress because I don't talk about it. I don't want to feel like being sexually assaulted is normal, I don't want to normalize it, I want to feel the pain and I want to relive it so I can get past it. It took me going through a withdrawal and having to use actual coping mechanisms for me to realize that I'm okay but I'm not good.


I don't want to just feel okay anymore, I want to grow, I want to move on, I want to feel good about myself, feel confident in myself, my relationships, I want to end the toxic and cyclical nature of navigating (or lack of navigating) romance and intimacy, take back what makes connection so special and actually claim it without pushing it away. 


I am not broken but I'm definitely not fixed and I want that to change.


I want to take back my reality most of all, I don't want to question the way I see and hear things, I don't want to mistrust as much as I do, I want to be able to go outside in glasses and look at the sky and see sky, not wonder if I'm in a dream because I'm drowning in my own pond of depersonalization. I know I'm not crazy, I know this isn't psychosis, but I don't want to keep questioning what I already know.


In probably one of the most ironic twists of twists, as much as I don't wanna be medicated I want to experience an extreme high. I want to get stoned out of my mind, try psychedelics and know what unreal really feels like, or even microdose on psychedelics or get a medical marijuana card. I inquired into an MDMA trial related to PTSD because I feel like I need to go into the unreal and uncanny, really let go and experience it so I can be free of slipping into a purgatory built around a cage of depersonalization, or worse, the perpetual dread of feeling like my connection with reality will be severed and I'll be thrown into that purgatory at any moment. 


Then again it could be that I just want to feel, I know what feeling happy is like, feeling good, feeling wanted, liked, loved, elated, but that's not the problem. The problem is the fear of feeling bad, that I feel so depressed and low because I can't feel really angry, despair, pain, sadness, I can't feel bad because I'm too afraid of it, I'm afraid that I'll spiral if I allow myself to delve into the dark side of the emotional spectrum. I want to be able to let go and break down, lose my shit, break down into tears, without guilt or fear that I'm regressing. 

And I feel like that's what the pills and the fear perpetuates, it sugar coats reality to the point where the sublime and beautiful are dulled. 


I cried when I saw wildflowers on the way to Gainesville, the sight was striking and I didn't cry because of the beauty. I cried because I was sad that I never took a moment to really be able to enjoy that sight, I cried because I was happy that I felt that sad longing, it was such a relief and I want to feel that again.


Maybe this is all just stream of consciousness, maybe this is just a roundabout way of saying I'm not happy because I can't let myself feel unhappy, I just know it stems all to the trauma and I want, no need, to face it for real.

I’m completely stuck and miserable. Behind in life, a failure. Bipolar and pathetic. I recently took up riding a bike around my neighborhood to distract my mind and give my self a break every now and then. Thing is I can only ride once it’s pitch black in my sketchy tweaker town, I guess that’s a good thing because it keeps me going fast. I have to go when it’s dark for fear of people seeing me and judging me, which is totally irrational. I stopped going every single night and changing up my routes as I go and getting lost sometimes, paranoid that people might be looking out their windows wondering why I was riding by their house every night. Also irrational. I started to notice my brain and body going completely numb. I would be staring at the road in front of me trying to figure out why I couldn’t feel a single thing. Every time a car speeds by I jump so hard I almost lose control of the bike, since my music drowns out the sound of them approaching. These brief seconds of fear are the only thing I can feel.  I’m starting to dread the bike rides now and they were my only escape from the house. I’m a neet atm for reasons that aren’t my fault as unbelievable as that might sound. I don’t ever leave my house, I don’t sleep until 6am and then sleep the day away. Riding my bike 4 miles every night was my daily exercise, made me feel a little better about my situation, but now it’s starting to feel like every other interest/hobby I’ve lost all interest for. I tried to kill myself like Robin Williams, minus the slit wrists lol. But wasn’t drunk enough to fight off the flight or fight responses. I’m in a relationship that offers no emotional support whatsoever and don’t have any friends.
I keep wanting to make friends with people on their internet, but I’m too scared of trusting the wrong people. ",26Sep2018,2,

38,"As a kid I used to have extreme bouts of paranoia. I thought the rapture (I grew up in a super religious household) was going to happen because of me. Like Jesus himself was waiting on me to do a specific action before deciding to commence the rapture. I'd constantly have thoughts like ""oh crap I can't turn my stereo on, what if Jesus is just waiting for me to turn on the stereo"". I'd always be super paranoid about my health. Anything that was wrong or could be wrong with me I thought I was dying. I read about so many mental illnesses and tried to self diagnose all the time. My parents took me to so many doctor visits who just told me all of it was in my head. I thought every time I was in public people were laughing and talking about me. Every time I scratched furniture with my fingernails or something similar I always had to apologize in case they had feelings or they may hate me. I even had a whole paragraph I'd recite every time I did this. It was weird. I used to think I could hear a tracking device that aliens had put in my ear when id go to sleep at night.  I would hear a weird dinging noise and then think they were tracking me so I would move my head around until I couldn't hear it anymore and assumed they lost signal. I would get weird hallucinations (night time mostly) and thought that posters in my room were moving or laughing at me or wanted to kill me. And oh man the night terrors were terrible. So realistic I'd constantly be waking my mom up in the middle of the night. The paranoia for the most part has subsided. I still get weird thoughts that people are laughing at me or I think I keep seeing things in my peripheals and I have bouts where I'm worried about my health. But I don't have crazy delusions like I used to as a kid about the rapture and aliens and what not. So I'd like to say whatever was wrong with me was mostly cured. But is this just normal kid things? I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety and social anxiety. But my therapist said during one of my first visits she'd take me to Walmart and make me talk to people to get over my fear of strangers and so I stopped going after like the 4th visit. I have trust issues too majorly. Wasn't the happiest childhood by no means.  Is it possible I had childhood schizophrenia that subsided? Sounds weird and doesn't seem likely since most of those episodes didn't carry on until adulthood. I don't know exactlywhere to proceed from here either. If just medication would work (I was on Zoloft but felt it did absolutely nothing for me) but I get episodes of slight paranoia where I think my husband is lying or my friends are trying to trick me and I've gotten to the point Ive mostly isolated myself. Scared of therapy because I don't want a therapist forcing me into stuff that fast like the last one did. I just wanna talk about my feelings and then maybe proceed with treatment like that.

40,"Hey all I need some help in regards to a problem which has appeared over the past 2 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow here it goes, I'll try to keep it concise and structured but I can't promise you anything.

 So I guess I'll start with my sorta mental background. I've suffered from being depressed for quite an extensive period of time, ever since I was like 9-12, from my early teens into now (I'm 20 now) So I mean yeah that's been going down and I know my mum, my cousin, my aunt, and my grandpa are a few of the depression sufferers that I know from my family, and umm yeah I've always known how to feel sad and depressed and shit, I was bullied a lot in school, all the way from primary, to secondary and so on, never really had a lot of friends, and the main thing I always experienced was either extreme depression or sadness in my sorta early teens and all. When I was 15 I was pretty close to suicide and was contemplating on it and everything, but the reason why I didn't go through with it was because I was extremely scared of death and what happened afterwards and I've just been depressed continuously till now, sorta I mean I would have these long periods of numbness and an apathetic outlook on everything, but these sorta time periods usually ranged from a month to like even a year, and through these periods I was thinking I was fine and everything, until I got hit with a big slump of depression, what would happen would be I'd be extremely sad and depressed for 2-4 days, be okay the next 2-3 days and the cycle would continue like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the point of which I require help, 2 years ago I met a girl online, who I formed a long distance relationship with and the first 6 months I was feeling pretty ecstatic and it was great, like I tried my best with it and I wasn't the best with empathy but I was learning to take her feelings into account and try to make her feel better if she was down, although I was never too good at this and still suck ass at it, but the main thing that has changed now is I am mid visiting her because she lives in a different country in comparison to me and ever since I am not back home anymore, I am not feeling sad or depressed anymore apart from missing my dog I guess. Although back home my mum made me depressed a lot, be it intentional or not she tried to manipulate me into different things here and there and always used the reasoning she wanted the best for me. Like trying to push me into uni although I felt very unprepared and depressed as I had barely passed any of my subjects at school in the last year, and I asked for a year break (2017) to see if I can better myself, but she herself was depressed a lot and I don't have the best relationship with her. I know I am really sidetracking here but I feel like this stuff is somewhat important in helping me reach the conclusion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now since I have been here, and away from my family I don't feel depressed or anything, and I am not put under pressure, or they don't shove their pressures onto me, (mainly my mum) or just don't try to manipulate me into doing things I have said no to. I am back into that neutral sorta apathetic phase again where I don't really care about anything and feel sorta just neutral to everything, I mean I have obsessions like specific games and everything, but nothing important, but this phase of feeling neutral, I have no idea what happened but I don't know what to say to people who are sad or depressed, or I don't know how to comfort them. Lately I have been ignoring my girlfriend over some of these obsessions like ""mmo's, but they aren't like wow, text based, yeah I know"" and I mean I can tell you I don't try to intentionally, but like I'll be online, while I am on the pc and she starts talking to me and mid conversation someone replies to me, I have a hard time keeping my mind on her and what she is talking about, as soon as someone messages me or I was in the middle of doing something there, I just jump straight to replying to them, and just get lost in it, and she would then get annoyed at me, but it's not just that, I haven't been there for her when her cats died or she was going through rough patches in her life, I always managed to fuck that up somehow, by hanging out with someone or something, and when she confronts me about it I don't really know what to say to her, I mean I know I should be sorry and everything and I do say that, but I just don't feel it, I have a super hard time comforting her. It's not just that though, when ever even a friend is going through something rough, I usually say the same thing and try to comfort them that way, but I don't really feel it in me, I really am lost for words at those points when I need to comfort someone, but the thing is I used to be able to do this, even a few years back when I was more depressed, I could still comfort people because I could feel those feelings in me, but now I just don't feel any feelings anymore and I don't know what to say to her or anyone if they are down or feeling sad, I say things which I think are right, but I can't act on them, like I can't stop myself from ignoring her, even though I don't try to I just get sucked into what ever. Like I mean I am still pretty sure I love her but I just don't feel any emotions inside myself anymore, and I just don't know what to say to people unless I can plan it over text and explain it that way since I am not put on the spot and can take what ever time I want to finish writing what ever words of encouragement I am writing. 

I just feel neutral and any emotions have really disappeared apart from getting pulled into games, I don't have sad or depressed days or anything anymore, I just have nothing in me, and I don't know what to do about it anymore since I can't feel this empathy. I know I have done wrong in ignoring her in her times of need and not paying attention to her when I should be but it is extremely hard for me to manage that and I just can't seem to help myself because I know if this goes on any longer she will finally stop putting up with my crap. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope that I haven't posted this in the wrong place in regards to my mental health sorta stuff and I apologise for how long it is, so yeah, like I mean if you have any ideas with what I could possibly be going through or what ever then yeah, feel free to post, plus I haven't proof read this thing so there may be errors. I also hope I didn't fill this with too much crap information and hopefully it's somewhat helpful.

45,"So I'm in a basic psychology class for college and my professor is apparently a psychologist for prisoners or people sentenced to a psychologist in order to better themselves with mental help.

Based on how she talks about mental illnesses, she should not be involved. I understand it's a basic psych class and she's not supposed to go into HUGE detail on the disorders, but she uses examples. 

One example was for Borderline Personality Disorder. ""Guys, say you find a girl who cuts herself, or has scars from cutting herself. you RUN from her.""

Another was for OCD. ""Do they have white or off-white carpets? Do they clean nonstop? are their clothes folded neatly no matter what? that's OCD."" from my understanding, that's not all OCD is.

I get it. she oversimplifies disorders due to the nature of the class. but. some of the things she says are SO toxic. She has no idea what some of her students are going through, but makes comments about how if you have *blank* disorder, people should run from you bc you're too insane to love.

She also asks students personal questions during lecture and when the student is VISIBLY uncomfortable continuing their response, she keeps at it until they fess up everything.

I just find myself very upset with how she explains things and how even as a psychologist, she's perpetuating negative stigmas about certain disorders. how the fuck do I deal with this for a whole semester?",26Sep2018,10,

49,"Not matter what I'm doing I can't live the moment, I'm waiting and coping until I can sit down, smoke and watch the world go by. I don't feel comfortable until I'm doing nothing. If I do nothing for long enough then I get terribly depressed and attempt to socialise and progress in my life but as soon as I'm active I can't wait to sit on my ass again especially as I've ""earnt"" it.

No motivation, time slips by, I live a mediocre life with occasional joy. Relationships wane as I struggle to appear convincing in my sociability. People progress, have children, marriages. I basically do the minimum to move through life with them.

I constantly compare myself to others, I envy successful people and look for the lowest common denominator to feel superior to.

Depending on the day/week I can see myself as being average, with opportunity a personality and skills or a worthless slacker with no redeeming qualities. The prior encourages me to relax and slack, the latter to panic and make a short lived effort to improve.

For example, sometimes I'll feel very close to my partner/a friend and can really bond over a shared understanding of the world/feelings and have a true sense of connection. The next day we may have a difference of opinion or interpret something differently and suddenly I can't understand how we'd ever be able to feel close, we're isolated and alone.

I can have absolutely zero self esteem and struggle to go to the grocery shop let alone make decisions about my life, another day I could be centre of social group with wit and confidence. Im falling more and more into the low self esteem state though.

I've struggled with depression and anxiety seemingly forever. Therapy Is difficult because I, counter intuitively, feel a lot better being able share my mind and lose the ability to convey the seriousness of my low points. I sort of forget how bad it can be and wonder why I'm even there.

Ironically I deal with my anxiety by feeding myself caffeine and nicotine. It's a spiral. I might be addicted to anxiety.

51,"Hello everybody,

I apologize if this is somewhat of a “vanilla” question but I feel my mental health is at stake. 

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder at the age of 18. I am now a 24 yo male. The periods usually range from 2-8 months of pure misery and suicidal ideation. I was hospitalized at an inpatient facility the July before last for these symptoms. 

Just last week, I had what one may consider a suicide “attempt.” Had the slipknot around my neck, note written, drunk enough for disinhibition, etc. Was fading fast and around 5 secs away from passing out and asphyxiating myself. However, I felt an almost other-worldly presence crying out to me from in my body...almost like I was killing another pseudo-divine being inside me. Like my body itself was crying out to spare it. So I did. 

This is where it gets tricky. My GP had started me on 5 mg of a newer SSRI called Trintellix about 3 days prior to this attempt. I was on no other medications up until that point (have been on others in the past, but weaned off 6 months prior). I am aware SSRIs can induce manic/hypomanic states and I fear this may be the case. 

From last week until now, it’s been almost a complete 180. I feel almost hyper-competent now. Very motivated and have begun a strict diet and exercise regime. Gotten more done in a week than the past 6 months. Listening to music “speaks” to me again. I get chills up the spine and the back of my head from many songs, and just from thinking about profound thoughts about my life in general up until this point and how far I’ve come (I never get this neurochemical release when depressed). 

Other changes in behavior: I’m much more open and talkative with people. I almost always feel like I can say the right thing. I am somewhat irritable and combative (really conscious to try to limit this). I can only sleep 5-6 hours a night, and it doesn’t feel very restful. Still not tired during the day though. I have spent more money recently, but it’s on things to improve my health (new gym membership, new shoes for b-ball league, b-ball league fees, healthy food). I wasn’t really able to leave the house before up until this point. 

Here’s the real kicker: I’ve displayed this behavior pattern before, back about 3 years ago in college. I believe it was also brought upon by the onset of a drug, this one an SNRI called bupuprion. Much more irritable back then, to the point of outward physical aggression. I alienated a lot of good friends in this state with my behavior. Some still won’t talk to me to this day. They used to say things like “you’ve changed.” But I ignored them until my parents kind of snapped me out of it. Somewhat heavy amphetamine (adderall) use at this time. Caffeine as well.

Fast-forward back to now, and I fear I may be in the same state. My stream of thoughts comes very fast, but not to the point of incomprehension or delusion. I’m really just afraid, guys. I have so many questions:

Has my medication induced a hypomanic state? Has the Trintellix even gotten enough time to take any sort of effect? Is the sleep deprivation just my circadian rhythm readjusting to my sleep schedule (been trying to go to bed earlier). Do any of these symptoms sound pathological in nature, or am I just being paranoid? Is this just what it feels like to not feel depressed? 

I should add I am on no stimulants as I was afraid of going through that college thing again. And sorry for the long post: I’ve never relayed all of this information to someone at once before. I fear I may have been misdiagnosed; I’ve bounced around to so many mental health professionals that nobody has a comprehensive history of my behavior and mood patterns. 

TL;DR: Have cyclical patterns that alternate between intense depression and more brief periods of “hyperactivity” and heightened states of well-being. Not sure who I really am, or what my mental diagnosis should be. 

I’m really just trying to find the right medication for my condition (or lack thereof). I want to be a good person and not kill myself. I also fear another impending crash in mood from my current condition (depression always comes back for one reason or another). Thank you for reading all or some of this post.

I woke up. Then I went to kitchen, my father was in bad mood. I sad hello, he replied hello too. Then I went to my room. Later I went to kitchen again to eat. And my father told me that I stole his money. I tried to prove that I hadn't stole his money, but he was talking how I stole his money. It made me sad and angry. I was really humiliated. Later I went to kitchen again. My mother was there. I told her hat happened. My father made some angry face expression. I tool his hands.I wanted to put him outside of house, just to show him how I feel. Then my mother tried to stop me. He felt on floor. I wanted to scare him and I put my hand around his neck. He started to scream: Help me, this thief wants to kill me! I could see that he lies, I saw it in his face expression. I got so angry and sad in same time, that I could not control my self anymore. I sat him on face and kicked him in stomach. After that I left kitchen. Then I decided to go back to kitchen to see where he hides money. I was trowing stuff everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I feel like shit. It was more than 6 months ago and I still feel some tension in stomach and I constantly think about it. I do not know if it is self hatred, or something else. First 2 months I was suicidal and I tried to kill my self. Now I am not anymore suicidal, but I hate my self. I stopped doing everything that I loved until this day. I stopped playing instruments, making music, learning languages and stuff about science and stuff for job. I am different person now. I hate my self.

Sometimes I write on reddit that he was bad person when I was younger, because I think that it could cause my aggressive behavior this day. He was beating me, my sister and my mother 10-11 years. Everything has started when I was 4 and ended when I was 15. he also abused me emotionally and sexually: he was thinking that I had phimosis and he forced me to get naked in front of his friends, because one of them was doctor. I think that this guy was't doctor, he was pedo. He also kicked my mother with piece of wood in head. I think that he could kill her.

Yesterday I went to kitchen to take glass of water. But my parents were talking. My mother said to my father that he was beating her when she was 7 months pregnant. Now I know how he was bad person, but still I feel self hatred, or gilt. I want to have normal life, but I can't I always feel guilty, because I kicked him and spat on him.

57,"I've been thinking a lot about death lately. When I lay out the things that make my life I can only see more reasons to die than continue. It's rather simple actually. My parents deeply dislike me, and bottle up resentment towards me for ruining their lives by stealing away their young years of freedom. Relationships are statistically doomed to fail, and it feels rather pointless to keep putting real effort into people when it's only temporary. You can do everything right in life, make one mistake, and be ostracized by society, now that we live in an age where everything follows you. 

I have plenty of purpose as a project head in the fintech industry, along with a few different skills and talents. I dont exactly feel like I'm searching for answers anymore as when I more philosophically curious. I've done a cost to benefit analysis of existing and I simply can't come up with a reason to continue. It simply doesn't feel like it's worth the effort. 

Am I suffering from an mental illness? I honestly feel fine, but my knowledge of the limitations that we have as humans disencourages me to participate in life.

58,"I do not experience mania or extreme sadness. 

I do feel the ""high"" occasionally but its not extreme. I don't think that I'm the God of the world. Just extremely confident and happy.

My sadness is also VERY mild. I never thought of suicide just a meh feeling. Just a ""meh I don't care"" type of feeling. 

I don't do reckless things like I saw in the symptoms. 

My day to day basis now are a mix of sad and happy. I can feel sad for a few hours then cheer myself up and be happier for a few hours. 

I can control the sadness. Sometimes its feeling as if I make myself sad on purpose.

Yet, I get super weird about singing in front of my own parents and even doing normal things in front of them like talking on the phone. Maybe because they begged me for so long to do it when I was little and I wouldn’t...

I'm based in the North of England if that makes any difference. 

I feel like my life is falling apart. I'm 20 and recently moved away to university and I've never felt more alone in my entire life. I was diagnosed when I was 16, on and off meds since then, currently off.

I'm so confused about every aspect of my life. One minute I want to leave my boyfriend, who still lives back at my home town an hour away. The next I'm completely in love and can't manage without him. One minute I just want to drop out and the next I don't. I feel like I have no one, I feel so lost all the time. If I'm not in class, and sometimes when I am, I'm crying. I can't sleep, I can barely eat and what I do manage usually comes back up again. I don't want to be alone and I don't want to be around people. I can't take a year out as I've just had two to work on my mental health and I can't keep putting this off. I thought I was ready for this now and I'm not but I need to be but I feel like I'm losing my mind. It's my first proper week of classes and I've already missed two and I know I'm not helping myself but I'm just completely lost and I don't know what to do. 

I feel so alone, I'm struggling to make friends. The friends I already have in this city are so busy that I rarely see them and when I do I just feel awful for talking about myself all the time so I pretend everything is okay. 

I feel lower than I have in my entire life. I've registered for an appointment with on campus counsellors but they only offer six sessions per person per year. 

I know that I have people in my life that love and care about me but that doesn't change how I feel. I feel so alone and lost and like I'm just not meant to be happy. I've recently decided to stop drinking, but fuck, all I want right now is to down a bottle of vodka and go to sleep. Possibly forever.

66,"Hello, Reddit. I'm a 19 yo guy and don't know what to do with my life.

For the last 5-7 or so years I've been constantly at home alone all day every day absolutely wasting my life on the internet. I don't have any friends. When i finished school and started uni, things changed but only slightly. I mean, i talk to people in the university, but i often find that i have nothing to say and people are mostly not interested in talking to me. 

I don't know if this has to do with the exessive use of the internet in the past,  but I can't concetrate on anything. I want to be good at what I do, but I can't sit down and just learn math. I constantly feel the urge to stop and go watch youtube or porn or something. 

Speaking of porn, i am addicted to it. I try to stop myself from fapping (r/NoFap), but i still watch it sometimes just as a form of entertainment. 

I am CONSTANTLY (all the time) tired and i can't figure out why. I forget my belongings everywhere all the time and am made fun of for it. I can't concentrate on the subject during lectures and lessons. Instead I daydream about how good my life could be all the time and i can't stop myself.

In my university they have a robotics lab, where i can work, and i do kinda find it interesting and wanted to start going there. But when i do, the main guy there tells me what i can do (help on a project) and i am overwhelmed by how much effort it would require.

Also, i am gay and i live in Russia. I dont think my peers would hate me for it, but if i come out, the fact that i'm gay would just make me look even more silly in the eyes of everyone (no one told me that directly, but i'm pretty sure everyone thinks i'm a loser, i've heard them laugh behind my back).

In the back of my mind i always think that a huge part of my problems is caused by my parents. They just didn't care to raise a well-adjused person. My dad is a loser, basically, my mom brings in the cash, working as a nurse. He is soft and i've never seen him defend his views. He also never taught me how to do that, obviously. My mother is pretty judgemental. She often shames me for my taste in music and stuff like that, but one the other hand she always demands love from me and makes me smootch her and stuff, which is humiliating. I'm just getting the vibe that i was meant to be a toy baby and my parents never had the intention to raise a good adult.

The biggest problem is, I am not interested in anything at all. I may get an urge sometimes to watch a tv show or read a book, but in the process, i always, without fail, start daydreaming and don't pick up on the actual story of the book/show/movie. Or if i try to learn i get distracted the sane way.

About 8 months ago i joined a gym  (skipped 2 months and just got back to it), a lot of people suggest that it could improve my mental health, but i can't say that it does. I want to find friends and get a bf, i want to be able to stand up for myself, i want to be interested and passionate about things, but i just can't. It hurts seeing my peers being happy and funny and passionate and in relationships when i just look at it from the side. I write here because i want to get any advice i can. Thank you so much if you decided to respond.

(Btw, i mostly learned english from watching youtube non-stop)",26Sep2018,2,

It goes like this. If I eat something that is cold, my teeth will hurt for a little bit and it will be gone.

It’s like every time I do eat cold food, there’s a knife stabbing right into the part of my brain that controls my emotions.

I have never been able to figure out why this happens. I’ve done research, talk to doctors, and now for the first time asking on reddit.

Even as Id tried so hard to get her to leave the party with me knowing she needed to sober up. It still keeps me up and ruins entire days for me, the fact that I tried to stay and help her even after that as not only an SO but a friend, I should have just left her to her addiction and taken care of myself, but I was so naive then and thought I could help. Puts a nasty taste in my mouth and makes me angry when my breathing doesnt cooperate reseeing that shit. I dont know why it will come up in my mind at times when im doing something else and its so hard not to just shut down. The specific memory has triggered other unpleasant memories from that time and Ive shut down for days in the past just processing it all. I was only able to get her to talk about it by telling her id seen the video. Its just one of those things where theres no place to talk about it, even in therapy I have talked and it doesnt make it any less nauseating , times helped a little but even 2 years later it wakes me up sometimes and I cant sleep and end up just chainsmoking until the nausea lessens.

I wish to share something with you all and I hope that this will either give some advice for those in need and at the same time I hope to gain advice from someone who may experienced or experiences the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine you are close to your 30s and you managed -nothing- in your life. You dumped school, you made a lot of bad choices of which some came with rather destructive consequences. You ran through every traumatic experience possible. You were lied to, cheated on and betrayed, abused and hit and hurt in so many ways that I don´t even wanna start counting or listing them all right here right now. For years life was nothing but a torment, the pure existence nothing but exhausting, tiring and sad. You wake up in the morning, no job nor money, literally only roleplay or videogames and stupid shows seem to dominate your day. You´re alone, lonely even and you have literally no one to truly talk to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing more could be better than a shoulder to cry on. You are in desperate need for a hug, for a little attention, for a little appreciation. But you have no friends, no family and if you have any of it... friends never have time or you´re nothing but the black sheep for those who share your blood. 

Every day is a pain in the arse, you question the very essence of life and existence. Why keep going? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 100% sure that at least a few of you know -exactly- what I am talking about here. I am 120% sure that some of you have experienced this feeling I just described or eventually experience this situation right now in the very second you read this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

After close to 30 years of life I have found love for the first time. True love. No fake love. Nothing that breaks. A bound many dream off. For the first time in your life you see a meaning, you wish to be better and there´s a motivator to visit the doctors, get a therapy, work on yourself. Do a walk every day, eat healthier, get better. For the very first time in my life I want to live. But now? 

There´s this shadows hovering over me and the shadow looks like the grim reaper holding his scythe close to my throat. I cry alone in my room, begging dreadfully ""please give me a few more years/please I don´t want to die -not yet"". I know I am not healthy, I know I need to do something and I just started the path of getting better. But the sense and fear of feeling like I have run our of time is so strong that it is difficult to ignore. I feel like now that I finally want to live I get more and more ill. My body weakens from years if isolation. My body hurts and my muscles die from the years I haven´t moved an inch for weeks at a time and I can feel and somehow I know I do not have much time left. Now I am exhausted and yet I need to fight. I have to live for me and for -him- ! 

&amp;#x200B;

But what can I do now? Is it already too late? Tomorrow I have an appointment at a doctor, she´s gonna check on my health and likely can give me advice on where to find a therapy soon. But what if I die tonight? What if I cross the street and pass out? What if I suddenly get a heart attack and die alone and lonely without anyone knowing or noticing like my father died a couple of months back? What if it is too late? What if depression and anxiety had kept me hostage for long enough to do enough unrepairable damage? And worst off it all... I know its my own fault as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

How many times have people like my father told me that I have to move once a day, go for a walk. Eat healthy, get a job, travel and so on? How many times have people given me the advice to seek help? To go to a professional? I cannot count how many times I was told these words and I am certainly sure many know this. Depression keeps you locked in your bed, you literally don´t care if you die and all you wanna do is sleep all day? 

&amp;#x200B;

For once in my life I wish to demand something in Hope it can help you before it is too late!!! Please listen!!! 

&amp;#x200B;

*""I know these are the worst words to tell someone dealing with mental illness. But as someone suffering herself I must tell you:* 

**GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!** 

*I know how harsh this sounds. I know how painful this sounds. I know. Believe me!! But please for your own good and to prevent later very painful regrets get help right now. I can understand how exhausting it is to open your eyes in the morning. I understand how scared you are to leave your room, to go outside and to socialise. I know how rough it is to make a simple phone call and I know how demotivated you are as life doesn´t have any meaning to you at all. But please... please... No matter how hard it is, pick up the phone, make a doctors appointment now and let him check you. Let him test your blood, your body and all that. Make sure you´re physically healthy and at the same time try to find a therapy.* 

*It will be a rough road. You´ll be exhausted. You will cry a lot. You will be in pain a lot. But believe me this - bit of stress and terror - is little compared to a serious mid life crises when you come to an older age and you look at your life and you did literally nothing with it. It is so hurtful. So painful and the regret and grief and pity you feel for yourself makes you drown every second of the day. Please! Please! Please! Please! Believe me.* 

*I know it´s rough. I know it´s hard. I know it feels like the world is on your shoulders and it will get rougher the first few weeks as you actively try to make yourself better. But I can promise you it is worth it. It took me 30 years to realise but I am worth it. I am worth receiving help. I am worth to be loved. I deserve to be happy and so do you! YOU ARE WORTH IT!* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Do not make the mistake to sit alone in your room in a few years an regret not taking that job. Not giving that guy or girl the chance. Not traveling. Not caring for yourself! And this is where I wish to ask everybody who read this far to do YOURSELF a favour and if you still think you aren´t worth it, then do me the favour. Do this strange girl you do now know the favour. Do me whom sat here 30 minutes to write this the favour and invest just 10 minutes time! Every day only 10 minutes and if you cannot do 10 I am okay with 5 as well! Once a day I wish that you try something tiny (which is in fact pretty big already). Once a day try to pick up the phone and call a therapist or a doctor. Make the appointment and try to go there. Once a day take those 10 minutes and make a healthy salad or some veggies instead of that microwave pizza. Once a day try to have a small walk, it only needs to be around the block to the corner store. Only once a day! Only 10 Minutes! No more. And if you one day feel like you want to invest 20 or 30 minutes.... GREAT! I am so fucking proud of you!!!! No matter how much time you invest, for every minute of the day you do something good for yourself I am proud of you!!! And I know you can do it!* 

***DO IT BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!****""*

79," I have been convinced, for as long as I’ve had the terms at my disposal to describe such things, that my older brother has some very serious undiagnosed mental health issues. The purpose of this post is to describe some of his behaviors and (hopefully) to receive some useful feedback.

We live in an unfortunate situation. He and I are both in our late twenties and share a bedroom at our parents house. Neither of us are yet in a position financially to move out of our parents house. Despite the fact that we effectively live within 6 feet of each other and always have, we haven’t been on speaking terms for the last 10 years or so. We’ve had short periods of time where communications improved, but ultimately things degenerate over time, something will flare up, and communications cease. Exchanges between us are rare and purely functional.

What sparked this post was a minor epiphany just last night. As I sat at my desk, and he at his, I slid my glass across a wooden table to move it closer to me. Imagine the sound that might make. Seeming not to like that sound, his reaction was to take his own glass and in an exaggerated way, mimic that gesture, creating the same noise but obviously much louder. He didn’t say:

“That’s an annoying noise - could you try not to do that?”

If he had, I know that I’m conscientious enough to at least \*try\* not to do it. Anyway, the impact this had on me was quite bad. Each time I reached for my glass thereafter I had to second-guess myself. Do I bow down and and be careful not to make too much noise - thus rewarding his behavior and lack of communication? Or do I continue to drag the glass - and risk escalating the situation further? In either case, it’s now at the forefront of my mind while I’m trying to relax in the evening, which is upsetting. I’m sat there in  a petty dominance dispute with the guy.

Another example from the top of my head, he had a desk fan in the summer. When he wasn’t around I’d turn it to face me and forget to turn it back to the original position. His response wasn’t to say:

“It annoys me when you use my fan and don’t put it back - could you not use it or put it back when you do?”.

His response was to attach it to something with cable ties so that it could no longer be used.

Now I know all of this sounds like “odd couple” stuff and is probably amusing on the surface (it is to me, as I write it). But these things crystallise a behavior that he has displayed his entire life to everyone in his immediate family; none of my other brothers are on speaking terms with him either. If he objects to something, he doesn't say so. He lashes out in some indirectly confrontational way. He never - ever -  apologies for anything.

That was something of a rant, so I’ll try to list off some other behaviors less verbosely. 

* He’s overly ordered. He has a cork board planning out the next five years of his life. His surroundings are squared away in an excessively ordered fashion.
* He has odd exceptions to this (he’ll leave food in places until flies appear).
* He doesn’t have any ongoing friendships to speak of (he had some when younger). Most nights he’ll be sat at home in the bedroom.
* He has a long term girlfriend, but see’s her a little as once a week.
* He was terribly behaved at school.

When we were younger, he’d often have “temper tantrums” and has shown the occasional proclivity to do this into adulthood when things are allowed to escalate that far. These would be full body convulsions; screaming, crying, violent lashing out. Arguments with him descent into violent speech. If asked to stop doing something in a way that isn’t grovelling he response will often be something like:

“What are you going to do about it?”

So I know this isn’t a lot of information, despite the length of the post. But I need an outside perspective. The research I’ve done has lead me to thinking he is perhaps on the autistic spectrum, but there as many things that rule him out as rule him in. I’ve thought perhaps borderline personality disorder, but that’s the same problem.

The truly puzzling thing is that he goes to work, holds down a position of responsibility and by all accounts doesn’t have any of these issues. He has managed to make his relationship last several years. These behaviors only seem to be directed at my brothers and I.

82,"So, my friend recently told me that he has troubles sleeping. It has nothing to do with insomnia - he is terrified of sleep. It disgusts him. As nighttime comes he is more and more anxious - he loathes sleeping and can't see anyone else asleep. Its such a big issue that if anyone falls asleep sooner than him, he gets angry and irritated. It greatly affects him, his sleeping patterns, his relationships with other people... He doesn't want to get professional help of course, but wishes to know what exactly is his problem. Otherwise he doesn't have problem with depression and he is a bit antisocial, but otherwise is quite happy and confident.

84,"A week ago I had one of my depressive moods for around a week and a half. I was thinking that I hated my life and wanted to die. But I never attempted to hurt myself and don’t think I ever will. 

I have been great since Thursday after I went to confession and talked to the Priest about my feelings and confessed to having suicidal thoughts. He gave me some good advice and urged me to talk to someone about my feelings but everything was fine up until today so I didn’t tell my family. He also told me I shouldn’t focus on the things which make me anxious but it’s easier said then done. 

I have been feeling anxious and began to feel unhappy again. I feel like I’ve been looking for a reason to feel depressed. At first I was anxious and depressed because I thought that I offended a coworker now I am because my friend isn’t responding back to me. Earlier it was because I was remembering that with my best friend I was inconsiderate and hung up too early on a phone call to eat dinner and that was making me upset. I was asking myself if I’m a shitty friend or a bad person. 

BUT I’m not having suicidal thoughts this time. I’m just feeling depressed at the moment. 

I go from happy one hour to sad the other because I’m trying to be positive but it’s tough. And it’s like my brain is trying to find a reason that I should be worried. 

I’ve had trauma in my past. I saw my dad almost die in a car accident at the age of 9. I’m 20 now. But I never went to a psychologist and I don’t want to go. Sometimes I want to and then sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I say I will go but the next day I decide I’m being too dramatic and so I don’t. 

I really try to focus on being kind to others but then I do things which are rude or inconsiderate and I feel so ashamed about it. People sometimes think that I consider myself to be this great person because I’m religious but I see all my flaws very clearly. I wish they would stop saying that. But sometimes I wonder if I am vain. But at the same time I have really low self esteem. 

I know I’m human so I can’t be perfect but it’s hard because I feel like I’m just a bad person.

88,"I have a huge existencial ""problem"". I need to hear anything you call tell me [LONG POST]

I know this is super long, but it’s incredibly important for me. I really need to be told anything you can tell me. I don’t expect advice, but simply sharing your thoughts of what you think of this might be incredibly helpful for me. So please give it a chance and read it. Thank you beforehand.

The original length of this post was much longer and far more detailed, but it was just too absurdly long that I trimmed it down quite a bit, going only for the key points. The “problem” I’m going to talk about is something that I now know I have had since I can remember, I just couldn’t rationalize or understand it until I became older. I’m not someone that is too fond of reading psychology, so I don’t know how common this might be. But I’m certain I mustn’t be the only one.

Short background. I’m an 18 year old European guy, not from an incredibly rich family, but yes from a wealthy one. To this day I haven’t been diagnosed of any mental diseases (much to my parents’ distaste), only high IQ when I was 13. An IQ that has been increasing over the years since.

Studying was always easy for me, I have never for my entire life studied more than zero seconds every day, and I have barely studied more than a couple of hours one or max two days before an exam. And I haven’t always gotten stellar grades, but yes always good and great ones. Around 7/10 minimum. Not boasting, I’ve known people much more amazing in that regard. However, even if I got good marks easily, going to class has always been a suffering to a greater or lesser extent. It has always been such a waste of time. Slow, purposeless classes that teach me nothing useful and prepare me for even less. However, even if it hurt going to class, I had always managed to live with it until recently.

Towards the end of highschool, I started suffering so much that I have full notebook pages with the words “Go home” written over and over again. I get really scared everytime I look at it. That’s what I did for weeks every day on nearly every class. The feelings of my time being wasted, of my capabilities being wasted, consumed my very mind and soul. However, I didn’t know this during this time. I simply had an incredibly painful uneasiness, but I never quite accepted that it was because of the school. Of course, I have always been taught to think that I am the problem and that I am the one who is wrong, so when I’m told that going to class is the right thing, how could I have thought of anything else?

I survived highschool and kept on to bachelor, still doing what I was told and thus wanting to study a career for something well paid.

Then things started going downhill. I started understanding my mind, and realized that every single time I was in class I was thinking the following things: “That is wrong”, “That shouldn’t be like that”, “Why do they do that?”, “What’s the purpose of this?”, “You are explaining it wrong”, “Teaching like that does the opposite of what you said you wanted to achieve”. So I started suffering even more, getting both emotionally and mentally obliterated by the mere act of being in class. However, things would start going “downhill” even more when the next questions started appearing on my mind: “Why am I here?”, “Is this my place?”. Which worsened things a lot.

What I just told you about is something that didn’t happen a day, it was a progressive thing through a couple of years, mostly between ages 15 – 17.

Then suddenly, one morning, a month short of becoming 18, as I was walking to class, a feeling I had never felt struck me out of nowhere. I have no words to explain it, but it was as if I could feel my own life within this world and see, feel, that I wasn’t where I was supposed to be. That feeling was literally feeling that I was out of my destined path. I insist, I’m not only an atheist, I have always been laughing at “stupid” things relating “destiny” and that sort of thing. However, I’m not fucking kidding when I said I could hear a shouting of sorts from somewhere telling me to get out of there.

I only needed 2 hours to act this time. I only needed 2 hours to throw nearly 18 years of life. I thought of nothing but that feeling until the first break time came, and I called my mother: “Mom, I’m going back home and not coming back until we decide where should I be headed”. Those were the words.

During the “spiritual pilgrimage” that happened during the following months I understood many things about myself. I managed to differentiate my true self from my “forged by others” self. That “transcendence” of sorts allowed me to start doing activities that I had never before done or enjoyed. I started mountaineering and hiking more than ever, I had the trip of my life my traveling alone to Japan during summer for a whole month amongst many other things. All for the sake of self discovery and joy. Just as I left classes, I started enjoying life more than ever. However, there were also downsides.

I got broader views about the world, and started seeing so many new flaws within nearly everything that now, even if I can finally, for the first time of my life, say that I am a happy person that is happy and even proud of himself, I have a “huge” problem that could end it all. I have officially become unable of doing anything that I don’t want to do or something that is not (or I don’t feel it is) necessary.

I thought I would enjoy getting into art and drawing, and I did. However, as soon as I get to drawing class all the things that I see, things that I don’t want to do or that aren’t useful, as well as the horrible teachings, managing, costs and many other things make me unable to be in there. My own thoughts make me unable of doing anything that doesn’t require my own creativity, or willpower, or emotions. I can’t even see myself working at anything more than 5 minutes every day in the future.

I want to insist, I do enjoy life. There any many things (most of which are recent) that I have discovered that I absolutely love and enjoy doing. I’m not depressed, there are things I want to do. Things I want to live for. But I am unable to do that which this life asks of me to achieve them. I don’t want to pretend I enjoy being told what life is and how I should tackle it. I don’t want to be told what to do for my entire life, especially when I can see for myself the correct course of action, and I see that it’s not that which they’re trying to convince me of. And forcing me to do otherwise destroys me, mentally and emotionally. I’m physically unable to do it.

One last thing. The idea of being free, of living in a world without compromises, where I can have the right to be happy without having to exchange half of my everyday life and most of my mental and physical energies, is something that I wish and dream so much of that has further increased my unavailability of those things. I’m not talking about earning money without doing anything, I’m not talking about being free in this world; because that’s absolutely impossible. I’m talking about how I have seen and dreamt of worlds were things are not like this, and I have been happy in them. I’m talking about having to fight for my own life and dreams, rather than for the permission of someone else to live. Which is what this world is about, and most people seem to not be able to differentiate “effort and sacrifice” from “conformism”. Not being able to differentiate one’s own will from someone else’s.

Even if I were to be wrong in this views of the world, which I would bet my neck I’m not, my beliefs of this topic are stronger by the day and make me even more unable of doing what I’m asked to do.

I’m soon expected to go back to bachelor and finish it, because that’s all I am able to do. If I have any other choice or way of living, I haven’t been able to find it. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but I’m being honest when I say that if I go back to that which I ran from, I will probably end up going to some faraway forest and just be in it until I die of starvation or whatever. And want me to be honest? It doesn’t sound too bad.

Thank you if you read it. Please tell me anything you can tell me, I will very much appreciate it. Thank you.

One last quick comment: I’m not willing to go to any medic nor psychologist anymore. Nobody ””professional”” I’ve ever talked to has ever told me anything beyond a stupid comment that would make me give them more money. And I’m talking from a much more extensive and expensive experience than I wish to admit. No one married to their own books and memorizations can understand me.",26Sep2018,1,
89," **1) uncomfortable emotion:**

another psychological sign of weariness is the existence of painful feelings. for example, you suddenly feel guilty and upset. for no good reason! and you even don’t understand what has happened. or you probably feel irritated because of some trifle. if this happens often you should think of some good rest, at least for a week. right, this way your brain also gives you a sign that it is tired and worn out. just take a break a bit, and you will be happy to see the result! being tired is an ordinary thing for a modern person. the thing is that each of you   should  know when and how it is right to act in such situations.

**2) working schedule break:**

apart from the alarming physiological signs, there is a physiological basis for dropping everything off and spending a week at the beach. if  you feel that you are unwilling to visit the office and try to invent numerous reasons not to go there, you should know that you are not lazy but just tired. you may also notice that you are late for work or try   to  postpone all the important tasks for the evening. alarm you surely need a rest right now.

**3) decrease in sexual activity:**

one of the most frightening symptoms which can ruin your family life as a result. see the neurological state can also produce certain signals! the brain ceases to produce enough chemicals responsible for a sexual drive, so much so that a person might lose any desire to make  love. if  you or your partner experience this kind of problem, remember  that a   good rest can set things straight again.

**4) chest pains:**

chest pains and aches caused by stress often have no connection whatsoever with the heart and are of purely neurological origin. if you frequently  experience piercing pain in your chest, try first to relax. however,  don’t forget that stress may lead to cardiac failure, so be sure to consult your doctor if you suspect heart problems.

**5) fatigue:**

this sign is probably one of the most logical ones. working hard plus “stress” equals fatigue when you’re tired all the time, you sleep worse, and you are always nervous. it may end up in severe fatigue. in shorter words, if you stoop, have a hard time simply getting up

90,"Just to let you know, I'm using an alt account. 

My symptoms are all over the place and I'm just confused. I might have OCD, Bipolar, Avoidant, Borderline, or Histrionic personality disorder.  

1. I feel really sad/upset sometimes for no good reason.
2. I have some issues with my self esteem. I compare myself to others a lot, and feel really bad about small/specific things. Often, I feel like I'm failing at something. 
3. If I want to do something, I usually first try to get someone else to tell/ask me to do it. I fear rejection and/or criticism if I do it without getting approval?
4. I don't feel some emotions, such as guilt or sadness when people talk about sad things. I can feel these, but it takes specific circumstances. It is super easy for me to joke about death or other dark topics. When other people feel sad, I feel numb and blocked and clogged. 
5. I can feel incredibly sad about things, however. Someone going our of their way to make someone else happy but then it actually makes the other person more unhappy? That makes me feel awful. Sad games (like to the moon or whatever) can almost bring me to tears.
6. I feel lots of emotions all the time. I feel like I don't meet my expectations, or something is amazing, or I want to do better. This usually is in a big picture way— what do I want to do with my life, what are my values, who are my friends, what is right/wrong, etc.
7. The best way to explain it might be that I have a high threshold for emotions. I only feel ones that are stronger then a certain bit. 
8. I can be very callous towards others, saying rude/inappropriate things.
9. A lot of me feels like a lie, but not just a lie, like the opposite of who I really am. Because I fear rejection and value other people's opinions of me, I pretend I don't care at all. I really wish I had more intimate relationships, so I pretend I don't.  
10. I am kind of aloof. 
11. I feel like I have two selves. The me at school and outside of school are two totally different people. 
12. At school, I seem incredibly happy and giddy, even hyper. I talk a ton, say silly/random things that make me laugh, and also others. I sometimes am disruptive in class. People often describe me as ""really funny"" or ""the most interesting thing that happens at school."" I also am really smart. 
13. At home, I keep to myself and can be incredibly angry at tiny things. All of my mood inhibitions go away. I have mood swings often. I keep my home life and my school life separate. 
14. I can be really obsessive. When I was in third grade, I would hate it if I got too close to a few certain people. I couldn't touch them, look at them, sit where they had sat, let the air touch me when they walked by. I would wash any part of my body that I thought had touched them. In fifth grade, I started taking a shower after school if I looked at this one kindergartner. I always need to balance my movements and things.  If I remember a moment as being good, I have to replicate it when I do that activity again. 
15. I have had the same close friends since I was very young. I haven't made a ""new friend"" since fourth grade— that is, a friend in which I have personally asked to spend time with me outside of school. 
16. I have, however, met lots of people who I like and could try and pursue a more intimate relationship with. (Not romantically!)
17. I sometimes annoy those around me by being rude and talking too much. 
18. I latch onto verbal phrases and say them all the time. 
19. I struggle with feelings of meaninglessness and existentialism. 
20. My mom has mentioned having struggles with depression, but we never really talk about it. 

This is really a struggle for me. I would like to talk to a therapist, but am too shy to ask my parents about it. My mom and sister also both already have to go to one, and I feel weird asking. Thank you so much!",26Sep2018,12,

She used to work at a mental hospital with those who are recovering from serious mental illnesses, and I’m nearly certain she has an anxiety disorder, which I inherited from her.

Anyway, all that to say, while the OT profession didn’t require a MSc back then, she did have the BSc.

All that to say, I’ve gotten in some pretty nasty arguments with my mom before; and she can be very indecisive.

One minute, she loves my abusive stepdad, the next minute they’re contemplating divorce.

I think I have OCD because I do a lot of ruminating, I fixate on an obsession, I’ve looked for reassurance for hours, and I self-doubt integrity, moral character, etc.

Point is, I’ve never actually told her how much I struggle.

I have low energy, irritability, intrusive thoughts, I think I might have mild depression.

98,"I met a female quite a bit older than me through my home business, and we've been friends for a little less than a year. We QUICKLY became good friends because our backgrounds were the same, we were both abused by our mothers, we both found really good husbands and are child free by choice and we're both chronically ill so much so that we can never leave our homes. We live in entirely different states in the US, so we can never see each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

As such, we help each other get through the week days while our husbands are gone talking on the phone 3-4 hours a day. We help get each other through simple tasks and it's like daily therapy having such a good friend. We're on the same page about other people, we prevent each other from overdoing things and talking to the wrong people ( sometimes other online friends) and she really helps me keep issues with my mom ( who is still unavoidably in my life) to a minimum. At most all times, I would consider her being in my life a blessing. 

&amp;#x200B;

To condense a long story, she's begun to do something that makes me uncomfortable but I would NEVER be able to tell her how; for my birthday a few months ago, she went WAY over the top with gift giving. She sent me so many gifts that I know she spent well over 100 dollars on me just for that. I was beyond thankful and kept saying so, but the day before my birthday things had gone really wrong and I was worried about something and told her that nothing could really cheer me up and she said something like "" well I just spent a lot of money so you could enjoy your birthday, so I hope that changes"". Add to that, she wanted to be on the phone with me when I opened everything, and I just felt like because she spent all that money, she had the control, and I had to act really happy for the sake of her not being upset. It really rubbed me the wrong way and I wanted to say something but didn't. 

  
After my birthday, she didn't act like that again, until now. We each paid half for something she ordered us on ebay we wanted, and she sent it to me, but when she did, she sent ALL SORTS of things. No telling how much money she spent on random gifts that came with it, including prints she ordered of me and my husband that I could have framed. Just any and everything she could have sent, she did. So of course I was profusely thankful again and I joke on her telling her "" you don't have to do this, I can't accept this!"" and she usually ""jokingly"" replies "" ah shut up and just say thank you"". 

Today we were on the phone and I said something about "" I wish Christmas came more often"" because we both love it, and she said "" well I've already given you two Christmases so far"".... and I didn't know what to say so I quickly made another joke to change the subject. 

She's always telling me that she stopped by somewhere to get one of my Christmas gifts and she's been asking today what kind of candy and stuff my husband likes... and I have no doubts Christmas will be the biggest fest of all, where she'll buy me so much more and make me feel so indebted. 

&amp;#x200B;

What on earth could I do about this? Should I honestly talk to her? I know her and she's blown up once and not talked to me for months last year, right before she had some life threatening strokes, so we all put her moods down to that, and she had not acted weirdly for SO LONG until now. If I mention this to her, I feel like she will be extremely offended and maybe not talk to me again. How do I approach this, with such a good friend otherwise?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  A dear close friend I have is normal and we help each other get through every day living with chronic illness showers me with too many gifts and starts acting erratic about the way that I accept them, and there's no way out/ around this without causing her to blow up. I feel like she has a deep-rooted issue about the power that these gifts give. ",26Sep2018,4,

&amp;#x200B;

I started college in August, and I don't really feel like myself.  Here's a list of what I've noticed.

1. I have no desire to do anything.  I usually sit around in my dorm room on reddit or playing league of legends.
2. I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning and going to bed at night (not trouble sleeping, I stay up late doing homework or playing league with my friends).
3. I haven't been eating as many meals I usually skip breakfast for more sleep and I average about 1.5 meals each day. 
4. I have less desire to socialize.  This is a big one.  All of my roommates are in clubs, etc. and often are out of the room hanging out with friends or doing club stuff.  There are things that interest me, but I don't have a lot of desire to pursue them (see 1).  On the weekends, I force myself to go out and have a good time, but outside of that I don't have a huge desire to talk to my friends.  When I am with my friends, I feel like an outsider (I've struggled with this in the past).
5. I don't know how to say this, but time seems to be going by quickly.  After I wake up, before I know it, I will be done with classes for the day.
6. I have not been fulfilling any of my ""goals"" for college.  I wanted to try out many clubs, start exercising, and meet all kinds of people.

None of this is affecting me grades, and I have not skipped class or anything like that.  Sometimes it is hard to start my work/studying, but I am not going to throw away my tuition.  I do feel like myself when I play lol with my friends from back home, but I feel like it is such a huge time sink (and I often stay up late playing).  Most notably, I *do not* feel sad or worthless, but this change in how I live inspired me to make this post.

103,"If you’re starting university this year, please take it from me - someone who’s just wasted two years of their student finance by pretending to be okay when I obvs wasn’t: get help.

I refused to ask for help through the first and second year of my degree, until I had a breakdown and had to take a break from my studies. I’m back this year, so I messaged my lecturers about my diagnosis and guess what: they’re helpful and supportive. They want to help you! Email them, let them know what you’re going through and any additional support you might need. Tell them now - it’s better to get it out of the way whilst you’re in a good frame of mind than when you’re stressed and depressed.

Register with your disability service if you haven’t already, especially if you’ll need adjustments for coursework or exams.

Universities also offer some kind of free counselling/psychiatrist/psychologist services, they may have a limit on the amount of sessions you can have, so if you’re moving to another city - it’s probably best to register with a local mental health team. Most SU’s now offer mental health support too, it’s worth checking what there is at your uni.

DSA is also available, it can take a few months to get - so if you need to apply and haven’t already, apply now. Universities disability services can also help pay for a doctors note, if you need it.

Some students are able to get [free prescriptions](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs/free-nhs-prescriptions)
If you’re not eligible, and are on multiple medications - [NHS](https://apps.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/ppcwebsales/patient.do) offer pre-paid prescriptions that that works out as £10.40 a month (I literally only found this out the other week)

106,"It's a joke. Mustering the effort to finally get myself to a therapist. Monumental milestone. Only to find myself face-to-face with someone repeating nauseatingly tired platitudes. Who refers me to the 'guy that everyone loves' in the office. I get my hopes up, only to see this guy a week later, and he's one of those hippie new age psychologists that very earnestly assumed my suicidal nihilism just needed a little spirituality in the mix to begin my awakening.

What is the point of therapy? Is therapy laughed at by people that aren't content with \~values\~? Is therapy nothing more than trained professionals trying to trick you into thinking positively? I'm so confused. ",26Sep2018,1,
107,"I cannot escape extremely dark, pessimistic and nihilistic feelings. I feel like scoffing whenever anyone brings up optimistic perspectives, or suggests value ethics. I truly feel like there is a gaping wound through the core of my being, and it's hard to determine whether I'm mentally ill, or if I've simply realized the true darkness of reality and refuse to look away.

And then I start ranting to my therapist, or I write a post on here about my disdain for my therapist's simplistic optimism, and I self-reflect and see myself as the exact stereotype that people deride -- the petulant teenage nihilistic emo -- except I'm 26 and supposed to be getting on with my life.

I have no way of knowing which to believe -- a) that my philosophical senses are correct and people with happiness or purpose are deluded, or b) i'm embarrassingly deluded and alone in this underdeveloped mindset that most people have either outgrown or don't even consider.",26Sep2018,8,

Luckily I'm able to identify what's happening and I keep telling myself I need to get my shit together. I think I'm internally freaking out because it's my last year of undergrad and I'm under immense pressure to end my four years with a good GPA all the while applying to grad school and taking the GRE -- so I think my anxiety is getting the best of me and because of my anxiety I am starting to become depressed again. 

What do you guys think I should do? I know I will snap out of it eventually but I need to keep that motivation and morale high until at least the end of semester and then I will have a month to do nothing but chill and work over break. ",26Sep2018,3,
109,"Background: I have anxiety, depression, OCD, and panic disorder. Due to suicidal thoughts and hourly panic attacks, I quit my full time job to ficus on my health. My spouse has been supporting me. It's been two months. I've been in therapy.

Today I had a working interview for a part time job at an animal shelter. I have about a decade of experience volunteering with various animal rescues.

I worked 8 hours. I am exhausted mentally and physically. My feet ache. My back hurts. My asthma is acting up. I was sweating hard all day. They're severely understaffed so I was doing like 5 jobs at once. There's sick and dying and abused animals. There's cats who have been there for years because everyone only wants kittens. There's dogs that won't make eye contact because they're so hurt. 

I am overwhelmed. My heart hurts from feeling so helpless. Because my body and mind were in overdrive, I felt suicidal thoughts creeping in. I fought off a panic attack. My brain is a whirl. I don't know how I made it home. I'm laying in bed naked, weeping and trying not to puke from stress.

They asked when I'd be back. I don't know how I can ever go back.

They desperately need help. 

I feel guilty and ashamed for feeling so overwhelmed. I feel so awful for the poor cats and dogs I met. I want to help but I can't even help myself. I feel so helpless, like there aren't even words to describe how messed up I feel right now. 

Major props to everyone who works in animal rescue. I genuinely don't know how you do it but you save so many lives and I wish I was as strong and brave as you. I want to find a way to help more.

I don't know what to do.",26Sep2018,63,
110,"Maybe my problem is nothing compared to others on this subreddit, but it's really bothering me. I'm a university student, and I find it hard to study or do assignments when I'm sober and awake. I only have the motivation when I've had a bit to drink, or when I'm sleepy (You know the feeling you get when you haven't slept around 24 hours? Kind of like being high). Every day when I wake up, I instantly feel the anxiety hit me, and it's only when before I sleep, I feel somewhat ""normal"". Actually, I also have social anxiety, and when I was younger, I would prefer going to school without sleeping the night before, just so I don't get nervous around my classmates and teachers. 

Because of the anxiety I have, I really don't do anything in my spare time, except procrastinate and churn out thoughts. It's like my mind is always wondering off when I'm more conscious, and I can only focus when I'm less conscious. Also, my academic anxiety only stays during the semester, and during holidays, the social anxiety takes over. 

The social anxiety thing is a whole other thing though, because right now, all I care about is my academic performance. What is wrong with me, and how can I get over it?",26Sep2018,2,

112,Hi. Uni student here. Basically when the year started I was a little rattled and i couldnt really eat food alot because I would feel sick. Well the feeling passed and I was eating a lot every day not throwing up and now I feel it again but this is after I went out public eating with my friend. This is weird.. I think that my body and brain basically got over it and when I went out to eat I threw up and now my body and brain are back to that mental state again. Any advice?,26Sep2018,3,
113,"Hi -

Throwaway account. 

I’m insanely attracted to a woman I work with who’s about 20 years older than me. She barely knows I exist, she has a few kids, is happily married, and - objectively speaking - there’s nothing about her that makes her absolutely gorgeous. She’s just a normal mom in her mid to late 40s. 

However, when I’m around her, my heart races and I start to get an erection. Sometimes, it gets so overwhelming that I have to leave the room and calm down. But I can’t deny that I’m sexually aroused by her and it’s a big problem for me. I would never act on these feelings, but I can’t look at her without getting some kind of arousing feelings. 

I know many people say these types of attractions aren’t unhealthy, but I can’t help but feel that it is. I was sexually abused as a child and have struggled with trauma bonding and codependency in prior relationships - problems I’m getting help on in therapy - but I can’t help but think that this attraction is not only NOT normal, but directly related to traumatic events in my life. 

Any ideas on WHY I might feel this way towards a completely average person? Is it indicative of deeper problems in my life or is it actually something sort of normal?",26Sep2018,5,
114,"So, full disclosure, I went through all of the SNRIs and a number of SSRIs and remained very unwell over 15 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started wondering about the efficacy of antidepressants, and did some investigation. It started by reading [Lost Connections](https://thelostconnections.com/), which I found very thought-provoking. One point of compelling evidence that questions antidepressant efficacy, is Dr Irving Kirsch's work (this guy's research is kind of a big deal in the broad debate), so I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC5RZRG7-QQ&amp;feature=youtu.be), which lays out some really significant questions about Antidepressants VS Placebo

&amp;#x200B;

It made me wonder if Antidepressant effect was largely placebo. Then a new study came out by Cipriani and colleagues, purportedly the biggest and most methodologically robust ever on this subject. For anyone considering changing meds, and who wants to find the 'best' one, [this paper](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext) may be helpful.  

&amp;#x200B;

A cursory reading of Cipriani's et al's paper might give one the impression that Kirsch was incorrect, but when you dig deeper, its much more interesting than that. Two poignant commentaries on the Cipriani study - which was incorrectly (I believe) hailed in the media as the ""last word on antidepressants"" - discuss exactly what the findings mean. 

&amp;#x200B;

[This article](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/26/ssc-journal-club-cipriani-on-antidepressants/)  by Scott Alexander drills down further by making some comparisons between the two authors, and weeding out where they agree, where they disagree, and why. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I came across [this article](https://medium.com/mad-in-america/do-antidepressants-work-a-peoples-review-of-the-evidence-dd5a027369e6) by Robert Whitaker, who writes for Mad in America, which weeds out some of the methodological limitations of the Cipriani paper and discusses why we should take its low-extent positive efficacy findings with a grain of salt. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - mental health consumers who take meds for depression stand to benefit by understanding the science and the extent to which it can objectively state the meds actually work. The evidence - on close examination - is flaky at best. When one takes into account the huge financial interests of big pharma in propogating the idea that they do work, one has to question who's interests the findings are in. ",26Sep2018,0,
