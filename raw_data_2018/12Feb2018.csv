0,"I don’t explain things well but I’ll give it a go. I’ve recently had this feeling like my general feeling has changed (does this make sense?, probably not)

So like my general day to day feeling now feels different to how it used to be. It feels wrong and uncomfortable almost like I’m in a dream or something. My anxiety is through the roof and it’s making me feel sick and shaky. I’m literally tossing and turning at night because the feeling is freaking me out and I can’t shake it. 

I’ve recently had a bad virus/flu thing and my anxiety normally gets a bit higher around any minor illness but nothing like this. I just don’t feel right and have no idea how to change it.  What is wrong with me and how do I stop it? ",12Feb2018,3,
1,Never met a therapist or psychiatrist/psycholgist before. Just wondering what the first initial contact is like.,12Feb2018,2,
2,"Through my journey of getting help for my mental health condition (Bipolar Disorder), I have been hospitalized in a psychiatric unit six times.  Each time was a different experience, and not all of them were great.  However, all of them were absolutely necessary to help me overcome self-harm ideation and ensure my safety.

When I try to describe my stays to others, they often have stereotypes about psychiatric hospitalization, which have been reinforced in gory detail in movies like A Clockwork Orange, One Flew Over the Cookoo’s Nest, and Girl, Interrupted.  They ask questions about my stay, supposing those stereotypes to be true:

“I thought you were going to be locked away forever.  How did you get out?”

“How crazy were the other patients?  Did you see them in straight jackets?”

“Did they do any shock treatments on you?”

“Were the facilities in pretty bad shape?”

“Did anyone escape?”

While the asylum era of hospitalization has been left far in the past, the stigma still lives on.  I wanted to share my experiences to help de-stigmatize psychiatric hospitals.

With the stigma of being locked away forever, I can say unequivocally patients are no longer held for longer than absolutely necessary.  The overwhelming majority of patients stayed less than one week.  My longest stay so far has been 10 days, and my average length of stay has been 5 days.  The largest factor in determining length of stay were the insurance companies and Medicaid/Medicare, who do not want to pay for any treatment beyond what is medically necessary, and who constantly antagonize doctors and hospitals for charging too much money.  Many people still have the stigma that psychiatric hospitalization is done in “asylums” and is akin to a tortuous prison sentence, which is no longer the case.

With the stigma of other patients, most people were surprised to find out that at least half of my fellow patients were actually in the hospital for drug overdose detox, compared to mental health crisis.  In order to detox from opiates and alcohol safely, patients needed to be administered psychiatric medications for controlled withdrawal.  As for other patients in mental health crisis like myself, most were there for depression-related symptoms.  We would often keep each other company in the common room, having conversations while playing cards, watching TV, or working on coloring mandalas.

Were there some patients experiencing severe psychosis?  Yes, although there were very few.  Usually only one patient had this condition in a unit of 12-16 people.  Were some patients restrained using physical or medical methods?  Yes, that did happen occasionally.  However, these restraints were not used haphazardly.  They were only used if a patient was a threat to themselves or others, by making death threats against the staff, or trying to break property which could have resulted in bodily harm to the patient.  All restraints had to be prescribed by a doctor, and recorded in an administration record.  Techs and nurses (“orderlies”) could not order restraints.  There were no straight jackets or “rubber rooms.”  There were isolation rooms with strapped beds instead, which were only used until a patient proved to no longer be a threat.

With the stigma of methods of treatment, most of the hospitals I went to had absolutely no method of performing shock treatment, or electroconvulsion therapy (ECT).  For the one hospital that did administer ECT, they only did so under anesthesia, and only to patients who had medicine-resistant illnesses.  I only met one patient at one hospital who was receiving ECT, and it was because her illness was resistant for several years and through many rounds of treatment.  ECT was never administered to any patient otherwise, and never administered as punishment or sedation.  ECT is being phased out in favor of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, or TMS.  TMS is a non-invasive procedure that can be done without pain, without anesthesia and is performed in an outpatient clinic instead of a hospital.

My treatment plan for bipolar disorder usually featured antidepressant drugs like Effexor and Wellbutrin, and anti-mania drugs like lithium and Seroquel.  I was given these medications in a supervised environment to ensure there were no negative side effects after several doses.  I was never given any sedatives, medical restraints, or shock therapy to control my behavior.  Despite being in an inpatient hospital, the overwhelming majority of patients had a docile and cooperative personality.  Nobody was in fear of receiving punishment or bodily harm within the hospital.

With the stigma of conditions of the hospitals, the conditions of modern psychiatric hospitals were much like any other medical hospital.  I’ve been to stand-alone psychiatric hospitals which were built into older hospitals no longer used, and I have been to psychiatric units built within brand-new hospitals.  The facilities are modern and clean.  The food is on-par with school cafeteria food; not great, but not bad.  One hospital even let me choose my meal every day, so I picked the best-tasting items on the menu for just about every meal:  hamburgers and chicken strips.  

There was one hospital stay in which the hospital run by the state was built in 1854, and is still unfortunately still in use today.  I do not hesitate to say the conditions were decrepit there.  However, that hospital is very much an exception instead of the rule, as other states have realized nobody should be medically treated in such squalid conditions.

With the stigma of escape, absolutely no one escaped.  The common stereotype involves hearing the words, “we’ve got a runner.”  However, nobody tried to escape, or said anything about a plan to escape.  Each psychiatric unit is secured with a badge RFID lock for the doors, and further secured by a sally port of two sets of doors, which couldn’t both be open at the same time.  One hospital had doors which could only be unlocked for badge RFID scan from the locked nurse’s station, requiring two-factor authentication.  Beyond the unit’s doors were several more layers of security, including more locked doors, locked elevators, security cameras, security staff, and many other staff.  None of the staff had any deadly weapons which could theoretically be taken by patients to aid escape.  Patients were not given any sharp objects either.  The coloring materials were always crayons and markers instead of pencils, and journal-writing could only be done with a flexible “jail pen.”  Eating utensils were collected by staff at the end of each meal.  Escape had such infinitesimal chance of success that nobody even thought about attempting it.

If you or a loved one are experiencing thoughts of hurting yourself or others, please do not hesitate to go to the nearest hospital emergency room for psychiatric hospitalization.  You can also call a crisis line like 911 (yes, you can call 911 for life-threatening situations including suicide), or call the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-8255, or text CONNECT to 741741.  Tell the crisis line that you need help getting to the hospital immediately, and they will respond with an ambulance or police officer to get you there safely.

I hope my story has helped to shed some stigma away from psychiatric hospitalization.  Please do not be afraid to go to the hospital if you feel it is necessary.  They will not lock you away, sedate you, give you shock treatment.  They will give you the medically necessary-medical treatment you need, for the medically-necessary amount of time you need it, then send you home for outpatient care.  Hospitals are there to help people get better, not punish them like prisons.  The days of abusive asylums are gone.",12Feb2018,21,
3,"Hi, this may be patchy and long (also formatting issues as I’m on mobile).

My mum was diagnosed with secondary terminal brain cancer last year (New Years day 2017). She had scans last wasted which showed signs of improvement however recent scans (January 2018) shows that it’s got much worse. She’s able to have more radiotherapy to try and help.

She is also mentally ill, and regularly upsets me - she believes in things like lizard overlords and CIA trying to kill her and MK Ultra mind control happening to her and such - she’s been sectioned twice before. She will scream at me and abuse me if I disagree that it’s happening to her and suggest taking medication (which she hates because she says it takes her powers away). She was unintentionally abusive when I was younger - she once convinced me I needed sectioning over my anxiety and depression then wouldn’t let me phone a doctor, I tried to be seen by CAMHS but she came to the initial meeting and sabotaged it (would disagree about my feelings and things happening)and they thought I was making it up so I wasn’t allowed to go to counselling through them.

I know that I’m being selfish in saying that I’m struggling, I know she has it worse; but I’m struggling. I have major anxiety and depression issues; coupled with paranoia. I was sexually abused as a child and am now struggling with the fact that the guy was never sent down and he could have done it to others because of me, my dad (47,m) is a violent drunk and me and my sisters witnessed this towards my mum when we were kids and now I’m struggling with this. I’m in my third year of uni, working two jobs and struggling with all of it. I don’t know what to do; I have no motivation for anything, medication isn’t helping, i want to cry all of the time, I don’t want to do anything, I’m sabotaging my relationship (21,m) constantly (being paranoid, moody, distant, overbearing, have problems with him binge drinking frequently) and I don’t know what to do anymore.

I’m terrified of her dying, I’m scared of losing my relationship, I’m scared of how bad I’m feeling, I don’t want to work or do uni.

TLDR: my mum has cancer, I’m anxious and depressed after issues during my childhood. I’m struggling and want to give up.",12Feb2018,3,

6,"I’m a 20 yr old female living in the the US, I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety my whole life and I’ve grown used to dealing with those issues, and in spite of that I’ve always been able to look at the good in life and in people, but lately it feels like everything around me is crumbling. I find myself getting irrationally angry at my boyfriend for something minor he’ll say when all he’s done is nothing but help me. I get anxious incredibly easily, especially when it comes to my relationship, and I’m always paranoid he’s cheating on me when we have a healthy relationship, he’s shown no signs of straying even when given the opportunity (that’s a whole other story) I love him with all of my heart and I trust him (I’m a trusting person in general) but i feel like my anxiety is going to be the thing that ruins my relationship. Even with no proof my head is telling me I’m not worth his time and that he’s spending his free time with someone better, and that he secretly loathes me because I’m annoying and too emotional. He always reassured me but in the end I still feel it eating away at my confidence. If he doesn’t want to have sex then I always feel like I did something wrong and that it’s because I gained 2 pounds or he’s suddenly realized how ugly I am when he reassured me it’s because he’s exhausted. I’m sorry about the wall of text I just don’t know where else to turn because he’s pretty much my only other source of venting and i don’t want to upset him. ",12Feb2018,7,

10,"Background: I am a 22 year old female lesbian college senior. I am an education major (English and French) and I love what I do. I work as an RA I love living with coworkers who are like my best friends now. I have a really supportive, amazing family who I am extremely close to. I don't have a significant other but I have mostly gotten over an ex, and I have been dating a little which is nice. You'd think I'd be really happy all the time but sometimes I'm not.

Sadly, I have struggled with procrastination since high school. I was pretty sad during those times but I was dealing with accepting my sexuality and also with a longtime crush on a friend. In college, I found out that I have ADD, which I thought might explain the extreme procrastination and not-really-getting-my-stuff-done-until-middle-of-the-night-before-it's-due. But let it be known that I'm actually a great student... I just wait forever to do it. I also procrastinate things I want to do. Call friends. Text parents. Read for pleasure. Watch French movies. Workout. I'll just watch stupid buzzfeed videos or The Office reruns, or sit in the RA office talking to people about something we've already talked about before. I don't like doing these things, really. I just do them. I figure ADD could explain some, I don't have a lot of impulse control. But also, like... I should be able to get myself to get off my ass and do something that I know I WANT to do, right? Not sabotage myself, like I do everytime? This definitely impacted by last relationship, it impacts my sleep and workout habits (therefore, kinda, my health), and a little bit impacts my educational success. It's so frustrating. I've been trying to fix myself and my habits that make my life stressful and unhappy but it hasn't worked all four years of college yet. I'm sick of it.

I wouldn't categorize my life as unhappy. But I DO things, my dumb, non-self-controlled actions, that make it unhappy sometimes. My family also has a long history of mental illness. My dad and sister deal with depression. I would categorize theirs as much more detrimental to their lives than mine, like they both got to points where they were all around extremely unhappy. I'm not. But I can't find ways to live the kind of life I want to! I don't want to say that I'm depressed because I feel sometimes like I'm not. I'm much happier generally than they are. But happy people don't make choices like I do (like write this fucking text to reddit at 12:37 on a Sunday night when I have a French assignment due tomorrow at 11 and a lesson plan due ASAP that I already got an extension on). 

I already take ADD medicine but it doesn't work well and I can't take more because too much gives me a lot of anxiety, takes away my appetite, as well as makes me feel like kind of a robot. 

Do you guys think I sound, like actually depressed? Or fine but I need to work some shit through? I tried to talk to a therapist but I didn't really have much to say to her after a few months. Should I try taking meds? My fellow English major friend who used to be like me, late on stuff and kinda apathetic and not often reading anymore, seemed so happy recently. He does the readings and reads for fun. He seems happy and jokey and better than I've ever known him. He went on meds and all I can think is wow, I want to be happy like that. Some days I'm like, I'm fine. And others I feel like I'm spiraling. Give me your thoughts, even though I know that only mine can really tell me what's up.",12Feb2018,2,
11,"Do you ever just sit and wonder what you’d be like if your situation was different? 

Because I do. A lot. 

I was born with a genetic condition that affected the way the bones in my face developed which really fucking sucks for my self-esteem.

I’ve been depressed since I was around 13 and I was never able to get help. I’m attempting at seeking help, very slowly as I would have to go behind my parents backs. Though, most days I feel like I don’t want help. Sometimes I just want to suffer because in some fucked up way, I’m kind of waiting for myself to snap and just put an end to myself. That story is for another time.

Anyways, on top of lovely depressing and suicidal thoughts.. I am also an extremely introverted person because my social anxiety is through the roof. I hate (*let me repeat myself I **hate** having to talk to other human beings*) talking to people because I always sound so fucking stupid and I’ll be left thinking about the interaction all day while simultaneously thinking about the death I deserve for being so awkward. I am truly a mess. 

So, y’all know depression and anxiety are shit partners together so I’m sure it’s not that hard to understand what a lonely, boring, pathetic piece of shit I am. 

In order to escape my shitty life I usually daydream, like way more than acceptable I think. Sometimes I daydream about how if I was born with normal facial features then maybe things would be different. But it’s not a thing where I feel like I would be a better person? I know *most* people daydream about how a little change in their life could really benefit them. 

Yet I’m the opposite, usually I find myself wishing I was born with at least a nice face for the simple purpose of being able to act out self-destructive tendencies; sleeping around, going out to clubs by myself, getting too drunk, doing drugs, etc. I really believe that in another life if I was born normal then I would probably be drowning in booze, drugs and sex instead of just drowning in my tears in my bed every single day. And honestly, I think I prefer the idea of the daydream life more. 

Is that fucked up that I *wish* I was self-destructive and reckless? ",12Feb2018,22,

I am very picky about my therapists, there has only ever been one therapist that I felt at least somewhat comfortable with, everyone else has just pissed me off. So I'm afraid I'll get a therapist that pissed me off. I'm also scared of starting meds cause there are always such shitty side effects,  it's the cons ALWAYS outweigh the pros.

I don't actually get much work, if any, done when I do go in because I end up being so easily distracted by the noise and surroundings.

And I had no clue what to do or say at all. She went on later that night to take too much diazepam (she is fine, she messaged me earlier and I’m seeing her in a couple of hours). I thought I had helped calm her down at least partially but it’s dawning on me just how clueless and unprepared to deal with this sort of thing I am. I love her, and I don’t want to lose her, and I wish she could see the amazing person that I see, and I’m freaking out a lot right now. I don’t know how to support another person, let alone someone with recurring suicidal feelings.

Hello,


For the last four years i have been very depressesd. I always put on a brave face and try to hide it until i eventually came out to a friend which shooked her a lot. She recommened that i seek help 


Sometimes i wonder if i have reached my purpose in my life and wonder if my parents lives and anyone elses life will be better without me. 


I do believie if i wasn't scared of dying i would have taken my life about now 


Guess i should explain why i feel this way and it make me summed up as been a failure and left behind. No matter how i try it never seems enough.


It's almost like been locked in a room and the walls are closing in 


Some more reasons 


1. Failed my second year of uni and lost all my friends. Tried to talking to them but got told to go away

2. During my work placement i was subjected to aunfair n discplinary 

3. In my final year and i hate what i do. I have no friends and found my exama very hard

4. Friends outside uni are starting to shun me out

5. Any dates i have end up running off. One time a girl ran off with her ex and left me 


Sometimes i wonder if their is a future for me",12Feb2018,5,

I'm scared. I am only 21 and i feel as though my life is ruined, like I am no longer in control. My depression and fear consumed me to the point where I forgot what optimism is like, where I feel like I forgot what happiness was. I feel like I forgot who I am. I am terrified of this path  that I feel like I am being forced down upon, a path where my fear of death may no longer keep me from killing myself.

24,"Be warned this is a long read but I really need some advice.

I’m new to this whole reddit thing but I’ll do the best I can do here. 

I was born in 95’ in June, throughout school I was bullied extensively and my mom moved around a lot after my dad left. So I didn’t really have any friends. I stuck to my games. 
My sister and only sibling was born when I was six years old and that sort of eased the loneliness later in life. 
As a child I comfort ate a lot and I feel like that’s why I stayed overweight for such a long time.

I moved to a behavioural needs school in 2009 and that’s finally where I stayed, that is where I met my best and only friend. 

In 2010 I picked up an acoustic guitar and haven’t stopped playing since, this tends to be my solace when I’m really low. I just write songs.

Since I finished school (2011) at the age of 16, things have been volatile, up and down like a crypto coin market. 
I went through several jobs, had received job seeking benefits, had lots and lots of female encounters, and relationships that just didn’t work. 

I tried college, twice in fact. And didn’t enjoy it, 
About the only think that was good was I started losing weight, becoming better looking and healthier. 

I lost a baby with a girl in 2015 and this drive me to rely on alcohol everyday.  It’s been a difficult recovery but I got there.

After years of these things cycling round, at 20 years old one of my ex girlfriends got me into a university. I was going to study on a music production course, I was so excited, I felt like finally I had a pathway into doing something I love and making lots of friends

And in mid September 2017 I did, and for the first few months it was amazing. I was living with 7 guys who were great and we all loved hanging around with each other.
But then I realised the course wasn’t right, I never even picked up a guitar to use on the course I just used computers to make music that I didn’t even like.

The friends I thought I had started talking about me behind my back. And I became physically ill and bedridden throwing up for several weeks.

I then met this girl who lived on a different city, I properly fell for her she was beautiful, funny, and we had so much in common, we were never bored and were always up and go to do things. It was a much bigger city, 3rd biggest in the country. It had a vibrant music and one of her friends was at a music university around there and said it’s absolutely amazing, she said it’d be perfect for me and I’d do so well there.

I looked it up and she was right it did seem perfect. So I applied and got in with flying colours, this was in February time but the course didn’t start until September, but that was okay it gave me plenty of time to prepare, I was also going to be closer to my girlfriend, which was another bonus! 

A few months later and I had a call from my girlfriend when I was at home, she didn’t want me anymore, said it was her and not me, this literally broke me. 

I got into the new university and knew nobody in this big city? I’d already left my old course!? I built up so much anxiety, but I decided to go for it as it was all I had.

Once September came around I started and made a couple of distant friends, not really much. The people I lived with I never saw, they made the place a right mess all the time and left me to clean it up. 

The course was okay but it was very group based and I had no friends? The only friend I had I moved away from.
I got into the wrong crowd and started missing a lot of university and doing a lot of hard drugs.

I thought I had friends but they didn’t really care about me and I realised that.

I met this other girl, she got me out of all these habits and is currently helping me move, she’s been really supportive of me and I’ve been supportive with her mental health too. 

But I just don’t see it lasting, both university and this relationship.

I know she feels a lot for me and I feel a lot for her, but nobody else would ever stay with me and support me why should she have to? 

I’m doing terribly at university and have so much time off because everyone talks about me and abuses me and I have no friends to fall back on. 
I got a job interview at this go karting place and it went really well, I had my induction the next day and it too went so well, I loved the place and I was good at it, they even asked me to stay behind extra time and I was there for another 5 hours helping them and doing the job.

They got back to me a week later and told me I didn’t have the job. 

I’m set to move in to a house this week and after a difficult stretch with the shit letting agency it’s with we sorted a room for me and my girlfriends helping me move in.

But none of this feels right.

I’m away from home, I’m away from the only friends I have.
I’m financially struggling so much. I’ve tried to kill myself several times.

I have a job interview this week, a new house to move into and a girlfriend that loves me.

But I’ve had all of this before, so many times and it never works, and all people tell me is that it will one day. And it never does. And now you know my story you see that too.

So I ask, what is the point Reddit?

26,"Hi guys. Just a bit of background for you. I am 21 years old. I suffered from anorexia between the ages of 14-18, and I now consider myself recovered. However , it's become clear that by starving myself I had been numbing feelings of anxiety, depression and loneliness. I am at university and have a good group of friends yet I still often find myself flitting between happiness, intense sadness and total numbness that leaves me unmotivated to do anything. I frequently have intrusive thoughts about self harm (eg: cutting, burning, head banging) although I've never gone through with it. 

I also have a tendency to form attachments to people very quickly and intensely to the point where the fear of rejection/abandonment heightens the numbness and thoughts of 'whats the point of eating well/working out/wearing makeup if I will never have anybody to do it for?

Again I apologize for the long ass  and probably largely incoherent post! I would consider myself stable, and these feelings are not constant. If it helps, I was diagnosed with Asperger's at 16, but I have reason to doubt this diagnosis. For example, I never exhibited any symptoms until I was 13-14, up until then I was socially 'normal' but I think with bullying I kind of retreated within myself.

I use to try really hard to accomplish things in life but always ended up in failure could not even find a job no matter how hard i tried did not matter how many places I applied and this has inflicted on my positive attitude towards succeeding in life and I just feel so depressed that I am numb and do much in life because of my depression from all this and just do not have a lot of confidence to to take a chance on even trying knowing that the world is against me and does not want me to succeed at all even though I have tried my hardest and because of this I  just want to die and escape my misery and just be at peace which I have yet to find in my life to be happy and have a purpose. All of these issues are not helpful to my mental health and make it super hard since I have BPD, social anxiety, anxiety, depression which has gotten in my way my hole life and makes it harder to function as a normal person and have a normal life because these are holding me back. I feel so lost and hopeless that my life will go anywhere and that ill die alone and not have a chance to enjoy life to the fullest and just want to end myself due to all this because I can not cope nor do I know how to deal with these mental issues. People do not understand what it is like with all these mental issues and how much harder it is to do stuff like a normal person. ",12Feb2018,1,

34,"I have an issue that has affected my life for a long time now. I'm 19 years old and I always feel stuck. It's especially prevalent when it comes down to learning something. I get extremely excited, and built up to learn something new, like programming, a language, even something like DMing a DND game. It is a very large issue in my life. I've read up on it a lot. I see a lot of people with a similar issue and, ironically, I believe it's with similar things, like learning programming, or a language. I don't know if it has to do with how tough the activity is, and how I don't want to go through with the process of learning it or what. Through elementary school, and middle school, I was always top of class because I didn't need to study. When high school hit, it changed a lot. I started getting extremely low marks and was at the bottom of my class. It's around this time when I started language learning and programming. I never got anywhere with either 7 years down the road. I'm not sticking to any daily habits, which also might be the issue. I really want to solve this issue because, it's causing un-needed depression in both my life, and my girlfriends. It might just be me, and changing my habits but, I would love to hear your ideas on how to fix this issue.

TL:DR: I have not been able to stick to anything since around the time of high school and it's got to a point where I start something, and a day later, I am no longer interested but go back to it in the future.

EDIT: On top of this, it's not only for learning things. It's for things like gaming even. Fun things that I enjoy. It doesn't need to be hard. I have a ton of books and games I've never played or read. I'm always restarting games and books. It's constant. I just got through a book recently though.

All my friends are internet friends and I am generally very obsessive person. I'm obsessed with computer games, cosmetics, stalking other people, etc.


About that stalking part, I just can't help it. I stalk innocent people to entertain my boring life, and I enjoy making them sick of me. This one person I stalk is, so stupid. She's being watched by many people including me and I loooooooove picking on her. I wonder when she's gonna kill herself. But I hope not. Because, who should I pick on since my beloved spider is already dead?


I can't go outside without heavy makeup because my plastic surgery totally fucked up my face. And that's making my skin worse. My skin looks like shit - so I have to put on more makeup to cover my gross skin which makes my skin worse, and it's endless vicious cycle.


So I tend to be a strong advocate of anything fucked up thing - stalking is just another example. I am very weak so I couldn't make or achieve anything meaningful. But maybe this time after I go to jail because my stalking victim already reported me, maybe I can become famous or at least notorious?


I already went to mental hospital several times but maybe this time I should go to mental hospital inside jail. What would they do to me? Would they make me undergo unwanted lobotomy or something? I'm generally worried about it.",12Feb2018,0,

44,"I know there are people out there with way shittier childhood that turned out just fine, but I feel like I just blame my mother for who I turned out to be, the mistakes I've made, and the mistakes I continue to make.

I spent a good part of my life blocking out my childhood and hiding from it. I'm starting to think maybe by not confronting it is causing me to continually making poor decisions.

I don't have many good memories from when I was little. My parents divorced when I was little and although I was told they always fought, I had no recollection of it other than vaguely of the last fight that ended their marriage. I only recall one truly ""happy"" memory in my entire childhood when my parents were still together.

Growing up, I've never really had any ""talks"" or those life lesson conversations that I can remember. I barely saw my father, not by his choice, but my mother's and through her, our deluded choice. He asked my sister and I if that was what we really wanted and we said yes.

My mother believed in good grades. I didn't particularly do well in school. And had poor English skills. There was a company that gave students at our schools basically a brochure of books and learning games. I was excited about some of the things in there. She found flash cards of math and English and I got those instead. They were ok to flip through. Then she began to keep me up at night to ""study"". I would get quizzed every night. I would be passing out and get yelled at for being tired. If I've already gone to bed, she'd wake me up for this. I've quickly learned to hate that fucking company for brining that shit to my school. She knew when we'd get the brochures every year and ask for it and with her, you can't say no.

My dad would buy me toys once in a while. Come to think of it, I don't think he was spoiling us at all. The only good memories was pretty much spent with him. I've also gotten toys from extended family members. I even convinced my grandmother once to buy me a toy car. My mother made her return it. My mother hid my toys and I wasn't allowed to play with them because I wasn't brining home good grades. She threw one across the room once and smashed it to pieces because I didn't deserve it. She thought that all I did was waste my time with toys and games. I began stealing toys. When she caught me, I lied and said I found them. I eventually got caught at a corner store during lunch in elementary school and the owner scared the shit out of me. She said she'd let it go if I paid and promised not to do it again. I don't remember if my mother found out, but I think I stopped shoplifting after that.

My mother thought my father was a money waster and that he should've been paying more child support. She thought he was a cheapskate because he stopped paying for my sister when she was 18. My mother barely worked her entire life. We lived with my grandparents, so she spent her life ""saving"" money instead of working for it. Whenever she quit, she claimed her co-workers were toxic and when she couldn't find a job, she said nobody wanted to hire someone with no skills or education.

My sister and I used to listen to everything she said. I'd hate certain extended family members because she had something against them. My sister and I used to have big fights. My mother told us we shouldn't fight with family. When we started chatting and became closer, my mother would accuse us of conspiring against her.

When I began to rebel, I was labeled a bad kid and she told people about how I no longer listened. When we were ""bad"", she would make us kneel or stand for hours. She would yell at us and stare at us in silence sometimes for at least half hour. When we were ""really bad"", she would whip us with metal wire coat hangers. A few times, it was hard enough that we bled. When a coat hanger wasn't available, sometimes because she bent them all on us and threw them out, she'd slap us. At first it was on the palms of our hands as hard as she could. Eventually, she'd move on to slapping us across the face. She would hit my ear so hard it would ring. To this day, I would randomly have a ring in my ear sometimes and I think it was because of her. She physically pinned my sister to the ground once because she didn't like the idea of her thinking about dating. Guy friends were pretty much forbidden. I've been pulled out of the shower before and made to kneel in the dark dripping wet with no clothes, put in the garage and locked there in the dark, and who knows what else I cant remember.

Those things mostly happened after the divorce, but I distinctly remember my dad asking my sister and I which of our parents we wanted to live with. Both of us chose my mother. I can't say for both of us, but I chose my mother because I was fucking scared that she would beat us for choosing him. If it wasn't for that, I'd gone with my dad. He knew she used to beat us, but we told him she stopped. We lied and defended her in front of him and he dropped it.

As I grew older, I had enough. I began to challenge her and eventually threatened to go to the police. She counter-threatened that foster parents cared even less, but she did stop abusing us... physically. She still played mental games with us and made us feel like shit. That's all I can remember about that part. Maybe it's because I've brought up so much I'm on overload.

Did I say she illegally kept us away from my dad? He was awarded weekend visits and there was a period of time she wouldn't let us see him because they had a fight after their divorce. We did eventually see him again. He passed away when I was finishing high school. Either I was dreaming, but she came into my room one night while I was sleeping and said I cursed him and caused him to die.

We never tell her anything because she would turn it against us. She wonders why we don't chat with her. She doesn't understand why her kids hate her. She believes she did the best she could to raise her kids. We still see her sometimes. I'm not afraid of her, but I get triggered by her easily and we end up yelling. My sister needed counseling years later for her anxiety of her own mother.

I don't know what I need. I never liked talking about this with anyone and only my wife knows everything. As an adult, I have 0 friends. How I managed to get married is beyond me and she is my everything.

I've made many bad choices in life and I don't know if I can blame my mother for my actions. I feel like I'm neglecting my responsibility if I believe it was her fault. So many things I wish I can take back, but I can't. It would be easy to blame my mother. I wish my dad and my mother could've traded places.",12Feb2018,1,

46,"I’ve been recently empowering myself (30 F) in my relationship of 3+ year with my BF (32M).

I’ve been on Reddit lately seeking help with my relationship. First it started with sharing about his selfish low input support. And then transitioning to my BF testing the waters on me for a future open relationship once we are married.

Luckily thanks to my therapist, friends and yes, Reddit - I’m realizing how important i am and how my needs must also be met in our relationship.  Therefore I’m trying to be more assertive.

It’s started by confronting him on his lack of support. And how dismissive he has been to me in the past. I told him that I’ll call him out on it. And I’d expect the same of him if he noticed I was not being a full partner to him. He agreed and has been showing improvement by telling me what he can/can’t handle.

I’m realizing I’m now always finding moments that annoy me about how he talks or treats me. Before I just let it go since I don’t like being a bother or telling people how to be their own person.  Usually he’s easy to have conversations, loves to travel, isn’t afraid to cook. But like idk - I’m just on edge about being on top of his treatment of me.  And avoiding harder subjects which are the main thing which make me happy in a relationship.

But this assertive side of me also feels like an asshole. Like I don’t want to crush his spirit. But he also grew up incredibly self focused. Like he just doesn’t see what he says or does as a problem because society or his work environment congratulates him on being selfish and focused on his desires.

Idk - it’s the stupid stuff where I’ll ask him to go to a band I like, or come work out or try something new with me. But he’s like oh I don’t do that - even if he’s never done it. I get so annoyed as I’m like - hey this is important to me and I’d like to share it with you. But he just gets very defensive and cuts me off. I’m always there to support him if he asks me to work networking things or host parties of people I don’t know... I cope and it’s fine - but I do it cos he needs he support.

TL:DR - help - i’m Becoming more assertive in my 3+ year relationship. But I receive unwanted treatment back which makes me feel like an asshole.  So I don’t know how to balance being assertive with being a doormat to my needs.  Like how can I balance being myself/assertive but also not feel like I have to police my BF? Or why do I feel shitty when he reacts to me being assertive?",12Feb2018,4,
47,"Hello all. Thank you for reading. My mother is 54 years old. For the past 8,9 years she goes through certain episodes where I believe she hears voices but won’t actually tell me if she really does. One example of why I think she may hear voices is because I told her “mom don’t listen to the voices if you Are hearing any, they are not real.” And her response is, “no they are not real.” I can tell she’s about to go through these episodes whenever she starts randomly saying she believes in god. Earlier this week she called the cops on my dad for no apparent reason. Whenever I look at her in her eyes, I can tell her pupils are very shrunken. She will laugh at noncomical situations. My mother knows I’m not a very emotional or lovey type person. I don’t go around hugging people but the love is there. Well when she goes through an episode, she gives me a hug and kisses me on the cheek and tells me she loves me. I know that sounds weird but I’m not one to be touchy feely and she knows that when she’s normal. One of the time (similar situation happened before) ls in the past, she jumped in her car and took off and no one knew where she was. Long story short, we get a call from campus police at a college about 40 mins away where she just parked her car and just wonder around campus. I think when she goes through these episodes she doesn’t sleep. This mornings when she was making breakfast, she was humming....my mom doesn’t just do that when she is mentally stable. Like I stated above, she gets really, really, religious whenever she is having an Episode. I believe something triggers her to go down this road. Usually drastic/stressful situations. Just recently, her parents in El Salvador need money for medicines and it’s putting pressure on her. She’s seen doctors before but they just gave her anti anxiety medicine. I’m here to seek help. Idk what to do. I live in Houston and we are not wealthy people. I want my mom to get the correct help instead of just doping her up on whatever medication is available...or at least get her the correct treatment and medication. Where should I first start off? What doctor should I see? Is there anyone that I can take her to that won’t be so expensive? Please help. Idk what to do. If there is anymore info that I need to explain, I am here.

She seems to think it's a personality trait that she was born with since she's been a worrier ever since she was little, but I wonder if she had a traumatizing event at an early age and does not remember? She fits many signs and symptoms of having PTSD. She startles very easily and it usually leads to an episode of crying. She regularly has nightmares of loved ones dying and wakes up screaming and/or crying. She says that she has had intense fear of her parents dying ever since she was little. She avoids car rides for fear of death/injury. She has flashbacks, but only to her miscarriage of our first child. She says she just has an anxious personality. Is that a thing? I've always bought that until just recently when I was reading about someone who has PTSD and the similarities made me wonder if that is actually what she has.

I think this started with the beginning of the year. I found out that my dog, Shirley, who just turned 10, has an inoperable tumor on her heart or spleen. And this is the dog that got me through middle school when I had no friends whatsoever, and I was just discovering who I am. And I reacted accordingly. I spent the rest of my winter break just watching tv with her on the couch, and then pausing to cry.  

Going back to school helped, and I thought I was doing ok. The only thing that was different was that I kept on diverting attention by saying I don’t want to talk about it because it makes me sad. But now about a month into it, I just feel like everything is the same. I’m not in any classes with my friend, so I just go through the day keeping relatively quiet. I find stuff that I used to love doing boring. I don’t think I really had any contact with people outside of my family because my best friend was on a cruise and I couldn’t contact him. So I guess my question is, should I be concerned? I mean, my friend is back now, so I’m hoping everything will be the same, but I don’t know.",12Feb2018,2,

65,"I am stupid - growing up I was your typical gifted and talented student who was actually just average and so grew up not knowing how to ask for help etc. I scraped through all academic achievements of my life and am only a medical student by circumstance (I got in with the help of a program that lowered entry requirements based on household income and if your parents were in a professional job or not). I scrape by my medical exams and honestly don't think I would make a good doctor, heck I'm just expecting to fail my exams sooner or later I mean, how long can you scrape by everything? All my peers excelled or at least don't scrape by.

I'm ugly - I turned 20 a few weeks back and have never had a single romantic event occur to me in my whole life. No one telling me they had a crush on me, nothing from a kiss to holding hands. I don't think I even know what a compliment is because I've never recieved one and it sounds like a foreign concept - someone looks at you and thinks you're pretty???? Sounds fake. You're laugh is music to their ears and not the most obnoxious thing in the world? A fairytale. (compliments from friends and families never count let's be honest here). Being surrounded by hot/beautiful friends who never lack in male attention since they went through puberty doesn't help in that regards. Constantly being the friend is painful, especially when a boy you like is pinning after one of your best friends. At this point I cringe whenever I hear something along the lines of 'you're pretty!' or 'wow you look great today!' because I know it's pity, I know it's just friends being kind and your mother being your mother. 

My life is a plateau. I don't think I can look at any point in my life and say I have made a difference. I don't think I can point at any time in my life and say I was truly happy for longer than a day. I don't think there's been anything in my life that was well interesting, or worth living for etc. Hence I know my future will just be the same. Why would my life all of a sudden peak at this point anyway? 20s and your teens are meant to be the best time of your life right, so if this is the best I dread to see the rest. There is honestly no point in living such a mediocre life. 

Mostly I'm bitter. I'm bitter I didn't get to fall in love or feel like everything was worth it or feel pride in myself or heck LIVE. I'm bitter I am who I am and I'm bitter my future will just be the same old because having 'hope' is fine and all but if the statistics of your life prove otherwise then it's just meaningless. 

Now what I want to ask - what do you guys think is the point in a life so monotone and meaningless? No tragic events, nothing to fix just a boring fate and day to day life alongside a self loathing mindset which only gets worse by the day. So yeah! Thanks. ",12Feb2018,1,
66,"Hi,
for a long time (more than 10 years) I have been having low self-esteem problems which affected my life a lot but recently they started to affect it too much. 

Everyday I think how ugly I am and feel hopeless when there isn't anything I could do to correct my looks (e.g. like you can lose weight). All of my friends are prettier than me and get more attention from guys than I do (also all of them have boyfriends). I haven't ever had a real boyfriend and I don't think I will ever be able to love somebody when I don't even love myself. I don't think I will ever be able to love myself the way I am and accept my flaws. I want to know how it feels to be in love, how it feels to love somebody and be loved back... 

Everyday I question myself if I am capable enough to be a doctor one day (I am halfway through med school). 
This year I have been feeling such deep sadness and it has started to affect my life too much. This year I haven't passed any of the exams because I don't have motivation or will to learn. I am scared that I will have to repeat this year. I am also noticing that I am slower at remembering things. 

There is a lot of competition in my field and I have met a lot of people (men professors/doctors) who think women as doctors aren't supposed to be or can't be successful. This makes me sad. So every time I do sth wrong or fail an exam I feel less worthy and nothing (except passing this exam with a great grade) can make me feel better. This is the only thing that makes me feel worthy and I don't know why and how to change that. 

Thinking how I will pass exams this year makes me sick in my stomach because nothing is going according to my plans. I don't want to have exams during summer (like every year) but there's just no way around it.

I don't have a lot of friends since I don't have time for anything else than learning. That few friends I have make me feel like I am worth less because they are much smarter, more successful and prettier than me. They probably don't know I am having this issues, because I am trying to hide them because I am ashamed of them. I am sure they would be very supportive and try to help if they knew but I don't want that. I don't want others to see me as a weak person I really am.

I feel like such a failure, because I am not great or one of the best at anything - that would give me reassurance and motivation to improve even more. I hate myself for always needing to be one of the best. 

I am scared I won't graduate or get a job or stay alone till the end of my life. I am also constantly scared that something bad is going to happen to someone I really care about (e.g. an accident, death) and this kind of thoughts take a lot of energy I don't have.",12Feb2018,2,

She's currently trying to go outside in the pouring rain. When she opened the door the cat tried to run out and she grabbed him and pulled him up by his front leg. I grabbed him from her. She doesn't understand that she hurt him.

She's seeing things that aren't there. She's very anxious and agitated. She doesn't know what a television is anymore. She asked us about her oxygen tube because she didn't know what it was. I know this all happens with a dying person. How do we help her? How do we control her unrelenting restlessness?",12Feb2018,3,

74,"Okay so I've had depression, body dysmorphic disorder, anxiety and an eating disorder for a few years now, I've had therapy twice and it's not helped at all because they literally don't take me seriously, they won't put me on meds, I went to the doctor recently and they said 'Leave it me' which filled me confidence (not!). I tried to kill myself 2 years ago but yet again was taken to see someone that didn't take me seriously. 
My family don't give a shit, my parent keep telling me one thing then telling me another, like my dad is saying to bring me driving test forward and 'maybe' buy me a car but mum's like 'we aren't buying you car, it's unfair on your brother and sister (even though they're on a higher paying jobs) and all my parents care about is bike riding, work and their new house, my older sister lives miles away and is having a baby and it's ONLY thing she talks about, my brother doesn't care about anything but his job and his car and my younger sister doesn't talk to me anymore because she's at uni, she was my best friend tbh, I'm trying to move out but the places that I can afford won't accept an 'apprentice' but home is stressing me out.
 I have no friends (I'm not even joking with that, I literally don't have any friends) there was a massive fall out last year where i got blamed for a lot of stuff and no one was listening to my side, all my friends rn are actually my boyfriends, no one even messages me anymore and my boyfriend is driving me crazy! He only knows about my anxiety and he's nice and supportive of it and I love him so so much but all I can think about recently it breaking up even when I don't want to, I hardly get any attention from him now, we only see each other at weekends because of my job but he's always on his phone when he's here, he also hates my parents so he doesn't really want to come to mine so what's the point. I don't really wanna talk to him as I want him to feel like he can be himself. We don't even text that much anymore and I hate it.
I've been sat in the bath for over an hour because I don't wanna go back to my room where my boyf is.
I hate my body, no matter what I do it never gets better, my hair is shit, I can't shave unless I get rashes and cuts (I've tried waxing and stuff but nothing ever works) I'm fat and hardly have any boobs (I've 20) which looks weird to me, im sooooo pale and I get dry skin a lot but I can't use normal lotion as my skin is really sensitive and I'm poor so I can't afford the expensive stuff and alot of other stuff which im not gonna get into because its the wrong place. 
I've put on weight which makes things 10x worse, I've tried losing weight healthily (including exercise) but it feels like I'm not getting anywhere with it, that's why I hardly eat, it makes a small difference but it's not enough, my boyfriend and parents say I don't need to lose weight but I clearly do. 
I find myself getting really frustrated a lot even when it's something small, like I've found my perfect job and I love it but because of all this I can't concentrate properly and when I am actually doing work I get frustrated with it and it's making scared that they're gonna get rid of me as I'm only an apprentice and they're gonna keep with other apprentice. 
I've now spent all my savings thinking it would make me feel better but it just made me feel worse and that I'm gonna have to lie when my parents ask how much I've saved.
I've been thinking about suicide for a while but it made me sad to think about it but for this past week I've not been sad about it. 
I'm not expecting a response and hardly anyone has replied to my previous posts and I just needed to get all of this out.
I'm also very sorry for this long ass post ",12Feb2018,1,

Last year I was with someone and happy and they left and it’s coming around again and I’m alone and all I can do is freak out about it, even though I freak out about it every single fucking day and I breakdown over and over and over and over again, Valentine’s Day just reminds be about how fucking alone I am and I can’t deal with it.

76,"I never had met any friends in the my town of origin, my parents divorced when I was 5, I lived with my grandma and and grandpa in a small village and was the only child there, to kindergarden I went only for one year because I hated it there and didn't have any friends there. My mom found a douchy boyfriend and sent me to school, where I didn't know anyone and was 14 km away from where I lived, had 2 friends in school and 2 girls as friends at home. And I was okay with that for that time, but when I went to high school I have become very close with 3 guys there and we became very close but over the course of time (now I am in 3rd year of HS) the friends started to get closer between each other, while I started to get more distant from them. Now I feel extremly lonely, and probably have depression, live with my mom and her douchy boyfriend that I hate for his anger issues and how stupid he can be and just want to end it all, I feel like my life has no goal and that I will end up lonely, sad and unloved by everyone",12Feb2018,1,

78,"I feel as though everything in my life is falling apart. I am a Sophomore in college with a double major that I started this year loving. Yet, this semester, I find myself dreading all of my classes. I enjoyed every single one of them last semester and they were similar in nature yet I can barely handle getting out of bed in the morning or completing any of my assignments. I don't know what I am working for. I always supposed I would go into Consulting or a similar field but am realizing that may not be what I want to do without seeing any other viable solutions. My relationship is falling apart. I get upset with my significant other over the dumbest things and don't derive happiness from it, it just acts as a place where I can seek refuge when things get stressful. Despite this, it also acts as a major stressor in my life. 

I have been going to therapy sessions for a month and a half and yet I haven't seemed to get anywhere despite being extremely open with my counselor and trying desperately to find the cause of my depression. I can't even get myself to do normal activities like folding my laundry after I wash it or charging my phone at night despite the little effort it takes. I just don't know where to turn anymore, I feel so overwhelmed and feel as though I am working towards nothing with no direction at all. I have tried all the classic methods of eating breakfast, sleeping more, drinking less alcohol, exercising more, but I still feel as though I am drowning. Does anyone have any experience with these feelings or have any advice on where to turn and what to do? ",12Feb2018,3,
79,"If you have a mental illness (maybe even since childhood well into adulthood) or someone did a really bad thing to you. How can you hold responsibility for things that were out of your control? A depressed person will allow things to get really messy (like losing a job, losing friends and a partner, becoming homeless, or even being unable to find and keep friends/partner/job etc) due to not having enough strength to react in a positive way to stop the situation from escalating. So how can we blame them for their misery? Why do therapists usually ""teach"" you to take the blame? It's the same as telling someone bound to a wheelchair that he doesn't walk because of his own fault/desire of not putting enough effort into standing up and walk. I don't see much difference in taking that approach than what religion did in the past blaming the leper and his ""sins"" for his illness.

Or if your situation is due to a very tough childhood or being raised by a dysfunctional family, and as a result you developed mental illnesses or personality disorders. How can you take the blame for that?",12Feb2018,49,
80,"ever since i was younger i've always been the unwanted one - ugly, ignored, bullied, left out, uninvited

that hasn't changed.

a bad habit i have developed is being very...dramatic. like i lie to make things more interesting (not about serious things but it gets silly), i overreact heavily about things that HAVE happened, and i sometimes even spam or talk loudly.

i think after my whole life of being left out i have never received much attention. i think this is my unhealthy way of ""trying to make up"" for what i never got in child hood but idk

any one else?",12Feb2018,1,

I asked my therapist if this made me a paranoid schizophrenic.She asked me point-blank ""are you speaking to someone else,or to yourself""?

I said ""I talk to myself,noone else"".

She said I was *not* paranoid schizophrenic,but still had issues with socialization,emotional control,etc.She is a MFT (marriage &amp; family) therapist.I see her because its really hard finding a *psychologist* that will accept Medicaid.

I just feel the need to talk about everything &amp; anything,practice talking,etc &amp; I *don't* like the word crazy because its disrespectful.Nowadays,I spent lots of time fantasizing over Michael Fassbender,Taron Egerton &amp; Dan Stevens (British actors) because I've been alone all my life.My father is an ex-Jehovah's Witness &amp; my mother naturalized US citizen from Morocco that's blind in one eye.My two brothers &amp; I were raised in a home of poverty,violence &amp; broken promises.I like reading romantic Fanfiction,romantic AO3,etc.

My aunt (Mom's sister) caught me doing it one time.She likes to talk shit about my Mom's bad decision to marry a poor man like my father.I often fantasize about hot Prince Charming type British actors that actually love me.I just want to be loved &amp; not controlled.So I have an intense need to control my environment.I don't know if I will ever find someone.Maybe I'm meant to be alone.Sometimes people catch me talking to myself when I'm out in public,alone.I just ignore them.I'm usually good at controlling it *most* of the time.

So what do you think?

84,"I'm a cop in the US. Saturday night I had a very routine dispatch call for a possible shoplifter. I get on scene talk to the reporting party and she shows me on the camera the guy in question. At that point she just wanted him to leave the property. 

I make contact with the subject, and he was belligerent. Which is normal in my zone, so no big deal. As he was walking off the property and leaving, he said ""You think you're so cool with your gun. Well I got one too"" then he reached in his bag and showed me the butt of a hand gun. 

I draw down, start with verbal commands, and he takes off. I chase him for about two or three blocks until the on duty sergeant called off the chase. It got into a residential area and we didn't want to risk a shoot out in a residential area (he did get arrested later that night). 

The thing that is getting to me is that is the closest I've ever come to shooting someone. I was pulling the slack out of my trigger and was aimed center mass. I've had to draw my gun before, but I always had a partner with me. This was one of my first shifts riding alone. This time was different. I felt terrified. I felt like it was going to be me or him. It was a feeling I've never felt. I can't even explain it. It was like an adrenaline rush, with anger, fear, and everything else. I'm having nightmares. I jump every time I hear a loud thud or a car back fire. I'm not sure where to go from here. Any help I can get is greatly appreciated. ",12Feb2018,6,
