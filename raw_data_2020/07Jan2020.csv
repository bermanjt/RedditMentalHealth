0,"This won’t be interesting to anyone, and is just here for me to feel heard. Sorry for taking up space.

I think I have finally made the worst mistake I’ll ever make. I told my friends (who are wonderful people) that I don’t think I should be their friend anymore.    
Why did I say this?    
Well, that’s because I suck as a friend, and they deserve better. Now, they’re telling me that they think I’ll get better, but they don’t know me as well as I do. I will never get better.

I wish I could be just slightly more normal. Then, maybe, I could be a better friend, and I might not feel so bad about everything either.

I really think they’re better off without me, but I know they’re kind people. They would never tell me to fuck off (which they should’ve done ages ago), so I have to end it instead.    
That they pushed back proves that I can never be deserving of their friendship. If I was my own friend, I would’ve just said “okay”, and then it’d be over.    
I really suck.

I know I’ll be really sad when I’m friendless again. I feel like I’m going to cry whenever I think about it, but there’s an upside to all that: I promised them to not kill myself, and (imo) that our friendship ends makes my promise not count.    
I’ve got some painkillers and a cutting-tool, plus a belt and a plastic bag. I desperately hope that’ll be enough to kill me. If it doesn’t, I’ll jump off a nearby bridge into traffic. It’s more messy, but it might work.

That’ll be the last time anyone had to deal with my shit. After that, they can move on. I won’t hold anyone back anymore.

But, I’ll probably wuss out, and then live the rest of my shitty life without friends because I’m too retarded to just shut up. Thanks for reading, etc.",07Jan2020,1
1,"Hundreds of ideas and thoughts will come into my head so much. I’m an artist and musician so a lot of it is art related, projects, work, organization, then it goes to books I wanna read places I wanna go things I wanna try and it’s great because I no longer feel that lack of wanting to do anything however, it’s kind of the same in that there’s just this overflow of SO much that I get anxious and just end up making thousands of lists and don’t even know where to get started and end up not doing it at all because I have this feeling that I can’t just do one thing at a time. Has anyone else experienced this/ how do you cope? And how would one describe this feeling in more detail but simpler than this post besides just “overwhelmed”? I’m in therapy currently but I’m just looking for answers here to get some extra input. Thanks!",07Jan2020,1

4,"Hello lovely people! 

Is it possible for me to see a therapist without parental consent? 

(context)
I have been wondering recently about the privacy and consent laws regarding mental health treatment for minors in California. I am 17, and I’m coping with my issues, but the methods I’m using are significantly damaging my body and interfering with my day-to-day life. I think I would benefit from having someone to talk to, but I don’t want to worry my family. They are under enough stress as it is. That fear has left me afraid to mention it to anyone, as it will ultimately get back to them due to the laws I’ve looked into for pediatric care and education. And I wouldn’t be able to use their insurance because the insurance company would disclose what I am paying for. I have my own income and I could pay out of pocket instead. I could drive myself to an appointment. The only limitation is my worry about the confidentiality of my issues due to my age. Any tips?",07Jan2020,1
5,"This is a throwaway account but I really need to hear from someone even if it’s one person.

I feel that most of my depression, frustration, or anything else comes from the fact that I hate my job.

To give everyone a better idea I’m a 20 year old office assistant. I had joined this business program back in highschool for this company that I currently work for when I was a senior. During that time, I felt mixed as it was my first job where I just wasn’t covering a shift for a friend. Then I got transferred to a new department and encountered a few problems listed below.

My boss expects me to be perfect in every aspect which I have reached in most parts but some parts I have not. Which irks me that I can’t be a perfect worker because of some mistakes I make. One time she put me on this performance plan and if I had not improved in the 30 days then I would be terminated. I survived it but have always felt anger that she never fully told me if I had made it or not and acts like she never had.

There is also woman that sits next to me who I also work with on my boss’s calendar I feel dislikes me. She never says anything good about me and will take any chance to make me feel like a idiot. What angers the most is that she’ll see some mistake I made on the calendar and write a whole email about it and cc my boss when we literally sit right next to each other. Sometimes she will send these emails out as soon as I leave for the day only for me to see them in the morning and make me upset in less than a whole minute of being there.

My parents have put a lot of pressure with me on this job because of the endless possibilities they can see me end up in when I feel I have no real future than just being front desk.

I feel that if I didn’t live where I am then I would have a more normal job like my friends who work at stores and restaurants. They have no problem with their jobs and some seem to enjoy it but my parents always tell me that they have loser jobs that will get them nowhere. Partly true if they plan on other things but still harsh I feel.

The only two good things I can think of is that my other coworkers see me as valuable and do compliment me about my hard work ethic and do make me feel like I’m not a damn burden. And also that I have saved money while working there and not wasting it.

I am in the probationary period as they call it and I have only until July of this year to fully complete it. I feel mixed about this. Part of me knows I can quit now but there’s another part that wants me to see the end and make my decision then since I have had already survived a year and a half. I am more on the edge to leave if that happens and will probably start job searching a month or two in advance that isn’t in this industry and something I’m more into.

When I was nearing the end of highschool, my first thoughts were to the join the military or a trade. But because of the program I was in didn’t go through with either. I still wonder if I would have been happier if I had quit and pursued these two.",07Jan2020,1
6,"I've been calling him the Red Man because I don't think he has a proper name. Every time I start panicking, hallucinating, or hearing voices, I'll see him somewhere nearby, just watching me. 
  
  
Now, when I see him, I start panicking even when he hasn't said or done anything. It's awful. 
  
  
Today, I started seeing the Red Man, and my throat felt like it was closing off almost instantly. I could faintly smell blood from somewhere, and my eyes were starting to tear up a bit because I was starting to panic a lot. 
  
  
I have one person that I talk to about this, but it doesn't help at all that I'm constantly being told that someone that's actively trying to break me mentally and physically just doesn't exist. Sure, nobody else around me sees him or experiences these things, but he's torturing me, and that means he's real enough for now. 
  
  
I just need to know how to get rid of him, or how to effectively block him out. Or, at the very least, I want someone to just be there for me instead of constantly telling me that something that's hurting me doesn't really exist, or that I'm acting crazy.",07Jan2020,1

12,"I really fucking hate math competitions. If it wasn't for my mom saying that I need them to get into good colleges, I wouldn't come within five miles of one in the first place.

Anyways, the AMC is coming up soon, and I'm completely fucking miserable. I suck at math. My peers think I'm good. I'm actually not (still waiting for the day they find out). What takes normal people a few seconds to get takes me a whole hour. I've been doing practice tests recently, and I'm doing really bad. Currently all of my time is devoted to math. I've stopped volunteering, another sport I enjoy doing, and video games just to focus my time on something that might or might not help me get into a good college. 

It's so bad that my evenings consists of one hour of studying, 15 minutes of sitting on the floor leaning against my bed and bawling, then back to studying. And I stay awake in the middle of the night crying for like the fourth time. I don't even know why I'm that upset. I could just take this again next year if I want to, since I'll still qualify anyways. I've already talked to conselors about this, but this is just becoming worse and worse. 

Currently I'm finishing one of my crying sessions and am about to go back to math. This is the FIFTH time I'm doing counting balls and boxes, and I'm still struggling to determine whether to use permutation and combination. Like WHAT THE FUCK.

It's not like I've never been under any pressure either. This is definetly not my first math competition, and the other sport I'm doing is waaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy more competitive. I've tried to ""enjoy math"" and ""have fun learning,"" but nothing is working for me.

14,"Sometimes when im outside at night getting something out of my car, I'll randomly worry that there is a killer or a kidnapper whos after me, so I'll usually get all anxious and sprint inside. There have also been times, where I've been sitting on a train, or at school, and I'll briefly worry that someone might be reading my mind. I've never truly believed these thoughts, but they worry me. 

The fact that I have these thoughts worries me more than the thoughts actually do.

Am I going crazy? I've had these thoughts since I was younger, but I got over them for a while, but then they all came back when I had a bad LSD trip. What can I do about this?",07Jan2020,1
15,"So first, I've been struggling with what is likely depression and just intense loneliness, from lacking any sort of real relationship between a person. Like a lover's relationship, great relationship with my family. It is mostly self inflicted, as I am very self conscious about how skinny fat I am. I don't work out, but really should, and diet a bit.

Regardless of all that, I realized I hadn't cried in like  a full 6 months, which is both good and bad. But I saw some America's Got Talent act that hit me in the feels. And I only teared up, but it made me feel amazingly better.

So don't be afraid to cry, it is so therapeutic. I'm riding this high of less sadness, less loneliness, I just feel so much fucking better. 

So take the time to cry sometime and let that shit out. Thing's will get better, life will sort itself and you out, and you'll get to where you see yourself in your head soon enough.",07Jan2020,1
16,"Today I did something for myself, something I’ve always wanted to try out but never had the guts for. Before I get into that, let me just say that my anxiety (and depression wooooo) is often times crippling. I like being home and I like staying home. I like doing things that require no effort or interaction save for activities with the people I’m comfortable with. I’m just a homebody and I don’t do anything alone or really for myself. I know it’s okay to take time for oneself and be alone but I also know it’s not healthy to do that ALL THE TIME. 

So today I went and had myself a climbing lesson at a climbing gym nearby. I’ve never done it before, at least in a gym, and it’s been a hot minute since I got some real physical activity. I was equal parts terrified and excited. The whole ordeal caused a bit of anxiety because I really figured out how much I hate heights. But! I also had so much fun! My arms feel like noodles right now and it’s a feat I can hold my phone but I really did enjoy myself. I’m terrified of balaying (I don’t know how to spell that word so there it is phonetically) and my teacher had to talk me down from the near top of one of the walls because I was way too scared to just grab the rope and hop down. Poor guy had to do it twice lol but I learned a lot, my body hurts and dammit I’m proud of myself. I’ll be coming back for sure!",07Jan2020,1
17,"Yesterday I was in my room when I noticed my body started feeling slower, more rigid, and like gravity was too heavy and it took a lot more force than usual to move my limbs, I had had this exact thing probably 4 times in the past few months and it never lasted more than an hour (but was also always accompanied by violent shivering), so I just decided to wait it out. Hours passed and I still felt it, but I was also feeling very hot so I decided to go check my temp, 99.6. I started feeling really sick, nauseas, and I had this sensation going up my right arm and right calf. I I started feeling worse so I tested again it had risen to 100.5 Was laying on the floor and my brain was so uncomfrotable, with my eyes closed I saw a rainbow of changing colored bright lights, that phenomen lasted a whole 5 or so hours even after the event. The room was spinning, I thought to myself maybe I'm having a stroke and dying and I called 911 and they sent an ambulance. But I got up and felt better for a bit, went up to my room to turn candles off. Ambulance came and I sent them away saying I felt better and would go to a doctor tomorrow. Then it came again on the couch and I thought oh my god, I'm really dying. I was slurring my words on the phone to my dad and I couldn't think well. Ambulance came back, I got in. They checked my vitals, blood pressure was 143/??. For the past two weeks my blood pressure had been high like that, even though before that it tended to be too low. I'm only 21 and fit I was laying there thinking for sure I'd had a stroke and what if I was going to die, and the ambulance worker tells me it was almost certainly a non-emergency panic attack or I had the flu, I didn't even feel any relief from that just anger because what I had gone through was so terrifying I knew something had to be wrong and I didn't want them to let me die because they think I'm being dramatic


All the problems I'd been having that were getting worse starting coming to my mind making me panic, how I couldn't recognize people, didn't know where my classes were on the last day of school, not remembering entire conversations I've had with people, having to meet people 3+ times before remembering them or ever talking to them, forgetting common words, thinking multiple people are the same person or someone is a different person with glasses off etc. I have schizophrenia so I thought it was that. I took my phone and started googling stroke symptoms and brain clots and all this terrifying stuff and it was so similar I thought for sure that had to have been what happened. But by this point it was like I was disconnected from myself, I didn't even panic about this, I just layed there well I guess it's not so bad to die

For the next hour I layed in the hospital bed feeling vague discomfort and my head was heavy, and the colors were still doing that rainbow shifting thing. And I had all these impulses to move in my body, I'd randomly puff my checks, move my arm, kick my leg, twitch my mouth, etc. I layed there like that for two hours before the doctor came, at one point my temperature felt high so I pressed the nurse button and asked her to come. She responded over the remote told me they had already checked it on the ambulance and didn't need to again. He did that neurologic exam by having me push on his hand and stuff and said it was normal so he wouldn't perform an MRI or anything as it would be useless exposure to radiation and that I just had a virus or dehydration. My bloodwork was normal so he said they could send me home. By that point I felt like a fucking dramatic idiot, I thought I was dying from just a virus or dehydration? My mom seemed upset with me after that, she had come to the hospital thinking I was really dying and now she was complaining about an ambulance bill and having to miss work from being up so late. I started crying from guilt, I felt so so so unbearably guilty from knowing how scared she was, she thought I was dying too, she had come all the way to the hospital. I cried from then until they sent us home, I felt so guilty, I felt so stupid, I felt like I could never show my face at a hospital or doctor again because surely they wrote in the notes about what a dramatic idiot I am

We we to the 24 hour open store and I got stuck staring in the mirror at the bathroom. My eyes flashed green and pink and it felt like I was trading eyes with the mirror. My face became scary and distorted.  I stood there over half an hour with tears streaming down my face but unable to move or make sound. My vision started warping. I felt the stress triggering psychosis, as we left the whole grocery store turned bright glowing blue

When I left I couldn't say anything but one word responses, I could only move slowly, and my face just stared blankly in the same direction. The car ride open I sat stiffly with my head crooked to the side and drool and snot dripping from my face. It felt like catatonia. I was still and blank the whole ride, I just existed in the rain and swirling shifting colors in my head


I got home and threw myself like a zombie bean bag onto the floor in my room, then laid there staring at my hand and drooling with voices saying things in my head transfixed for I don't know how long. I went down the stairs and had a panic attack in front of the fireplace watching shadows dart around and objects morph into beings while my mom laid on the couch. Then something changed, I felt more comfortable, even happy, warm. But my head was so different, it was like the bottom of my brain didn't exist, my thoughts were just a handful of small green ""legos"" floating high above a black void, everything on the bottom deleted. I was saying things that didn't make any sense, word salad, but like a child, I would look worried at my mom and ask things ""Are you okay?"" and reply to questions she never asked or sometimes not reply when she said something to me. I felt like I was inside a horror movie, I would lean into the fireplace and it would gain more sides and I'd be on the highest one laying, with many little ""arms"" pulling the top slap into my head. I was holding my head with my hands and it felt like my hands  morphed into hands with only two fingers that grew really long. I was acting like a child for hours, I was being rude, and then I would be very friendly, and I sat in front of the fireplace drawing heavenly structures I was seeing and writing important things voices said. I couldn't spell basic words, it was a struggle to control my right arm for some reason so I was sloppily writing and everything misspelled.

20,"So basically I am 1 year out of high school and I am struggling to decide with path to take with my life and I am having to deal with other factors that are causing me stress and extreme anxiety. Basically all through school I had planned to get a trade and start up like that, however as encouraged by one of my teachers I decided to try university studying marketing as it was an area that interested me. I ended up hating it and wanted out so I decided to try something else which was paramedicine. Now this is where the dilemma begins, most of my senior years of school I had struggled with mild depression and abit of anxiety mainly due to my unattractive looks and inability to get any interest from girls, so subconsciously I thought that studying paramedicine which would be something abit more interesting for me would dull the pain and give me something to focus on rather than not getting girls and feeling lonely. This worked only for a short while but eventually I realised that no matter what I studied I still wouldn’t get any interest from girls just because I was studying something different. So now I am back on the trade path but now am feeling the lonely and isolated feelings again and I now have ambition to try studying nursing as I feel it would be more interesting and give me the human to human contact that I crave. I just need advice now, am I choosing this career path again but subconsciously I am lonely and feel that doing that would somehow cure it because I hate my current situation? Or am I just genuinely interested in it but I am letting my emotions question it?

22,"I have debilitating anxiety due to having complex ptsd from childhood trauma. I have tmj too and my ears often ring from stress. A few weeks ago I had an episode that was basically an emotional flashback. I experienced horrible depression. Couldn’t leave my bed, could not go to work, could barely stand and could not eat. Although my depression or emotional flashback or whatever it’s called seems to be at bay right now due to outside distractions that snapped me out of it and I’m more functional, my appetite is still extremely suppressed. I’m barely eating. If it weren’t for alcohol a few times a week I’d get very little calories. Despite how low my appetite is, my stomach always growls and my body is craving food. But even after not eating for so long and feeling like I’m going to pass out, food still doesn’t taste good which is crazy to me! I thought I’d want to gulf it down but I still had to force it down. 

Before I finally made myself eat tonight, my anxiety was getting so bad it started to take the form of ocd where I was getting obsessive, intrusive thoughts that only come when my anxiety is at its worst. After I got some food down, those symptoms got way better. I didn’t even realize not eating was having such a huge impact on my anxiety. I don’t know what to do.

23,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been worrying very recently that I might be a Narcissist. I went to a mental health professional not too long ago, and I was told I shown traits of BPD and they suggested I partake in DBT in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have no idea what to believe. I know something is wrong with me, but I want that definitive answer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I met my new partner 4 months ago. A lot of my behaviours I see in myself, I worry about them. I am very quick to anger, sometimes when he tells me no, I act like a child. What I see in him is nothing how I am. He is very stable in his job, he is great with his money, he is head strong and knows what he wants. I am the opposite, I feel like I can't do anything myself without someone prodding me or helping me. I feel like I keep playing the victim. He is also very smart and logical, and thinks rationally about things. Sometimes this irritates me, as sometimes he will tell me to do something a different way and this sparks annoyance and anger in me. I feel like he thinks I'm incompetent but I do know it's only coming from a place in him of care and just trying to offer easier solutions to something that I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill of.

&amp;#x200B;

My childhood is very confusing. I love and hate my mother. I have some real deep resentment towards her. She was very aggressive growing up, punishing myself and my sister with physical violence. She would scream in our face, throw things, leave, come back. I never grew up with a father.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a time when I was 6, my sister 8. My mother was towering over my sister screaming at her and hitting her. I remember putting myself between them and screaming ""don't hurt my sister"" I was then punished and told to be respectful. There was also a time where after an argument with her, I broke my glasses (I was 11 at the time). I used to be bullied for wearing these. She punished me by smashing my PS3 into pieces with a hammer. After many arguments, I would remember laying on my bed crying and feeling so alone. I would usually be the one to apologise. My mother tells me I'm manipulative. And sometimes during confrontation, if I try to be level headed as I'm now an adult she asks me why I'm always analysing her. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a time when I was 9 and I pretended to be dead in the park. The ambulance came and they knew I was just pretending. My mother came too. I do not know my reasoning's behind this, I can't remember what was going on in my head at the time. I think looking at it, I may have been calling out for help or attention. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing, my mother was incredibly drunk one night. I was probably about 11/12. I hadn't really seen my dad, maybe 3-5 times in my life. Mum would say she made contact with him to arrange things but he wouldn't show. He was always painted to me growing up as a bad terrible man who deserted us. But, on this night, me and my mum walked to my dads house (while shes incredible intoxicated). She said I wanted to go, to this day when I asked her, but I don't remember asking to go. And even if I did, it was 10.30pm and she was intoxicated, she should have said no? Anyway, we got to his house and she knocked on the door, he opened it and my mum said ""here is your kid he's come to see you"" and he slammed the door. My mother retaliated instantly, kicking and banging the door and screaming. My dads wife opened the door and told my mum to be quiet as her kid was upstairs sleeping. My mum screamed at her ""what about Kevins (my dads name) son (as in me)"", I don't remember much else of this conversation, next thing I know, my mum leaned into the door and grabbed the lady by the chin. She shoved my mum out the door and they ended up in a scuffle on the floor. I remember jumping on the ladies back screaming ""get off my mum"" and I think I was pulling the ladies hair. The police came, my mum was arrested and I was taken home. Social services came out soon after as my dad reported my mum to them, I was scared and didn't know what to say to them. My mum told me to tell them exactly how I feel about her. So I said that she was the best mum and that I couldn't have asked for better... But I think I could have.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother in an argument regularly says things like ""after all I've done for you, you disrespect me like that"" or ""you have no respect for me"" or ""i tried my hardest and it's never good enough for you"". She would sometimes say things growing up and still does like ""i dont even want to be here anymore"". She would result to calling me a cunt, a bastard, a little shit, you name it. She still does now and I'm an adult.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up with just her and my sister (I am a male), my sister is 2 years older than me.

I'm worried for my partner. I don't want to hurt him, but I feel like I'm a bad person and my behaviour growing up wasn't good either, I focus too much on how I feel during situations with him and I don't like that I seem to blame him for how I feel. After I perceive the situation differently. I can be very quick to react to something that might not even seem like such a big issue, but to me it feels like it is. I feel like I change too, I notice myself becoming cold and inconsiderate to his point of view until after I calm down. This is really not fair on him. And I'm considering leaving the relationship, which is incredible painful to even think about. I don't want to bring him down with my toxicity and ruin him.

Am I a bad person? I need help.",07Jan2020,1
24,"Alright, so this is my first ever post on here and Im starting out with a banger. I have bipolar ii(professional diagnosis), I am currently on Lamotrogine(about eight months) and Escatalopram(about one month). I have been experiencing some memory loss of distant past conversations/events and recent conversations/events, I constantly misplace things such as my phone, remotes, clothing, etc. I have searched online and it has said that Lamotrigine actually helps with memory in most cases, but I have only experienced the weird random memory loss for about 3-4 months. If anyone has advice, information, or similar experiences, I’d love to hear about it.",07Jan2020,1

27,"There are times in our lives when we need or want to tell the important people in our lives (could be friends, partners, family, etc.) about our struggles and experiences or let them know about our specific illnesses. 

I'm typically very open about my struggles with mental health and the fact that I have suffered the symptoms of Panic Disorder, GAD, and clinical depression for a long time. I actually enjoy having discussions about the importance of mental health and using my experiences as a way to start that. Sometimes it's just nice to share, right?

But there are some people that are hard to tell this to. Usually, it's people you know well, or people you are worried might react badly because you know you have something to lose if you tell them and somehow things go wrong. You might lose someone, or get hurt. 

There's a specific person I'm wanting to tell about my issues. For very minimal background on my relationship with them, we met and connected really well, some stuff happened, and we're starting over. 

I don't think they'll react badly. At all. They have some problems too and I've always been understanding and supportive of them. The problem is, it's really important to me that they are aware of these very crucial parts of my life and identity, and I truly have no clue how to bring it up. I have no idea what to say or how. I have no idea how to tell them that crowded places make me panic, or that everyday situations can turn into nightmares if my anxiety spirals, or that I can feel so tired for no reason. I need to tell them just how much this has affected me and how I'm concerned it might affect our relationship, but I feel something blocking me from doing that that I've simply never experienced before. 

I've had to go into conversations about my mental health knowing I might not get a positive reaction or that things might not end that well, that I might get hurt. Even then I've known what to say and how to handle things, but now I'm just so lost.

Advice or tips would be great, but it would also be cool to see people sharing their experiences with telling people about their mental health. Thanks :)",07Jan2020,1

So, around April of this year I experienced what was assumed to be a psychotic break. Im 21 years old, was diagnosed ADHD, conduct and bipolar all before age 10. I've been diagnosed Bipolar 1 (rediagnosed in foster care at age 17)
for about 10 years, complex PTSD, persistent depression, parent-child relation issues and so on and so forth.
 My mother is Schizoaffective, both uncles are diagnosed as well and my sister is full Schizophrenic with ""do not record me"" signs on her doors, thinks ATT is spying on her and calls the police regarding the 'bugs' aka listening devices someone put in her house.

During a night in April, I went into a 6 hour long episode that was a complete break from reality.
(This actually continued until November.)
 I dont remember this, but at the same time know it happened- sort of as if through muscle memory and looking as a third person type view.

It was late one evening, I was coloring with my wife one of her favorite bonding activities and just zoned off. I thought I'd been staring at it too long, I saw like I was in a fish bowl, so I used eyedrops. No drugs or alcohol within 2 months and then it was just weed before.
Started to free draw and scribbling off the lines. I started making absurd and dark shapes which changed, and morphed and became one thing into another into another.
Exact lines as if they were intentional and concious, detailed and done in a way I can't actually draw, I was talking to them out of range from my wifes voice, answering her back in a dull and monotone voice and answers that didnt make sense-- answering her swift and chop to get back to my multiple conversations I was already having.
Telling them to calm down, wait their turn, to come back and quiet down-among other things. I'd spend half an hour scouring through the lines trying to find where one went or was hiding. Mad they left, exasperated. 
One request towards the end was an odd one that struck a bell with me. 
Specifically they had, or wanted silver eyes. Even now I know that is something I heard a long time ago but cant place, the silver eyes.

I just kept circling the black pen for hours, talking to them. I'm not sure how I “came back”. After that, it got really bad and really fast.

The voices, I'd never had quite as noticable or distinguished before. I'd hide, afraid to leave the house or under blankets afraid someone was coming, never a certain fear just a doom feelings. Whatever was coming, whoever would bring the end. Aggression, memory loss, paranoia and personality changes. 
I thought the kids in the neighborhood were always staring, always judging me and “frowning"", they stood in a line-- the youngest to oldest.
 Every day I'd drive home and get angrier everytime I saw them until I was foaming at the mouth, cussing out my window.
 I dont think they ever actually looked at me.
I sped, pulled dangerous maneuvers and ran lights at intersections. I've never done this. I stopped driving and still dont because of the fear I'd react like this.

As time progressed, I saw the figures I drew standing outside in the street in a small crowd every night. I was convinced I was safe if I didnt listen for them, try to hear or catch what they said and safe if I didnt go outside at night. They couldnt reach me on the second story, so at night I wouldn't go downstairs either. The lights would always have to be on.

They never left, they followed me and waited for me at three different homes I lived in--over about six months. The last house it took them a while to show up. They were taller then.

Eventually, they talked. Whispers from the windows on the first floor telling me to come outside, then the voices of friends acting like they were real and needing my help with something outside.

One night, I went out. I saw all of them in the back yard, the figures tell and black. Like a black animated sketch with just lines and eyes. One specifically stood out, from the drawing, he felt powerful and reminded me of the undertaker. Fur Cape, feather shoulder pads, long black hair. He had a figure, defined with different tones not just black. His eyes were silver and he started coming towards me, ran inside and upstairs and jumped in bed, covering my ears with my knees on my chest. 
5-6 voices at once, more than ever, overlapping and female. 
They were on the roof, the closed windows were wide open to me, louder and louder as they were up the stairs, one behind the dresser. 6 on each window ledge, climbing in. They were never able to come inside, never able to come upstairs before, I never had to scream shut up before this. They surrounded me, my eyes closed but I could feel them towering and closing in.

I dont remember much, hazy after. I went outside and stood there, my one roomate had security cameras where I was able to watch it over later. I waved at something off in the dark, automated steps and wide blank eyes. I came inside and starred into nothing for 3 hours before being brought to bed by my bestfriend who'd seen me like this just once before over four years. Gave me some of my medicine which I hadnt been taking.

Since then, nothing has happened. My memory is better, no mood swings or voices or hallucinations.
 I feel like it's starting to resurface, 2-3 months later I can feel it oddly and faintly starting to click again, everything make sense and feel real again.

But the other day I bought a new conditioner, didn’t give it much thought since I read the label and it seemed okay. However, last night when I was in the shower, as soon as I got a whiff of the scent, I said, “Oh, shit.” 

I shut down. I was like a zombie throughout the night, I knew that smell and it reminded me of people and a past I’d rather move on from. I hate the fact that just a smell affects me. I could barely sleep all night and I’m feeling drained today. 

I think I’ll be okay though. I knew the trigger and didn’t let it affect me so bad.

My parents are divorced and I see my dad twice a year as he lives in a state across the country from me. I got back from visiting him just a few days ago and back to my regular situation. But it's changed now. 

I lived with my mom, and we didn't have a good relationship in the first place. She moved to a different state for a job and will fly back on the weekends, leaving me to live all alone in this city with her boyfriend of 7 months living with me. She has been through so many boyfriends since the divorce when I was 4 that it's become really hard for me to form a genuine relationship with them as I feel like they're just going to leave and it will be all for naught. Tonight he invited me to dinner with his parents and I declined and I feel bad about it but I just didn't want to go and be fake with his family who I feel like won't even be in my life even 6 months from now.

I'm just having a really hard time keeping everything together. I've been holding in so many emotions because I've never been allowed to express them to either of my parents because they haven't been emotionally (and physically) available to me.

2019 wasnt a good year for me. In the year it seemed me and my S/O got more and more distant with eachother. It was the year my depression spiraled down into deepest depths of my being. It was the year I tried to kill myself. It was the year i realized i hated my job and my life. It was the year I got more.. pessimistic.. It had me thinking that maybe were all just doing everything for ourselves. That maybe nobody cared at all. That everything we did was for some self gratification or reward. Maybe it's true, maybe it's not who knows. But recently I've had time to reflect, if it is true, is it a bad thing? Because all anyone in this world can do for you is suggest something. Theres nobody more valuable in your corner than yourself, because it's you making all the decisions here. No matter what you think, you always have a choice, so you need to do what's best for you.

They had just told me they started taking their pills again so when they put up a photo about ""chugging"" their pills I thought it was a joke and didn't even realise it was a joke about suicide. They kept telling me how tired they were (they did seem quite loopy) so I just told them to get some rest. When I woke up it hit me what they had meant and done.   

I was so relieved when they responded and said they were still breathing. I spent a few hours just texting them and telling them I'm here and sorry and all. I'm so frazzled and distraught because I didn't help as much as I could. I didn't even realise what was happening.   

I'm supposed to be working right now but I just can't focus and haven't eaten etc. because I'm just so shaken at them and myself.

36,"I fucked up, and my communication skills when I'm stressed are subpar, at best. 

I have a coping technique I've been using for about a year whenever I feel suicidal. A few things to understand first before I explain it:

1.) I have a very vivid imagination... which is, in and of itself, a coping technique I've developed alongside mental escapism. I can entertain anytime, anywhere, by retreating into my own head. It can be an issue sometimes, actually, but that's not the issue I came here for this time.

2.) I tried to kill myself via Tylenol about a year ago, and about a minute after swallowing I freaked the hell out and realized I did not, in fact, want to die. I made myself vomit immediately and sat on the toilet for an hour with '911' typed out on my phone, ready to call if anything happened. Nothing did (thank God.) 

That feeling of 'This was the dumbest thing I've ever done UNDO UNDO UNDO' is very important... but it's hard, sometimes, to latch onto it when I'm at a low point in a depressed feedback loop.

So, my coping mechanism is this; I close my eyes, and go into my head. I go through with the suicide I'm thinking about step-by step. I mentally construct every part of the scene; the room I'm in right now, getting up, the sound of my footsteps, sounds of the city outside, how the orange tree next door smells, how the cold iron handrails feel on my fingers. I put myself right there as much as I can, with as much detail and belief as I can muster.

I had been thinking about hanging myself. I had looked up a noose gif; so, I could imagine doing it like I'd have to. 

Whenever I do this, at the point where I commit the act is when the feeling of 'Oh *fuck* oh *God* oh *no*, *no no no* ***I don't want to do this at all****'* kicks in. 

I don't want to die; *I know this.* I just have to remind myself sometimes, because my brain kind of sucks eggs and I'm not getting the help I need yet. This method has done more than anything else to snap me out of that low and into a more manageable state of mind.

So, what's the issue here? Remember that noose gif I looked up?

I thought I closed it.

I didn't.

Husband saw it.

He asked why I had it up, and instead of explaining the above, my brain froze up in a panic and an idiotic 'uh, I had it up already' falls out of my mouth.

We didn't get to talk about it after that point at all because he was in the middle of heading out the door for work. All he was able to ask was a quick 'should I be worried about you?' and get my hasty, embarrassed reassurances that he doesn't.

*Of course* he's worried about me. Like, what sane, caring person wouldn't be if they saw that on their clinically-depressed spouse's computer? I couldn't even use the excuse *'I needed to look it up for a picture / writing thing'* because we'd just had a shitty bad-communication discussion on an emotional topic that I'm not dealing with well. I obviously didn't look it up for that reason.

I just, don't know how to explain any of this to him without sounding like an idiot. How do I do that? Fantasizing about yourself dying is supposed to be the exact opposite of healthy, but I'm doing it in a way that reminds me that I'm being irrational and I want to live.

...To be fair, I haven't actually asked a therapist if this is healthy or not, but I am in the middle of settling into California and I intend to get psychiatric help as soon as we get me my I.D. and medical coverage.

Please help me. I fuck up communication regularly and I don't wanna fuck this up, I need him to know I'm ok. He's got enough to worry about already, and I'm getting help soon. I'm not going to off myself in two, three weeks.",07Jan2020,1

I'm fine with meeting new people (albeit it can get awkward), preparing for a speech or speaking in front of a huge crowd. But I constantly feel like people are always looking at my actions. 

For example, if I needed to buy items from a supermarket I would anxiously walk around looking for the items I needed. If I had to look for the items on the shelve, I would scan through it quickly rather than slowly looking at the brands/information of the items. I always feel like I need to get out as soon as possible.

Another example, if I needed to buy lunch for myself I would try not to buy from the same store the previous day as I feel like the store owner would judge me for buying the same food again. Sure, they will benefit from my business but I can't shake that feeling.

One last example, I would never be able to go window shopping alone as I would always walk quickly everywhere I go. I tried to slow my footsteps, but I would naturally go back to walking at a fast speed.

So, last night I went on a first date with a guy I’ve been talking to/hanging out with for a couple of weeks. I don’t know what it is about him but this time I wanted to be honest about my issues. He came with me to a party as my +1,  I sat him down after a little liquid courage and told him.

As soon as I was done he kissed me, gave me a hug, was totally understanding and we had a really great night.

I still don’t know how far I will be able to go with him but I am just so happy that I was finally able to tell someone and that he reacted the way that he did. I’m hungover as hell and feel like shit today but have been grinning like an idiot all day long.

My psychiatrist thought maybe the XL wouldn’t help the sleeping and make it worse plus she doesn’t like prescribing me another med to help me sleep so she changes me to Wellbutrin SR generic 150mg only once a day to see if that helps me sleep. 

I thought this was weird it’s the same mg once day? Wouldn’t that take away the good effects I’m feeling from the XL 150mg I was doing so well on? 

Also, though I’m only on day 3 of the SR - my sleeping is even worse on the SR because I feel like I’m panicking and overthinking when I’m in bed trying to sleep.

I figure maybe I can apply to be in the national guard as theyre always recruiting at my campus I just want to stop being a useless, talentless, low on the food chain, piece of shit.  I could really care less what the job is if it can give me something more than what my life is with better pay and maybe even benefits. Seriously has me in a state of shock, once my parents got divorced they stopped giving a shit about me because I distanced myself from them for my own well being, my dad just gets drunk and gets bitter and goes on about how I dont appreciate him, looking at me like Im a fucking skidmark, meanwhile I have fucking classmates my age who own multiple boats and cars, already got married, and have fucking kids who get to have undivorced grandparents. Sure whatever I dont know the rest of the stories and theres undoubtedly something going on to make me more wrong and be reason for me to be more appreciative of my life, but I need to remind myself that I need to make my life better and nobody I know now wants to/ is going to help me do that, not my bickering parents or my siblings who are already figuring their lives out, not my gf since I might as well be dead to her when I enlist, and not my therapy group since Im not going to be able to have that. Nobody else got me those perfect grades busting their asses like I did, even if theyre just useless fucking numbers I know I can do the same on my bio and organic chem classes, because being a fuckup is not an option, and Once I get my degree, then what? Likely a life of underemployment and more of this feeling that keeps me awake, maybe by then Ill have the shit I was never taught figured out. Fuckit man idk anymore I have work at 6am with an hour commute so I gotta be up in 5 hours. And just in case I ever get looked up and this comes up im not suicidal or any of that shit, but it would be dope to not have to worry about any of this overrated shit.",07Jan2020,1
51,"So much shit has been going on with me so this is kinda a rant as well.

14m. This is a throwaway.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I've been feeling super shit, sad, and self-deprecating of recent.  Idk why but I just have. I also hate myself. 

There is this person who I used to count as an old friend. One time I was really depressed over text and all of it just came spilling out. She tried to help me for some time but it wasn't really working. She told me that she was ""sick and tired of this shit"" and that she has ""given up"". I then told her that since she said I should go to a helpline that I would with no real intention of doing so. I just told her that so we could keep being friends. 

I decided that I wouldn't try to rant to her again. No more than 2 days later and she pressures me into telling her more things. For some stupid reason, I did. Now she has reacted with something that basically said I give up this is not how friendships work. I just feel so shit now. 

She was just about my closest friend. I have tried and tried time again to help her through her bad things and when she has wanted to talk or not I have done as she has asked. I genuinely enjoyed talking to her. The reason why I think this is my fault is that she has problems. Genuine really bad problems that are hard to explain but that must be why she reacted in this way. 

I just feel super bad now and Idk what to do.",07Jan2020,1
52,"Please don’t ask exactly what it is I’m going through. It’s such as sensitive subject that in my 30’s I started to cry tears when I realized I hadn’t got past this. It’s very emotional, and no I wasn’t sexually abused or anything. It’s like I hate my parents and I love my parents, but like oil in water, I can’t resolve the two. Ideally I would only love my parents but I have no idea how to get to that point. 


I don’t want to cause any potential emotional harm to my parents by letting them know how distraught I am about this n directly talking with them, and how I may never forgive them for some things... I myself was no perfect angel. We’re all just humans. In itself that doesn’t forgive anything it’s just a reminder I told myself whenever I resented them about this or that. 
But, it seems I’ve just been burying the issue. 


I know very well that deep seeded parental issues can spill over in to my future children if I don’t take care of it now. If I’m ever going to get married I don’t want to burden my wife with this either.

Is this normal to experience this with a high fever?
I have a feeling that the underlying cause of all the flu symptoms comes from depression, although I haven't been diagnosed I am seeing the doctor tomorrow so I'll have more information then.

55,"I’ve been drinking a lot since I started in September. I decided in the new year I would stop drinking, I drank almost a full bottle of vodka on new years eve.

Then I finished the rest on Jan 4th.
It’s the 6th and I want to go buy more when I get payed. That’s 60$

I switch between phases of starving myself and binge eating and since I found one place that delivers food in this town a lot of money has gone into binge eating orders. 
I ordered food yesterday, enough fries for 4 people and some cinnamon rolls.
They tried to give me free soda because I order from there so often.

Today I didn’t order food because it would cost more money and I’m trying to lose weight, on top of that the roads are so full of snow I wouldn’t ask that of them today.
I regret not either ordering food or buying more vodka when I did, I am so broke and will be broke for the next few months trying to save for a car.

I have a severe bug phobia that makes walking to work give me panic attacks so I need to get driving before May. I have pretty much no money.
I’m kind of scared of what a high addiction risk I have, when I was a teenager I wanted to try all kinds of drugs. Now as an adult I know I’d never escape it if I did.

I have around $170 (my car savings so far) for the rest of the week and almost no food. I took a week off work then called in sick once, so I don’t expect my next two pay checks to be much with the hours I missed.

I have anxiety(possible ptsd idk), bipolar disorder and an eating disorder.
If I let the eating issues and drinking out of control this month that’s going to be an extra $360 per month!

59,"Ok so... Im 16 so it’s normal to expect that I have never been in a relationship where I was totally committed. 

But recently I was in a no-labels relationship with a girl (17F) I really liked and the thing is, I met her online. So she technically wasn’t my girlfriend but she wasn’t just a friend either and I have to say I fell in love with her. She always said she was in love with me too but I don’t know anymore. And I have to say, I definitely was committed.

At one point... she told me she liked me and I said the same to her and that’s where it all started

We FaceTimed, we voice called, etc

She was gorgeous and she was kind and she was smart and I loved her so much.

Once she went on a trip to a rural part of Tennessee and we didn’t talk for two weeks... she got back earlier than she texted me and she had a new boyfriend...

It’s no wrong that she dumped me but... how she did it was what really bothered me...

So she added me to a group chat with him and broke up with me without even saying we ever were a thing because she never told him we were. So I privately texted her and she refused to tell the truth and she basically said that I never cared about her even though I always was there for her... I helped her grieve her friend who committed suicide... I did all sorts of stuff for her and I loved her so much and she just disregarded it... 

She also told me that I made her feel like she wasn’t enough and I don’t know what I did and she never told me...

She also again said she never liked me and all sorts of stuff and she even told her boyfriend we were never a thing.

Oh and she rubbed it in my face that she and her new bf were planning on fucking at some point and it sounded like it was just to run it in my face.

I barely slept that night. I barely slept... only around five hours.

I cried so much last night and almost did several times today...

I just don’t know what to do anymore... 

I told my therapist about it but I feel absolutely awful... I just don’t know what to do...

I don’t think I’ve felt so awful in my life I can’t even hear about relationships or anything anymore without getting on the verge of crying.

She even said she feels like my care wasn’t genuine and I just don’t know what to do anymore... like even before we were even involved and were just friends.

I feel like a complete mess rn tbh... why the fuck is this?",07Jan2020,1
60,"I don't suffer from any mental illnesses per se, but I just feel so disconnected and hazy about my life and everything that has been happening. I look over the calendar and I'm surprised that I've been awake every single day. I feel like this world and this life is not mine, but this temporary layover that is hard. It's like I can't make any decisions and I can only be unproductive. I'm too tired and unproductive and get by doing the bare minimum. It's like there's something wrong but there really isn;t .

61,"We all have friends, family members, co-workers, relative, or people who are close to us, going through mental health issue at some point of their life.

I personally went through the experience of it, from my mother since my early childhood.

When I'm age 3, my mom suffer from serious OCD.  
As we're from a lower class family, we couldn't afford to get a proper diagnostic on her, or get a psychiatrist to treat her.

Fact is, we're quite uneducated and we did not realize it was a mental health issue.  
All the time, our family take it as 'effect from work stress', 'bad temper', 'releasing tantrum'.

It was until I'm 14, we get her to a psychiatrist, and diagnose with OCD.

It didn't strike me as much when we learned that, as her disease comes and go, it's not 'Active' all the time.  
I was a teenager then and don't care much about mental health and don't understand the seriousness of it.

It's usually triggered by an event, a negative one, which will then cause her to be in 'Active' mode.  
It would then last for few months, or worst case,  2 years.

When it's triggered, she repeatedly do the same thing over and over again.  
Checking the trash bin, asking for the same questions, clean up the house over and over again.  
I can't count how many times she has the suicide thoughts and actually taking the action to do it, while I'm there with her experience this since I was still a kid.

I'm now at my 30, with experience in the industry and outside world, I learned that mental health is a very important thing that most people would neglect.

It sickens me when people react negatively towards people who suffers from mental illness or disease.  


**No one chose to get this.**  
**People who suffers from depression, OCD, ADD, ADHD, didn't get it by choice.**

&amp;#x200B;

To raise awareness about this, and with my personal experience of helping my mother to get better and changing her life (she still has OCD, but it rarely triggers now as we have the knowledge and ways to best prevent the disease from striking again).

Me and my partner, who also have very close friends suffering from mental illness, talk about how understanding mental health is so important and how it would change your life, any your loved ones.

We decide to share the talks to the public, hoping it could help someone out there who is listening.  
We're not professional by any means, just concerned citizens who have real life experience dealing with the matter, especially with close and loved ones.

I'm 32 now and this has not gone away, probably caused from too much bullying now my brain is broken.  It makes me insane enough that I have to avoid people or I'd end up killing them or jumping off a tall building.  But if I got my hearing removed I believe it would be cured bc it couldn't get to me if I can't hear what they're saying.

My mother got extremely mad, and told her to stop crying at school and to stop being “weak”. I feel really bad for her because she probably feels alone, and like if no one is there to help her. My mom has issues of her own as well. I have no idea how to approach this situation. My mom blames my sister for being depressed, and also says that she has no reason for being depressed. All she does is call my sister weak. How can I deal with this situation? I feel like my mom doesn’t believe in depression, or she is in denial. What can I do ??",07Jan2020,1
64,"Sorry for the long post and my bad English.
My mom is 65
This all started 2 months ago with minor dizziness but nothing significant. Weeks later it started to worsen to the point she couldn't even walk by herself, wouldn't leave bed throughout the day, she needed the help of two people to go to the bathroom and would cry almost every day for not being able to perform any task by herself. She had lost her appetite, ate 80% less than usual and would usually throw up the food. 

A week later it became worse, she started to develop panic, she would get scared and scream by insignificant things like for example turning the lights on without notifying her or something that accidentally fell and hit the floor making a noise, she was aware she shouldn't get scared by those things but she said she couldn't control it and that she wasn't crazy. 

Days later she woke up happy, and was VERY talkative (5x more than when she was fine) was very positive and could finally eat by herself in bed without making a mess. After this day she was never the same... Next day she denied all food and all liquid, she wouldn't open her mouth and kept spitting everything, then started to act differently, she was not the same person, wouldn't talk, would scream for whatever reason and call her mom for help (her mom is an elderly handicapped woman) when we were trying to feed her or give her the prescribed medication. 

Fast forward to today, she's with sedans, it's been over three weeks since she ate so we decided to get her a nasogastric feeding tube but she took it off. Last time she wasn't on sedants she had an arrhythmia due to her extreme panic, now she doesn't speak at all, she seems to understand when people talk to her and laugh at some jokes but won't reply. It's just like if she wasn't there anymore, sometimes she gets aggressive and bite people who try to open her mouth to give her the medication. When she is barely conscious she would ask for food to then deny to eat. 

She's being treated by two psychiatrist, a doctor, a cardiologist and a nurse. 
The psychiatrists say she isn't cooperating and that she is the only one that could stop this. 

It's unbelievable how she was completely fine 2 months ago being a regular 65 yo adult and now she gave up and is on the edge of death. 

My question is, is it still possible for her to recover? What are your recommendations?",07Jan2020,1
65,"I have had nightmares since I was young, when I was 14 when I was diagnosed with night terrors.  I have dreams that are either memories, being hurt or watching someone I love being hurt. Some night I wake up every two hours.  I used to take  some medicine and smoke weed to help with my bad dreams but I haven't done that in years. My boyfriend didn't like that type of ""lifestyle"" or being with someone who was self medicated to function.   The main reason I am asking for help is cause I keep having bad dreams, so I have become more afraid to sleep, so I can't fall asleep. I have other mental illness's and I am almost always sleep deprived, so I am all over the place. I wake up twitching, gasping for air, yelling, or just wake up and cry. A few times my nose will bleed or I'll get physically sick. 
The main way I am dealing with my troubles now is mostly over the counter sleeping medicine and drinking liquor or waiting until I am so sleep deprived that I pass out. But it's been taking its toll on me. I'm worried about me   like I don't wanna drive cause I could fall asleep and I am also paranoid af.

67,"Not sure if this belongs here. Ever since a bad breakup and loosing all my friends again for the 4th time, I have a real hard time trusting people or letting them in. 

I feel inadequate to decide they can be trusted or not. I often think they'll hurt/leave me anyway as soon as I speak up to them about things that are important to me. Tried to find something online but not really working either. Can't do much irl because I can't handle crowds due to my autism. I feel so lonely though, don't want to give up on my principles either.

I did a lot of bad shit due to a psychosis when off my meds. Had a breakdown few days ago, because I was sick I couldn't take my meds. Would throw them up straight away. Can't use discord because guess what? I am banned. I feel so stupid. 

I doubt 9 out of 10 times if it will ever turn around again. Already spent a lot of my life alone, slowly hating life more and more.

Regularly I wish I wasn't born. Sometimes I think everyone of my age(25) wants me to be alone. Like I don't deserve friends or a lover at all. I am so far at this point that if my parents died I would have no one and commit suicide. I sometimes even struggle to keep that promise I made to myself. Started to plan my suicide and then stop it. I am safe now. How much longer I will last alone, honestly no idea. There's just this deep hole I can't get myself out off on my own.

69,"I hear voices, see things, feel things that aren’t there. I hate it so much. There are the voices that come and go, without me being able to “pinpoint” per se, but there are 3 voices that I can easily pinpoint. 

They all have different opinions, mannerisms, etc. It’s getting so difficult keeping up with my friends, and, if it weren’t for me being so freakily good at school, I would 100% be struggling in that. 

The first voice that defends my father to the death (he was abusive), and seems to be a bit *younger* than the others... *if that makes any sense?* 

Then there’s the second voice that hate certain friends of mine. Me and another of my friends talked one of my friends out of suicide, but the other voice still hates her. Guilting me saying I should have let her die, let my other friend isolate herself away from everyone, etc. 

Then the 3rd voice doesn’t talk very much, and whenever he does it’s when there’s a heated argument going on, which he’ll then get yelled at for speaking up and just get quiet again

All of them have different views on situations, religion, politics, etc. which is why I generally try to avoid that stuff while talking to people. They even have different *names* but I don’t like acknowledging them because that just makes me feel like I’m admitting that there’s something wrong.

Which I’m kinda doing with this post, but fuck it. No ones gonna see it anyway, and I just need to get it out there for my own sanity. I’m going insane, and I want out. Everything is getting worse, and I haven’t even gotten into how sometimes it’s like the world doesn’t even exist, that it’s all fake and that it’s either a simulation, hell, or I’m just a brain in a jar getting the right stimulation to make me hallucinate all of this.

70,"I've done multiple things out of my boredom, I have spent more money from my mother than I should have, and I decided to go to another country as an exchange student for 1 year and ruined it less than halfway through by doing some drugs.


 So I came back to my family. They are concerned about me because of the drugs and think I'm depressed. Now their rules are harsher to me, like they don't want me to go out on my own as they think I'll use any opportunity I have to smoke weed, which I don't want to stop doing even if I told them otherwise.


 I'm starting to feel anxious about being in this house. My family loves me, but I just avoid being in the same room as them or stay awake at night so I don't have to see them. They want me to tell them what's wrong with me and why am I doing all of this, but of course I wouldn't say all of this since I don't want to sound like such an entitled piece of sh!t after everything I have done to them.

I want to run away from my house, I feel like I'm dead here, doing the same thing everyday is making me crazy. I want to achieve something great in life, that's what I fantasize all day long, I want to go to the gym, I want people to like me but as of now I don't have any talent.

It took me two cycling accidents and an appointment for a attention deficit disorder diagnosis to finally get diagnosed with a severe anxiety and depression disorder. There is a lot more to my story, but what makes me question this the most is the fact that there are probably many others out there who are quietly suffering from a mental illness, but really just have no idea.

Tired of waiting to see if new medication will work. It’s not, and I don’t have much hope of it getting better but it has only been a month so I guess I need to just wait it out.


Tired of spending hours awake until I eventually cry myself to sleep at some stupid hour in the morning and having to get up a few hours later, exhausted and pretending everything is okay because god forbid I show any emotion. 


Tired of having to fight the self harm urges every fucking day.


Tired of being told spending time with my young nephew is good therapy. Most of the time, yeah it is. Right now when I have my miscarriage anniversary coming up and being around children is HARD? Not helpful. (Note: id NEVER avoid or ignore him, I just can’t handle caring for him right now)


Tired of the generic “get some fresh air and sunshine” advice. I am in Australia. My city is covered in smoke from the bushfires. There ISN’T any fresh air. Even if there’s a bit of sunshine, it’s not worth spending time outside if you’re going to be breathing in smoke. I’m not just being a pain in the ass and ignoring/dismissing people’s “helpful” advice, our air is literally fucking hazardous. 


I try so hard. I have 3 amazing supports in place. I take my medication. I’ve tried over THIRTY medications.

76,"No prior history of psychiatric/recreational drug use. I developed depersonalization/derealization disorder in December 2016, and recovered completely in August 2019. What I'm experiencing currently is very, very different to anything I experienced then. 

- September 1st to 5th (2019) : Took 5 mg of Abilify (Noticed my confidence levels beginning to decline, slight depression/dread/panic beginning to creep in, creativity/cognitive abilities seemed slightly diminished)

- September 6th to 15th (2019) : Increased dose to 10 mg (Symptoms listed above became worse, and developed severe restlessness)

- September 15th to 23rd (2019) : Tapered over a period of 1 week. Restlessness improved but other symptoms became slightly worse

- September 23rd to 30th (2019) : Depression continued to increase. On the 30th I started experiencing the worst case of depersonalization I've ever experienced. Severe depression, thoughts and emotions gone, could barely function cognitively. I'm a bit calmer now and the depression has subsided, but the main symptoms haven't improved still. During my previous episode of depersonalization/derealization I could read, think and function more or less normally. I'm profoundly gifted and could make it through a 300 page novel in about an hour. Loved reading, writing, puzzle solving, had very strong opinions, etc. Now my mind is completely blank. I struggle to have conversations (have started stammering a lot because I words don't come to my mind), read and generally do anything I was easily able to do before",07Jan2020,1
77,"We've always had a rocky relationship since the beginning, a lot went down that didn't start it off right. To make things even crazier, she was my first and only relationship, at the age of 23. So I really had 0 experience or knowledge of what I was doing.

I realize now that a lot of the problems throughout the relationship were my fault. I have so many issues, and I know it's not good to google symptoms of things, but I really feel like I might have BPD. Self esteem, issues with self worth and self confidence, trust issues, possibly stemming from trauma when I was a child, these all impacted the relationship, and I know they led to its dissolution. She had issues too with anger, controlling her temper, she'd yell, throw things sometimes, but it was my fault for setting it off. I, more often than not, set these events in motion. 

In hindsight, I was a terrible person and spouse. Her step-father struggled with mental health issues as well and he ended up killing himself. I was insensitive to it and her feelings/emotions toward the subject. I've gone on rampages about how I just want to die, how it'd be better for everyone, you know the spiel. I took it a step further and lost my mind, majorly overreacted to a minor little issue, and ended up texting her something along the lines of - 'how do you think I should go? Driving off the side of the cliff seems good enough.' I hate myself, constantly, especially for things like that. I seem to just fly from one extreme to the next. The self hard definitely didn't help either. I never blamed her when I did it, but she always felt responsible. 

As I said before, I have a lot of self esteem, self confidence, self worth issues, problems with trust, controlling. I'd always think/question - 'why is she with me?', 'why would she choose me when there's so many other guys', 'if I can't make myself happy, I can't make her happy, yet she seems happy now, so she must be getting it from somewhere/someone else', 'how could she love someone like me?', etc. I had a big problem with other guys. We'd see a guy jogging down the street shirtless and my mind would immediately wonder if she thought he was hot, if she was thinking about him, etc. Same for nearly everyone else. I could rarely keep it inside as well, as soon as I'd see someone else, I'd open my shitty mouth - 'you think he's hot?', 'think he's sexy?', 'ooh, look at his abs!', 'do you wish I looked like that?', 'would you love me more if I looked like that?'. I was super controlling as well, I know that, I admit it, I'm a major piece of shit for it. Her phone would chime and I'd immediately ask who it was, if it was a guy, what they want, etc. On several occasions I would go into her phone and look at past messages, texts, whatever, to see if there were other guys she was talking to, or if she was talking to her friends about other guys, etc. If she wanted to go hang out with friends my immediate thought was, what if she's with her friends and she meets a guy, what if she gets drunk and messes around, what if she's really going to meet up with a guy and not her friends, etc. 

As the relationship went on, we rarely were physical, especially near the end. She has a lot of issues too, and has been on a lot of different meds, so we both kind of figured it was/is messing with her libido. When we first started dating, and for the first year or so, the physical intimacy was great, and we messed around quite often. She said she enjoyed it. Later on it started to get rarer and rarer, which of course made me question it. I couldn't just think about the fact she was dealing with her own issues, dealing with side effects of medication and such, I had to immediately accuse her of either not enjoying being with me physically, of not being attracted to me, or of finding it somewhere else. Again, yes, I'm an asshole. 

I was so worried and scared about her falling out of love with me, or of her finding someone better. I was so terrified of being left or abandoned. And in the end it was my fears and worries that took hold and let me ruin the relationship. I ruined it. It was my choices, my actions. 

It's been about 2 months since we've officially separated, the divorce isn't official yet though. We still talk everyday. We agree we want to treat this like a sort of break, instead of a permanent split. We both love each other, I'm still in love with her, she claims she's still in love with me. We both want to get help for ourselves and then try to see if we can get back together once we're better. It may sound stupid, but that's all I want. I want it more than anything. I can't handle being away from her. I was in such a dark place before we got together, and she reached in and pulled me out. And I had to go and fuck it all up. And now I feel even worse than I did back then. I'm terrified of what would happen if we don't get back together. Not just because of her - I miss her family, her siblings. She has 4 little siblings, I grew up an only child. I love them so much, I think of them as my own blood, and the thought that I might never get to see them again absolutely destroys me. She says she still loves me though, and she still wants us to work out more than anything, and I do believe it, but it's hard. 

I wish I could have seen my errors and how badly I was messing things up back then. I wish I would have gotten the help I needed, when it would have helped. Now I'm at a job that barely pays enough to get by, and the therapist I want to see can only go as low as $80 a session. I've already fucked up my life with debt, I have a little over $10k in credit card debt, and a little over $14k in personal loans. But I need help so bad. I have to get help, I'm scared what'll happen if I don't. I'm thinking of taking out another $1k or $1.5k personal loan, just so I can have enough to see a therapist until I find a better job. It's not smart, but I don't know what else to do at this point. 

I'm just spiraling so bad. Feel out of control, don't feel like myself anymore. I have moments at work where I'm standing there and don't feel like I'm even in my body anymore, like I have no control, it feels empty. I hate it, and I hate myself for messing things up so badly. If I'm not thinking about her, or wanting to be with her again, I'm wishing I was dead. I hate it. 

Sorry, just needed to get this off my chest..",07Jan2020,1

So I've been slowly going through the NHS and doing interviews with charities but nothing is happening because I haven't done much to worry about. But it feels like every day I think about killing myself which I still don't feel comfortable talking to my parents about.

83,"I would normally never post anything like this asking for advice or help but I honestly dont know what else I can do right now.

I have always had problems with my mental health (i.e: depressive episodes, manic episodes, anxiety, getting trapped in my head, suicidal thoughts, breakdowns, and very rare hallucinations when under stress) but recently it's gotten a lot worse. The frequency of the problems I have went from being maybe once every two to three weeks to now being a nightly endeavor that keeps me from sleeping or keeps me in bed for upwards of 12 to 15 hours. I recently turned 18 and am a high school senior and have never sought out any help for my mental problems and my parents have always dismissed me whenever I try to open up to them.

With the problem severity and frequency increasing I'm honestly scared for my well being and the well being of those around me.

84,"It took everything I had to call and make the appointment.
It was with this company that you call and your workplace gives you a certain number of session. So I asked for a psychologist at the end of November and got my first appointment yesterday.

She asked what brought me there so I said I was having a hard time dealing with a breakup of my ex boyfriend that I’ve been with for 2.5 years. I say we were talking about kids and a house and it’s hard to let all of that go.

She told me things like « you’re still young » and « it’s not like it was a long relationship ». She told me I would be better off with another man. And when I told her about something really important, I felt judged. I felt like my feelings were not taking seriously.

Plus, she was yawning and rubbing her eye most of the session and I felt like I was bothering her. 

People of Reddit, I am disappointed. I am sad, and I am mad. I have wasted my time and now I am in an even worse place than I was before.

It took me courage to actually call to make an appointment and that’s what I get for doing it?

I feel so weird. It’s like I can’t call to get another professional because I am scared of ever talking to anyone ever again. It’s 4;16am and I feel like crying and I regret saying everything I did and I am afraid I’ll be judged and the subject of her jokes to her family!

I want to know what I, as the youngest member of my family, can do to provide support for her. Should I research any triggers, be made aware of things I should or shouldn’t say?

When people do go into depth about some of their experiences with mental health however, I always feel my thoughts are far less worse than anyone else's, so surely I don't need help?

In fact, if they don't seek help **or** do some self-helping, they might not live for even 15 years I fear (the parent is about in their mid-fifties).

Having to stand by that kind of self-destructive behaviour is then extremely stressful for me - especially when the issues have existed for as long as I can remember, and as a byproduct of them I've developed deep issues of my own (""hunger"" for love, complex PTSD symptoms etc.).

This topic, however, is a strict taboo in our family *and* the parent has sort of made it clear that even the pushing of others doesn't really help. Behind the issues there are *even deeper* mental blocks, but the parent is (seemingly) unwilling to go talk about those anywhere.

I know that I can't really do anything to fix the situation (or the parent, for that matter, them being an adult and therefore responsible for their own life). Still, their constant issues and their subsequent ongoing ""problem-talk"" is stressing me out so much that I've reduced the amount of visits to my parents because I can't take the stress (additionally, I don't really have anything concrete to talk with them most of the time).

It applies to every aspect of life.  This is not a first-time idea that positive or positive success is essentially necessary.  Rather it is true that this is the same squeeze of human experience from hunting era.  Evolutionist

Charles Darwin also said about the species that survive after the conflict, that the same species always lives.  Leads ahead which has a positive attitude to it.  Overall, the point to say is that technical suggestions for success can be many if found for logic and for.  But in some form or the other they all come to this conclusion.

If you want to be successful, then you have to be positive, usually from our childhood, we come to hear some such jokes and grow up listening to them, that the positive could not be included in our nature.

The longer the sheet is, the longer the foot should spread, but just think that the charger can be increased.  If our legs are large then it is on the long side, then why should we not arrange a sheet according to it, why should our feet take the code, after listening 10 runs or even if it is impractical and alert.  It may seem necessary for Ne but in reality it is very negative or negative thing.  We can never grow up in the midst of such representative thinking.

**ALWAYS LAUGH LIKE A CHILD**

The days of childhood are very beautiful, every moment of this childhood is full of energy, away from pain and stress, even while climbing in the dream world.  If you also want to live a healthy happy, interesting and easy life away from fight fights, mental stress and illnesses, then follow our advice, fill color in the life of 35 years or 55, which is childhood.

Remember, when you felt bad about anything in childhood, you used to speak openly and do not press anything in your heart.  They used to ask for their rights, even if they used to fight with the front in a fight, then after 2 minutes you used to play with the same person, there was no match in the mind.  There were no complaints.  But now there are thousands of things and complaints that you keep in mind

**BEHAVE LIKE A CHILD AND MAKE LAUGHING IT IMPROVE OUR HEALTH**

But now there are thousands of things and complaints that you keep in mind.  Knees do not say to the front, but they remain inside.  If someone feels bad, they get hurt.  You get angry at small things and from that flame of anger, you keep getting pained yourself for years, in this way you yourself harm your health.

Cracks in the relationship and the burden of suffering goes on the mind for years and continues to live. It is better to start taking other harsh things like children.  Always keep your mind clean, watch the children carefully.

He laughs at small things.  Strangers smile even on seeing this.  But after growing up, our laughter gets lost somewhere.  We smile thinking and laughing.  We have to try and laugh.  In any park in the morning you will definitely find a group of people who try to raise their hands together and laugh together.  So that the lungs can get full oxygen and health can be good, but this forceful laughter cannot give the benefit that comes naturally from inside us. A real smile is necessary which reaches beyond the lips to the eyes.  That will give relief.

If you want to make life beautiful, then you have to laugh openly.  Never skimp on laughing.  Have you ever noticed the children, they speak what they think is on their mind, they are on the tongue, they do not get involved in the store's equations or the claims of overtaking others.

They do not wear falseness.  If you adopt the qualities of simplicity, then you will get a life of happiness and respect without asking.  At the same time, our mindset changes when we grow up, then we keep remembering the same things because of which we have been hurt or humiliated.  We start having negative feelings towards some people.

In this way our mind is filled with negative energy.  Which has a direct impact on health.  To avoid all this, it is important that you keep yourself away from negative thinking and negativity around you, make a habit of looking good in everything.  This will bring peace of health and energy in your life, forgive others and keep your heart clear. Keep this goal of life, you will always be happy and happy.",07Jan2020,1
104,"I relive all the terrible episodes of my life pratically every night. I'm a quitter. I run away. I don't know who I am. I can't breathe around people even in dreams. I'm hurt, physically and mentally. Nearly every night I dream of having to pack my shit and carry really heavy luggage around to the next place. I'm always all alone, on the road, meet people that hurt me or offer their friendship and then they're gone. All the failure and dull pain haunts me no matter asleep or awake. I hate going to sleep so much because that means I have to face another day of despair but I still don't wake up from the dreams. Sometimes when I nearly wake up I know I'm still dreaming and I close my eyes so hard and hide myself under the pillow so I can continue living in the dreaded past.

I wish that whenever I'd actually do that, I wouldn't get floored again as soon as some setbacks hit. I wish I could find something to do that actually feels like I'm doing something purposeful. Maybe I just need to accept that studying in college isn't for me, that I can find friends outside of those places too, that just doing things for the world is always better than getting a piece of paper that proves your worth. But I can't help feeling that I'll lose the opportunity to study while I'm still young, that I'll get the discount. I live in a country with a culture that values achievement, where you're basically looked down on when you choose not to study. I'm a smart guy, really, so it feels really bad when people won't recognise that when you can't show them a diploma. I may have problems but if I see the sense and the purpose in what I do, I'll do the absolute best I can to get it done. It's only when I don't see it, that I just don't want to do it anymore.

(Highschool) I'd get suspended Interschool suspension all that and as long as I made someone laugh I'd not care even when I got into fights I'd mock the other person and make jokes about them to make my friends laugh when they were watching I didn't care what happened to me I failed all my classes every year (I past 2 classes from Year 7-9) I wasn't held by for god knows why I've never really got scared I used to get home sick when I was around 10 but that faded as I got older I can count the times Ive gotten mad on one hand in my life I never actually expressed or experienced my own emotions I didnt care for my own personal growth only time I looked in the mirror was when I brushed my teeth which was rare or showered I'd not tell anyone if I was hurt or go to the doctors I ripped my nose open and arms/knees in 2011 and stuck into my house avoiding my parents untill one came in and asked if I was hungry and they rushed me to the hospital which I didnt want to go and said I was fine I later found out I required several stitches and had a infection due to somthing I cant remember. so I cared not for my health/emotions up untill 2012 which is when something happened that I can't remember to this day which changed me I lost all my social skills I couldn't talk to anyone I stopped riding bikes/hanging with friends being the class clown I could only talk to someone if I knew them years I could talk if someone spoke to me completely fine i wasn't nervous or anything i cant really explain what it was like but I couldnt start the conversation  the school sent me to a school therapist who said I was ""borderline"" to this day I still don't know what that means but I was kicked out of my new school due to my attendance (2014) after that everyone I grew up with and everyone I had met seemed to have abandoned me and to this day I haven't heard from 99.9% of them theyd ask my brother where I was and all that fake shit but never asked for my number or for me to meet up for about 1 year I went through alot of emotions that I feel like I had bottled up for my entire life but I feel like it changed me in a good and (bad) way I went back to doing MMA n going to the gym to the point it was all i did the next year 2015 I went back to another school and I sort of changed again to another person it was like letting out all of my emotions made me ""better"" for myself but I now have this sense of superior I don't care for anyones opinion even if it would benefit me people I cared for my entire life untill the end of 2014 died and the feeling I had for the situation was like the feeling you have before your born there is and was nothing everyone around me was crying at the funerals and telling me how im holding it together but in my head I was wondering when I could leave not caring even to this day I have that feeling about everyone but myself I do not believe I've ever loved anyone nor If Ive ever said it to anyone including my parents but skip a few years and this has only now been amplified  to the point where people have noticed and think I'm a ""socipath"" which I don't believe I am I dont care for others nor seem to have any empathy I manipulate everyone, I lie but I lie in a way that i tell the truth but use word play to trick them so its if i'm caught I can play it off as they just didn't understand what I was saying I know I'm superior I think people who require confidence are weak same as nervous nus I'm told I'm the most relaxed person they have ever met I do not experience social anxiety, anxiety, depression I somewhat understand depression but when it comes down to it I'll tell people there weak for it even know in my head I know its not about that I can understand when I do things that are wrong but I don't have an emotional response to the understanding of the wrong I don't apologie to people if I hurt them unless I'm sorry which i'm not sorry for the things I do because I believe I'd not be true to myself for such due to the fact that I did it so is stand by what I did even knowing it could help the situation but I do believe I could care about someone which is one of the reasons I don't think I'm a sociopath + they say they dont have emotions my natural state is happy I do get annoyed but only at myself if I lose or something not really at anything else I've never been in a serious relationship and I dont care for casual sex I smile when girls approach me instantly knowing who is worth my time and not I'm also never really bored I also seem to like going into town to walk around for no other reason but just for people to see me but that might be the fact that I peaked when I grew facial hair I have no worries or anything never stressed I believe stressed people are sort of just mentally weak I heard sociopaths fake emotions but due to the way I see my self I don't care to I have no filter and I dont care who hears what I say i've been fired several times due to it and simply had no emotional response just applied at others and went on with my day the only desires I have is for others to see me not caring if I never see them again just aslong as they have seen me and I know they've thought about me I believe I'm beyond confidence to the point that I talk very loudly everywhere and even bait people into fighting me knowing I can beat them due to my years of MMA experience (I'm beyond cocky af If you cant tell) I've had several people tell me that I walk and act like I own the place I'm also a perfectionist for my own looks/dressing I never pay for anything I either steal it or convince others to buy me stuff I've lived off others for years now with barely spending my own money and on my childhood it wasn't bad I think mine was really good only ""negative"" side I could think of is my parents fighting every day and I dont believe they like each other and there only together to not deal with the hassle of devorce I've never seen them care for each other nor do i believe they cared for me seeing I have 0 memorys of them actually doing/being apart of anything impactful to my life but they have/are with my brothers my brothers are the opposite of me they care deeply for everything but they were also raised in a different state and both 10 years older then me the photos of them back then makes them seem happily married and there are photos of my brothers around there housr but no one seems to have photos of me which never bothered me but might have influenced me deep down Wwhen I was a kid without me knowing also I've never really been afraid of anything as a kid when people tried to scare me I wouldnt react like it was relevant to me but now I'm still not really afraid of anything to my knowledge apart from the feeling of not being incontrol I dont drink/do drug anymore due to it not letting me being incontrol 100% which is what I'd say to my knowledge being the only thing I'm 'afraid' of I don't know if I'm afraid of it but I believe I am due to never not being in control since I changed if that makes sense I was raised in a ghetto place In australia but I lived in the not so ghetto part I hang out in the ghetto suburbs and basically lived with people in ""gangs""  dealing drugs and all that from a very young age up untill 2014 my brothers didn't do that which may explain my numbness to violence due to being in ""my first"" gang fight when I was 12 I wasn't standing fighting people but I was hitting people with poles and shit while they fought I was involved with bikies and all that from young age aswell seen people get stabbed/ cut off things with machettes guns pulled/held on people even on myself when I was 14 I've never thought about suicide or cutting myself I think people who kill themselves are weak and pathetic I love every aspect of life the good and 'bad' I say 'bad' as in I dont have anything bad in my life for years now So to end this rambling If anyone has any advice on what mental ""disorder"" I have or could possibly or if I should seek ""professional"" help let me know I'm not sure if any of that made sense or was clear but I find it difficult to explain emotions or even identify them thanks.
(TLDR 1st one btw) ""I lost emotions from somthing that I have no memory of and ever since then I lost all my friends/family and gained then relost emotions that made me into a ""bad"" person but I understand whats good n bad but aslong as it doesn't negatively affect me  I don't care.

Any advice or help on how I can overturn this situation would be greatly appreciated as I am worrying every minute of everyday that she will be gone. Bit of context...

Every day she is calling me saying she wants this life to end and how it is only constant pain and suffering for her. Luckily in the last few days I have been off work with flu so have been able to be on the phone to her for most of the day. However, anytime I try to suggest advice or support services such as advice helplines, support groups in her area and even offer to pay for private therapy she simply tells me that it is not worth the time/effort/money as she doesn't want any of those things to force ""fake happiness"" but simply not be here so her pain can end. 

She has had a history of depression for the most part of the \~5 years (caused in part by family deaths and the suicide of her ex-boyfriend, which was very hard to deal with for her) that I have known her but it has not been this bad until the last couple of weeks following Christmas/new years. In the past she has received counselling and benefited from it but since moving back to her mums house recently she has gotten worse and is basically refusing all help and explicitly telling me it won't be long left until she is gone because she can't deal with the pain of ""being forced to live this life."" 

I spend every second of every day in a constant state of worry that she is going to do it and I really am pleading with anyone out there if you have any advice on how to help someone suicidal who is unwilling and unreceptive to any help. If anyone wants anymore information/context on her life/the situation I am happy to provide this if it will help with helping her.

Thank you. 

All the best to you all.",07Jan2020,1

116,"My (26F) mental health is ruining my relationship. Anxiety is something that I've always dealt with but managed fairly well with medication. I started dating this guy (24M) a few years ago and he was aware of my anxiety issues from the get-go and was always fairly supportive of me in that regard. We ended up getting pregnant and I stopped taking all my anxiety medications during pregnancy. This was a really hard time for me because not only was my anxiety not being managed, I was extremely hormonal and insecure. We fought a lot throughout the pregnancy but ended up working through most of our problems and staying together. I was sure that after the baby was born things would get better because I could get back on medication and so on. However, I developed very bad postpartum depression and have pretty much spiraled out of emotional control the past two months our son has been born. My PCP put me on some antidepressants and I know that they can take a while to get into your system and have an effect. In the mean time, I have been following the advice of some of my peers and have been very open about my feelings with him. Mostly of insecurity and isolation. Every time I bring it up I try to be as non-confrontational as possible and just open a safe line of communication. I am aware that my feelings are not always rational, but that is part of having a mental illness in  my opinion. So when I do communicate these feelings to my partner, he basically degrades/dismisses me I feel like. He tells me that it's not his fault that I feel that way, there's not always something wrong, if i know that these feelings are irrational then why do I bring them up, he just wants to come home and relax, I'm overreacting/being dramatic, etc... I feel like I get no where and I feel like things will never get better because he is not understanding at all.

So my best friend (23M) has been experiencing what I believe is a high functional depression for a couple of years now, but even before that, as early as we were 16 years old, while he felt generally good, he would always casually make comments about how he ""feels"" or ""knows"" that he won't live to be old age and how he will definitely die young. He has no physical health problems, or any real physical health concern to back it up, and everytime I ask him why he thinks so, his only ""argument"" is ""I just know"". I have tried talking to him multiple times, trying to convince him to see a therapist, to get help, but he just he won't do it because he says he just doesn't care and refuses to do anything. He also often puts himself down, any given chance in the conversation he will use to make negative comments about himself, and when I try to bring him up or give him any compliment he will accuse my of lying and become defensive. Even though I'm always there for him, whenever we get into a disagreement, he will accuse me of not caring about him and there's nothing I can do to prove it to him that I do. He also gets defensive and cold every time I try to give him an advice or try to help when he's complaining (which is alot). About his comments concearning death, I have asked him multiple times is he suicidal and everytime he says no, that he won't kill himself, but something else will and he just ""knows"" he won't live long. He uses any given opportunity to say this. Yesterday, I was playing with Snapchat filters and took a picture with a filter on that makes you look old. I sent the picture to him playfully, and told him to try the filter (I also recommended him to try the baby filter and other filters as well before), to which he replied that he won't do it because he is scared of that, looking old or whenever, and again said how he won't live to be that age anyway.

Over the past 6-7 months, my mental condition has been affecting me massively. It's gotten worse as the weeks and months have gone by, to the point where it's nearly got me fired from work and kicked out of college.

To start off, I didn't know I had depression &amp; anxiety, until I was diagnosed with the symptoms from when my therapist told me. This happened suddenly, when I suffered a second brain hemorrhage four years ago and the changes it brought to my physical health and my personality in the future. About six-seven months ago, my current ex-girlfriend broke up with me and that was when I was at my lowest. I just didn't function in the way that I should have.

I'm always stressing myself out with college work because I'm always trying my best, but it's never enough. Also including work itself, where I talk to customers but I'm not fully focused, which nearly resulted in me getting fired.

I wanted to see if anyone could offer some insight into a decision I am making. I have previously been on an SSRI (for about a year) and have struggled with mental health pretty much my entire life after my fathers suicide when I was a child. 

I currently do not have health insurance and am finishing up a masters degree so I am about to begin an unpaid internship and have just moved back into my mothers house with her new husband in a new city  I have been living with my boyfriend for the last 5 years, and in recent months we have been fighting so much that I’ve have very strongly considered leaving the relationship. I’m now conflicted about that, but all of my things are now relocated so the option stands, but now the thought of ending it is so painful that I burst into tears constantly. 

I also do jot handle general change well, such as the move that I just completed to a much bigger city than I am used to. 

I guess what I need an opinion on is this, I am crying constantly. I am upset constantly and my internship starts tomorrow. I found an app where I could get the same SSRI I had before, but coming off of it last time was a nightmare so I’m hesitant to start it again. Can anyone offer some perspective?

I have a fear of large waters, and in general standing at the base of large things like skyscrapers, or idk bridges, cruise ships...

I'm currently unmedicated. I have to go on a cruise ship next week for a 6 day work conference. I think it's too late to address a walk-in clinic for help and I don't have access to a family physician. I am in Canada so finances don't matter as hard.

I also have MS so getting medication on such short notice is very unlikely. I think the DR would have to know what reacts well or ill with my disease. I should have known about this trip at least 6 weeks ago but :( I didn't. I came to the assumption that getting on an  ssri would take too long and benzos are addictive. I have no idea what else is used to treat symptoms of phobias.

I'm gonna take some valerian root and melatonin with me. I'm so scared of the ship. The impending death feels have already started and I'm sweating at night thinking about it. The 5000 other people with me, and anyone with OR without a long term disease can simply get people'd out. I get it often as I work from home.

I have always been of strong character and hard working, people who know me would say I'm life and soul, funny, intelligent and strong.

I cocoon myself in my duvet and wrap a pillow around my head and try to sleep as long as possible. I can wake momentarily and remember my dreams quite vividly (they are always enjoyable happy dreams) I can then just remember the dream and slip back into them. 

It's like I'm addicted to my dreams and as soon as I wake I try and try to enter back into that world. Sometimes I'm successful but after 12 hours sadly I am in the real world. 

I am in danger of losing my job because of this now which worries me even more. It's quite apparent that I must be depressed. I have so much to be grateful for but it appears the big D has taken over my life. Can I regain my normal life? This is the first time I've ever spoke about it to anyone, probably the wrong place to seek help, I have no idea.

128,"Sorry if this post doesn't make much sense. I'm in such a dark place mentally right now and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't even know where to start or how I should type this so sorry again if this is all over the place. 

I just feel like I've fucked myself up permanently due to my stupidity. All I've done for the past seven years is waste precious time playing video games and ignoring the rest of the world around me. I ended up dropping out of school because of this. I have no social skills, no talents, no skills, nothing all due to my incompetence.

· Failed 7th grade because of my gaming addiction. I never studied/did homework. I went to court for truancy because I skipped school so many days.

· Ended up dropping out 9th grade with no good reason other than to play video games all day. One of my biggest regrets.

· Never bothered trying to get my GED because I thought I was too dumb and didn't want to embarass myself

· Despite dropping out never tried getting a job out of fear. Never been employed. 

· Completely isolated myself from friends and family for years because of self-hatred, shame, anxiety, and guilt.

I'm 19 years old and I feel like I'm fucked up beyond repair. I wasted the best years of my life doing absolutely nothing. All this time I should've spent creating amazing memories, friendships, and experiencing the world and learning who I was and wanted to do with my life was all wasted. And all I'm left with is regret. It's almost like I've been on auto-pilot the past 9 years and I'm trying extremely hard to wake up. But waking up means acknowledging and accepting that I've wasted all this time. I try to move on but it's so fucking hard. I feel stuck like there is no way out of this chaos. And it's all my fault.

129,"It's that time of year again in Canada. The notorious 'Let's Talk' day is fast approaching. Supposedly Bell has raised over 100 million since it began but here's why I HATE it:

1. Campaign is effecively a viral advertisement for Bell.
2. I've never once actually seen use of that donation money or where it goes. I've never thought to myself ''Thank God for Bell's Let's Talk"" while I was sitting in the emergency room hallway for three days in crisis, multiple times, waiting for a psych floor spot to open. Have you ever been to the Bell Treatment Centre? How about The Bell Mental Health Wing of your local hospital? The Bell Mental Health Crisis House? Did you get a grant from Bell to attend therapy? Did Bell ever cover the cost of your meds? I'm sure the money does go somewhere, but if they're going to shamelessly stick their name all over the campaign, they should shamelessly stick their name all over their donations so I know excactly that the money is being put to good use. FFS they should use most of it for mental health inpatient beds, crisis house spots, hire some mental health professionals, etc... actual boots on the ground treatment access. Apparently there's a mental health entreprenurial grant program though that Bell started (F off Bell. We need better treatment not a business loan).
3. The whistleblower story a few years ago about how working at Bell is a toxic environment.
4. Overemphasis on stories of Anxiety and Depression. Yes they're the most common mental health diagnoses and they're serious, but if you really want to reduce stigma, have people share their stories of the most stigmatized diagnoses. We all know there's much more stigma for example surrounding Schizophrenia and Dissociative Identity Disorder than Anxiety and Depression.

130,"Now, before you dismiss this as a flex, I actually don't know what to do with myself if I don't excercise for at least an hour and a half a day, even if I'm sore. 

A little background, I've recently quit watching porn for good (hopefully) and it's been about a month since I've quit and since then it's been hard for me to adapt. What I've realized is that I enjoy running and going to the gym more than I've ever in my life to the point where I'm almost late for some of my classes because I will go to the gym in between some of my classes. 

I'm also starting to feel even more lonely than I have before even though I feel my confidence has greatly improved. Is my body trying to compensate for the lack of stimulation which porn provided? 

I've had several injuries in the past and I'm worried that I may take this too far. I don't want to rest. I've gone to the gym almost everyday for the past 3 weeks with little rest and I always want more. How can I stop feeling this way?

133,"TW for self-harm, depression and suicide ideation. Also sorry this is so long.

This winter holiday has been rough on me to put it bluntly. Hell, the whole of last year was too. I was stressed out of my mind, scared about the direction my life was going in, my self-esteem was at the lowest it had ever been at the time and I started relying on cutting myself to cope with my feelings. I was worried about my exams and my future at university and that continued until my exams actually happened and I was suddenly more worried about not getting into my universities. 

During the revision period from Jan-Apr I got scared enough to go to a doctor about the state of my mental health. I originally started cutting in places I could cover up but as it became a more impulsive habit I was doing it anywhere and everywhere I could for the rush, the feeling that wasn't just emptiness and self hate and worry. My doctor ended up telling my mum and she was made aware that I had a suicide plan as a last resort of sorts if everything failed and it got me the motivation to quit. So, for a while I did. 

And things got better, I got a girlfriend, came to terms with my sexuality and things about myself I wasn't comfortable with and started joining in more. And then when I got into my uni I was the happiest I had been in forever, I felt like I finally did something worthwhile, something my parents could be proud of. 

But I relapsed about a month into my life on campus, and because of the availability of cigarettes and alcohol in my area I started obsessively chain-smoking and drinking to stop thinking about it all on top of cutting. I stopped going out and put in the bare minimum in my work. Then the winter break started, I was thrown a tonne of coursework and left to go back to my parent's house for a few weeks and I was just so drained from everything I had no motivation to even touch it.  It didn't help that my girlfriend and I broke up and I felt distant from family the entire time. I still handed in something, but nothing worthwhile and I was scarily ok with it, I didn't care when usually I'd be miserable and disappointed about it but it barely phased me. 

Then New Year rolls around and I get so drunk at a friends house that they find me carving into my arm with a nail I'd found somewhere in their house and now many many close and old friends know that I'm not ok when I'd told them that I was doing fine and I hate myself for it. I barely remember anything but see the scratches and cuts and some concerning messages and want to just end it. 

So instead I start trying to heal, I stop cutting and smoking and manage it through a sobreity app that counts the days. I'm trying to manage my drinking but today I fucked up with a deadline on my coursework because they put the wrong date on and I misread it and because of the way they mark it I'm probably getting a zero for 50% of my module because the reason is so pathetic and stupid they won't believe me if I tell them. 

And now it feels like everything's gonna crash, the urge to cut was the worst it's been, I'm now more anxious about the whole thing more than ever because I don't want to fail and now the department probably thinks I just don't give a fuck because of the state of my work recently and it kills me. 

I haven't relapsed yet and when I get back I'll probably try to talk to a doctor on campus or something and see if there's anything worth doing but I just can't believe I fucked up already, and at this point I'm pretty certain if I do anything less than perfect I'm on thin ice and might not get accepted for a second year. 

That's pretty much it. Sorry the structure is terrible I just needed to vent this stuff since I can't turn to anyone on campus rn.",07Jan2020,1

For example, I recently passed the cutoff in an exam that placed me in one of the ""scholar"" batches that are made for good students and receive more resources.

I had some thoughts for him but was living my life. I was depressed a lot and to be honest  as much as I loved him, talking about how depressed we were didnt help me at all. I was trying to live a more positive life and be able to feel happiness again.

Anyway, I was bored on friday and I went on his facebook (I had unfollowed him due to negative and depressive stuffs), only to see ""remembering"" and a bunch of posts of his friends saying they miss him, they love him and wished he was still here. I'm super confused and talked to his sister to find out he killed himself on january 31 last year.

I feel guilty cause I didnt really help or listen to him as much as I could have, and didnt actually think it was this bad...

140,"I'm not sure when it started. What I do know is that I've felt like this for a long time.

To summarise, I've just felt *empty.* Like I'm just a husk. The fact that I can put on such a convincing smile, and a cheerful tone of voice, concerns me. The days just feel the same. Get up-&gt;go to school-&gt;go home-&gt;pass the time-&gt;go to sleep-&gt;repeat. Even the things I liked have become tiresome. Sometimes, I spend hours *deciding what* to do to spend my time, instead of actually doing something. I can't even find the motivation to try something new.

Sometimes I just feel like crying, and I don't know why. I just *feel* like it.

I've always been an introverted person, finding interaction with others to be *very* tiresome. The only moments when this doesn't  happen is when I interact with my friends (the only 2 that I have), but lately, even then, I have my doubts.            

When I laugh, when I smile, am I *really* happy? Or have I just gotten so good at lying that I can trick *myself*? Whenever I laugh or smile, it doesn't feel whole. I feel like there's something missing, like staring at a child's half finished drawing. There should be *something*, but there isn't...

Paradoxically, I am very good at speaking in public. I have participated in various contests (even on a nacional level) based around public speaking. I don't know why or how I am like this. I dont know how I can switch between a vocal, charismatic persona, and my ""regular"" one.

""Which is the ***real*** me?"" I wonder...

I spend most of my time daydreaming, but I don't know if I should call it that. I create all of these stories in my mind. I create characters, settings, entire worlds. In these stories, I am God. I can freely change each and every detail. In my mind, I feel like I can make a difference. But, despite this, these stories are only in my mind. I would like to pursue them further, maybe place them onto paper, but my doubts pile up. ""It's not good enough"", ""No one will like it"", etc.

I feel like a **coward** for not doing things, and an **idiot** for trying and failing.

In the end, I feel like my feelings of self-doubt are what destroy me more.

Ever since we got married and moved because of the military it’s gotten worse. Last night he told me that he hears a female voice (that he calls his demon) in his head telling him to hurt me &amp; do bad things to me. He says he can’t control himself and feels guilty and cries after he does anything that the voice tells him. And that it takes over his body and drains his energy. For some reason this only happens at night when he’s in and out of sleep. He also says he doesn’t know what’s real, he’s suicidal and says he doesn’t care what happens to himself because it’s not really him. He’s also had sleep paralysis in the past and nightmares about his childhood.

I’m honestly really scared because He listens to the voice and it has control over him, it keeps me up all night. I have no one to go to and he made me promise to not tell anyone. I’m scared to say anything to anyone in case he hurts himself, he cares a lot about his reputation.

With him being in the military I’m not sure what kind of help he can even get for this without getting kicked out.

148,"I was never diagnosed with BDD, but I suspect I do suffer from it. I am diagnosed with anorexia, I will forever hate how fat my body is. But I am also extremely preoccupied with my facial features, and it feels like less to do with wanting to be skinnier and more to do with just hating some of my natural facial structure. Whenever I look in the mirror I want to cry. The thought that this is the person I have to live as until I die is devastating, and it's even worse to think that it's not something I can change (unlike my anorexia, where I actually feel like I can have control over how skinny I am and knowing that I can actually appear as my goal weight one day if I put in enough effort).

The only way to change it is plastic surgery. I don't want 50 different face jobs, I just want to slim my jaw a little, slim my nose a little and maybe plump my lips a little. I say little for everything because that's really what I mean, I don't want any dramatic changes, I know that probably isn't the best way to gather info but when I use apps like facetune for example I barely use any sliders at all and the sliders I do use, I do so very minimally, and the results make me so happy and wish I would actually achieve that face in real life.

My question is, with my situation, will getting plastic surgery actually make me feel better about myself, or will it be a waste of money because I still won't feel like I'm pretty enough afterwards?

I have had anxiety for about 8 years. After my GP was no longer able to help, and I developed severe depression, I saw a psychiatrist in April. She diagnosed me with BP NOS. I have a family history and am knowledgeable of the disorder but it didn’t feel right. Tried some meds and some of the antipsychotics did help.

Saw a new psychiatrist in October who thinks it’s just GAD and Depression, not BP. Last week my counselor recommended I get screened for ADHD. So I’m back to the doctor in a couple weeks for an evaluation.

I’m grateful I have the support of healthcare providers, especially since that’s not the case for anyone. But anxiety meds haven’t been helping and I am desperate for Ana curare diagnosis.

He gets frustrated immediately and says he doesn't care and asks again, ""Where are you going?"". I asked him what exactly does he mean by that. He rolls his eyes and walks away relieves a sigh of frustration and walks back to my car window. I asked him bluntly, if he is the parking attendant. He clinches his fist and puts it near my face.. and asks me again where am i going. I ask him if hes the parking attendant yes or no. He throws up his hands, forms the hand sign for choking towards me. He then tells me to go forward and talk to the other guy.

I became a ward of the state when I was 12 years old under the care of my maternal grandparents. I had court mandated therapy, but they never diagnosed me with anything so my grandma just thought I was going to be okay after a little opening up. She was wrong.

I never did well in school, it made me anxious. I've had so many bad experiences relating to school and other structured environments like it that I seem to always find a way to set myself up for failure just to get away from it. After college I jumped from job to job, abandoning ship when everything became to much. I was just hoping that the next place would be different and I would be happy.

Now I'm engaged, I have a great job and my wedding is literally 250 days away. Everything should be good right? Nothing has gotten better, my psychiatrist ordered a month leave from work to get used to meds and relax and it was working- I thought I was finally going to be okay. But now I'm back at work and I'm already right back where I was before my break.

My psychiatrist thinks quitting work would be best and my fiance says he can make it work- but I see the look on his face when we talk about him being the sole income. He's so worried. He says he cares more about me being okay and being happy, but I feel so guilty. I feel like I'm using him and I feel like others are going to think that too.

We're training our puppy to be my service animal and she does help- I just cant take her to work yet. And applying for disability is possible, but they almost always deny on the first try and take 6 months to do so. They also require a 6 month leave of no working.. which means no income. So that's going to be at least a year of one income with a wedding and two cars we have to pay for.

I want to do so many things like getting some plants for my room and do so many tiny things that would make me more happy but i never get to them. dont get me wrong, i DO HAVE TIME to do all that but the perceived energy i need to do those things is sooooo big. when i have 10 letters i open one, do whats needed and need  a break before i get to the next one.

i know my uncle feels the same. i talked to my mum about that and she told me she has the same struggle but not as bad as my uncle or me. she said she can handle it. but i feel like on the verge of giving up. its just one step away i dont get up in the morning or not opening the letters at all.

Is that in any way normal? Can i do anything against that?",07Jan2020,1
159,"As the title says, one of my parents has issues for which they're unable (or even unwilling) to seek treatment of any kind - even if those issues have started to treaten their health *. Actually, in the near past, they have started to sometimes (even) make death-related *extremely disturbing* jokes. In fact, if they don't seek help **or** do some self-helping, they might not live for even 15 years I fear (the parent is about in their mid-fifties).

Having to stand by that kind of self-destructive behaviour is then extremely stressful for me - especially when the issues have existed for as long as I can remember, and as a byproduct of them I've developed deep issues of my own (""hunger"" for love, complex PTSD symptoms etc.).

This topic, however, is a strict taboo in our family *and* the parent has sort of made it clear that even the pushing of others doesn't really help. Behind the issues there are *even deeper* mental blocks, but the parent is (seemingly) unwilling to go talk about those anywhere.

I know that I can't really do anything to fix the situation (or the parent, for that matter, them being an adult and therefore responsible for their own life). Still, their constant issues and their subsequent ongoing ""problem-talk"" is stressing me out so much that I've reduced the amount of visits to my parents because I can't take the stress (additionally, I don't really have anything concrete to talk with them most of the time).

*TL;DR* : The issues of a parent are so stressful to me that I'm forced to keep slight distance to them in order not to worsen my own situation...

160,"I suffer from a list of mental health issues... and sometimes they flare up and I get overwhelmed by everything. Lately it's a lot of anxiety and worry. I just can't seem to turn my mind off and let myself go worry free for a day, let alone a few hours. I worry myself sick and it's becoming very overwhelming. 

So I clam up. I haven't really talked to any of my friends or family. I worry they're mad a me for doing this, but the thought of reaching out to tell them, ""hey, sorry I'm distant, I just feel overwhelmed by talking to anyone right now. I'll definitely try to reach out once this mood has faded."" scares me. I know they say they understand. But I can't help but think they're secretly upset I don't talk to them. 

I mean I only have two friends I actually talk to and both live in different states than me. I talk to my siblings and parents often (but not in the last few weeks). My mom and in laws think I should get back on Facebook to make it easier to keep up with me, but I hate the platform. It causes a lot of triggers and I just don't like to go on it. 

I used to have more friends. I'm just not the type of person who enjoys texting or communication over the phone/internet. I like to have conversations in person and spend time with someone. This is hard because I move a lot due to my husband's job. I've made friends over the years, that I now don't talk to because I feel more comfortable having an in person, irl, relationship. I tend to disassociate when I only have communication over the phone or internet. Like they really aren't real. 

Problem with all this is, I have trouble making friends irl. I've lived in the same area for a year now and still don't have any friends here. Despite my many attempts at making new friends. I miss having friends and I am feeling overwhelmed with communicating over the phone because I just feel like it's not real. 

I wish I could learn how to make a friend... I've never been that great at it. And I'm at an age (26) where I don't fit into certain groups. Everyone my age doesn't have kids (I have a stepchild), is either just married or not in a serious relationship. I don't have a job due to many things. My hobbies are pretty boring to people my age and people who do share the same interests in things I like are a lot older than me. I am very socially anxious and talking to people stresses me out a lot. So it's hard to explain to a new potential friend that I'm not ignoring them, I'm just needing quiet time because I get overwhelmed easily. 

There are days I will sit in silence and not do anything because it helps me not feel so overstimulated. I'm technically doing it now! I've been sitting in my room quietly for an hour, and I really am not ready for anyone to be home. My stepchild gets out of school in a few hours and my husband will be home from work around the same time. It makes me a bit anxious because I'd rather just be alone for awhile. And this makes it hard to make friends. Most people I've met want to talk to you often, meet up weekly, or text daily. I don't really care for that and it causes me not to be able to keep friends.

It is extremely hard for me to consciously focus on something and allow myself to just be mindful in the present of what I'm looking at. I can't focus on an image as a whole and take in what's happening it's like i have tunnel vision looking through a scope of one part of the picture and I'm taken aback by all of it. I can't just simply look at something. I don't know if it has anything to do with overthinking or not because back then I had hyper focus because i wanted to enjoy things to the highest possible way. If i didn't appreciate something in all of it's entirety to the smallest things to the biggest then I truly don't enjoy it. Long story short i left that obsession of me in the past and i no longer think that at all, but am still dealing with the effects or what?!

Well, because of this movie, I thought it’d be a brilliant way for me to learn my emotions by color coding and picturing them as people.

175,"Hello. Im a usual 20 year old male, I don't drink, I don't smoke and I do a lot of sport to keep in shape. So Id call myself a healthy person. Id also like to excuse my grammatical mistakes in advance as English is not my first language.

But there is one thing that is making me question my sanity and how healthy I truly am. And that is the fascination with fires Ive had for my whole life but only started noticing lately. Let me tell you everything from the beginning. 

As a kid I always enjoyed when I got to put things on fire and that was fairy common as me and my family used to live on a farm where my granddad would burn things all the time, and out of 4 kids (there were for of us) Id always be the one volunteering to take care of the fire, and Id stand there and look at the fire, oh yes Id stand and not only look at it but even try to play with it (trying to put my shoe in and get it out super fast so it wouldn't catch on fire and games like those). It would be kinda ok if it were only those kind of games but it got to a point where id burn a stick and run after my other 3 cousins. Id also catch bugs and put them in a pan and fry them above the fire... I know it all sounds terrible. 

In recent years it has only been getting worse, while I stopped burning bugs and trying to burn my cousins there is another type of behaviour Ive been noticing. I would (and still do) buy a lighter and sit behind my desk and watch a movie, and I am a very energetic person I can never just sit and do nothing, I always have to be doing something. So the thing i'd do and still do is burn those little stick notes and then just stare at the fire. And the thing is that when im looking at the fire it makes me enter a trans like state where I just stare at it thinking nothing and I could do that for hours and hours. Its getting dangerous to the point where I once almost burned my apartment. I threw a still burning piece of sticky note in my trash can full of paper and it semi caught on fire. And I cant seem to be able to just stop doing it. 

Now Im coming to reddit as I dont want to assume anything and just seek professional help which is expensive and would also make everyone in my family know im going somewhere for my mental health (and that just doesnt put the best light on me does it). Also as far as im aware there is no cure for pyromania, so it doesnt make sense to start visiting the doctor to me.

I wondered whether or not I was being controlled at times by evil spirits and I would feel weird compelling feelings towards random things.

I'm only 15. Is there anything wrong with me? I feel I can't focus as well as I used to. I don't care about school anymore. Is this normal? Will it go? I've felt this way for a few months now, but I keep naively expecting it to just pass. 

Thanks.

194,"I’ve been a definite outcast for years now and I’m trying to figure out what I would classify as. Maybe I’m thinking too deep into this and I’m just a normal kid with lots of mental illnesses which have made me not normal, but I feel like there’s more to it. Maybe I’m just going crazy. I feel like a lot of people at school look at me like a sociopath but a lot of the traits of a sociopath I don’t have. 

I had a completely normal childhood and that was the last time I was truly content. I had a loving family and I was never a cool kid but lots of friends. There was no traumatic event that changed my but I changed. Starting around 12 years old I was diagnosed with ocd. This was the first time I endured suffering. I started losing friends and the brightness I had felt began to fade. Between age 12 and 16 I’ve been also diagnosed with tourette’s, depression, adhd, and social anxiety. The time between age 12 and now has basically been a cycle between feeling okay and then depressed over and over.

I’m now on day 3 of just water and the occasional vegetable just to make myself feel like I’m doing something to lose weight when I actually know I’m hurting myself.

196,"As the title says, one of my parents has issues for which they're unable (or even unwilling) to seek treatment of any kind - even if those issues have started to treaten their health *. Actually, in the near past, they have started to sometimes (even) make death-related *extremely disturbing* jokes. In fact, if they don't seek help **or** do some self-helping, they might not live for even 15 years I fear (the parent is about in their mid-fifties).

Having to stand by that kind of self-destructive behaviour is then extremely stressful for me - especially when the issues have existed for as long as I can remember, and as a byproduct of them I've developed deep issues of my own (""hunger"" for love, complex PTSD symptoms etc.).

This topic, however, is a strict taboo in our family *and* the parent has sort of made it clear that even the pushing of others doesn't really help. Behind the issues there are *even deeper* mental blocks, but the parent is (seemingly) unwilling to go talk about those anywhere.

I know that I can't really do anything to fix the situation (or the parent, for that matter, them being an adult and therefore responsible for their own life). Still, their constant issues and their subsequent ongoing ""problem-talk"" is stressing me out so much that I've reduced the amount of visits to my parents because I can't take the stress (additionally, I don't really have anything concrete to talk with them most of the time).

*TL;DR* : The issues of a parent are so stressful to me that I'm forced to keep slight distance to them in order not to worsen my own situation...

Im 17, currently prescribed Concerta for my ADD and Sertraline to help manage my severe Anxiety disorder.

Its gotten to the point where it sometimes stresses me to the point of having anxiety attacks, and i lay in bed unable to sleep thinking about it

200,"I just posted in r/suicidewatch, but I think this is a better place to ask the specific question of, has anyone ever been “normal” again after a situation like mine? Copy/pasted from the other subreddit:

Preface: I’m only 18 years old, live with my parents, am a fucked up person, and have had a fucked up life. This is going to be quite long, and I’m going to write everything just as it is.
Let’s start with the first part of my title: I am a piece of shit. I’ve been so horrible to my parents that my mom wrote a suicide note, blaming me, when I was 12 years old. I’ve verbally abused both her and my father, also physically abused them, attacked them. I’ve broken my mom’s bones in her fingers on several occasions. I’ve full-on punched both parents over the most trivial of things and that’s one reason I want to die. All I’ve done is harm. Now that I’m over 100 days without such an “incident” I want to die before I cause harm again. I don’t want to hurt people anymore.
My parents fucking feared me, maybe they still do, I don’t know but they should based on what a piece of shit I’ve been to them. This past will never go away, they’ll always remember and I’ll always remember. That’s another reason I want to die, no matter if I can actually change or not, it’s already happened. It’s too late to pretend to be “good” like I have been doing online. I love my parents, I know, no one will believe this. I love them but I have been so fucking unstable. I can’t risk putting them through my abuse again.
Apart from my behavior toward my parents, I’m a fuck up in other ways. My anxiety is so bad that I can’t even go out alone, I rarely talk to my friend if I dare call them that, I have no future goals, I’m fat, I binge eat, I harm myself... there’s too much to list. I’ve made a list before, with 88 things that show I’m fucked up. 88 reasons I should die.
Even if it weren’t for my abusive behavior, I still don’t think I could be helped. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, binge eating disorder, anxiety, PTSD from being raped, and self harming (I cut). I’ve already attempted suicide twice, been hospitalized five or six times for mental health issues. I’m stupid, too, I remember when I used to be smart but now I’m not anymore. There’s been too much in my life for me to handle and I think I’m ready to go. There is no future for someone like me, a former abuser with so many problems.
My mom and dad still love me, after all I’ve done. I don’t know why but the only thing that has stopped me from killing myself so far is that they would only be hurt (by me) more. How do they not hate me after all the abuse and hell I’ve put them through? I just want to die before I fuck up again.",07Jan2020,1

202,"First time on this sub but I needed to vent.

My fiance has diagnosed OCD and recently had to get new insurance (we're USA). He's miles better than he was a few years ago (he wasn't able to leave the house before) and I'd consider him incredibly high functioning but it still affects his day-to-day life and our relationship. We have been searching for MONTHS to find a clinic that could help him and also are trying to get him a prescription for his medication since his past psychiatrist is now out-of-network for him.

We have been warned by different MH providers that he needs to see a specialist bc his condition requires certain treatment, yet all the ones that are available are $200 - $700 a session and some want to have 3-5 sessions a week! That's somewhere in the neighborhood of $1200 a week if I'm being conservative (3x$400) which puts it at $4800 a month, close to $57,600 a year! That's more than our combined household income!! Granted, most say that they want to see ""short term"" results, but that looks like 8-16 weeks. So $9600 - $19,200. 

And the websites that say they have a sliding scale never do when we call them to confirm. The one clinic that does have a scholarship program said the process would take 1-2 weeks after they received his application. He submitted his application early November and they STILL haven't gotten back to us! He has called and emailed them several times and the person assigned to his application is apparently never there. 

I'm so fucking frustrated. All we want is literally some kind of treatment for his diagnosed disorder. His insurance really only has in-network MH providers for addiction. I'm sick to my stomach trying to understand how the system got to be this way. I could cry.",07Jan2020,1

205,"Hello all,

First off, I want to say this story will be somewhat graphic just for transparency. 

This is my first time posting on reddit (21M) and as of late something from my childhood seems to have been uncovered. First I'll explain what I have remembered. So, weirdly enough this memory has been coming together piece by piece over the last couple of weeks. 

The first piece was remembered while I was sitting in a movie theater watching the new Star Wars. For some reason, I suddenly remember being a young child (cannot recall what age), laying on my stomach on my couch in the living room that I grew up in and still live in to this day. Then I remembered my dad walking in and climbing on top of me, pinning my arms to the side of my body and holding me down. Then I remember him essentially humping me (I can recall feeling his penis in between my butt cheeks). I felt trapped and extremely unsettled and began attempting to free myself from his grasp and calling out for him to stop. This was all I could remember at this time. I experienced a panic attack in the movie theater with my heart pounding and I began feeling extremely light headed. I was terrified of what I had just remembered. 

Then, today, I was driving, and suddenly remembered more. I could hear my dad giggling as he did whatever he did to me. I also remember when I was free from his grasp looking at him, his face flush red and a weird smile on his face, and quickly moving so that I was sitting upright, feeling powerless and extremely small. This led me to begin crying profusely in my car while I was driving. 

Recalling this memory has had me feeling so terrible lately, I am shaking as I write this. Firstly because I do not know if what I am remembering is even true. Another thing that bothers me about this whole scenario is that I now cannot look my dad in the eye and feel like he is a monster for what he did to me and acting like nothing ever happened all these years. I never once thought my dad to be that type of person and have been close to him throughout my life, but admittedly always felt much more comfortable around my mom. 

I do not know what to do. I feel like there is still a part of this story that I cannot remember. Should I tell my mom? Should I seek professional help? I'm really struggling with this and feel extremely lost. Any advice someone might have would be much appreciated.",07Jan2020,1

207,"I feel like I have nowhere else to put this so, I’m just putting this out here, to get it off of me I guess, cause I just don’t want to hold it in anymore, almost my entire life has been spent in suffering for no real reason that I can find other than being “born with depression” according to my doctors, which I’m not sure is even entirely possible, or if the meant something else, I seemed like from a young age I was very mentally aware yet disconnected from reality, I could see and comprehend things the other kids could while I struggled with things they could do,

For example I could never learn like anyone else, and while I know that’s not necessarily a bad thing it made me feel so alienated from the rest of the kids that I refused to get a tutor cause I didn’t want to be different, but I could always read peoples intentions or emotions like a book, a lot of emotions actually physically looked like colours sometimes, other times I could see more of a shift in stance, like the way someone was standing or sitting or looking, and I guess I got a taste of a little to much for my own good and I couldn’t stop seeing these colours and movements, I could only see what people really thought or felt, it was horrible, I only ever saw a despairing grey hang from my mother and a terrifying red rage from my father, 

I’m the oldest of three siblings, I have two little sisters, for some odd reason, my dad was excessively hard on me compared to them, almost like he expected everything from me and nothing of them, and while I don’t hate my sisters for this, I fantasize of killing my father in cold blood sometimes, sometimes I’m laughing and smiling at the sight of it, other times it makes me feel like I’m the scum of the earth and I’m a complete failure, 

Dealing with my depression on top of my abusive father doubled down on the mental illnesses and caused me to develops severe anxiety, ptsd and a panic disorder, and I think it’s cause more and more as I get older, I’m feeling more and more devoid of emotion, almost absolute nothingness, it’s horrible, I don’t feel real, reality doesn’t feel real, I can’t describe what it’s like to feel the pain of not feeling any pain but I promise you it’s nothing like what you’d think, and it’s all happening because of me, because my dad convinced me that emotions are for the weak boys or the girls, not for the men, and I was to be a man, but I was a really, really, really sensitive kid, And so I got nothing but punishment, and eventually this caused my to hate my own emotions, every time I felt like o was gonna cry because I was sad I would lock myself in a room and beat myself until I stopped crying, I remember being in unnaturally violent rage all the time as a kid, I would talk back to teachers or authority figures and start fights with them, some even got physical, I actually instigated a fight between me and a teacher, a fckin teacher, I was in the 1st grade when I got into my first fight, the kid was hurt so bad he was in the hospital for a really long time (not sure how long it was a long time ago) for stuff like a concussion, broken ribs and even a broken shin bone, and this was as a first grade kid, and I’ve always been a pretty good athlete I was the star athlete of my elementary school and I was on a national rock climbing team for 6 years, this gave me a massive fear of myself, what if I get to angry and loose control? I’ve gotten black out angry before, on multiple occasions, only now my body is actually significantly trained, I’m terrified of doing something I can’t take back, and the worst thing is, I hate fighting people, I mean for god’s sake, I’m an INFJ personality type, all I want to do is help people, I will help anybody I physically can even if it means forsaking my literal future, but I could also go lurking in a city for a few hours and come back with blood stains without realizing I even did it, 


I feel like I’m living in an actual hell, completely devoid of humanity, I don’t dream, I barely feel anything, I can hardly stomach any food anymore without almost throwing up or my body rejecting it in some way, and I’m 45 pounds underweight now, I feel like I’m being forced to watch myself fall because of impulse decisions or complex consequences of innocent actions, I have a girlfriend, and for all intensive purposes, she is the single last thing keeping my brain off of the walls, she is my single lifeline that is holding me down and I love her dearly, I would die and kill for her, but I feel like I’ve made a mistake I dating her, we’ve been together for 5 moths but we’ve know each other for 6 years, and we’ve even dated previously before, I’ve seriously thought she’s the one sometimes but also she’s my biggest mistake, and god how horrible it feels to say that, but she’s hurting me and I can see it, she has her own set of mental issues, and in my opinion, to her dislike, I consider hers more important that mine, I won’t reveal anything too personal about her but she’s in a very severe condition, explosive anger to where she reds out (her vision gets covered in a red tint) and she destroys everything in sight with brute force, it terrifies me, I’ve never seen such sheer rage in someone before, and I’m trying to take all of her problems onto me, it’s what I’ve done with everyone I’ve ever met, and it’s destroying me, she’s making me lose all my friends and I can’t talk to any of the girls I used to know because there all “stupid whores” some of them are like, or at least we’re, like sisters to me, people I grew up with from really early grades, basically my only actual family, and I lost them, even my real family, I got kicked out, addicted to weed and tobacco, I’ve even looked at getting really hard stuff like DMT or MDMA, just so something feels real, I contemplate about suicide and mass murder or massacring my family and friends, I catch myself staring out into space and staring at blades or broken pieces of glass, I’m living with my girlfriend right now and it’s a horrible house, one bedroom, one bathroom, one living room, one kitchen, that’s it, bachelor pad essentially, it’s over run with cockroaches, 7 people sleep here, 4 cats and 2 dogs, sheer chaos, I’m disconnecting from reality and I can see it happening, my head feels like it’s splitting in half from the inside and sometimes it feels like it being pushed together, sometimes I want to claw my cheeks or claw at my eyes, other times I scratch my head until I bleed, I burn myself, beat myself, I don’t cut myself because it to noticeable, it’s easier to hide bruises and burns, I’ve thought about what way I would kill myself, I think I’ve settled on drug over dose, something trippy like a psychedelic, I’ve tried to kill myself 6 times before I turned 12 I gave up after that because I didn’t see a point, I wasn’t a solution, sure I wouldn’t feel pain anymore, but I’d be dead, so, kind of for nothing in the end, plus I’m afraid that heaven is real and suicide is a sin, on that note I feel like I’m going to hell on a first class ticket because I feel evil and disgusting, even though I haven’t done anything that could describe me that way, I’m starting to here voices and I catch my fingers moving on their own, like they’re trying to do something, the voices aren’t quiet either, screaming at me to hurt or be hurt, to kill or be killed, that everyone around me wants me dead and that I’m nothing but dead weight, and they’re all my voices, screaming at me, and I can hear where they come from in my head, like my conscious and the voice I’m using to wright this right now is coming from the very back on my skull and the bottom, it feels like it comes from where skull connects to spine, but the other voices come from different places, like the front left of my forehead or right above me ear, one screaming in rage, another sobbing nonsensically, radical muttering for hours about how we’re being watched by something, very specifically something, not someone, it seems like they converse with each other, like they want something as a collective group, i once heard a voice that told me to somehow come into possession of a super weapon like a nuke, and systematically set off the end of the world, because he hates humans, there’s a voice in me somewhere that hates humans so much that it not only wants them to end, but wants to be the reason they end, I’m not looking for help, I don’t know if I can be helped, I needed to say that, all of it for the first time ever, it feels kind of relieving almost, but I’ve accepted that my life is doomed and I’ve rectified that my illnesses are here to stay, and before anyone suggests, under no circumstance would I leave my girlfriend even if it were to help me, as it’s not exactly her fault she’s like this and I know how much it would destroy her, with the state she’s in now I can 100% guarantee it would end in suicide, and that would lead me to do the same, thank you for listening reddit, this might be my last time using social media, I guess in case these are my last words; To my girlfriend, I love you, more than anything, please don’t let this destroy you, in no way is it your fault that this is happening, to my sisters, I love you both so much and I hope you can grow to be better than me, to my mom, I’m sorry, to my dad, I wish we could’ve done better, to anyone I’ve ever harmed, or done anything negative in anyway to affect you, I apologize, it’s entirely my fault, all of it, to anyone reading this who’s struggling with depression and anxiety, please for the love of god never ever, ever, forsake your emotions because you think it will help, it’s not better, it’s worse, far, far worse, at that point you lose and literally definitive point of being human, and you become aware of that, thanks again for reading everyone, 

Goodbye.",07Jan2020,1
208,"The way I have been recently, going though episodes where I feel like someone else is taking over my mind and my thought.
Making me say things I don't recognise as my own words. 
Or maybe they are. Maybe they are actually my true words, portraying what I'm really thinking and feeling. 
It doesn't feel like me. 
It feels like an ugly deeply shut in person managed to sneak out and cause me to react in ways that are unfamiliar to me. 

I try to stop and tell it to stop this. I will only regret it later. They're not my true feelings. But it doesn't work. It's crawled out from it's dark hiding space. It's making me say the things I don't want to say.it makes me say hurtful things I know are wrong and I will so deeply regret and feel ashamed of later.
And it's made more appearances in the past few months than maybe ever before. 

I don't know why. 

Am I really, truly so convinced I am unworthy of sharing my love and life with someone that I have to push him away to the point of not being able to repair the damage I've done? 
Do I really want to hurt myself so much that I am able to make him leave me. Surely soon he's had enough? 
Is there a guarantee I'll be better after we're married? 

This fucking bitch is insane and it's only a matter of time until I'll be put in the psych ward. 
Apparently I have to be punished. 
I don't think I will ever know why. 

Maybe it will only stop if I kill it off. But to kill it off I have to kill myself. It might be the only escape. 

Do I want to die? 
Partially yes. Partially no. Which has the most votes? 
Cowardice makes ""no"" win. 

I must be mentally ill. I must be bipolar or manic depressive or something. 

Maybe it doesn't matter.

I don’t know if this belongs or is even connected. I have had depression for years now. I am in my late twenty’s. Growing up I would always be effected deeply by external environments.

These videos break my heart (as I’m sure they do many) but I have that feeling lingering for a longggg time. This made me ask around and realized it’s not the norm.

215,"I am text book depressed, I’ve known this for a very long time. As early as I can remember, maybe 10. I was told all the things you can think of before mental health was a priority and semi normalized. I’ve had the job I have now since I was 19, I’m 25 now. It pays well and I get yearly pay increases. I make a lot of money, more than I’d like to admit but I’m always broke. Constantly dipping into savings, and maxing my credit card out. I’m addicted to shopping, honestly sounds unreal but I am. I can’t stop, and I want to. I buy things and thrift a lot. Fashion is my ultimate vice and the only thing I look forward to in my life, hoping I can make a career out of it one day. But it is literally taking over my life. I have clothes everywhere that I never even wear because I hate the way I look in anything that isn’t baggy. I wish I was one of those people who can’t eat due to stress but I’m not. I can’t wear anything that isn’t a jacket or sweater. Yet my closet is filled with tiny things I love but will never wear. I have a huge walk in closet, filled to the brim, two dressers, 4 giant tubs of clothes in the living room, two racks in the living room and things I thrift that I plan to alter one day in another bin. But I can’t bring myself to get rid of things because I have no money, no savings, and a maxed out credit card so I want to sell it. But that’s harder than it seems. All of it consumes me and tears me apart but I can’t part with it. Am I a hoarder? Because I want to get rid of it but it’s just now cost me more than I can afford to just let it go. 
I want to do better, I want to not live with piles of clothes in literally every corner of my house. But it’s hard. And this isn’t even just one thing. It’s all the hobbies I try to pick up but never do. Like journaling, I have literally 15 journals that are empty because 1. I have nothing interesting to write about and 2. I’m afraid to touch it because it will get ugly and messed up if I write in it. 
Or like altering clothes with my sewing machine, I have a whole bunch of feet, thread, beading, whatever and I haven’t touched it once.
Over a 200 pairs of shoes that I never wear. Mind you my wardrobe is 95% thrifted but it all adds up. 
Cameras and electronics I never used
Over $3,000 worth of makeup and brushes I never touch sitting in a giant drawer in my bathroom 
I obsess over things and then never use them.
