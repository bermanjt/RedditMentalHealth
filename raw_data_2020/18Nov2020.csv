0,"It’s time for another dose of my mental issues everyone.... 

I had my 8th and final session this morning. It was oddly satisfying, I said thanks to my therapist and we redid a questionnaire from the start to show my progress. I am better than I was two months ago... the intrusive thoughts are very infrequent now,  I’m dwelling less and less on the “trauma” that cause all this, I haven’t had any emotional breakdowns or sobbing episodes in the past two weeks. But I’m still not happy...

I still don’t find any enjoyment in my old hobbies anymore, I dread the thought of going out and drinking with friends, the only thing that doesn’t fill me with fear and sadness is sitting in bed and binging Netflix... which brings in loneliness and makes me feel worse eventually. 

My college also provides 8 free therapy sessions... but I dunno if I have the strength to go through it again. It’s such a mental drain...

I have a little check in with my therapist in two weeks, she offered it to see how I’ll progress. 
Do you think I should ask her about the college therapy? Is it a good call? Or have I progressed enough to be able to get through the rest of this alone?",18Nov2020,2
1,"So i'm considering if i should see a doctor.

I have for the last couple of years been struggeling, my dads death anxiety from abusive work collegues.
I have on and off for the last year been experiencing ""brain fog"" and have been feeling down.

I'm going over and over in my head what feeling happy really feels like, and if me not feeling emotions is just the new ""normal""

I just can't fiqure out by myself if i should seek help.

I’m going to be seeing a therapist for the first time, and for some reason I’m just kind of nervous and not sure what to expect. I’m 28, already been seeing a psychiatrist for about a year, and am diagnosed with depression. I’m taking currently Zoloft and abilify, and she thinks I may also have BPD or bipolar.

I need people that I can talk to to help work out the situation that I have found myself in. I’ve been spiraling out of control for a while now. I have thought of suicide often throughout my lifetime, but over the last couple of weeks, has finally hit my breaking point to the point where it’s all I can think about. Every moment that I am alone I think about ways that I could do it that would be less less traumatic to people in my life. If I wasn’t such a coward, I would’ve already done it by now. I just can’t take all of the pain anymore. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t know how to fix it. I’ve struggled to find a therapist And I just don’t know what else to do anymore.

She's driven everyone out of her life in favor of her own deliusions. I have no where else to turn &amp; I can't afford therapy. I looked into local resources for psychiatric hospitals to admit myself but they have such horrible reviews of how they treat their patients that I don't think that route would benefit me very much.

15,"*Not sure MentalHealth is the best r/ for this*
I feel like I can't let myself do my best or use my full potential at many things. I hold myself back, avoiding things that are more my level of challenge and opting for ones below it. It's like it's bottled up inside, I want to let it out, I can feel it in there but it's too scary to let it out for some reason, like maybe I'm afraid to ""fail"" or perform less than what I thought I'd do, and that it'd be too much for me to bare so I'd give up. Honestly I think those are the biggest reasons I have this problem. I know that if I don't do as well or don't achieve what I'd hoped for, I can learn, improve, try again, etc. But I often can't get myself to anyways, or don't realize how well I'm doing to get closer to my goal. So often I just don't try at all in the first place. Maybe it's like a low self-esteem thing or something like that. I have been working against this lately, using drawing. I'm very talented at it, been told so my entire life, but for the reasons above, along with other reasons linked to mental health issues, I almost stopped drawing completely for years (it got harder and harder since I was a kid, and hit it's hardest when I reached the end of high school, where I almost totally stopped). I love drawing, it hurt me immensely when I it became too difficult (I remember I dropped my head onto my desk crying).

I’ve been diagnosed with depression before but it’s become increasingly obvious that’s not all that it is. After a brief call with my GP I got referred to a early intervention team for psychotic episodes a month or so ago, but they can only provide talking therapy (CBT). So I was advised to talk to my GP again for proper investigation into my symptoms and mental health issues. 

So I’ve done it. I booked an appointment, filled out all my details about symptoms + got my transcript form the early intervention team, and I’m talking to my doctor this week about all my symptoms (beyond psychosis, I’m just not sharing them here right now), medication adjustment and possible schizoaffective disorder.

I must say, I had a few really uncomfortable moments that I do remember clearly with that person, and well, he clearly sexually assaulted me once, I even posted about it here on Reddit and well, I was a bit confused about it being actual sexual assault and it was for sure. But I fear there's a lot more to it than what I can clearly remember, and I feel like I need and want to know what truly happened there, I think it'll help me keep on processing and working and understanding my trauma and my responses, but I'm scared... I don't want to harm or mess up in any way my healing process, but I feel like I need my memories to really be able to process my trauma and fully heal one day, otherwise I think those images and sensations are gonna keep on haunting me forever because I don't really understand why I'm getting them and where they're coming from, if they're part of that event I remember when he sexually assaulted me or if he did that multiple times or if he raped me and I can't  remember, I don't know, I hope I don't sound crazy, this is just really blurry, overwhelming and confusing.

25,"About a year ago, my mate introduced me to two boys. One she had a crush on, and one she was intent on setting me up with. Me and this guy dated for about 8 months before I ended it as I just didn’t like him, although he was a decent guy (Not really relevant, but hey).

I’m generally kind of an awkward person. I don’t really know how to social but I’m getting better at it, and I don’t consider myself to have social anxiety anymore. But this day, a year ago, it was really weird.

From the moment I met these boys, something weird kicked in. I started acting weird (as in super weird- like climbing trees unprompted and saying things I couldn’t control (nothing rude)) and I knew it but I couldn’t stop it. At the end of the day, my mate and I were walking home and she said it was like I was an entirely different person. 

My boyfriend later commented on this day and said (I was asking for advice) that I should tone it down with people I meet. (He didn’t mean this in a mean way at all, just to clarify).

Idk if it was a dissociative state, but I certainly couldn’t control myself. It isn’t a matter of self esteem either. For a short while, I wondered if it was ADHD, but I’m not a doctor (obviously aha) and I don’t really think I relate to any of the common symptoms.

About 5 years ago I was diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety, and the (tics? I don’t know what the proper term is) are the typical ones that include germophobia, extreme hand washing, not touching the ground, repetitive checking and stuff like that. It’s become such a normal thing for me that washing my hands 10 times a day plus sanitising is considered normal in my world.

However this is not the case with my family and to an extent my friends. My mother believes the reasons I don’t like touching her or her belongings is because of her; absolutely not the case. The stupid beliefs I have in my head are something like “her handbag touched the ground, and then she touched it and she hasn’t washed her hands, so it will affect me”. The typical ridiculous logic that to everyone else isn’t a problem. She can get quite upset because she believes that I don’t want to hug her or anything like that. Not true at all. 

I’ve been on medication for 4 years and see a therapist every 5 months but it doesn’t seem to do anything to help. I feel like I’m a nuisance to others when I have to hang back to check my locker is closed at school or my laptop is fully shut down at night.

What you see as a reason of happiness could be seen as a reason of bad luck, tiring, horrible thing. 

I am looking at it from a wider perspective. The person that means the world to me, could be mean nothing to someone else. In fact, he or she could be hated for that. I would be waiting patiently for, others would leave as soon as he or she enters. I am reflecting now, as I have seen people in my life where I never liked their existance. But for others, someone would come to visit regularly or they would have partners and I wonder how. 

Now with that perspective, I wish I could change my feelings and my beliefs with my ex. My ex had haters. People never liked her and even family members rejecting her. Yet, I was passionate wanted to be close to her. She brought me happiness. I saw her as scarce and wanted to become even closer. 

Now, how do I reach the level of neutrality with her. How did others not see her as I did or how can i see her as they did? 

Dont get me wrong, I am not judging. I am just trying to understand my emotions and feelings and beliefs.

I'm a 26 year old male and I'm writing this because I've lost interest in everything. I'd like to clarify I'm not suicidal.

This whole COVID shindig has given me pause to think.

What has happened to over the years? I used to have passion and fire. Since I've turned 24 I hate going to work, I hate getting out of bed I hate doing ANYTHING.

Even the things I once enjoyed like playing video games bore me. I'm content to listen to Spotify and stare blindly at my phone hoping something will happen to make life better.

I cant concentrate for more than 10 minutes anymore I lose interest so quickly. I feel so unfulfilled.

I just feel like I'm existing for the sake of it... aimless, purposeless and directionless content to let the winds of life and fate steer me wherever.

34,"So, I'm in college. I have about one more semester until I'm done. I'm in a super intense and stressful major. Tons of work and studying, my brain is over it.

I'm a bit introverted.

I used to have a really cool group of friends at the start of school, and we did everything together! We studied and bonded and had many good times together. I loved having them as friends.

Over time though, things began to become weird and I felt strange around my friends. Sometimes my minor efforts would be ignored, things I said didn't make any difference sometimes... It just seemed like they were much closer with each other than with me.

At times I just felt invisible to them.

Despite all that, I kept hanging out with them because I genuinely wanted the friendship and I truly did care for my friends. I can't lie, it always felt forced, but I still tried.

I'd show up to every study session, drive far to meet them at places, stay out late with them (even when I wanted to be home or do something else), and tried my best to converse with them. At the end of the day, these were the only people in the program who knew me and I felt comfortable speaking to.

THEN, they pretty much just stopped talking to me altogether after COVID came. We only speak when we are assigned on group assignments but that's it. I study TONS of material that we all used to split up all on my own now, and my stress levels are much higher because of that as well.

I know they have a separate group chat, they hang out with each other, do everything we all used to do, minus me.

It sucks and it hurts and most of all, I feel absolutely ALONE in the program we're in. Being that I'm more of an introvert, those were the only friends I had. Now I feel as if I have no one. It affects me so much to the point that I cry during exams or whenever I see them (my mask covers my tears)

I've also noticed that due to my loss of friends, I've gotten a bit more reckless in my dating habits and have been jumping from man to man a lot, and I feel like its in an effort to get over my friends.. is that strange? (I recently met someone really nice and stable though)

I also found a job recently that helps me feel better and distracts me, and I have a loving family, but still.

I only really have one more semester until school is done, so that is my light at the end of the tunnel. but honestly the situation just sucks and I don't know how to get myself out of this dump. My mental health is shit, my self esteem is very low, and I am so so so sad.

How do I cope better? Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR; After the pandemic, I was ghosted on by a solid group of friends in my program. We were quite close in the beginning of the program. Now we barely talk unless we need to. Takes a toll on me a lot.",18Nov2020,1

I started dating a girl that I had been waiting to date for about a year around the same time the stomach issues started - there were a lot of different things that got in the way of us starting to date since we met - and I just thought that I was having a bit of diet issues, though that notion soon left from my head. You see, the girl I started dating has some mental problems of her own and I thought that because of them, in some roundabout way, they would end up stopping us from being able to be together, because they had before. This became a regular occurrence, me being full of the impending doom of our relationship, which led me to stress over it and give the whole situation way too much attention, leading me to have incredibly bad relationship anxiety. About a month ago I broke it off with her because I had come to a point where I was going into a depression and I believe that I began self-sabotaging because of it. I also haven’t had much experience in relationships, with this being the only one that I’ve ever truly wanted to be in and cared that much about, with all my others being quick flings. Now that she’s not in my life anymore I find myself missing her time to time and regretting what I did, and now I’m in even more of a hole than before because I can’t find a way out of the maze that is in my head. I’ve talked to her about it a little bit, trying to explain what I’m going through, but obviously I don’t want to hurt her anymore than I already have by continuing to communicate instead of letting her deal with it on her own, though she’s been very understanding because we’ve been in similar situations before with the roles reversed. At this point I’m trying to decide if I should go back to her or spare her from myself, because I know that when my head is at a good place and I’m happy I really would like to be with her, but lately my head usually isn’t at that good place and I’m usually drained of energy and can’t find anything pleasurable, especially other people. 


Another part of this is that I remember times when I’ve felt similar to this throughout my life, this is just the worst it’s been. I’ve always worried about things, especially with other people, to the point of my stomach not feeling good and me coming to be sick. I’m thinking that I may have some type of undiagnosed anxiety disorder, but obviously it isn’t easy to admit to yourself that you need help sometimes, especially since I have never needed it before. I’m hoping that someone can give some type of insight on what I should do, because I really don’t know at this point. 

Also I just want to add this, I don’t plan on hurting myself, I never had that intention and I never will. I’m hoping that I can find some type of light at the end of the tunnel because I know what happiness feels like, and this definitely ain’t it. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope that someone can offer some advice.",18Nov2020,2
47,"A couple years ago I was in a good place emotionally. I got a tattoo to celebrate three years clean from self harm. I used to love it. I got it on my wrist, it's the classic butterfly semicolon.

I've been going through some super heavy stuff in my long term (5 years) relationship and in a recent argument some very hurtful things were said, and I finally broke.

It's been a hard yesr. I'm embarrassed, ashamed, and disgusted with myself. Seeing this tattoo makes me sick to my stomach. I feel like a fake. I want it gone so badly.

My partner keeps trying to talk me out of getting it removed. He has good intentions, but I don't think he understands the weight of what he said that night, and how badly it hurts to have this still knowing that it's nothing more than an empty promise to myself now.

I don't know what to do. Somebody please say something to make me love myself again. I have so much self-hatred right now it's ridiculous.",18Nov2020,6

I’ll also think about embarrassing things from the past and think terrible, self depreciating thoughts. My psychiatrist doesn’t seem to think medication will help. Does anybody have tips or tricks to alleviate this? How to turn my brain of when I’m anxious. I will be seeing a therapist eventually, but I need something to help me until then.

49,"So I am 23 years old and have always struggled with my mental health in some capacity. My mother has never been supportive of me getting help, unless she suggested it. And now to this day, is not very supportive. At 18, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and depression and have been medicated for both since. 

I requested to be tested for Adult ADHD earlier this month. My mother said, ""What if they say you don't have it, and just say you're f\*cking crazy instead? What will you do?"" Well, I thought that was going to happen. I went through my entire undergrad struggling and I'm now in grad school and feel overwhelmed with my coursework. I had always suspected it, so it was nice to know that my suspicions were confirmed. While I was assessed for ADHD, the psychologist ran other assessments. I have been diagnosed Adult ADHD, Dysthymia, and an Anxiety Disorder. However, some of my results also indicated that it was very likely that I also have borderline personality disorder as well.

This is also something that I have suspected in myself for a long, long time. As a psychology major, of course I always wonder if something I am studying applies to me. I am also known to be a hypochondriac (but is it hypochondria when I am right 9 times out of 10...?). 

I am unsure of what to do with this information. The psychologist made no mention of it. I talked to my mother about it, since she works in the medical field. She said it made sense. But, ""back in my day that was just called being an asshole. Now everything is a personality disorder."" I am medicated for depression and I really do not find therapy is beneficial to me. So I am unsure of what to do. Everyone can benefit from therapy, sure, but should I seek therapy for this? 

I guess this is just me venting. I am very frustrated. My mother and I have a strained relationship where we go through phases of being best friends and hating each other (I have always wondered if she has undiagnosed mental disorders as well). I still live at home because I am in school and cannot afford to move out.

I’m always impatient and anxious, I’m pretty angry or depressed a lot of the time. I’m just so not doing great. I tried to self medicate with diet pills today for the adhd stuff and it worked. But I have none left and I just feel like I can’t keep living like this now at this point. I’m an adult and I have no safety net if it does fall apart.

52,"Hey guys. I hope you’re all doing well. 


I keep thinking about my time in the psych ward in the hospital (late April of this year) and every little detail. The people I met, the way my room was, the card games we would play in between groups and a meal, the outside time flipping through music stations on a radio, the pancakes I always ordered in the morning, the strawberry-kiwi water, the styrofoam plates... all of it. 

I can’t stop thinking about it. I kind of want to go back and live in those moments. People my age, going through similar things, no outside crap like school or family issues, we didn’t have to wear masks, free meals... I just wish it was forever. 


Is that wrong of me??




I also got a girls email my age and was planning just keeping up with her via email after our discharges. I’m trying to gain a lot of trust and respect with my parents so I told them about it before I did or sent anything. I even showed them a draft of the email I was hoping to send. No addresses or personal info... just hoping to have someone to talk to and support each other on our journeys in life. 

My mom said no... she said she’s older than you and she’s probably been through a lot so hold off on contacting her to give her time to heal... it’s too soon... 

As much as I get that, she said that in late April and it’s mid November and I haven’t brought it up until last night... she still said no. Even after I tried to prove myself by saying I still hadn’t sent the email,  I’m trustworthy let me do this please. In all honesty, I could send the email right now if I wanted... It really sucks though because if I do they will never let it go and they will be so disappointed in me.

And what really sucks is when that girl was getting discharged, she said email me when you get home. She probably thinks I’m some white a-hole. It’s been so long and I don’t even know what to say anymore... I just know I need to reach out. What if she attempted again because I never sent that email? What if it’s all my fault.

55,"I think that it all started when I was 15 years old where I played a lot of mmorpg games. I had to check on shops, and had open chat with dozens of people at once. It felt like I am forcing myself to level up and I had pretty good memory about everything what I was doing and suddenly something happened what I've figured out was a brain fog. I am 25 years old and I never recovered from it. It made me feel sad/depressed/anxious/weird and a lot of more.

I started to drink and smoke weed occasionally and when I was 18 I started to consume much more weed and alcohol than I did before but it was just a beginning. We started to party with mdma and few times I've tried  psychedelics. I've developed tinnitus and I am not sure if I was 18 or 19 where it started but I had it since and it never went away.

 My recalling skills are really bad, I tend to forget a movie I just saw or conversation i just had too often. I really feel like I am brain damaged for life and I can't do anything about it. Sometimes it's like I  can't recall a TV show I just saw because my brain feels foggy and it felt like that in last 10 years, but if I solve a quiz where I can choose which answer is correct  I'm not having a problem at all with solving it.

It's like I can't remember names from tv show, but if someone came up with different random names until the real one came up I'd imeddiately know which answer is right without hesitating.

I had really good memory before and because it's gone i didn't felt myself in really long time. It was a long journey with brain fog which probably will continue for the rest of my life but I still have faith in finding a way to get my clear mind back.

I feel like it's difficult to find someone who can understand what I am going through who can guide me on what can I try to do to see if there is still hope.

58,"Tw: mentions of suicide and self harm 

Back on Saturday I finally told my mom about what I have been going thorough and she scheduled an appointment with my primary care physician for tomorrow. What should I know before going to a doctor about mental health and what will a primary care physician do? Will they actually diagnose me with anything and prescribe medicine or will they just refer me to a psychiatrist? 

If they will diagnose me, how does that even work? I suspect I have depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety (and my mom who’s a psychiatrist says the same) but how are these things determined? 

In addition, should I tell them about self harm or suicidal thoughts? I’ve been cutting and I’ve also thought a lot about suicide, but is it unwise to tell them since I’ll just get sent to the hospital? Or should I tell the truth? Anything else I should know before going?

Thanks for any answers :)

This jolt of happiness arose last night listening to music and I just couldn’t stop dancing, it died down during the day today.

I’ve lost a lot of weight and am proud of that, but again, I never thought this much happiness would arise from it.

After that i started to lose weight 'healthy', at the end of the summer having 95kg and maintaining that weight even today. I have 180cm so i am still overweight but since the last 2 months i didn t pay attention to the fact that i am constantly sleeping 12-16 hours daily, one time a week even staying up 2 days without sleep because i overslept so hard that day, and after that crashing another half of a day in the bed.

69,"Whenever I look back at high school, I realize how much it scarred me and caused psychological problems. I was in the top 5 percent GPA wise in my high school which was the best in my state, taking all AP classes by Junior year and mostly AP classes my sophomore year, had extreme pressure put on me by my dad, peers, teachers, etc., got extremely minimal sleep, barely had time to myself since my life was wake, school for 8 hours, homework, swim practice , study until bed, get yelled at and live in fear of my dad, repeat. Not to mention to school had a horribly toxic culture in terms of perfectionism, competitiveness with grades and “achievement”, and just being extraordinarily overbearing about grades greases grades. I hated my life, had severe depression and anxiety, and was suicidal through most of high school. I’m in college now and I often find myself having severe reactions to school related things, primarily grades. Entering college, I avoided work, class, and studying as much as I could because simply thinking of attempting to do my schoolwork brought on waves of anxiety and I only ever managed to study the night before an exam and do my homework the night before it was due because the fear of failure and need to have a perfect GPA had been ingrained in me so deeply that it over rode the anxiety I felt from doing it. I somehow managed a mix of As and Bs (with one C which I retook) from a combination of being mentally incapacitated and Knowing how to scrape by and do well from high school. During exams I get horrible test anxiety before and during. I even had a bad panic attack my sophomore year during a psych stats exam that I knew the material for and had an A in the class for, but through my anxiety I could barely read the page, ran to the bathroom, broke down, came back, and my professor was the kindest human being and made accommodations for me to finish the exam later and had a very long conversation with me (a good one) once I had settled down. Once during my freshman year (when these symptoms were the worst) I had forgotten to complete an assignment for biology, a small one worth very few points, and I had one of the most massive panic attacks I had had in recent memory where I was collapsed in my girlfriends arms, clutching her like I was about to die, and literally screaming in what felt like a mix of fear and pain. This happened another couple times to a lesser extent. As time went on it got slowly better but still never has gone away. Sophomore year I broke down in my advisors office talking to him (I’ve built a close relationship with him since I work for him so I trust him) during which point we decided to attempt to put me on SSRI’s and to take the next semester and take only GE’s that still fulfilled requirements but that were easy and I enjoyed. I calmed down a lot that semester and I think the SSRIs for a time did help along with the easier less crushing classes (I’m a neuroscience major  thats pre doctorate in PT so my major is often very information heavy and stressful). I still found myself pushing things off to the last minute fairly often and had trouble keeping a reliable study schedule, but I wasn’t wrought with mental anguish at the idea of academics since I loved my classes and teachers. I did however always feel terrible about myself because I felt like me taking a break from the “serious” work made me less of a person and would be a huge hindrance to my career, since at this point I still had the narrow mentality of “my career and grades is my worth and identity”. Which reminds me, nothing gives me more anxiety in the world than GPA. The very concept of it fills me with anger, hatred, and anxiety since that one number has caused me so much pain in my life. Today in my junior year I’m doing much better overall. I have a hard time gauging my overall mental health in relation to school because COVID and being isolated from classes, school activities, and people in general is hard on me and has made me miserable (like everyone) in a different way. But I haven’t had a panic attack over grades or school in a while and I’ve made many mental adjustments to how I view the world, school, and my self worth and identity. I’m also off my SSRIs and I don’t feel much different, maybe more anxious and prone to fits of depression due to isolation, but I think those are more situational issues due to the world right now. I’m writing this long description to see if anyone might think this sounds like PTSD since I’ve recently read studies that say you can actually get PTSD from long term or environmentally traumatizing stimuli (like school) rather than just from a singular traumatizing instance.",18Nov2020,1

71,"I'm 26\[M\] and it wouldn't take a doctor to tell you that I've contended with severe depression and confidence issues most of my life, but a few days ago I sort of broke emotionally.

I started life as an angry little kid that would throw temper tantrums and slam doors, to which my Mother's response was to ""make fun of me until I developed as sense of humor"". From a certain perspective I can see her wanting to help me develop some thicker skin, but what she really did was invite half of my mother's side of the family to endlessly harass me for about 13 years. Words were constantly twisted out of context or put in my mouth, embarrassing moments of my life were intentionally put on display for all to see, shamed for being overweight and reclusive, etc. Socially I was allowed to do most of the same things as other kids, but was always given far less freedom than my brother and sisters, and didn't start to notice until I got older. Academically I was expected to out-perform everyone else as if I was some sort of prodigy, despite being the epitome of average. The punishment for getting a 'C' on a report card was to be grounded in my room for the next semester, only allowed to read or do homework and come out for school or meals, a 'B' was just met with extreme disappointment.

I started smoking weed in 9th grade through my brother, since it was really the only thing I had ever found that kept me ""happy"" through it all, but at 18 I got caught with a gram. The state put me on community service, supervised probation, 5k in fees, and 4 months of paid addiction treatment. My mom kept her word and kicked me out (the pre-established punishment after my brother got caught by her), but when I didn't take it hard enough she upped the ante and took my scholarship, car, and consequently job with it, and spent the next few years slandering me at family gatherings. I cut ties after that and haven't spoken to her since. Her attempts to contact me over the years have slowly turned from anger and accusation to begging me to come home or even just talk to her. I think about talking to her all of time, but I've caught a glimpse of what waits for me when I go home and will have no part of it, nor can I ever think of anything to say that could accurately convey my feelings over the years or reasons for taking the actions that I have.

Fortunately I was pseudo-adopted by my friend's family (that I'm indebted to) and allowed to stay with them until my probation was sorted, at which point I moved to CA to live with my dad. Aside from partial custody every other weekend where me and my brother lived the same structured routine for many years, we never really saw him much or developed any real attachment to him. At first moving to another state where I could start over sounded like a dream, but the reality has been completely different. We were both under the impression that I would live with him until I finished my undergrad, then get a real job and move out; the reality has been a degree path littered with complications and restrictions beyond my control. We have nothing in common and we never used to spend any time together in or out of the house except for at dinner, but after a couple years nearly every conversation turned to listing all of my failures in his eyes. Eventually, after the comments got more personal and insulting I just stopped coming to dinner; He still cooks dinners for me and leaves them in the fridge, but we don't eat together. Its reached the point where we don't talk unless its necessary, and I try to avoid him and stick to my room as much as possible. I wish and often wonder what it would be like to have a healthy relationship with my dad, but to him I'm nothing more than a failed financial investment that he feels socially obligated to tolerate for now.

Objectively my life doesn't really seem so bad, but the older I get and more damage I accumulate, the harder it is for me to hold it all together on my own. I'm comfortable being alone most of the time, but never having anyone to trust or emotionally confide in, and never knowing unconditional love has slowly taken its toll over time. Nowadays my biggest issues is that I've lost the ability to connect with people, even at a fundamental level of interpersonal interaction. When I first moved to CA I was optimistic about the opportunity and new experiences, but so far its been a living nightmare. I'm a country bumpkin from a small town, so needless to say that I stood out enough that the moment I got off of the plane I was being made fun of for how I looked. At first I just shrugged it off and assumed the people around here were just really style conscious, but it got worse and more personal with time. These days no matter where I go, how I behave, how I dress, or what I do, there's always a surplus of people that need to do some pointlessly cruel thing towards me or treat me like a freak; Just walking from class to class on campus, standing in a checkout line, or sitting and working/eating in peace there's always someone that can't just leave me alone. While I'm sure that some of this is all just in my head as some self-confidence/image issue, there's too much tangible evidence and too many witnesses to deny that it isn't happening at a disproportionate rate. I wish I could just stop caring about what other people think, but its like listening to a continuous loop of personalized insults tailored to your insecurities 24/7, and after a few years it got under my skin.

At this point I've all but shut down completely. A few days ago between harassment at work and a small cancer scare and stress from school, I think I reached a breaking point. I haven't been able to cry for myself since I was a teenager, but I broke down crying for about 20 minutes and then just stopped feeling any want or desire. I just sat there for hours not moving, thinking, or caring about anything. I didn't eat for over 36 hours, I knew I was starving but couldn't stomach anything and eventually forced myself to eat something bland. While today I'm more-so back to my usual self, I still don't feel any enjoyment from anything and still have no appetite at all. Until recently I coped by drinking myself to sleep every night and smoking all day, but after discovering that I may have been blacking out several nights a week I decided to stop drinking and at the very least cut back on smoking. At this point I'm back to staring at my ceiling cuddling my pillow girlfriend until I fall asleep, while trying to ignore the feeling of loneliness so overwhelming that it now registers as an intense physical feeling.

73,"Feeling really sad today. Not seeing my sisters for  months is getting to me. One just had twins and I haven't been allowed over to see them because of covid. Sad I'm missing seeing them as newborns and I probably won't get to hold them anytime soon. 

My other sisters and her husband decided they were okay with my parents visiting them only but won't come near me or my husband because my husband is a first responder (firefighter) and I'm working out in the community too. My parents still see us and many other people so I don't understand why they'd draw the line at us. I  told my sister I feel really hurt and now she won't talk to me at all. She made a comment  about me trying to control them or something... I just feel it's really unfair. 
It really hurts to be so disconnected with everyone and none of it is within my control. My mental health has not been good at all as a result of the isolation. 

Work has also been so stressful and busy. I started a new job two weeks before the pandemic hit. The pandemic created so many obstacles and extra tasks and my boss keeps piling on the woek... I can't keep up. 

Also I just recently had a miscarriage. I was only 5 weeks pregnant and I knew it could happen but it was just awful and it's probably messing with my hormones. I want to get pregnant again but I'm just so stressed right now I'm worried it won't happen. Ughh... 

Anyways I just needed to vent because it's all really just too much. Anyone else feel this way?

74,"Hi everyone, for a bit of background, I’m a 23F college student and I’m currently living at home with my family, taking classes online (didn’t return to campus this semester because of COVID-19).

I’m very much an introvert and thrive on alone time, so not leaving the house or seeing friends often hasn’t impacted me much at all. In fact, in the beginning months, I’d say having to quarantine actually improved my mental health. I was sent home from my school in March this year, and I haven’t been back since then. I’ve visited a couple of friends maybe 3 times in the past 8 months, but that’s it. 

The problem though is that suddenly I’ve started to have intrusive thoughts. They’re all centered around death, primarily. They’re worst at night when I’m trying to sleep. I get really sad and anxious about people I love dying, and I’m even anxious about dying myself, too. And not even from COVID, really... it’s more so that I have these odd fears that my loved ones could die at any time in some freak accident. I even got anxious recently about having to take a longer drive on the highway, because I thought “if I crash, then that’s it for me.”

And now this has permeated into things that have nothing to do with me. When I hear about tragedies on the news, about people dying in accidents, it always breaks my heart and just makes me feel dread. And then I can’t stop thinking about these stories afterwards. Most recently, for no reason that I’ve been able to tell, the story of the 16-year-old teen Kyle Plush who died a couple years ago from positional asphyxiation after getting pinned between the backseat and trunk of his car after the seat flipped over on him, I can’t get that story out of my head. It’s even worse that he managed to call 911 using voice commands with Siri (he couldn’t get his phone out of his pocket because his arms were pinned too), and tried to explain what was going on, and police/dispatchers didn’t handle it well and didn’t find him. What gets me most is that he said on the call “tell my mom I love her if I die”.. all that just from getting pinned down by a car seat, it’s so messed up. 

I feel so so so horrible for that boy and especially for his family that now they have to live with this loss for the rest of their life. And I feel so terrible for Kyle, just thinking of somebody dying in that way... it’s to the point where I haven’t been able to get the story out of my head, and the scenario of how he died keeps playing back in my mind over and over, involuntarily almost. I’ve cried much of today over it. I feel crazy honestly. I don’t know why my thoughts are spiraling so out of control like this, why I’m so distraught over a horrible tragedy that happened a couple years back, that has nothing to do with me personally on top of it.

I don’t know what’s going on, or how to cope with this. I’m really tired of these thoughts. About death, and tragedies, and especially this one story in particular that my mind has now decided to latch onto and play back in a loop for whatever reason. If anyone has any advice on how to deal with this, I’d appreciate it a lot. I just hate feeling so alone with this awful feeling of dread / sadness in my gut",18Nov2020,1

76,"Hi first time poster here. I've been on drugs for the past 5 years (21m). I was smoking meth at first, for the first 3 or so years but I have basically quit that. For the past 2 or so years I have been smoking heroin or doing some other strong opioid (oxycodone, oxymorphone, fentanyl, ect.) Most recently I've been doing bumps of this china white one of my friends can get (basically a weak fentanyl analog thats been cut). In my past experience I've never had bad withdrawals from fent, but have had bad withdrawals from heroin and other opioids.
Idk it doesn't really matter whether I'm high or not I just don't want to do anything all day long most days. Like I have no drive to do anything, I'd rather just sit and stare at the wall tbh. The only times where I feel I actually want to be productive are very sparse and come on very sporadically like out of nowhere, it's very spur of the moment when that happens. Well I should rephrase that I want to be productive most of the time but I don't actually have any desire to get up and do something. Idk it's hard to explain. It's been like this for basically as long as I can remember tbh (bare in mind it's not often something from my short-term memory becomes a long-term memory, my memory has been fucked for some time now). I feel I should mention I only mentioned the drugs that I have struggled with addiction with. There's a boatload of non-abusive, albeit oftentimes heavy, drug use in there as well over that timespan.
Idk I'm not looking for someone to say ""oPioIDs aRe DePreSsAnTs oF cOuRsE yOu dOnT wAnT tO Do aNyThInG."" In my experience with opioids I tend to typically do low-medium doses as I find that to have a more energetic-type effect on me and will quell any withdrawal symptoms I might be having and actually get me up to do some chore or other thing I might need/want to do that day. Although of course a heavy dose will put anyone to sleep.
I just need help to be able to like function like a regular person and actually want to do shit with my life, both productive and just for fun. The only time I actually have some outside source of motivation is when I know I'm going to get to see my girlfriend or when I'm with her because we don't get to see each other very often and I really enjoy spending time with her no matter what we're doing.
I wouldn't say I'm depressed most of the time, but then at the same time I think I would say I'm depressed most of the time to some extent at least lol. I really just don't know what to do and I don't want to have to take adderall or something similar in order to actually want to do shit in everyday life. And for those of you who will say to get on suboxone, I already have a script, but am afraid that I will get worse withdrawal trying to get off of subs than I do with fentanyl, like I said earlier fent has never given me any real withdrawal symptoms even when being the only kind of opioid I've used everyday for a month or more.

I feel so alone. And i don’t know how to fix it.

Hi, I’m currently a senior in highschool and this is my story on how my life seemed to crash and burn in the entirety of 2020. January 9th is a day I’ll never forget, it’s when an ex girlfriend (dated in 8th grade) told the world the biggest lie imaginable. That i had raped her. Instantly instead of being asked for my side of the story people assumed it was true and pushed me away calling me a monster, the worst person to walk the earth, to kill myself, and i should die. Now people usually don’t get to me when they say these things, i was kinda the annoying, funny kid, that everyone liked up till then so i used to jabs. But this was different people I’ve known all my life changed at the snap of a finger. I shut myself away from the world because no one wanted to listen and i was dealing with the state police aswell. This continued till July where on the last day of our family vacation we received a call saying that the case was being thrown out as the other person was caught lying multiple times. I was so relieved, happy, and overwhelmed with emotion. I cried on the beach and remembered thinking i got a second chance for my senior year. However, this wasn’t the case, instead of sorrys from people that betrayed me they chose to ignore me and act like nothing happened. Basically saying “....shit.... well good job for not raping”, i thought I’d get my friends back and people would be open, this wasn’t the case. My step father who worked as a campus security officer after retiring from being a correctional officer, was then attacked by a student claiming he was racist, homophobic and transphobic. He never backed any of these claims up and with my reputation already dragged through the mud since i lived with him i was obviously all these things too. I will say it once because that’s how many times it’s needs to be said, he or I are none of those things and it is incredibly disrespectful to just throw words like that around when they have heavy meaning. I’ve emailed the school asking for repercussions as these false claims are blatant lies and i will not be lied and bullied any longer. That was in august and i have not received one update from them regarding the situation. It seemed like everyone changed and I’m a victim but i dont want to feel this way. I don’t want to be the victim of anything, i want my life to be the way it was before that girl told that awful lie. I want my friends to go on late night drives and laugh and sing in the car, i want to go to party’s and be a normal 17 year old kid. But i live in constant fear, with anything i do i could be lied about and what if this time it doesn’t work out. I avoid parties because of drinking and I’m scared to open up to new people. I used to be so good at making friends and now i trust no one. I feel like a ghost in the sense of no one gives a shit about me and like people would be better if i moved away. I don’t know when or how to learn to trust people again. And I’m so tired of being scared to open up. This is the first real time I’ve told my story to the world so please if you have any questions about something i wasn’t clear about just ask. I’m not trying to throw a pity party or look for sympathy, i simply just want advice on how i can learn to trust, love, and feel emotions other than anger, sadness, betrayal, and loneliness. Thanks everyone who read this far. Hope y’all are doing well. Sending out positive vibes❤️.",18Nov2020,1
91,"I have been struggling with my mental health for 3 years now. At first I thought it was due to me struggling to get good grades but it manifested overtime with something else. I am in college and college can be very busy. I coped with my issues with staying busy for the first year but soon it caught up to me. In the second year I finally told my parents that I needed dedicated attention for my issues. By my parents I mean my mother, my father has no idea about my mental health. My brothers really freaked out because they had no idea about it at all. I waited for my summer holidays to come so that we can move to city. But we had family issue that summer and the whole focus shifted and I couldn't get through with the appointments. 

Throughout my college I reached out to the psychologist of the Institute which made me feel very hopeless about getting help at all. She neglected my issues and steered my issues to something else. She never checked up on me or paid attention to what I had to say. She even told me I wasn't busy enough while I had 4 active colleges groups at the same time. 

The problem lies in the faith my family has on me. From the childhood I was considered to be the stoic kid. I was. I didn't feel too much when I was a kid. My stoic nature often made others feel like I was mentally strong. And so my family believes . I have always been the person that kept things to themselves. I have had my share of traumas that my family know nothing about because I chose to not share them and suffer alone. Be it getting mercilessly bullied in every way possible or getting sexually abused by middle aged person or slut shamed. My family knows nothing and not even my friends now. I have always been like this. 

My mental health has deteriorated so over the time that all I could think for the past 5 months is to just get over and be done with it. I can't pick up stuff and not visualize harming myself with it. My chest is constantly tight. I am the most miserable I have ever been. I am away from my family at the point and I have been thinking a lot about doing it. I have cut out my friends so much that I have none at this point that I could talk to or even share what's going in my head. I can't talk to my family because my cousin recently died in an unfortunate accident and they are very distrubed. And to top it all, they still pine about me being very strong to be able to live alone and do it so nicely. They are not at a good place noe mentally and neither I am. I can't even bring the topic of me getting help without freaking them out.

93,I know theres been something wrong with how I think and act for 2 or 3 years now (I'm 22). I've slowly cut off contact with all my friends simply because they've done things that made me uncomfortable. Not anything really bad I just grew disconnected from them no matter how long I knew them before and little things would disgust me. I feel lonely all the time but the thought of actually interacting with someone is very intimidating. I work at a gas station and my boss always gets on to me about not saying hi to customers becuase putting on a friendly face is genuinely exhausting for me. However Despite all this I actually have a girlfriend. We're long distance but she's the only one I feel I have any compassion for and yet I have to make myslef stay in contact with her on a day to day basis. We've known each other 1.5 years now and visited 4 times for 1 week through out. I think she really loves me and I think I love her but when were away it's like I have no urge to communicate with her. I feel like I have no energy in my soul. I have no compassion for others. When ever someone tells me something bad has happened to them or that they're going through something tough I feel absolutely nothing and try to put on a caring face until they walk away. Now that masks are commonplace in public I don't even try to smile when I talk to someone anymore. I feel inhuman and I can feel my emotions getting darker. Sometimes their are periods where I feel so angry all I want to do is cause as much pain as possible to anyone around me.

97,"I won’t inundate you with every detail of my family life, but here’s a quick overview. I wouldn’t say my family never showed love or affection. Actually, they “presented” love and affection quite a bit. By that I mean that my parents told us they loved us, but it never felt real. This is mainly because they were abusive too many times for me to actually feel loved. My dad has repeatedly told me and my brother that he hates us. He beat me a few times, but not too much. Mainly the insults got to me. He used to tell me that I’d grow up to be nobody. He’d say I’ll develop into a drug addicted loser with no prospects. These are things he told me when I was a kid. Mind you, I had never touched a drug. I understand that my dad was traumatized from growing up with a crack-addicted mother. I’d say on about a weekly basis my dad would explode over something from work, or really anything unrelated and he’d take it out on us. He’d threaten to get rid of us, he’d tell me I’m ugly and weird, he’d say that he’s so disappointed to have loser sons like us. Usually the abuse would last for one or two days. After that, he’d suddenly be fine and would almost be too nice. He would constantly go in for hugs and tell us how much he loves us. 

I certainly developed some issues out of this. My brother got it the worst, though. My brother has become a severe drug addict and alcoholic. He actually admitted to me that he feels like our dad brought him to this point. Now my brother has actually brought his physical health to such a low point that he probably won’t live very long. And he’s only 26. I get so upset when my brother goes back to my dad for help. Last time I was home, my dad found my brother drunk and instead of helping him, he filmed him while calling him a pathetic loser. The worst part of that was him saying, “I love you, but I’ve never liked you.” Then he told my brother to watch that video every morning so that he feels motivated to stop drinking. Frankly, I was appalled. I tried explaining to my brother that he has to get away from my dad, but I think my brother is beyond help at this point. 

Anyways, the real reason I’m saying all this is because I genuinely don’t know how to feel love for anyone. I just don’t know what it feels like. My girlfriend talks about how she still feels butterflies when she sees me, and I just wonder what that feels like. I certainly love my girlfriend, but I don’t actually feel it. I understand my love for her, and I would do anything for her, but sometimes I wish I could experience the catharsis of passionate love. She tells me how good I am with people, especially as a teacher, but my interpersonal skills have only been honed out of necessity. Most of the time I prefer solitude. I only wanted to teach so that I could be a good role model. Honestly, I wouldn’t even be in a relationship had my girlfriend not been the initiator. That’s how my few friendships began as well, by people approaching me when I was never looking to get close to anyone. The upside of this is that my girlfriend and my friends are as real as it gets. Other than my family, my relationships are far from superficial. I absolutely relate to these people on several levels and I genuinely enjoy them. Still, for once I would like to FEEL my love for these people. I’ve felt that love before, especially with my older sister growing up. I loved her so much, but my father did a good job of breaking us down and I was unfortunate to not recognize that in time.",18Nov2020,1

Anyways, recently it seems I have jumped off the deep end and it's hard for me to get up in the morning, I regularly get in verbal fights with family (once in a while it goes physical), I have no drive whatsoever except for my job. I was supposed to graduate from highschool in 2020, but I never finished; I do go to credit recovery but ever since it has gone full online because of COVID I have not done one ounce of work. I lie all the time and manipulate people once in a while, and I my emotions are like a rollercoaster. I DO want help but I'm deathly scared of psychiatric hospitals.

108,"I tried posting this in r/relationship_advice but it didn't work for some reason.

Hey reddit I've been trying to help a step relative(female, we'll call her Sarah) for a while now with their mental health but have recently hit a brick wall. Basically Sarah still has left over feelings for a partner(male, we'll call him dick) that Sarah acknowledges was toxic, but doesn't know why she still has feelings or how to identify those said feelings.

Dick was a awful manipulator. He started out nice enough. Both Sarah and dick had a mutual attraction to each other so they started a relationship. Dick was really kind and nice at first but slowly started to show his true colors. He would start to body shame Sarah constantly calling her fat and making fun of her, telling her to work out more often, telling her that her clothes don't look good on her etc. On occasion when snacks where had like a single cookie or candy bar, Dick would tell Sarah to eat something healthier. If Sarah ever did put on a swimsuit he'd make fun of her body and tell her to ""put something on to cover that up"". 

Now this seems pretty bad already, but it gets worse. Dick was constantly bringing up any mistakes that Sarah made, waving them in her face for weeks to even months. It was dicks trump card. "" I'm wrong? Well heres a bad thing you did! Remember this? How bad you screwed up?"". However if he ever made any mistakes he expected to be given forgiveness withen the day. If Sarah ever brought up something dick did he'd non-shalantly shrug it off and say something along the lines of ""you should get over it"" or ""your still hung up on that?"" 

He was also embarrassed to be around Sarah and to even associate with her. In private they were a couple. But at school or in public places dick didn't know Sarah. It was to the point almost only Sarahs friendgroup knew they were dating. Dick was also really nice guy to others thus giving him a positive reputation in most peoples eyes, including Sarahs friends.

Some of the emotional abuse doesn't need to be shared on reddit but suffice to say Dick introduced more emotionally abusive activities to his schedule. To say he made Sarah cry often would be an understatement. Which was only made worse by the fact when Sarah tried reaching out to her friends about the abuse none of them believed her, because Dick was ""so nice"" "" he would never do/say something like that"" ""are you sure its not YOUR FAULT?""


By this point in the story you're probably wondering ""why didn't Sarah just leave? Does Dick have blackmail?"" No. Sarahs mentality was just that ""this is the longest I've been in a relationship. So this must be [the one]"". How dumb that may sound to you dear reader but Sarah? Sarah believed it. She gave that relationship her all. She would make him presents (for almost every holiday and his birthday btw). Apologies for next to nothing, and just utter compliance with his abuse. Don't get me wrong Dicks an awful guy but every now and then he'd sprinkle in a compliment about Sarah. A ""your really pretty"" or a "" you so thoughtful and kind"". I guess these compliments must have felt really genuine coming from Dick. In hindsight I feel like those small quips of self confidence is what kept Sarah in that relationship for so long.

After a while Dick knew he was being well a Dick. He told Sarah ""I don't want to feel like a dick so what do you want for your birthday?"" Sarah just said money... Dick brought 15$ usd. Keep in mind Sarah had constantly made thoughtful gifts for him on several different occasions. That was the only gift Dick gave in the relationship and he had to ask. To add insult to injury, one night Sarah asks why Dick is still in a relationship with her if he dislikes her so much. He responded with a ""I don't know"" this is where the relationship takes a nosedive. More arguments, more insults,more abuse.

Eventually Sarah's mom catches on to the trend of her daughter crying at night. Connects the dots and tells her to break up with him. Sarah reluctantly does so over text. Dick is of course a pretentious asshole about it, and blocks her on all platforms. Not even 2hrs after the breakup one of Sarahs friends messages her a image of Dicks snapchat story asking if anyone wants to hook up. Words fail me.

Now Sarah was in a relationship with Dick for a year and has been dick free for a year. Sarah still sort of has ""feelings"" for dick though, she keeps a box of his stuff in the garage for some reason. She says she wants to thank him give him a hug and say goodbye. I don't understand this at all. I don't know if she thinks his abuse bettered her and made her a better person or what. But she can't identify these feelings. And she doesn't want to move on in relationships without squashing this beef. I have also found this trauma is a massive Boulder in her mental health. And I can't really help her with other issues while its in the way.

Can anyone offer some solutions? Anything from the name of what this feeling of emapthy? Towards a abusive partner, is called to ways to deal with it, to personal experiences would be helpful. Thank you reddit.",18Nov2020,1

110,"Thirty minutes ago, i woke up.  

Twenty minutes ago, i had come to terms with my reality, i meditated, i realized my situation, i understood myself and set tenets so i could improve myself every day.  

Ten minutes ago, i forgot about it all. It already feels like a lifetime ago. All that I had realized and set for myself gone like an innocent whisper in the wind, falling on none's ears.  
This has been my life for much longer than i realize. I have been assessed as possessing both a mind and a heart broken beyond repair, believing them to be my fault, i continually down myself in a spiral of self-hatred, of titling myself worthless of living.  

All I've been were masks created by a pained child to cope with existance, to shut himself away and let another form grieve for him. I'm not the same person. I don't have any memories of that person, but neither do i have memories of days shortly past.  

In truth, I am happy. I am terrified of how complacent i am with my reality. I live each day making room by forgetting yesterday. I want to know how to better myself and to hold onto that feeling, but each routine i ever adapt and grasp turns into dust falling between my fingers.  

By the time I finish writing this, I'm already another person, another mask. The same one that assessed me back then, told me they were ways i hurt myself, but if the child hadn't made them in the first place, i doubt he could had withstood the grief without snapping, but then again, maybe that's why we were made im the first place.  
They all tell me to take off the masks, but there's no personality behind all of them, or if there is, They're afraid.",18Nov2020,1
111,"Some of them are -

* Regular Exercise - It is scientifically proven that regular exercising would help in the prevention of depression.
* Stress - Often stress is unavoidable but due to that, it can cause depression. So managing stress is very important.
* Sleep - Getting high-quality sleep is very necessary for both, mental and physical health.
* Substance Abuse - Reducing alcohol, nicotine consumption and drug use can be a difficulty, however, it is associated with higher risks of depression.
* Relationships - We have all come across people in our lives who weren't healthy for us be it friends, partners or even family members. Regardless of the situation, it is very important to avid toxic people who put us down at all costs",18Nov2020,44
112,"There has to be something wrong with me. I just don’t see how it is normal to be this way. Ok, my explanation is probably going to be nonsensical but here I go.
I am obsessed. Like insanely obsessed. I go onto apps and websites to get to know people because I’m lonely. If someone starts talking to me something in my brain just sort of flips and I start waiting. I constantly check my phone for messages and my emails. If I like a person I will talk about them for a really long time with my friends but as soon as they fail to respond I begin to dislike the person and/or feel like a failure. I hate it. I know that I want the validation of being acknowledged but I can’t seem to control it and it feels like my brain is splitting in half as I try to tell myself that it’s ok, while the other me says ‘no it is not’.
I feel all over the place. I’m happy one day then I’m not. Being happy feels overwhelming but usually I’m having a hard time trying to convince my family that I’m not cold or callous and that I do care. I care. It’s just that not that much. And I know that sounds awful. 
I’m not sleeping well and I’m pretty sure that’s affecting my mood but I can’t go to bed. My mind keeps rushing into a thousand directions and making up scenarios where I’m gravelly injured. 
I don’t know if I’m doing everything for attention. I think I usually do and the reason for that is that while I’m doing anything or feeling anything there’s always my mind in the background just being a casual observer. At a funeral I cried and stopped crying at random intervals because I couldn’t tell if that’s what was required of me. I know that I wanted people to see me cry at the same time the other half of me told me that I was being ridiculous. I don’t understand myself even when I think I do. 
I don’t know. I just know that when I show emotions it is for attention and I hate that I do it. Heck, maybe that’s why I’m writing this. 
I’m tired of myself. I just want to be normal.

114,"Sorry this is really long, I just feel..lost

I'm 17, and I don't know if I really feel things. Things that happen to other people are such big deals to them but to me it's whatever. 

I'm smart but good grades are hard to come by, I can't concentrate and my friends tell me I have inconcistent personalities. They say that my eyes look like I don't have any empathy in them, and their right, I feel pity in place of empathy except for children. 

My head is always spinning and I cant stay on one train of thought. I talk to fast and move to fast for anyone I have interacted with, if I'm not being the funny one I'm too exhausting to be around. I feel exhausted myself. 

I want to take a bat to someone's face sometimes, I don't care who. 

I'm scared of being myself around anyone except close friends because I'm afraid I will scare them with the strength of my personality. I usually end up taking leadership roles but I have to put myself on a leash so I don't slap someone for taking so long on a menial task. I'm constantly frustrated when working with others because they move so slow. People are afraid to give me feedback even though I have never outwardly shown my anger. It's frustrating because I can see on their face they have something to say. I'm tired of being around kids without backbones. 

Everyday is the same especially because of covid. There is no structure to my day yet there still isn't any variation. I feel like I'm in a loop. I used to think that solipsism waa a crazy idea but now I'm starting to connect with it more and more. 

I have university applications coming up and I don't feel a thing, all my peers are stressed up the wazoo but I'm more or less apathetic - even though I say I'm passionate about my favourite career paths I feel like even though I want to pursue it, I would rather go to sleep instead and live in my dreams. 

My dreams, I look forward to the night so I can go to sleep and dream again. I know it sounds cheesy but it's true.

Nobody has expectations of me except me, I crush myself with the. And stress myself out. I tell myself I'm worthless if I can't meet my goals and I always move the yardstick forward before I cross them. My parents say I expect too much of myself but I only have one life, I want to do everything, i want to get good grades,I want to continue my charity work, I want to do more volunteering, I want to continue my business, I want to keep doing everything and more. 

I have anxiety attacks when I'm not doing anything, I'm not entertained by videogames anymore and I feel like I'm only playing them to hold onto the little innocence I have left. 

Everything seems so close but out of reach, everything I do feels second class, every compliment I get feels like a backhanded insult. I've turned down everyone who's approached me romantically because I'm afraid I'll hurt their feelings. I want to drive a pencil through my skull when I speak with people who are my age.

One time I woke up from a euphoric dream and was legitimately depressed for the next month. It's been so long since I feel like I've felt happy or even just not apathetic that I feel like I have to hit my head like an old tv to change the channel. 

When I said I speak fast and move too fast for others. I feel like there's is a brick wall between every person I talk to. No matter how many communication classes I take I will never get to someone because either I'm dumb or they're dumb. Sometimes I feel like there is no way I can be wrong about something through the lines of reasoning I have in my head but everybody else around me tell me I am wrong. I accept it but I still feel like I'm right and they're not understanding me. 

Online school has been insane, either it's too underwhelming or too overwhelming. I feel like these teachers are incompetent in the way they structure their lesson plans during covid even thought they've been doing it for decades. How can you expect me to complete 8 hours of lessons and an assignment in one day when it takes you 2 months to mark 30 papers?

I don't want to die but I just want to melt away. You might think that allot of the stuff I said above is arrogance, idk, I don't think so, I admit when I'm wrong (and understand why) and I happily accept feedback and criticism (when I'm given an explanation) but when I don't understand and am not given an explanation I hardly move. ""I don't give a shit what you have to say untill you explain to me why you say that""

I just want everything to stop but not really stop. I want all my expectations to go away, I want everyone to go away, I want to be able to tune in and out of reality as I wish and not to the whim of my thoughts. I want to be loved by someone else other than my parents. I feel like if I was in a relationship then all my problems would go away but I know that's not true. I know I would only end up hurting everyone involved 

I want to change so I'm not constantly feeling anxiety, frustration, and anger

Tl:dr
I really feel like the waiter or old man from hemingway's ""a clean well lighted place"", except I don't want to kill myself, I just want to sit in that cafe for eternity, I want to sit in nothingness. I want to change so I don't want to do that",18Nov2020,1

118,"Long story short, I have always been regretting things. Almost all of my stress origins from overthinking and regrets.

1) I did not get into good university for my undergrad. Got civil engineering. Regretted not working harder in my high school. Overthinking led to not participating in activities and classes enthusiastically for the 4 years. This led to poor GPA, and poor resume during undergrad.
&gt;
2) Luckily, got into a good master's program in materials engineering. Did decently in first year. Regretted not taking part in clubs and running for student body head. Regretted opting for a research project that was hard and not a very hot topic. Overthinking resulted in not getting a good job after master's. I felt worthless. Left job after few months. Regretted my poor decisions and performance. Have a gap of 8 months in my resume.
&gt;
3) Meanwhile, applied for PhD to 5 university, got accepted only in the safe choice university. Did not like the topic very much, was not very enthusiastic. Regretted not working harder to get a good GRE score or publishing papers during master's. Spent 2 years avoiding social events and not working hard. Regretted not taking relevant courses in the fear of getting poor grades. Now I don't have sound technical knowledge. Somehow completed my PhD in 5 years. I now like my topic but I have not done enough to get a PhD.
&gt;
Now, I regret not working harder during my PhD. I regret not publishing papers early. I also did not do any networking or be in organizing committee of social events. This led to not getting any job after graduation. Now I am working as a postdoc. I regret not working harder this year. I wasted first 5 months worrying about not able to start my job and delay in my work permit due to covid.
&gt;
I am always stressed and full of regrets. I am 32 now and am afraid that I will die in few years from stress. I don't know what to do.

I may have OCD but I’m not sure yet. Since high school I have been extremely sensitive to clothing. It started with bras. They were too tight and itchy.

Slowly I could no longer wear tight jeans, elastic waistbands, fabric that wasn’t perfectly soft, seams, pants at all, and now basically nothing is comfortable.

Hi,

As of this week my boyfriend is starting on citroplam. This is his first time trying antidepressants and he asked to avoid sertraline as several of his friends told him the side effects are horrendous, so the doctor prescribed citroplam instead 

I am aware antidepressants can completely kill sex drive. Obviously my bf’s mental health is the most important thing, so I don’t really want to discuss this with him in case it stresses him out, but I want to prepare myself privately. My boyfriend currently has a very high sex drive, can anyone give me any idea how this is going to change? I know it will be different for everyone but wondering if anyone has any anecdotal advice/experience on this

126,"Ok so before I start ranting about my useless self my dad is a Trump supporter, Christian, and homophobic (and divorced with my mom) so you know all that combined is going to be bad.
(WARNING VERY LONG AND TINY SELF HARM/SUICIDAL THOUGHTS TRIGGER WARNING AT THE END)
When I was in elementary I still am today struggling with a lot issues with myself. Like figuring out my sexuality and my gender.

My dad has been a very important person in my life due to him probably buying me stuff my mother wouldn’t do often cause she always told me to ask him to buy it. He was one of the many reasons why I even kept on living. My dad is very bi polar I guess you can say he is extremely mad one minute and happy the next second. 
I always that what he does and say was normal until middle school. I have never realized how racist he was and then he says well know one is perfect and that It takes time to change(he is a devoted Christian now) he keeps using that excuse but he never even tries to change. My dad says he has never hit me or yelled at me when he has. The thing is he comments about my weight and makes jokes about insecurities like socializing and freezing up in public but when I do I’m the bad person and deserves to be yelled at. I feel so god damn stupid and think why the hell did I do that. I thought it was okay when he does it too. My dad guilt trips me a lot when I have to go back to my mom or anything really. He always tell me that If I love him but he responds with if I’m lying and to prove it. I just don’t know what he wants me to prove like I’m always with you during the weekends what else do you want!? Then when my older sister steps in I just feel more worse. LIKE I’m sorry that I can be daughter I wanted I’m so sorry that I’m a fucking disappointment. I deserve this. He keeps on telling that I’m so fucking ungrateful and how I take things for granted. I’m starting to believe maybe I do deserve to be ridiculed like this or I’m being such a bad daughter I deserve this. I honestly feel like I deserve all the hate I give. I also have this habit that if I accidentally hurt someone I will allow them to give me the same pain back to me and let them hit me as hard as they like. I guess you can say I’m use to being hit because of living in a household where we use hitting as a sort of punishment. This is probably the main reason why I flinch A LOT. 

Then he pretends he is different races changes his voice and use racial slurs. I always tell him to stop but then goes of saying he has a friend of said race and he lets him. Oh god let’s not get start the only reason he goes for trump cause he did something that happened in the Bible(MY WHOLE ENITE FAMILY IS HISPANIC SO YOU KNOW THAT IS SOME CRAZY SHIT TO SAY) Then he got super fucking angry when he found out the pope is accepting gay marriage. He kept going on a rampage saying all gays are going to hell. I just sat there the car ride home taking all this is in. HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY I SHOULD TELL MY MOM ABOUT THIS. My mom thankfully accepts me for who I am(I’m pan and gender-fluid ) and like she even said that was crazy she is catholic to show that her religion won’t stop her from accepting me. My stepdad barely knows English so you unbothered but I hope he accepts me. Like my dad is super crazy like I love him a lot but I am scared of him and when he gets angry or pressures putting me in situations I can’t not handle being in I’m terrified of him. He knows I cannot handle stress well and top of that I cry very easily especially if I’m being yelled at I can’t handle being yelled at well. I’m not Christian or catholic at all but I have to pretend so I won’t face his wrath. I honestly fear the day he finds out I’m not straight and not Christian. 
Most of the stuff he has done is the main reason why I purposely scratch my wrists and arms until there raw. I haven’t actually cut myself due to the fear of making myself bleed but I’m at my breaking point I actually have thought about and I don’t want these thoughts. I stopped purposely harming myself for a couple months and now I’m back we’re I started. I also very self conscious on how I eat like I wish I could stop eating so my dad can be happy about my weight. I hate my body so much. I have always thought about ending it during  elementary to now I always wrote a new suicide note in my head. I realized I have so much pills in my house I could easily overdoes myself and know one will notice. They will just think I’m sleeping in my room until it is to late. I’m trying my best not to think about this anymore but it is so hard. I’m going to have to cut it off here as this is getting to long sorry for the long vent I am just to scared to get a therapist thinking that they will make talk about these problems with him near.",18Nov2020,1

129,"To say that the last 1.5 years have been the worst in my life is an understatement. 

WARNING: This is going to be long, all over the place and will most likely include many spelling errors. 

Quick background on the the first issue and then we will get to events currently happening. My bio mom (referred to as mother from now on) and I have never had a good relationship. We moved approximately 30 times growing up, she had many men in and out and clearly favored my sister over me. Toxic relationships plagued her and my parents divorced when I was 3. I won't go into extreme detail but my childhood was filled with lies, inconsistencies, and emotional neglect. When I was 13 I made the decision to live with my Dad and stepmother (will be referred to as mom from this point on). My sister didn't move with me and my mother demanded more child support and less time with me and more time with my sister. I wasn't allowed in her home without her there and, despite the legal documents was really only allowed to come over on holidays. Also, she always took money from me during holidays. Anyway... after that point our relationship was good then bad, off and on for years. When I was 23  I got married to my wife and my mother made a scene at our wedding which lead to us not speaking for a year. I got stationed oversees and the relationship was... okay I guess. We welcomed our first child. Fast forward to 27 and I decide to do an at home DNA test. My dad wasn't showing as related to me. Obviously a massive blow to me in evert way. I felt like I lost my identity, who I was, where I belonged, my whole life was a lie. When I confronted her over text she denied denied denied ( she was a product of the same situation and found out at 27 too). I begged her to give me any info. She wouldn't, I asked her to please do it for my daughter, she wouldn't. We haven't spoken since. She is a nasty nasty toxic person. That was the first MAJOR blow to my mental health

Shortly afterward my married took a hit. I was caught talking to guys online and my wife found out. My indiscretions led to a crumbling marriage and was pushed to come out as bisexual. I still haven't accepted this for myself and don't know when I will. We have been working on things for over a year now since I was caught being unfaithful and my wife reminds me frequently of what I did and how much it hurt and hiw she wishes I feel the same pain. We got stationed to a new base overseas. 

Second MAJOR blow to my mental health

Earlier this year I was able to find my biological father after searching and searching with no help or info due to my mother's lack of transparency. He is actually awesome although I havent met him in person. Obviously my Dad took all of this news about this DNA test extremely hard and doesn't speak of it, but I feel like we have grown closer. He will always be my dad. 

The day I called my dad to tell him I found my biological father he stopped me and told me he had cancer. How could this be? I feel like we are closer and have so much more to do, so muxh more bonding. Over this past year he has steadily declined in health and now has a 20% of living. I havent seen my dad for more than a week in 4 years. My dad is dying and is crushes me. We decided to put in for a humanitarian move back to my hometown which has a base for me. It isn't approved yet but will allow me to be with my father for as long as he has left. I cry about this so much. 

Third MAJOR hit to my mental health. 

I decided I am going to better myself and get some help so i went to the mental health clinic to address my depression and anxiety. I am in therapy now and on meds but I don't feel like anything is working. I have lost most motivation to do anything, no energy, no joy (other than being a father which is the best thing to ever happen to me). I've gained like 20 pounds and just don't care anymore. My new base sucks, I hate work. I dont have any friends, marriage is still rocky, I cant stop thinking about the biological father thing, my relationship with my mother, my indiscretions, and my dad dying. 

I just want it all to go away. To pause. I want to be happy again. I wish I made better choices",18Nov2020,1

135,"For context I’m a female, always been a tomboy sort since a young child.  Also I’m an only child that has realised my mother has other nasty habits which is for a different post. 

This idea started when I was in my early teens and got harsher as I got older. As you can guess my mother was a single parent (father was absent but that’s a different story) and it started as “I don’t need a man, I have OP”. Over the years it turned into “OP is my husband, no need for a real man as got her”

She was not a fan of men after father (not sure why as the “truth” has a lot of holes of what really happened) and instead she pushed the “father/husband” stereotypes and role onto me. Even to a point she would introduce me as her “stand in husband” to strangers. Honestly back then I thought it was harmless or light humour but now I’m thinking was it normal? She has a lot of bad habits like being the golden child and throwing a tantrum if she’s not the centre of attention. At the same time she always find ways to ruin her own relationships/friendships. 

She was always extreme on letting me being social even as a child. I could never go to a friends house or even leave without her. The only times I could be away from her was with another family member but that was only for a few hours (3-7+ hours) at a time. I never made a proper friend till age 14/15 but was only allowed as they had special needs and mum thought it would make her look good if I had them as a friend. She ignored the fact I saw my friend as a sister and love who she is as a friend and person.

I have asked now around 6 times, surely I shouldn't have to amend every single contacts settings in my phone so they can get through the ""Do Not Disturb"" setting.

They happen mostly during the night but rarely during the day. These spells are strange.

She does have a bad fear of the dark. But lately I'm concerned because it scares me too sometimes.

142,"I worry I'm emotionally abusive because I want my boyfriend to get diagnosed. We've been together over 2 years and he gets really distressing POCD/incest OCD/racist/sexist and harm thoughts. He also tends to play devil's advocate and claims its his OCD and he can't help it because it makes him doubt his morals?

A year and a half ago, he ruined my family vacation by texting me a new confession every hour or 2. Really upsetting stuff like thinking Rachel is hotter or that he had sexual thoughts about his mom/cousin (intrusive i think?) or about all the women he sexted before me or how he loved incest porn as a young teen or how he pegged himself with a broom and toilet brush. Just constant. After a few weeks I told him he needed to stop confessing *right now*. It took weeks of me ignoring him for a few hours to stop. Some of the confessions really hurt like how he thought I was a loser a few times for having 400 followers on Instagram or that he thought I was ugly/he could do better a few times. He would never really apologise, it was always ""I'm sorry my OCD made me say it""/""I'm sorry you feel that way but its not my fault I have OCD"". It's never ""I'm sorry"". 

Things escalated after almost a year of him hiding the OCD. This summer, I begged and cried for him to get a diagnosis to prove to me he is safe to be around. This made his OCD worse because I had so little faith in him, which I think is abusive on my end and I feel terrible for it. I told him several times that  in good conscience, I couldn't marry/have kids with him if i wasn't certain he was innocent. He fell asleep arguing with me over this a few times, that's how repetitive it got. On my 21st birthday, we were staying at a hotel and he confessed some POCD thoughts and I started sobbing because I thought he was too selfish to give me one day of peace or to even get help. He told me to shut up in case anyone heard my crying. I sat crying in the bathroom for like 30 mins on my bday, before he apolosgied.  I still can't believe it but after the ""sorry its my OCD can't help it"" apology, I called him a ""f***ing AH"" and threw a wet cotton pad in his direction. As it flew through the air I immediately regretted it and thought ""wtf when did I become this monster?"". He laughed it off but I still think this 100% crossed the line. I've stopped asking him to get help and his confessions have lessened a lot but I still wish he'd get help as I knew a relapse is inevitable. Have I been emotionally abusive to him?

146,"I [17M] have been having intrusive thoughts lately. Even though most of the time they aren’t anything disturbing or weird (Though occasionally they are), they seem to completely highjack my ability to think for a short period of time, constantly popping up and making it very difficult for me to stop thinking about whatever the intrusive thought was. This is really starting to get on my nerves, and I’m usually a fairly calm and patient person, or at least I try to be.

There is one in particular, which is about a poorly written finally to a book series I had become really invested in. Normally it doesn’t bother me, beyond the usual very minor disappointment you’d get from that as I’m not the kind of person to freak out over a made up story, but because whenever I try to think about anything that thought will just pop into my head, it’s starting to really annoy me. I’m more mad at the fact that the goddamn though keeps popping into my head more than anything, and there are other intrusive thoughts, but this is one of the more common ones so I thought I’d use it as an example. 

These intrusive thoughts are kinda stopping me from being able to meditate, which could be a problem as meditation is an important coping strategy for me to deal with my anxiety.

160,"Apologies in advance for the novel —

I underwent same-day minor surgery with general anesthesia on Monday morning, and have since been feeling intense anger, directed specifically toward my surgeon and his team.

In an attempt to stay educated prior to my surgery, I read a LOT online. I read about how surgeons have an innate financial bias because, in the US, they make about 10x more money for surgeries, rather than for resolving an issue more conservatively. I also read how lots of surgeons make minor mistakes but don’t tell the patient because it doesn’t impact their health and they don’t want to cause “unnecessary stress”, which, in my opinion, isn’t their decision to make. In fact, it’s incredibly unethical.

During the prep-phase, before being rolled into the OR, I couldn’t help but be infuriated at how much they were treating me like a child and how vulnerable I felt. (I’m a 28 y/o guy, btw). Stuff like, “It’ll be okay. Just relax. You HAVE to eat these crackers. You can’t leave by yourself.” Logically, I know they’re just doing their jobs, but emotionally, it absolutely pisses me off. 

To be clear, I’ve had an unshakable distrust in the medical community for most of my life. My mother’s been an opiate addict for decades because she ALWAYS finds a doctor to give them to her, even though she doesn’t need them. So, why are patients just expected to put blind faith in their doctors? There are horrible, selfish people in every field. The reason I chose my surgeon was because he was recommended by four different institutions, so I don’t think, at this point, that I’d have been able to “find a doctor I can trust.” 

With all that said, I don’t *want* to be angry at my medical providers. It makes me feel like shit, and it’s probably not great for my healing process either. But I don’t know how to leave those feelings behind. Like most people, it’s very likely I’m going to have to see doctors again at some point, and I absolutely do want to trust them with my health.

167,"Background story: I'm from a country where psychotherapy is not really a thing and exists only in big cities. I'm currently studying abroad so I don't live with my family. I suppose my mom (47) has IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder). She also has heart problem, I don't know if it's genetic but her aunt and my grandma also have heart problem and anger issues . Again, we don't have access to a psychotherapist but it's my assumption from observing her behaviour in the last 7-8 years: she easily gets angry, mostly because something doesn't go the way she wants, and she can't control her anger. She'll start using very offensive language, throw/smash things in the house, sometimes hurt herself or others. When she calms down, she often gets sick, has headache and regrets what she did.

My sister's been exposed to mom's aggressive behaviours since she was 8, so it must've affected her. She told me that recently she can't control her anger, she'll throw things, yell or curse (can't control what she says) and even thinks of hurting herself. She and I both think that it's somewhat similar to mom's behaviour. 

I try to talk to her, calm her down and encourage her to think positively (my sister doesn't wanna talk to our parents about this). However I don't live with my family so I don't know what else I can do for her. I would appreciate your suggestions and comments on this!!",18Nov2020,1

179,"I'm 20 years old 

  
Something is not right with me and I cannot seem to figure out what it is. Ever since a few years i've been extremely anxious about a lot of things. Example: asking a grocery store worker where to find certain things is almost impossible for me. I also have problems with going to physical stores that I have not been too before, same with restaurants. Not too sure where issues like these come from but i've really been struggling with this, especially now that i'm doing an internship at a school and I start to feel physically anxious when I need to correct or be harsh to students. It's like feeling afraid without knowing what I am really even afraid off. 

I've also been experiencing mood swings. I'll feel happy and excited to move forward one day, but then another day I shut down and get stuck in my own thoughts. By far the most amazing thing in my life right now is my girlfriend and i'm really afraid these patterns of behavior that i've been finding myself in will impact this relationship.

I also have no idea how to start and finish projects anymore. I get stuck in many wonderful ideas but i can never really seem to put them into practice. All i've been doing for the past year is just smoke weed and get through the day chilling with my girlfriend, watching movies and most of all: Browsing Reddit. Now that i'm finally being productive again by doing an important internship for my study I cannot even feel motivated for this anymore because every lesson is dreading to me since I always feel so anxious. 

I've also gotten into the habit of buying expensive clothes. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with anything, but one of the most fun things for me to do is sign up for raffles and limited brand drops to buy clothes. It brings me enjoyment and i don't even know why.

I felt betrayed and more heartbroken than I was already. People around me say she didn’t care about the relationship,and she says she does. 

I don’t know what to think about it anymore. What’s worst is that I have self destructive tendencies that I can’t let go for some reason. Whenever I feel down, I usually think very negatively about myself and that everything is my fault, and that affects everyone around me. One day I’d be happy the next I’d be sad.

More on myself now rather from others, that I have established such a negative view of myself. I barely eat, I have a lot of trouble sleeping, but my grades are good. 

I have this final project for my fashion design course due today, and I have been working on it, there has just been so much other stuff going on that throws me into such a deep depression that I have to distract myself.

190,"I’ve struggled with mental health most of my childhood/adulthood but I’ve never felt so unstable. I grew up in a very traumatic situation and my whole childhood was spent with the ideal that once I got out I would be fine. After graduating high school I bounced around finding jobs in different states but always returning home due to financial reasons. 

Recently I moved away again but don’t have any safety nets due to cut ties/lack of support. The past few years I haven’t thought about what I was doing or how I was building my future and I am stuck in this vicious cycle. I feel completely lost to myself. I don’t know myself anymore. I can’t trust my opinions or thoughts because of extreme intrusive thoughts/ anxiety attacks. My emotions do not feel like my own. I am the passenger in my own life. I feel like I don’t have control. If I try and change my situation I generally act impulsively and make very strongly opinionated decisions that in a year or so down the road completely regret due to me making decisions out of a very triggered place. Which leads to me cutting out good people, good jobs, ect. Which is why I can’t trust myself. 

My confidence had dwindled in the last couple of years. I don’t feel confident in getting jobs, talking to people. I am completely shutting down and I am living in a car with my partner. It is very difficult to try and take care of myself living in a car. 

I have tried seeing several different therapists. Each was like a really shitty date in their own way. I have spent almost a grand trying to get help and feel like I’m wasting money. I’m not at a point where I can spend money like that at the moment and am turning to y’all. 

I have extreme ADHD(not medicated) and am at a place with myself where I feel I strongly need some medication. But again I am not in a place where I can afford this. 

I am so tired. I am so frustrated. My days are miserable. Whatever I am doing I do not enjoy. I am anxious, depressed, and I can’t remember shit which makes me not know who I am. 

I keep expecting my parents to finally show up and be parents and I don’t know how to let go of that. They’re not there. 

I don’t know what to do. I am stuck in these cycles reacting on shit that happened ten fifteen years ago. I don’t know how to be consistently present.

193,"Over the last 18 months or so I hadn’t been doing too good, but a few weeks ago, everything started to turn around.

I didn’t have any close friends, I was struggling to make some, I thought no one liked me or cared about me, and the ones who did were just pretending, I’m very pessimistic, I was very irritable and I argued with my parents a lot. Throughout most of last month, all that was starting to make me very anxious and a little depressed. To the point where I was frequently having what may have been panic attacks, and it even turned into crying a couple of times... But then, something happened which changed a lot of that...mostly.

Towards the end of last month, a friend of mine (who wasn’t close then) noticed something was up, so he asked what was wrong. We had a long conversation about it, where I opened up to him about everything. He said he used to be like me, pessimistic, friendless, and unable to make friends. But today, he’s full of optimism and positive energy (maybe a little too much at times, lol) and he’s able to make friends with just about anyone. In saying that, he wanted to help me out. Since then, we’ve only become closer and closer. The only friends I ever had never cared about me much at all. To have him show that he truly cares about me brings tears to my eyes. For once in my life, I can finally say I have a true friend!

But not everything’s been perfect. A week later, I was in a car accident. No one was hurt (apart from the other driver having a little chest pain at first, but I think she was fine after paramedics checked her), but both my car and the other car have since been written-off, and I was put at fault... (my car went sideways under heavy braking for some reason, which caused it to hit the other car next to me, and yes, it had ABS). Being young, my insurance excess is very, very expensive (thankfully they just took it out of the insurance payout this time), and on top of that I currently don’t have a car. Until I buy a new car I have to rely on public transport, which is terrible in my area...

After my dad picked me up from where the accident happened, and while at the scene, we were both talking in a calm manner. But when we got home, we started talking about it with mum. Then, a lot of stuff went down (not from mum, probably me)... There was arguing, yelling, and at one point, physical violence. After all that, I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. I had the perfect day with my friend and a few others, then that accident happened on my way home and ruined it... For the next few days, I was depressed again... Almost like I was back to square one. I’m not too bad atm though.

I’ve considered getting help before that conversation with my friend, but now I don’t know if I need to. During that conversation, I brought up my mental health, and my friend said I may have some form of anxiety and depression, which is exactly what I was thinking. It seems to go up and down at times, so should I still seek professional help? I’m already seeing a counsellor btw.",18Nov2020,1

195,"Recently, I (19F) have been getting worried about my college friend's (18F) mental health. I think it's becoming worse ever since we started college together, but I don't know what else I can do to help. Below is a list of instances (in chronological order) about her mental health that I hope will give context:

* In freshman year, she started to have suicidal thoughts (around 6-7 months after college started). Our group of friends and I advised her to go to the school's counseling center (we have free therapy sessions at our college). She did and said the counselors did not help her. Eventually, she was busy with school and push her suicidal thoughts under the rug.
* In freshman + sophomore year, she often discussed with me a lot of depressing and anxious thoughts about school. She also started to have some mental breakdowns. I advised her to maybe take fewer college classes (she takes 5-6 classes per semester + is in a few clubs), but she said that's difficult considering she is a nursing major. 
* In junior year (present-day), her mental health is at a low point. She complains to me a lot about her stressed schedule and being anxious about her assignments. 
* (Present Day) With her boyfriend (in a relationship since freshman year), she starts to get angry verbally and sometimes physically (e.g. throwing objects on the ground but not at him)  at the boyfriend. 
* (Present Day) Her suicidal thoughts are getting more intense. Last time she tried to cut herself with scissors but failed to do so (no cuts or bleeding). Her boyfriend has now put anything sharp away from her reach.
* (Present day) She did say that she has been in contact with a psychologist/counselor, who has prescribed her some meds to calm her anxieties and combat depression, but she is not reacting to it well and has been struggling to sleep for most nights.
* (Present day) A few days ago, she also told me that she might have a binge eating disorder due to her stress eating from anxiety/depression. I was doubtful at first, but considering her history of mental health, now I am worried.

In general, I think my friend's mental health is declining and I'm worried that she will go down further on a destructive path. Although I tried to be there for her and give her advice, I don't know what I can do to help considering that I am living in a different state now.

196,"Honestly, tl;dr right there in the title, but for context: growing up, and well into my twenties, my parents called me a hypochondriac whenever I was sick with anything. I have a twin sister with severe medical issues that needed constant attention, so I think they thought I would fake being ill for attention, or maybe they just didn't have the money for me. Obviously, this has caused several issues, the biggest being that I have come to ignore or downplay illnesses, I constantly fear that I'm faking my symptoms or that people think I'm lying, and have a very hard time seeing and talking to a doctor.

Furthermore, it seems like every doctor I try to talk to ignores me when I ask for help. The biggest help I've ever received was when I admitted that I was depressed, but any other illness or injury is scoffed at. If I'm suffering, it's obviously because I'm overweight. Weirdly high white blood cell count? Overweight. Arthritis in every joint of my body? Lose weight. Severe vitamin D deficiency? Obesity, obviously. Nauseous and pain in my gut every day, long bouts of constant diarrhea followed by constipation? Have you tried losing weight?

I'm starting to think it's me; maybe because I come off as someone who assumes everyone thinks I'm lying, I could be leading them to think that I am? I also just can't seem to describe my symptoms in ways that doctors understand (but random people on the internet do??).

He doesn't sleep at night although he wants to sleep at night. He tried to fix it but in vain and I don't think he will be able to fix it by himself. He needs someone. 

He is also mentally unstable and um has a death wish. He is in a very bad condition and all I want is to help him but I cannot figure out ways how.

I know this year has been hard for so many and we have all been affected by COVID. 2020 has seriously sucked. I’ve experienced mild depression and I suffer from anxiety but this feeling I’ve had these past months is something I’ve never felt before. Combined with just graduating and entering the work force amid a pandemic... I feel completely empty like there is nothing to look forward to and no way of differentiating one day from the next. I think I’ve lost hope, passion? I’m not sure how to describe it. 

It’s a combination of finally entering the work force (I was lucky enough to get a job during COVID), getting rejected from my top choice law schools, seeing my friends go on to study what I’ve been working so hard to get into, and then (of course) seeing the financial, physical and mental toll COVID has taken on myself, my family (especially) and my friends. 

There is literally nothing in the foreseeable future to look forward to and it’s bleak.

I’ve tried to stay positive (towards the start I was one of those who convinced themselves COVID could be a “good thing” (I hope you know what I mean when I say this - not ignoring the deaths, illnesses, stress etc.) but now I can’t pull at any positives from this experience. I haven’t gotten fit, I haven’t started studying for the LSAT so I could give law another try... I’m just here. And from the often short conversations with friends (“how are you” “good - nothing different same as last week”) they too are just here.

Just seeing people on the commute to work, interacting with the barista while grabbing a coffee, petting dogs are you cross their path and asking their owner how old they are... it was all human interaction that I didn’t realize I (we) needed. They weren’t just nice encounters... they gave me energy. Days where I was really feeling my outfit and noticed people looking (they probably weren’t but let’s pretend) gave me confidence. Funny interactions i witnessed on the bus gave me stories to tell friends over drinks. 

I know it’s a bit of a “well this is what we have to do...suck it up” situation. But I’m trying to really come to terms with these feelings that I’ve pushed aside for so long. Things are not okay and knowing they won’t be for so many for a while is devastating. 

Anyways if anyone’s still reading I hope you were able to relate to this in some way. I know my perspective right now is pessimistic - trust me when I say I wish it wasn’t. If you have any tips for how to change my outlook on this whole situation I will take anything. 

Hope you’re all staying safe, healthy and being kind to each other.",18Nov2020,1

212,"Hi !

So I've been having episodes where I am very depressed for the past year (no motivation, no enjoyment in anything I usually like, crying a lot randomly and struggling to identify/manage my emotions, can't focus and work correctly). I am getting very tired of being in this state. I also have anxiety issues with random panic attacks.

My question is : how do you know you might start to suffer from depression, or whether you're having a rough time momentarily ?

When I do try to talk about how I feel with my boyfriend or my family, they're usually telling me to focus on how good my life is compared to others (still have a job, no money issues and nice apartment) and telling me it's momentary. It makes my feel guilty about feeling bad as I don't have specific reasons to feel depressed or anxious. It really makes me question how I actually feel and whether I'm giving too much attention to the moments where I feel bad. I'm considering seeing a therapist but I'm wondering if I actually need it and I'm worried about having to explain it to people close to me.",18Nov2020,3
213,"TW; suicidal conversations/actions

Posting on a throwaway cause some of my roommates are on reddit

I (24f) live in a house with my boyfriend (25m) and his friends (25m's) and last night they were having a casual conversation in the kitchen that turned into ways to kill yourself. That's the part of it I walked into while making dinner. They talked about everything from carbon monoxide poisoning to jumping off a bridge. They talked about the ways they'd kill themselves if they had to then suddenly asked me if I had thought about how I'd kill myself and I just froze up and said I can't say I've thought about it before. One of my other roommates was in the living room and yelled in he didn't like the conversation they were having but they continued on anyway. Eventually it just kinda fizzled out but not before I finished cooking. I don't know why I didn't just immediately walk out when I heard what they were talking about.

Now for the reasons this was triggering for me:
1. They brought up trying to kill yourself with Tylenol which doesn't work: which is how I had tried to take my own life in highschool 9 years ago as of November 15th (3 days before this), panicked and threw it up immediately after (I still can't take that kind of medication) 
2. Talked about jumping off a bridge: a lost a friend to suicide that way within the past 5 years 
3. Asking me how I'd kill myself: upsetting for obvious reasons

Reasons I have no one to talk to about it:
The only person that really knows what happened is my bf and I know if I told him he'd be pretty pissed at them for it (he wasn't in the kitchen when this was happening) and I don't want to start that kind of drama in the house. I'm not ready for this to really be out there, don't know if I ever will be. Another reason is my best friend (who doesn't know about the suicide attempt) is dating one of the guys who was in the conversation so I feel like I couldn't go tell her even if she knew. 

So I need help as to how to cope with this situation, I'd go stay with someone for a couple days but a) covid and b) I feel like I couldn't just leave with talking about why I'm upset.

I'm doing okay and am not a risk to myself as of right now. Sorry if this was kinda long/messy

TIA

Edit to add: I feel really uncomfortable now being around them for fear of conversations like these coming up again does anyone have tips for helping to overcome that?

Edit to add 2: would it be worth it to talk to even just the roommate who asked me how I would kill myself about being careful about asking those kinds of questions to",18Nov2020,1

215,"Examples: 
●  I like this song so I share it with them but their reaction is not enthusiastic enough. I'd feel ashamed after and overthink about replaying their reaction in my head. I'd think my taste in music is bad and I wouldn't be able to enjoy the song after this event.
● I'm into this new hobby and I'd say it to them. Again if their reaction is not enthusiastic enough then my taste in things are bad. I won't be able to do it in public spaces again and probably hide in my room. The level of enjoyment decreases. Sometimes I feel so bad about it that I'd drop the hobby alltogether.
● When I try conversing with other people and they smile, I'd feel like they're laughing at me privately. My mind would go to lenghts thinking that they'd tell other people about me and that they would all isolate me.

Not sharing directly w/ a person but sharing a public space:
● I'd feel off or sick after expressing myself in public.
● I'd also feel sick after catching a glimpse of myself in the mirror and their are other people around.

217,"Hey Guys,

So I have this issue. I'm stuck inside my head. Even when I'm performing tasks, the inner noise goes on. It can become so ""loud"" that I'm not present at all with what I'm doing; leading to mistakes and disappointment with myself, as well as from my bosses, peers and friends. This is a very frustrating reality, but I'm dedicated to coming outside of myself and engaging fully with my surroundings. I feel that there must be some sort of blockage that keeps me trapped in my head, but I have trouble defining what that blockage is. I take accountability for the blockage, as I feel it's self created. 

I know I'm far from the only person that deals with this, but I'm curious to hear how other people overcome this issue and live on to lead productive and successful lives. I know if I don't work towards a better self now, this will remain an issue and grow more frustrating and inhibiting with time.

I’m in the US and my psychiatrist just prescribed guanfacine. I asked him to prescribe strattera instead because I have low blood pressure. His response was that I need to get a test of my liver functioning before he could prescribe it.

He’s been really weird lately with missing phone appointments and being inconsistent about whether or not he can prescribe anything (I asked him last year if he could prescribe something for ADHD and he said no, but now he says yes). 

I have not been able to find any information to suggest that it’s normal to require a liver test before prescribing strattera (from what I could find there’s been like 2 cases of liver problems? Ever? I think?). 

I’m 21 and have not had liver problems before, and don’t have a family history of them. I’ll do the test because it was already ordered as part of a panel for something else, but I have a serious fear of getting my blood drawn so if it wasn’t for that I would absolutely refuse.

So I just want to know if this is normal? Is there any actual reason why he would claim that my liver functioning has to be tested before prescribing this? Has anyone else been told this?",18Nov2020,2

Hes only been in childrens hospital for a week. He continues to call me and hes definetly getting better. Hes now coherent and can have a conversation.

237,"I just turned 30 this past Sunday. It's one of those milestone days in a person's life. One that marks the time to settle down, stop acting like a child, and finally become an adult. That was never really a problem for me since I never really liked going out and I have always maintained long term employment. I wouldn't say career because I don't see myself doing this for another 20 years and really see it as more of a means to an end. I put some long term goals in place a couple years ago and have since seen my credit score go up nearly 100 points, I have a small but growing investment portfolio, and plans to start buying real estate next year. On paper, everything looks good. In reality though, I am very depressed. I spent my whole birthday contemplating suicide. I began examining the various aspects of my life, and didn't like what I found.

Sure I have a steady job, one that seems to be recession proof and was unaffected by the covid pandemic, but I honestly hate it. It's just paperwork for the sake of paperwork. I've been here for 7 years and I want to quit sooo bad, but that seems like a horrible idea in the current environment. I would also feel horrible about screwing over my coworkers. I work for a small company with less than 10 employees and we're in real estate, specifically title research. Since the pandemic, we've actually gotten busier as people are buying new homes and refinancing mortgages on one end, and other people are being evicted and foreclosed on. We get work either way, and while this is supposed to be our slow part of the year, we are actually busier now than we were last summer, which is our busiest time of year. If I quit now, everyone in the office would suffer for it. People are already having anxiety problems, and that would just make it so much worse, so I feel stuck here.

As far as financials go, I have enough money to pay my bills and then some, which is more than a lot of people can say right now, and I'm definitely grateful for it. I made my plan to get into real estate a few years ago but needed to get things set up first. I spent a whole year working on building my credit and then set about putting together a down payment to buy a rental. Now that I'm on the verge of buying my own place, I just lost all passion for it. I used to constantly look online at places for sale. I would spend hours running numbers to evaluate deals and see what ones were good or not. Now, I haven't looked a deal in months and I don't even want to.

Emotionally, I have a family that I talk to, but not about really important things. I'm not especially close with anyone and the only people I've ever opened to have left me or used me, so I just don't do that anymore. For the longest time I thought that if I could be happy with myself, then that would be an attractive quality for someone to see in me. For years I tried and I thought I was happy, but lately I've realized it's been a hollow joy. What's the point of being happy by yourself? Looking back, I may have been happy in the moment, but the memories are cold, distant things. Like watching a movie. I see myself in my mind, I was happy then, and recognize the feeling, but I don't feel it myself in the present. When I look back at times with others though, I have feelings attached to those memories. After examing everything, I've decided that without someone to share everything with, joy is just a fleeting, shallow thing. It is temporary at best. I can't seem to find anyone and this fuels my depression which makes things worse.

5 years ago I was in a relationship with someone I truly loved and I planned on marrying. The left me because they said they felt like I didn't care and that I should have tried harder. I opened up to them more than anyone else in my life, and sacrificed so much for them, for us, and to be told they didn't feel it and that my best wasn't enough broke me. Since then I've gained like 40 lbs and just stopped caring about everything. I know that I have a lot going for me, I just can't seem to actually care about anything.

238,"I struggle with anxiety, PTSD and depression. Unfortunately wearing a face mask actually causes really bad episodes to the point I get extremely dizzy and unable to focus. I feel guilty that I can't wear face masks even though it's literally out of my control because of how my brain works.

239,"I (23F) know I'm wrong, and I know most people don't feel this way. But sex has always made me feel dirty cheap. Whenever I think of sex it's something dirty, private, disgusting, and wrong. It makes me feel exposed and weak, and the few times I want sex I am quickly overcome by feelings of guilt and shame. Bc I must be disgusting and wrong to want such a thing. 
Sex has to me always been something that I ""must do"" to keep my partners happy, not because it's something I want. It feels like a chore.

Now, being in a good, healthy relationship, I wish I knew how to not feel this way. I am trying to work on it, I'm just not quite sure how. Talking about sex is unnatural to me,  and I don't know how to express my thoughts and feelings. It's like a mental block stopping me from opening my mouth. All those intrusive, negative thoughts spins and makes me feel like shit anytime I try. It's just a terrible spiral.

I've tried speaking to my partner, but he doesn't get it.  Not that I know how to accurately describe my feelings. He has always had very positive experiences with sex, and has confided in me that his two last relationships was mostly based on sex. Given my very limited and mostly not great experience with sex, it has made me even more insecure. I'm struggling, and I don't know what to do.

I just need to know I can improve, and that I don't have to feel like this forever.",18Nov2020,1
240,"I had just left the Ukrainain army after completing my service, I had found my girlfriend had left me and moved away with a different person without me knowing, it broke my heart so I decided to start fresh. I moved to Australia where I struggled with addiction and I hated my job, I thought about suicide a lot. But that's when I stopped and looked at my life and thought ""what am I doing"". If you want to get out a hole first put down the shovel, I decided to join a support group and soon things started to Improve, I was surrounded with amazing people who listened and helped, I soon stopped my addiction after I realized it was doing more bad than good, I also left my job and pursued something I enjoyed. I also met an amazing girl and we started dating, a few years later we're married and I'm a happy stepdad to 2 kids.

241,"i’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I can’t find any other place to ask. 

so some background:
My grandma has been staying in a guest room that i once used. She has been using my bed frame, mattress and dresser. Now i can’t use it and i can’t explain why. It just makes me so angry thinking that someone used MY things, I tried explaining this to my family but they just ask “You have no problem staying in one place? You use my stuff when i moved out, What’s the problem?” 
This could have started with my parents always walking into my room unannounced and my room has always been my safe space, so now when someone uses my old things i can’t put together it’s a safe thing now. 

I just can’t piece together why i can’t use the old stuff and now i have to explain to my grandpa who doesn’t understand some things, what my problem is with that room and why i can’t be in there yet. I’m just so confused and i’m freaking out having to explain this all.",18Nov2020,1

The first two times she tried visiting a psychologist,but that didn't do any good. This time, she tried going to psychiatric hospital and, as she tells, she literally escaped from there. She says that although she was there with the diagnosis of depression, the personell treated her as though she was completely mad, and they gave her pills which were literal drugs and though she's out for 3 days, the effects haven't worn off yet and her pupils are still dilated. She lives in Russia, where the quality of the medical care(especially that relating to mental health) is not in the best condition. I was the one to encourage her to take a medical approach to problem and i was the one to ensure her that ""sooner or later it will be better"".

248,"Trans Being. Being Trans. Grateful. Exhausting. Divine. Proud. Sadness. Pain. Lack of Being in the body that I am currently Living in. Dysphoria at every given second to the point that i'm Hurting........Broken........Healing.

This is something that is a daily struggle, daily strength. I am learning to make peace with the things that I can not change in this very moment, that will change with time; my facial hair, my body parts, wearing what I want, accepting myself for me and embracing the empowerment that comes with that. Its difficult but I know that this is my purpose, this is meant for me and honestly I'd rather it no other way.

Being grateful for the ones who understand from the get go and learning to have compassion and empathy for the ones that it might take a lot more work and a lot more time with, my parents, distant family etc. Some days it feels like too much, some days im exhausted from the minute I have risen. 1:11. Make a wish. I know this all apart of my purpose and journey. Its greater than right now by living in the present.

Remember, its ok to feel tired, its ok to admit that I don't feel good today because their is always a higher reason for all of this. Sun shining, break through the clouds. Something I realized the other day is that in the midst of the worst storm possible, the blue sky hasn't ran away, its lingering behind the clouds, the Sun is still there, it hasn't gone anywhere. Its about Perspective and Self Awareness, to feel all the feels and sit in them but as well as, to know that this will only last for a short period of time. With the back end of Growth, Self Love, Self Fulfillment, Abundance and Miracles. God, Thank you For it All.

I love you.

I couldn’t put my mask properly because I had my teddy bear in my arms. It’s not a big teddy bear so I don’t understand why I couldn’t just use one hand to put my mask on.

No matter how much sleep I get, I always want more. I’ve implemented exercise into my lifestyle, but it doesn’t make a significant difference.

I didn't get any diagnosis and counseling because I'm broke, can't afford the therapy and stuff. Plus I am pessimistic of the treatment and the idea of talking about my dark identity to a complete stranger. 

Last night I had a dream. I visited a psychologist. He was very attentive and supportive of me. I vented out to him without any fear or regret. That's not so typical of me irl. I can still see his face, how focused he was when listening to me. 
Later on he introduced me to a mental health talk group. There were a bunch if other similar people going through some same shit. It was quite a pleasant experience (though in my subconscious mind). It made me cry in the morning. I feel truly happy by myself after ages. 

It made me feel positive of getting a diagnosis and treatment. I feel that I too can get better. But the financial problem is still lurking. Neither I've enough money nor do I trust people around me to get open up. I genuinely wants to come out of it. If anyone out there have any advice or suggestion, please write that down for me.

Now I am 25 and I have put on some weight (about 20lbs in the last year). I don’t use tanning beds anymore. My hair is shorter/thinner and I have dark shadows under my eyes. I don’t really wear much make up/don’t know how and i don’t have the nicest clothes or style. I don’t get any attention from men, or anyone and I just feel like I’ve totally lost my identity. I have a boyfriend who has totally lost interest in me sexually (although he would never admit it). He avoids sex, never compliments my appearance and I feel he is embarrassed by me. 

I feel so insecure. And the worst part is I know in my rational side of my brain that attractiveness and beauty should not wholly comprise your self worth. But I don’t feel like I have anything else to fall back on other than my looks which have gone. this is so deeply ingrained I just don’t know how to get out of it and move on and accept I’m not attractive anymore but that that’s ok.

262,"it's been a very long time, many years, of trying to put myself out there, try different groups in person mainly, but also, online forums, subreddits, etc, but unfortunately, i can't seem to find anyone similar enough and i just don't know where to go / look in relating to people and feel a proper connection. 

brief history on myself, i started seeking mental health services in 2011, because simply at that point, right after high school, where the feeling not right / frustration, depression or w.e became more problematic, and at first i was only diagnosed with vague terms of ""Anxiety"" and ""Depression"", but i obviously knew my struggles and impairments were more than just that. 

a few years later, i saw a different psychologist, who for the first time, diagnosed me with schizotypal personality disorder and major depression, at the time, i didn't think i even came across schizotypal PD, despite doing lots of researching of my own. ironically, before the StPD diagnosis, i thought i suffered from borderline personality disorder, mainly because i was looking at symptoms such as ""boredom"", ""anger"", ""emptiness"", etc, but over time and up to this point, i realized that the ""boredom"", ""anger"", and ""emptiness"" i had was not in any shape or form the same thing that people i met that actually were diagnosed with Borderline PD were like or had. likewise, the encounters i had in person and online with those who had borderline PD caused me a lot of distress, as i didn't like them / relate to them, and envied them highly. 

i have tried many online different online forums in different thread areas, and all i ended up finding was also the same unpleasant experiences i had in person in the mental health groups i attended, the same type of people with the same sorts of beliefs / experiences or viewpoints about things that i didn't agree with or relate to, and sometimes the same sort of belittlement / disrespect i would get online too. the groups i attended in person up to this point were NAMI, DBSA, local wellness centers, kaiser case management created groups, random groups for depression or other conditions, and others. online, i've tried [mentalhealthforums.net](https://mentalhealthforums.net), psychforums, reddit, yahooanswers ( very early on ), add forums, youtube, zoom and discord apps, etc. 

some other information about me is that a male ISFJ personality, age 27. i regularly have been seeing my same psychologist for the last 2 years or so, so at least i have that at bare minimum, but outside that, i do not get any other functional / relatable measures. i'm eager to share more specific information, provided i have someone ask a relevant enough / good question and follow up. also, on diagnosis, i feel like personality disorder NOS may be a better fit for me, unfortunately, support for this is almost non existent, because there is little to no active discussion for people in this domain, and trying to bring this up would be poor, because there is simply a lack of diverse population to begin with. the only other condition perhaps could be for further discussion is sluggish cognitive tempo, but even for that, i do not feel the connection with the communities that have been populated around it so far.",18Nov2020,1

Sometimes I go through bouts of depression where I cant seem to follow through with goals, stay on task, and generally feel down about life and relationships. A lot of times I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around people. I've dealt with this since childhood and always thought this was just how life works.

He has recently been saying he thinks he has an OCD problem and I want to try and help him. He has always been very tidy and obsessed with cleaning, he can't stand any mess and is very phobic of mud and dirt. 

He is also a perfectionist when it comes to DIY and will redo any job until its absolutely perfect and cannot relax until he is finished and this is more the issue. 

He recently got new windows fitted and has now, a few months later, noticed a fingerprint on the inside of the glass and has fixated on it. He got a quote for the whole window to be replaced (apparently the only fix for this) and it will be £240 and he is considering paying it. He realises this is absurd for a mark that most people cannot even see when it is pointed out to them but he cannot forget it.

276,"Hey. You read the title, you probably don't know what I'm talking about, so sit back, relax, and listen to my story. IDK if anyone will see this but I just feel like writing a diary entry and share it. So here we go.

Let me give you a little context about me. I'm a 16-year-old who likes art and math I guess, that's how I usually describe myself. I've had some teenage angst periods from 13 to 15, where I frankly don't know what happened. I have the worst memory of concrete details except when it comes to some random sad/hurtful things. I have many memories I have internalized, such as (I don't know if this was real or a dream that I had ) when my best friend, a few years ago, told me that I seem nice when you start talking to me, but if you get to know me better, you're not as nice or something like that.

My whole life feels like a paradox. I genuinely do not remember the last time I felt love towards something/someone (except my mom, brothers, and best friend), yet I occasionally have sleepless nights thinking about love. Sometimes, though, I feel a real fatherly connection to my drawings, which may be weird.

I'm usually aware of my problems, but I rarely know how to solve them. I have been fat for my whole life and despite some tries of losing weight, It's been over a year since I worked out. I'm socially inept most of the time with my heart racing when I talk with someone I usually don't talk to, but I can't for the life of me fix that.   Many times I feel like my friends from high school don't actually want to talk to me because I'm weird and anxious all the time.

And then there is my superiority complex. This is probably one of my biggest problems I feel. My friends at school most of the time label me as the smartest one in class, the problem is I am both aware of this and not at the same time. I am usually ashamed of the top scores I get. I got 800/800 SAT math and am soon getting my full TOEFL score (4 sections: first two sections I got 28/30, 30/30, and am waiting for the rest). I usually don't say anything unless asked or I just lie and say that I got lower scores. I feel like I'm good at art, I feel pride in my drawings, but I also know that I can improve. 

With all that said, one part of me just hopes that this whole thing is just puberty and I'll just grow out of it, but I doubt it. I seriously don't know what is wrong with me, but I can only guess, and I guess that I am some kind of sociopath with anxiety. What do you think?",18Nov2020,2

278,"Tdlr: I hurt one of my best friends feelings. The though of me hurting his feelings made me anxious and I had no appetite and every time the thought of hurting him crossed my mind I had to threw up. Even though I apologised and he told me all was good, I knew he was lying. So when everything was okay again and we talked like before that incident everything went back to normal. The anxiousness and the urge to throw up went away. Now two weeks later, the though of him or someone mentioning his name, makes me anxious and want to throw up again. Wtf is wrong with me ? Shouldn’t be everything be back to normal ? 

I (F,21) have been feeling pretty bad the last few weeks. I hurt some of best friends feelings. It was so bad, he didn’t talk to me at all and he has been really distant. Wich is extra depressing since we used to talk to each other every day. I apologised to him, several times. He told me its all good, wich I know was a lie. A mutual friend of us  told me that he has been really hurt since then. He told him he didn’t think I would hurt his feelings ever, especially since we knew eachother for several months and used to talk every single day. We laught together and talked about our ups and downs in daily life. Everything you could think off a good friendship is made off.
Well he was quiet and distant for a few days and these days were the worst. I don’t know why but just the though of hurting his feelings and that this friendship is never going to be the same made me really anxious. It was so bad I couldn’t even eat and every time I would think of him I had to threw up. It was really bad so I wrote him a text apologising and telling him how much I appreciate him and all the time we had together was special to me and that I would never do something to hurt his feelings intentionally. So we met up with our mutual friend. I apologised again. He told he would be over it. Mind you, he didn’t tell me at all that he was hurt and why my words hurt his feelings so bad. Our mutual friend told me what was going on. Nonetheless, since then  it’s been like before that incident. All has been good. All the anxiousness and the throw ups have been gone since. Now, two weeks later, I do have the same symptoms as before. I get anxious and want to threw when the thought of him crosses my mind or when someone mentions his name. Wtf ist wrong ? Everything was fine. Why did this affect me so much at the time ?  And why is it still affecting me so much now that everything is fine ? It’s just exhausting and I think I lost a pound or two or even three. Can someone tell me how to cope with that ? I really need help",18Nov2020,1

280,"I am spent.

It absolutely feels like I am running on fumes these days, and, as we head towards the end of this hellscape of a year, I am most certainly feeling burnt out.

And the worst part is that it’s not concentrated from one thing. It seems to be everything that’s feeding it. It’s the election. It’s Covid. It’s the daily helping of bullshit that seems to get served up without fail. It’s life across the board right now, and it’s exhausting.

When you’re feeling this drained, it’s hard to find motivation to accomplish anything, because both your body and mind are just telling you no... and guess what? That’s okay. It’s okay for you to tell yourself that you need a break. We don’t always have to be constantly be pushing past, hoping it’ll just go away.

Sometimes we just need to slow down, process everything that is happening around us and take some moments for us.

On my podcast this week, I decided to use my time to talk about the burnout I’m feeling right now, and really to let you know that I know you’re struggling with it, too. How could you not?

286,"Hello,

I have been struggling against something for a number of months that is a difficult and ongoing trauma. It’s destroyed my mental health and I am left consumed with anxiety all day long.

One of the worst and main symptoms contributing to my condition is that I continually think the worst will happen. I’m constantly terrified the trauma I’ve suffered will resurface and I will have to deal with it over and over again. The situation I went through is basically over with, but just small reminders place me in a position where I can hardly move and leave me terrified.

I constantly think the worst will happen. That this situation will resurface and my life will always be hell. In reality, it probably isn’t rational. But I can’t stop thinking this way.

Does anyone suffer from this or can relate? Perhaps there is a medical name for this type of thinking? 

I am at my wits end. At this point in my life the chances of my fears occurring are infinitely small and I know that my reasoning of the worst occurring is unreasonable, yet my mind believes them as a possible reality.",18Nov2020,1

Let's do this one without too much thinking and rationalizing, OK?

It will be worth it, I promise.

Afterwards, drop a comment or hit reply to share how it felt.

**Before you do this mirror exercise read this**

* Find a mirror where you can be alone and undisturbed
* Then look at yourself. Really, look into your eyesNo preening, no posing
* Breathe slowlyUnclench your jawEase your shoulders downUnclench your toesOne more breath

Now say to yourself:

&gt;I love you  
I am going to take care of you  
You're going to be OK

Yes, you can say it out loud.

No overthinking. Just do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**How did it feel?**

How did you see yourself?

Did you feel any tenderness towards the face in the mirror?

Did it feel strange or emotional, or just indifferent?

I don't know about you, but I felt like crying. In a good way.

It felt emotional and tender. Like a step towards accepting and loving myself.

I saw myself as a little vulnerable, but felt lighter afterwards. Like I was going to be OK.

That's why I am sharing this with you.

297,"I""m not going to get into super detail here, but basically my boyfriend is going through some really rough times right now, and I want to be there and do as much as I can. He's experiencing heart clenching anxiety for the first time ever, and on top of that he's just feeling pretty shitty with a lot of things. Overall he feels frustrated as his anxiety and depression haven't gone away and it's been a month already since it started.

 Obviously I'm not a psychological professional or expert here, but I at least know what it feels like to have depression and anxiety, so I completely understand where he's coming from. I know not to say stupid things like, ""Just be happy, simple as that."" etc. However, again I'm gonna say I'm not an expert.  I don't want to throw seemingly helpful and encouraging words at him when it's just making things worse. I love him so much and I just want to be able to be there for him as much as I can possibly be.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here are things I say to my boyfriend to make him feel better, please let me know if they're actually damaging. He's said I've made him feel better, but I don't know if he's just saying that because he's in a state of self-denial, and feeling ungrateful in life because he can't comprehend or care about things right now. My intentions with these words is to make him feel like he isn't alone, that things are going to get better even if it takes time, he's actually a great person, and to make him be less harsh on himself. 

\-Everything will be alright

\-I believe in you

\-I am there all the way

\-You are a great person

\-Accept that you're currently going through anxiety and that whatever you're doing now to function is perfectly alright

\-Other people are going through the same feelings and thoughts you are, you're not walking alone

\- Don't feel ashamed if you want to seek professional help with your anxiety

\-You are worthy

\-You're going to get through this, these things just take time

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Also here's some quick research I've looked at, please let me know if these are true. 

\- Recently found out that you shouldn't say, ""Everything will be alright.""

\- You shouldn't give your own personal experience

\- Sometimes just being there for a person is all you can do

\- Ask a person what you could do for them

\- Listen instead of giving feedback

\- Don't be forceful, like telling a person to BE positive 

\- One last thing, don't portray getting medication or professional help as something that is a shameful , or unreachable option.

He does this multiple times a day and some days he will just flat out block me for literally no reason. His ""entities"" usually say that they're gonna make him kill himself but eh never does that.

He has a Personality Disorder and he does this to try and manipulate me into becoming desperate for him to unblock me.

He actually thinks he's a different person, possible mild Schizophrenia.

He thinks I have the entities too, I used to believe in them but I have since realized that i have something else that is actually real going on with me and I'm trying to get professional help. Every time I bring this up to him he says I'm a ""bad entity"" who ""lies and manipulates"".

- She is very emotional. Sometimes starts crying, seems extremely lonely, up and down.
- After talking to a guy once, she will be mad if he takes more than 10 min to reply and ask very serious questions before the first date even. 
- She is kinda childish and very touchy feely sometimes. Clapping when seeing one and saying hooray as a small child, and looking sad/hurt when I rejected a hug because of corona.
- When she broke up with her boyfriend, she posted a pic on facebook of them and said he left. Also did that with her boyfriend before him.
- She is older, but still think she is our age as me and our other friends, thinking it is natural for her to get invited for all the parties by people our age and sound sad when we get more invitations than her. Goes for much younger guys intentionally, while keep complaining she can’t trust younger guys because of her age and gets very sad about her age.
- She talks a looot about herself, write weird things to people she barely knows like I am a good person, open and honest, I love my friends and kids, and I see you as a good man, my ex hurt me so much and I want something serious I am not to play with, why didn’t you call me back yet.

I wanna say it’s better but a lot of times I’m so confused. I wonder am I on the right track, if I’ll achieve my goals, and be truly happy. 
I had a rocky childhood because we were always moving and my parents were abusive. When I started high school things got really complicated with dcfs getting involved. I spent the remainder in foster care and with my grandmother until I decided I wanted to try being on my own due to conflict with my grandmother. I’ve been renting with roommates ever since then. 
I’ve had some difficulty with continuing school recently and I’m only doing 6 units at community college. When I first moved out I was working two jobs and I really burned myself out. I was super underweight, not managing money, and just felt like I was forcing myself to go forward. A year and a half later I’ve fixed most of those problems. I eat healthy and right, have saved some money, and just passed my driving test. I hope to get a car soon. 
I guess a lot of what I struggle with is fear of missing out. Most people my age don’t have half this responsibility. And when I see on social media them celebrating holidays with their families, parents getting them their first car, and at nicer colleges taking more classes I get sad. I know not everyone is living to good life but I feel like I’m really in the sh*t sometimes. I was fortunate enough to get into therapy through dcfs during my first year on my own which was great. I can be pretty solitary but it was nice to have someone with me to help me navigate things. And that first year was hard. I’d just gotten out of a 1 year relationship and I felt so lonely. I feel like I’m learning so much so fast. Some of the decisions I’ve made have been great and been not so great.
Things are different now but I just wanna know is this what it feels like to be an adult. Maybe always a little lost? Will things be all squared away before I know it? The thing that makes me feel better is that this experience will make me a smarter and stronger person.",18Nov2020,1

I am estranged from my own father so I got really close to Harry and I wouldn't even say so much like a father way (although it was also) but he was like a really good friend who I could always have a laugh with and thought cared for me deeply.

We went to crown court yesterday and he was mouthing horrible stuff through the glass and if looks could kill we would both be dead, he pleaded guilty to breaching the non molestation order and harassment charge. I expected him to play fake tears to the judge and stuff and for that to naturally make me feel genuinely upset and guilty for putting him in prison but nothing. He showed no remorse or empathy for what he's done and said, he has been given a 20 month sentence. I'm posting this because I feel so upset due to the fact that I miss him? I miss all of the good times I had with him and I feel distraught he is out of my life even though I know he's a narcissistic abuser meaning he has put on a false personality and that I never knew the real him, heck the judge literally called him a serial abuser due to previous charges. What I'm hoping to receive from you guys is I know it sounds crazy but sort of confirmation that he is a narcissist and whether they actually care about you and just how long it'll be until I feel better. Thank you for reading, I'm sorry about the bad typing I'm crying writing this",18Nov2020,2

317,"Hi there,

Loneliness has always impacted me in my life since I've never been good at approaching people, or rather approaching the right people. Most of my friends I have were initially the first once who started conversations and started to initiate a friendship. 

I'm afraid that as things change, friends will go, but new once won't come. I don't know if I have some kind of social anxiety, but I'm always afraid to show my true self so finding friends that fit to me is rare since I'm always kinda different around new people. I guess I am afraid of people don't liking me or people thinking I'm boring. And always failing to make new friends makes me even more insecure and lonely, it's like a vicious cycle. 

So I never am the first to try working towards a friendship unless I can clearly see the other person likes me and I feel save enough to think this could be a friendship. 

So basically I am too afraid of rejection which is why I'm always waiting for people to approach me. Even If I like them, I'm never sure if they won't get sick and bored of me. 

I really don't know how I can change that, does anyone have the same issue and has success in overcoming this?",18Nov2020,2

320,"I was diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression last year but was to scared to take any medication, I started walking 30min a day &amp; started taking SAMe pills from Walmart, I feel a huge difference..",18Nov2020,4
321,"I don’t want to get on any medication. I’ve heard the side effects can be worse than the mental health issue itself. But maybe I should consider it now. I started feeling “down” since 7th grade, and have been diagnosed with only anxiety since. But I feel like I have both anxiety and depression. I feel like every day is the same... I do my 8hr, I work on homework, I spend time with my family (I still live with my parents)... but whenever I’m alone the numbness comes. I feel like I’ll never shake my depression or anxiety. I never feel good enough. It makes me want to cry if I don’t keep myself busy with endless social media scrolling. 
I know I’m my heart I am good enough. I have a good job, I have a loving family and boyfriend, I get good grades, I’m growing my nest egg to buy my own place someday... but it all feels like it’s all for nothing. I’ll never be fully happy. I’m a fake. I’ll never have the happiness that I see other people experiencing. I wish I could just leave, start over in a new country with a new job, leaving behind everyone and everything I’ve known. I feel so lost yet so bored on a familiar path. Nothing makes sense but everything makes sense. I hate reliving every embarrassing or stupid moment I’ve ever had before I sleep or in between quiet moments. I hate this brain fog that I can’t shake. I hate how tight my chest feels 90% of the day. I’m physically so tired. I’m fat, I’m mean online to people with different opinions than my own liberal thoughts, I’m worthless, not as good as the next girl, I’ll never achieve my dream job and will live a mediocre life. Not sure if I’m just wallowing, being a pessimist, or just being realistic to the shit show of life. I just know my brain never feels the way that it should, the way it does when I’m having a good day. Idk.",18Nov2020,3
322,"Hi i'm 18 (m). When it's dark, i see.... Thing.

Not ""high quality"" just gray outlines of deformed heads. Smiling with quite sharp teeth. Just for few sec tho. Does anyone know what culd it be, and how can i ""fight"" this.",18Nov2020,2
323,"Woke up before my alarm clock, took a cold shower, finished my shift and I just got home from a walk to treat myself and to welcome the oncoming evening. Now I'm going to play some video games, eat dinner and do some guided meditation before bed, those are my evening plans. Thanks for reading everyone, take care now. ✌",18Nov2020,32

325,"I remember before I tried drugs, I asked someone what it was like. They said “it’s like a nice warm/numb feeling, it’s the best feeling ever, idk how to explain it really”  but now if someone were to ever ask me what it’s like, I would tell them.. 

”Its like spending every single penny you ever had, on drugs. 
Its like going days without eating even if you were starving, but you needed the withdrawals to stop. 
Its like having to lie to every family member and friend youve ever had. 
It’s like lighting a whole pack of cigarettes and never smoking one. 
Its like waking up hating yourself from the shame and guilt. 
Its like going into withdrawals every 8 hours unless you had more dope to do.
Its like never attending any family event because you needed to get high. 
Its like everyone eventually stopped inviting you anywhere or talking to you. 
Its like everything was on your drug dealers time. If they said a hour. You’ll wait 5 hours or more.
It’s like being late to every single day of your life even if you started getting ready long before you were supposed to be somewhere.
Its like losing so much weight you can’t fit into any of your clothes. 
Its like losing everything you’ve ever owned in your entire life. 
Its like nobody believing a word you said, even if it was the truth. 
Its like being a prisoner inside your own head. 
Its like contemplating suicide every single day. Its like never being scared to die, because that’s what you wanted. 
Its like trying to shut your brain up for even five minutes. It was worth that little time of peace. 
Its like seeing your family beg to spend time with you only for you to leave and go get high. Because stopping wasn’t an option. 
Its like you’d do anything for more.
It’s like talking in circles for hours about absolutely nothing.
It’s like losing days,weeks,months, years off your life and not even realizing it happened.
It’s like going inside places you’d never go before you did meth.
Its like everyone hating you no matter where you went, because they knew you were a drug addict.
It’s like thinking everyone is out to get you and people can read your every thought.
Its like walking into treatment 100 pounds with the clothes on your back and being scared to death. 
Its like giving your entire life away..”
So if you’re ever curious like I was, please at least know the truth. Curiosity killed the cat, and it’ll kill you too",18Nov2020,2
