0,"I've been strong for so long. I've blocked the voice out. I even tried talking it out. Nothing worked. I'm what people, including my psychiatrist, call a ""lost cause."" 

I've done everything right. Paid my taxes, go to work,  went to therapy, I am a loving girlfriend, daughter, I donate, and gave food/money to the homeless. 

I'm Alexithymic, have BPD, and Depression 

The voice became the only thing I heard. I'm exhausted, I'm tired, I deserve it. 

No one cares. No one listens. They leave. It's not their fault...only mine to bare. 

Life is going to go on. People are still going to be going to bed hungry. The world will keep spinning. I'll be gone, the world will keep spinning. 

I'm only on this to tell you that you matter and I care. I've read many of the stories you post on here.  It truly breaks my heart to read what all of you are going through. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and I'll be there on the other side waiting. 


The only downside is, I've never left California.

1,"I like to think that I’m a decent guy I guess. I try to do everything I can to please the people around me. Most of the things I do are to make other people happy rather than myself. I’m still left with nothing. I’ve been in the deepest depression I think I’ve ever been in for well over a month and not a single person has noticed. My roommates don’t care about how I am, they just care if rent gets paid. None of my “friends” respond when I try to talk about things. All of my exes are in happy long term relationships while I’m left with nothing. I can’t keep anyone in my life and I can’t get a single person to give a fuck about me. If I didn’t have 7 reptiles relying on me for their entire existence I would be long gone by now. It’s hard to stop myself from rehoming all of my animals to make sure they’re safe when I die. I’m honestly pretty scared of death, and I really don’t want to die, but I feel like death will feel less alone than life itself. What’s so fucking wrong with me?",10Apr2020,1
2,"I've been emotionally abused my entire life (19M), and even two years into therapy there are a LOT of things I cannot and will not talk about. I'm really not comfortable with him, as he will often side with my parents, try to rationalize why they are being that way toward me, tell me to respect them and be patient with them even though I know very well they will never change, and all my efforts in trying to please them will never be enough because we are fundamentally different. I know all of this but I honestly think I'm not making any progress by going, and will be a lot better off by just having my own processes and seeking help by myself when I need it. But for the life of me, I am incapable of confronting an adult on anything that's a sensitive matter. I cannot tell my parents I don't wanna go anymore, and I am not going to tell my therapist that. I know this is not working but I just feel trapped in a loophole. Has anyone experienced this? Or have any advice?",10Apr2020,1
3,"The past year has just been rediculous. 
I've been homeless, I've lost friends due to my sexual preferences after being honest with them, I've been trying to keep my head above water with my last year of university, corona virus hits and just when I thought things couldn't get any worse i find out today that my mum has cancer. 
Honestly it's my final straw I feel completely numb and like giving up. I've tried to stay positive throughout it all but I'm just not sure I can stay strong anymore. 
Every single god damn time I pick myself up something comes crashing down and wipes all the happiness away. 

I'm trying to stay positive when I speak to my mum but I don't know how long I can keep it up. 

I came off my meds in January becuase I was having some negitive side effects but now I guess I'm going to have to go back on them.

I have had to suffer through many things without support and find a way to survive by myself. I feel so many emotions that sometimes I shut off, I am angry and I have lost my relationship with my unstable family. Sometimes I am agitated by people who preach about their illness and how hard life is for them because I remain silent and see their life as much easier than my own. I have accepted my downfall or success but that is up to me to make happen. I lose sensitivity to what others are going through at these times, I am selfish I am negative and I get very agitated by people crying over things I may consider minor in comparison.

now for the past few weeks i’ve been at a huge convention center that was transformed into a hospital to hold patients. seeing these patients come in has really been fucking with me. yesterday i watched an old man take his last breath as they were taking him out the ambulance. this whole situation has me beyond stressed. i’m working 12-15 hours day, 7 days a week, 0 days off. i’m not sleeping well so i’m only getting about 3 hours of rest a night. i’m starting to push my girlfriend away unintentionally, barely even talking to her. i haven’t talked to my family in about 2 weeks. i just have no desire to talk to anyone. i don’t feel like myself right now.

I even want to change my email now, because her laughing at it makes me think that maybe it sounds stupid? It's firstname lastname.email@xxx.com.

Hi [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Depression/)anxiety

Depression, anxiety and mental issues has always been something that haunted my life when I was   in my 20s. I struggled with relationship problems, video game addiction, social isolation and more... While many are still struggling to cope, I have been fortunate enough to walk out of it alive.

During  the pandemic, my friend and I came up with an idea. We want to build a platform to connect those who want to talk to those who are willing to talk. Currently I am going through a tough break up which is causing   strong feelings of anxiety that has been dragging me down for days. With the app, I would specify the issues I am facing, and an algorithm will  connect me to someone else who has experience with break ups. And we  will extend this to all other issues, for example addiction to video  games, lack of social support.

What  we are trying to build is a platform that helps those looking for help  with those who are willing to help (The services would be free of  course). So my question for you are the  following:

1. If you are going through something right now, do you feel this can be something you are willing to try to receive help from?
2. If you been through a tough time, is this an app you are willing to help others with?

Thanks for your time.",10Apr2020,1
16,"Basically what the title says. Especially in the last few days, I’ve noticed that I have unexplainable “good” days almost immediately followed by a “bad” day. I’m a college student who has to work from home now, and it’s really impacting my studies. As an electrical engineer I can’t afford to slack off, even though I’m currently a straight A student I still keep getting anxious about other people’s perception of me, I don’t want to appear like I’m an idiot. I don’t have a lot of things going for me socially and/or physically so my intelligence is essentially keeping me grounded in reality. Only bad part is, when the bad days come, i can’t get any work done since my anxiety keeps me from concentrating on my schoolwork, and then I go to bed early to make sure I can finish everything that’s planned for tomorrow.

I guess it’s not really impacting my grades in a significant manner( I’m still able to maintain my good gpa) its just that the anxiety and crying at night can’t be good for my health, and I would like some advice. Sorry for rambling, I’m just not really fully cognizant at the moment.",10Apr2020,1

I was up throwing up in the school bathrooms, blacking out during gym, and laying in bed for days but I pushed the thought of needing help away. I didn’t feel sick enough. 

I just wanted to let you know that there’s no such thing as “sick enough”. Cancer is cancer, just like any ED is an ED, any self harm is self harm, and any depression or mood disorder is as such.

**Part Two**

“I love my parents, they’re my biggest supporter” she said.

“But they’re your family, you gotta love them!” he said.

“They’re just doing what’s best for you” everyone said.

If I hear one more time that I need to reconcile with my family, I will honestly fucking snap. 

I’ve been called useless, unintelligent, a failure, etc. from my mom’s side of the family. 

My sister is emotionally and physically abusive to her kids,   
 My brother is in debt and used my money for gambling (owes me $4500) and   
 My mom patronizes and leeches on me for money though I make the least of all her kids. 

My dad? He was in jail for four years when I was twelve, released now, but all he cares about is money. Kept telling me lies that he needs to financially support his other kids but spent $8,000 to do some landscaping for his home rather than my tuition. 

Every day, I always ask myself “How can I NOT come home tonight?” I purposefully skip meals at home, impulsively spend money just so I can see everyone’s faces less.

Should I love my family now? My answer is: “No”

22,"Okay, so while in quarantine, I've been seeing a lot of people talking about mental health and I wanted to do some self-reflection while I have the time and also to be prepared when life (hopefully) returns to normal.  (this is going to be long, so sorry).

**Trigger warnings**: mentions of suicidal thoughts, reference to self harm (no details), cultural dysphoria, minor racism

I've gone to therapy before for a slew of reasons, here's sort of a highlight reel of my mental health through my life. Any advice or thoughts are welcome. Please tell me what you think, be real, but be kind. 

Here's a brief history of my mental health: 

* I was adopted at the age of 2 from China, my parents are white, I've never had a problem with my parents and adoption. That being said, since returning to China for a heritage tour, I've felt a little bit of cultural dysphoria because I feel like ""I'm too white to be Asian and too Asian to be white (American) (seeing asian people being attacked during the pandemic scares me a little).
* The exact phrasing of my ""birth story"" was that I was ""abandoned near a cable factory"" and found by someone and eventually put into an orphanage. During the heritage tour, some of the other adoptees stressed using the word ""left"" rather than ""abandoned"". My mom always said that my birth mother was very brave for giving birth to me in a time during the One-Child Policy. None of this ever bothered me until after the heritage tour.
* I went to family therapy for a bit when I was younger because I was acting out a bit. We implemented a ""chip system"" so that I could earn chips for good behavior and then trade in the chips when I accumulated enough to do desirable things (buy things I wanted, do things I wanted, etc). Obviously, at the age of 22 now, I haven't used that system for years.
* In 8th grade, a bunch of things happened with some of my friends moving away/moving to other schools, and I also became aware of the world more (reading more news) and became a bit depressed to the point of having suicidal thoughts (including having a plan, but never acting upon the thoughts). These thoughts eventually faded and my mental health improved after talking to my mom. 
* After going to college (after the trip to China), in my sophomore year, my mental health deteriorated due to poor sleep and an isolated social pool (the school I go to only comprises of roughly 200 people and I only interacted with about 40 people in an average month or so). I began having more suicidal thoughts, more anxiety/depression episodes, gained a lot of weight from excessive eating, and came close to self-harm. Eventually, I got a therapist and things got better for a little bit. I got ""better"" enough to stop seeing my therapist.
* Recently, in the light of things, I've been feeling more mentally unhealthy (had a couple of breakdowns, lethargy, and I'm worried about bringing up needing a therapist again to my parents.

Here's some more notes, if anyone cares:

* when I'm stressed, I pick at my nails until they bleed (i don't really bite them, just picking). I was able to stop for a bit but I recently relapsed
* I did take medication for performance anxiety at one point, still have some of that but don't take the medication very often at all
* my parents are retired and are living off their savings. They would like to see me get help if I need it, but they did mention trying to find a different therapist when i was talking to a therapist in college because they were $70/session. I'd like to find another therapist when I'm working (unemployed at the moment since I'm just about to graduate college).
* I think since the time in 8th grade, I've always had a negative outlook on humans as a whole (how we're affecting the planet, the environment, how we treat each other, etc.). This has since translated to me aiming to be a minimalist and trying to be low waste as well as going pescatarian (i'm sorry i love sushi too much to give it up). 
* I've developed a very negative mindset (on good days, I'll call it a ""realist"" mindset) and trying to find a reason to live beyond ""it would make everyone sad if I killed myself"" because it seems like the good stuff I have going always gets overshadowed in my mind by the bad stuff that happens to me. The thing I want to do most is travel around the world, but obviously you can't do that without money, which I don't have at the moment.
* not religious really. I've gone to church a couple of times, but the whole ""God has his ways/is watching over you"" stuff doesn't really click with me. 
* When I die, I just want oblivion and not to feel anything anymore. I don't want a time of consciousness after life.
* my previous therapist called me an empath and I've always been sensitive and an easy crier.

TLDR: I'm pretty negative and I need help, but I want to wait until I have an income generated by myself, not on my parents retirement funds. I just want to find a reason to live beyond ""people will be sad if I die early"".",10Apr2020,1
23,"What the title says. If you are considering the facility or interested in residential treatment, I can try to answer questions. Additionally, if you went there and just wanna reminisce about the ‘good ole days’, I’m down for that too.",10Apr2020,1

25,"Pretty much just ranting here: I didn’t used to feel this way, I think it has everything to do with my lack of confidence. I used to be all over Facebook a long time ago. I’ve always hated Instagram though, just think it’s stupid. The only socials i like are Snapchat and Reddit. I don’t want to hate socials though, especially now that we’re all on lockdown it would be nice to get on Facebook and try to talk to some old friends. But every time I get on there it just pisses me off and I end up deactivating it again. I’ve tried to get on Instagram but the shit I see on there makes me super mad and depressed and just makes me feel like I’m not good enough. I guess I just want to feel like I fit in. My boyfriend loves Instagram and Twitter, sometimes I get mad that I hate it so much. Sometimes I wish I could be “normal” and be on all that shit like most people my age. Anyone relate to me? Or have advice on how to stop being a hater? Lol",10Apr2020,1
26,"For context:
I am a 20 year old female.
I live with both biological parents, whom are not married and only my mother graduated high school (did not go into college). I have been diagnosed (by an actual doctor) with severe depression. I also have suicidal tendencies, though not as often these days. I am unemployed and have never had a proper job. My father is verbally abusive, sometimes also physically, and has the potential to be sexually abusive as well. I have had memory loss problems since I was young. I am suspected to be on the spectrum by my therapist and myself, but this has not been confirmed. 

I first got myself medicated for depression in 2017 with fluoxetine.  I ended my medication in mid 2018 due to the effects failing and making my symptoms worse. I have not been on medication since then.

I have high difficulty coping with my mental health and cannot properly comprehend things. I also have a hard time reading under certain circumstances because the words tend to get jumbled up and I need to look away or else it distresses me, I dont know what this is.

My parents and I are going to be moving soon, to a city that is four hours away, and its stressful. I have moved many times over the years. The longest I've ever lived in a house to my knowledge is 5 years. I have only lived in my current house for a couple months, and we have never owned a house.

I need a job, and I need to move out. Preferably with a roommate so I'm not alone. (I dont function well on my own, hence why I'm still with my parents). I'll take whatever useful advice I can get. 

I'm so lost, I dont know which way is up and I'm always going through mental warfare. I'm reaching my end if I cannot help help myself out of this.",10Apr2020,1

28,"One of the most beautiful feelings in the world is that moment. The moment when you smile for the first time and actually mean it in so long. I struggle with really heavy depressive episodes that are easily triggered and can last sometimes for a month or 2 at a time. It's so hard to push through, but when the time come, and I turn it around it's amazing. When the time comes after it's over, I smile and I actually mean it. I'm so proud of myself for fighting through something so hard. I rarely talk about it because none of my friends or family understand. If you're going through a rough time please hold on. Please wait until you smile your first real smile in a long time and you'll feel on top of the world.",10Apr2020,1
29,"So to make a very long story short, I have a friend who was burned severely a while ago. He's family to me and has been for years. For those who might be concerned, he's almost to his complete recovery. There's still some superficial work to be done if he decides to, but he's perfectly fine beyond that. 

He spent a long time in a hospital far from home. I went to see him at least twice a week in that time, more if I could have the time off. I spent the day there, just waiting for each round of visiting hours. I saw pretty much every step of his recovery. I've even been his driver for a lot of his follow up appointments and surgeries.

I don't say all of that to brag, but to explain that I've been closely involved in the whole process. Now, to the problem. Since his accident and the hard times since then, fire is an absolute no-go for me. I can handle a candle or a lighter, little things, but beyond that I just can't take. Burns also just trigger this response I can't even explain. As a great example, Chicago Fire is essentially completely off limits now. I tried one episode and there's no way (which sucks because it's a good show!). Seeing him and him showing off his scars doesn't really affect me at all, but just about any other context I just feel sick to my stomach and start bawling. I don't even know how to handle it. Even my own problems in upbringing aren't a big deal at this point, but this is so absolute. Any advice or really anything you guys can offer, I'm more than willing to listen to.",10Apr2020,1

I do not understand the realm of piss and misery in some people.  This constant hate and misery and torment, it's evil.  

Wear does this strain from? This nerve of taking pleasure in the hurt or dominance of others?  Humans, animals, insects, Deities, display this satisfaction in torture.  

I've been a sick fuck in the past, I recollect myself and do resent it.  I tortured some animals in the past, me Mom brings it up from time to time.  I wasn't an evil kid, I just was pissed or motivated.  

Now I'm a different and decent and good person, I don't want to hurt anything.  I do not understand what motivates such satisfaction in these things.  I took little satisfaction in my misdeeds, it's as if I were possessed by a Demon.

I do not know how to explain that, nor is it a cop out. Hypothetically, Demonic possession can be very subliminal, intelligent.  Not the crazed feral folk you see in the film all the times. I just don't know the motivations or why these people are so broken and deranged.

That said i am not exactly sure how to process ghosting by my father. I grew up with my mom, and i almost felt like a guest at his house with his family that i visited weekly-biweekly while growing up. I was accepted for a while, but as my road got more challenging and started angling downward and most importantly when i got depressed, he and his family basically decided they don't like me, and my visits became limited to holidays.

Felt like they were waiting for me to prove myself, and to be fair i was a burden, i truly failed to take responsibility, i sought their help and guidance but when it didn't work i was to blame. I didn't know how to fix myself nor was even sure i cared to, seemingly no one else did. 

I briefly rekindled the relationship with them when i moved countries like 1,5 years ago, even left a fair bit of change with them just to hold onto for me, that i never asked back. Can only contact them via email, and we basically send like up to 3-5 message a year, and i thought Coronavirus was a good reason to open up and share what i was up to. They basically never do, and i always feel responsible for not reaching out enough.

I suspected i will be judged. They can't help but see me for who i used to be, not the person they kind of liked, but the person they didn't, the useless depressed guy, who was not above lying to pretend to have a sense of normalcy and was pretty annoying to deal with. Just talked with people to feel good but nothing ever got done.

Now i don't like dwelling on the past, it's pointless you can't change it, if anything if you keep seeing yourself as the person you were yesterday than that anchor hold you back. 

The current situation is that i sent them a message like over a month ago, followed it up with another short one a week later, totally relaxed just sharing more stuff i am doing. Replying slowly is definitely not out of character for them, but doesn't seem to be the case this time. 

I found myself speculating what was the last straw, especially annoying because i am doing the best i ever did. Perhaps i should have messaged them later so my achievements are more impressive. Apparently it never even warranted them belittling or halfheartedly accepting my achievements and pointing out what i should do instead. Of course we had good times too, and i didn't hurt them intentionally, they simply seemingly wired to interpret the actions of others personally. Who i was, was far from ideal, but i wasn't acting like that to hurt them.

Realistically i don't think there is going to be a resolution to this, maybe his christmas reminder will tempt him to write a line or two, but i think realistically i should focus on making new friends.

I would have preferred direct and honest replies. I suppose i should be glad for what i had and accept our relationship for what it is, rather than what i wish it to be.",10Apr2020,1

37,"(If you’re pro Trump that’s fine but this post won’t involve any of that so please respect that and don’t comment if it’s irrelevant)

I’m a sexual assault survivor. I’ve been pro Bernie since last election. This election has really gotten to my mental state. 
Last election it tore me apart that someone could hold office for having assault allegations against them. *I am NOT saying that we need to just disregard a candidate if they do have allegations, however I think their candidacy should be postponed until an investigation can clear anything pending.*

I’d become interested in Biden a while back when I saw he was very active in supporting assault survivors in college campuses. After looking into that briefly, I saw back then that even some of the survivors he encountered, he made feel uncomfortable. Since then he has in a part of my brain that can’t see him as a credible assault advocate, let alone a president. 

Man I really, really wanted Bernie. I’m terrified as a woman to lose more of my rights to my body. I’m scared for people in this country who aren’t white. I’m scared for anyone in the LGBTQ community. The last few years has shown that if we continue down this road, so many of us will be beaten farther down in society. 

I’m nauseous at the thought of another four years of this. 
I want to do what I can to help avoid this continuing; but anytime I try to think of casting a ballot for Biden, I just flash forward to my mindset afterwards, and imagine myself reliving more trauma for possibly supporting someone who could be benefiting from our fucked up rape culture. 

I want to vote green. I want to be able to live with myself. Part of me wants so badly to imagine everyone just abandoning Biden and going Bernie all of a sudden or going green. But my realistic mind knows that’s not plausible in the slightest. 

I’ve had two arguments today alone with people I am extremely close with. I do value their opinion, but I feel as though they still just don’t understand the perspective I have and why this would be so difficult for me to vote Biden to vote for the “lesser of two evils” (Goddamn I am SO FUCKING SICK of hearing that).

I feel like if we continue to be a nation that just lets the Democratic Party hold us hostage, we’re never going to have real change. I feel like there needs to be a huge movement and shift in what is happening and I don’t know how to get into that. 
I want to be a part of that; then I start thinking of all of the people locked in cages in our own country. Locked in cages in general, but also during a pandemic. 

It just makes me not want to even vote because I can’t make the right decision, but then NOT voting is also a huge part of this countries problem. I feel like I am in a lose, lose, lose, lose situation. 

I just want to know if there are others out there who are also having this internal conflict, and if so, what the fuck man. What do we do? I can already feel myself dissociating.",10Apr2020,1

Going through my day is just a cycle that never ends. Same think everyday. And going to sleep makes it worse. As I think about how bad it gets some times.",10Apr2020,1
39,"Bear with me, this might be a little long. 
A story about a series of events from last week. Those of you who suffer from anxiety/depresssion or anyone with mental/behavioral problem probably know these chain of events buts not often that you see the after affect of a suicide attempt. 
 But first a little context first. 
I am not the type of person who likes any sort of attention unless it’s from my husband, or my children.
I go to counseling regularly, see my psychiatrist regularly. I explore every avenue for my mental health and I stay on top of it. 
I’ll forever advocate for mental health.
Sunday I woke up with this overwhelming sense of defeat. Mostly because for the last 3-4 weeks I’d gotten two hours asleep if I was lucky. So I was already running on fumes, distancing myself from others. Keeping to myself begging any higher power to let me sleep a full night, or even half a night. I’m the type of person who would try anything to finally get sleep. I was suffering from major sleep deprivation on top of the depression and anxiety I deal with every day.
It had begun to affect my speech, my memory, everything in my head was fuzzy. The thoughts of giving up kept growing in my mind
I don’t ever try and make excuses for my own actions. 
I was so desperate for sleep that I decided to drink the fruity drinks we’ve had in our fridge for months. I had hoped that it would help me just pass out. Boy, was I wrong. 

So just to give an example,  a few questions if you’ve ever felt this way. 
Have you ever had your brain try and trick you into thinking your family/friends would be better in the long run if you weren’t around?  I have.
Have you ever gotten so delirious you didn’t know who your spouse/significant other was.  I checked that box too. 
Having your regular mental issues intensify to the point where you’re shaking uncontrollably with a stutter when you try and speak? I was guilty of that too.

As bad as that is it doesn’t hold a candle to breaking your husbands heart as he reads your Suicide note wondering if he was too late. 
But I also had someone who loved me so deeply and cared so much about me to physically get me back into the house before I ended up in Grayson lake. 

The moment of regret was instant. 
I knew I wasn’t myself. I know I have so much to live for and then some. I also sought help immediately. 
You hear so many people tell you it’s the cowards way out or it’s weak and selfish but I can tell you from experience that’s definitely not the case. 
It’s your brain tricking you. It’s a terrible demon on your shoulder telling you you’re not worth the hassle. That when you want to reach out that you’re bothering them or that the other person has too much on their plate for you to burden them with your problems. 

But what you don’t see often is the aftermath, the reality of how much your life is worth it to so many people. Don’t get me wrong it’s hard to face at first because of the unimaginable about of guilt you have about the weakest moment of your life. I didn’t get anything but loving and concerning responses. 
Remember  those who love you they aren’t mad. They’re scared, they’re relieved and worried of course. 
There hasn’t been a single person that hasn’t said I would rather get through this with you than have to just go on memories. 

So yes you might be scared to reach out, you might be afraid of someone being disappointed that things got that bad but they would take that a 10000x compared to getting the call that you’re no longer with them. 

Please, please, please. If you’re struggling in any way. Or if it’s something like sleep where you might say not a big deal I can fix this on my own. Don’t. Stress the urgency of your situation. 
Don’t down play any issue you might have. 
And if you feel like you can’t turn to someone please turn to me. If I can’t help. I will research I will do absolutely anything and everything in my power to help.  I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. 

I was one of the lucky ones and I’m grateful. 
I’m not done raising my babies. I’m not done driving my husband insane or my family and friends. 

My story isn’t over. 

But thanks to my husband, my doctor, kids, mom and my friends and family I’m still here. Not only that I’m doing better. I’m not a 100% but I will get there.

It’s a lesson to teach your children. There will be someone in their life who is actively struggling with this.
Even when you think somethings in life are too overwhelming you can always reach out and get help. It doesn’t make you a weak person or a bad spouse, mother, daughter or friend. 
It takes so much strength to confront the problem head on but it’s important not to do alone. 

You are not alone. 
You are worth it.
You are not a burden. 
The world would not be better off without you. 

Check on your friends and love ones who struggle with any type of mental health issues. 

Together we can help break the stigma on mental health.

41,"So, the past few years have been a wild ride. For reference I’ve just turned 17 last week, and a friend of mine suggested I seek some form of advice with this but I’m too scared/broke to see a real mental health professional. I’m going to start at the beginning, and I’m gonna try being honest with myself 

I don’t have many memories of elementary school. Like, only a select few really good and bad moments are left. The rest is a blur. I remember that kids were, for whatever reason, picked on me a lot for things that were pretty usual for kids to do. I liked pokemon, and I liked Ninjago, and for whatever reason I was a target. I remember having told my teachers and parents over and over that kids were picking on me, but for the longest time nobody took me seriously.  Because of that when kids would pick on me I’d end up having some pretty bad meltdowns. Nothing really changed until fourth grade, when some kid sang this one song they used to tease me, and I stood up and hit him with a (paperback) book. This is one of the only moments I really remember. The teacher, instead of asking me why I’d do that, asks the kid why I’d do that. Somehow, the whole deal gets out and the teacher is confronting the whole class. She asked how many kids knew I was being picked on, and the whole class raised their hand. She asked how many kids did anything. Nobody. I don’t remember much until running out of the school, excited to tell my mom she’d be getting a phone call that night. And my teacher told her everything I’d been trying to say for years. The next year, the teasing mostly subsided(save for one kid who’s gone from being a bully to just a nuisance). That I think was the year I also learned I had Aspergers. 

Flash forward to middle school, which I mostly *can* remember. Around the time I was 13, it started dawning on me that I had gender dysphoria(which seems to be/hopefully is taken seriously by this community). I discovered through interacting with people online, and very gradually realizing I much preferred being seen as feminine and going by what was once just an online username, Crystal, which I’ve ended up adopting as my proper name. Enter this one little online community, where I meet my best friend of four years, who we’ll call Dash. She and I clicked nearly instantly. Things were going great. I was getting used to being crystal, though I still had yet to come out to Dash and online friends in that community, and to this day still haven’t to my real family. A year or so passes. Then, we enter the most confusing part of this whole equation. A girl who i ended up rushing into an online relationship with the day I met her, who I’ll call Candy, because she used a lot of blue and pink in her social media. And she’d call herself the cotton candy queen. Profile picture was always her blue and pink OCs or someone holding cotton candy, etc. Looking back, things were pretty sketchy. She said she was 17, then bumped her age down and said she was lying earlier when I told her I was 14. She told me she was trans ftm for a while before settling on being cis, but then came out truly as trans mtf. Most of this relationship is honestly a complete and under blank spot. I hardly remember a thing from my interactions with her, and most of the conversations have been lost due to me getting a new phone. I remember that she would disappear. A lot. Even though she knew it made me anxious. She’d disappear with no warning for days at a time just to nonchalantly come back. It always seemed to follow me having an episode of venting or frustration(take that with a grain of salt because the memories are so fuzzy they’re practically nonexistent). Things were okay for the first year, but the second was where things went downhill. She tells 15 year old me that she has a crush on one of her friends. Like, to my digital face. So now I’m on edge all the time thinking she could leave at any moment. She keeps disappearing off the face of the earth for days. It never seemed she *couldn’t* tell me she *had* to go, she would just poof, and he gone. This, coincidentally or not, was the time I started having serious self image issues. Worthless, annoying, burdensome, you get the deal. But I still think she’s gonna be with me forever. Until May 2018. She breaks up with me, Sorta. Because I’m smothering her and she feels like she has no space. Says it’s just for a while, or we’ll see how it goes or whatever. That lasted a couple weeks or so, then she comes back because she can’t stand being apart or whatever. So I’m even more on edge until August, 2018. I check Twitter and find that that boy she told me she likes has “taken by candy” in his bio. Obviously confused and paranoid, I ask Candy what’s up. But it’s over now, because I don’t trust her enough. So begins my six month downward spiral. The self image issues got progressively worse. Replaceable, temporary, worthless, annoying, etc. I kept trying to reconnect as just friends. Like, just talk to her casually. I talked to her boyfriend, literally the guy she told me not to worry about, and he says they got together in “the summer” and he doesn’t remember exactly what day. She broke up with me in August. Make of that what you will Cuz I certainly can’t make up my mind on it. Things get worse, and I start making plans. I’ll be gone by February 15, the day that would’ve been our two year anniversary. I gave myself till then to build up the nerve to finish myself off. I could never bring myself to lay a single scratch on myself, so i tried to use my cowardice as fuel for the fire. Nobody wanted me anymore. Dash was moving on to bigger and better things, all my old friends had left me behind, real life was cold and I couldn’t be myself, and candy had left me in the dust. 

Then I met who we’ll call Big Sis in December. Something about us just clicked instantly, and she became a big sister to me. She made me feel a bit better, but the clock was still ticking in my head. February 15 2019 comes along, and I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t even make myself try. I just sat there, telling myself to do it, do something for the longest time. But I couldn’t. Cue the arrival of who I’ll call Enby for privacy, because they recently discovered thats what they are, though at the time they identified as cis female. They and I also grow pretty close. We become good friends, and I come out to them, turn 16, and start to get a little interested. Apparently they did as well, because they became my partner in April. A little rushed I know, but this time we confirmed each other weren’t just catfishes right off the bat. We’re still going strong today, about to have our anniversary. Anyway, things start going alright for me. I feel like I’m back up on my feet. Later into the year, I check Candy’s old Facebook, and it says she graduated university. In 2004. Don’t know what to make of that. 

2020, and the self image issues started flaring up again. They’ve become a constant persistent feeling of self loathing always lingering overhead, some sometimes it flares up into a bit of a breakdown and I’ll spill all the feelings out to Enby, Big Sis, or Dash. It becomes a vicious cycle where my inability to leave them alone makes me even angrier at myself and makes it even harder to bottle up. 

Fast forward to the last few weeks and I notice some odd things. Someone with a very similar name to Candy’s real name says something in a group chat, and I panic hard for a few seconds before realizing it’s not her. Cotton candy, which I used to like, makes me uncomfortable. But by far the most ridiculous thing was when I opened my freezer, saw a blue and pink pair of popsicles, and legitimately had a fear response where I reflexively stepped back and tensed up. I wish I was joking. Thinking back, seeing that color combination the past few months had started making me feel anywhere from uncomfortable to unnerved, but never before had I been genuinely scared because of it. Feeling ridiculous, I go to Big Sis. When I vent to her, she tells me I have anxiety and depression, but I usually don’t believe her and say I make myself feel that way, which in retrospect probably didn’t help my case. 

Yesterday, after telling her about the popsicle incident, she tells me that she’s uncertain, but it sounds low key like some form of PTSD. I don’t think so. I don’t know though. While not a trained mental health professional, she has a lot of experience dealing with people with a variety of diagnosed mental health issues, PTSD included, and shes fairly well versed in the topics. I don’t think Candy did anything *that* bad. And if she did, I don’t remember it. So I don’t know why I’d be reacting to things that remind me of her or I associate with her with genuine fear. 

That night I had a bit of a meltdown and made a long text about how I manipulate people into liking me and weigh them down and leech pity and attention off them, etc etc. I feel better today but the whole thing’s got me confused. I’m not necessarily asking for a diagnosis, just advice I guess. I don’t know what to do, and I don’t know what’s up with me. I’m trying my hardest to remember anything else from my relationship with Candy, but Im just drawing a blank. Or maybe I just needed people to hear my story. Maybe I’m just being overly dramatic for attention. Maybe I’m just echoing things I’ve seen on tv without realizing. Maybe there’s something actually wrong with me

42,"I have stupid issues. I have problems that really should not be problems. What are these problems, you may be asking? My mind sometimes think that women have no attraction to men. This often leads to me having mental breakdowns because of a fear of being lonely forever and never finding someone who loves me. This, really should not be a problem. If you just look on T.V. or on social media you can see a lot of evidence for women having attraction to men. Yet, it still happens and it still is very hard to deal with.

To help with this, I sometimes go to google and type in stuff like “Do women like men” or “”Do women hate men”. And you would think that, because these are very simple yes and no questions that Google would be able to be able to help very easily, However, probably because very few people in the world have the same problem as me, Google pulls up no articles to help. I fact the articles that Google pulls up makes it worse. All the articles talk about how “women don’t need men”. Now that is absolutely a good message to tell, however, when I am in desperate need of an answer to a simple question then telling me that people don’t need me will give off the wrong impression. It is worse when I find an article that is just horrible and tells me terrible things like “men are disposable”. “Because that will obviously help my self confidence and mental health”.

I got a boyfriend, started college, waned off my medication, got to a place where I didn't need counseling. I thought I had it all together. Everyone told me they saw a difference, that I just looked...happier...? All the while though I think I've just been pushing away the inevitable crash from this high place I've been at.

When I was a kid. I developed a coping mechanism. I was smarter than most kids, more mature, and bigger. Therefore, I was bullied pretty harshly. So I developed a coping mechanism. I soon learned that I could analyze people: how they think, act, opinions, body language, accent. I learned to perfect building personalities for each person. I called it headspaces. Every person in my life no matter who I build a headspace and mask for. To make them like me. To build connections. I still do it today I lie to anyone and everyone and no one knows I  do it. They have no idea that honestly I don’t care about them or their feelings. I don’t care about their family dying or their animal. But I know that society demands that I be compassionate, caring, understanding, nice and have a smile on my face. But, I can’t stand it. It’s exhausting but I know if I don’t do it I won’t be able to build those bridges with people. To make those connections that I can manipulate in the future and use them like a chess piece in a game. 

Also, I don’t feel emotions honestly. When I am alone I feel nothing at all but boredom. It’s like I’m an empty slate. But when I have stimuli from someone or something. I swap into the headspace and I feel emotions again. But I do it only because I know society tells me I have to. But all of this is so ingrained In me I do it without realizing. It wears me down and tires me out. I can’t stand being around large groups of people. In large groups it’s impossible for me to put on a new mask for each person in seconds. Im better at one on one. I can manipulate and change my actions to satisfy them. Building a connection. 

But every relationship I build doesn’t last long. I haven’t had friends longer than a year or two honestly. As long as I have a use for that person Ill keep them happy and stay with them. I never break down any bridges I let them burn them. 

I tried explaining this to my counselor but she says she doesn’t see it. But I have never let her see my real self. I have a headspace for all medical personnel I deal with. So that I don’t end up in the mental asylum. And I don’t wanna push the idea with her and she put me in one. But I need to understand my own thoughts. 

Excuse my grammar please. But does any of this sound like a sociopath to you. And yes I am in a headspace now while writing this.",10Apr2020,1

Before I start let me tell you a little.
A year and a month ago I arrived in the US with a broken heart. My ex broke up with me. I was really hoping to get back home but I couldn't. A few months later my mom and my older sister went back to my home country temporarily.
I am currently living with my aunt who I think (I am not sure) has Borderline Personality Disorder.


Now, what's up with me?

I can't:
-Hold a conversation with people
-Have friends to hang out with
-Believe in myself
-Actually do stuff to progress in my ""dreams""
-Get over my ex, though it happened a year ago and she's with another man
-Stop crying to sleep

NOBODY GIVES A FUCK

53,"A little over a year ago I had, what I believe was, a panic attack. At the time I was a semi heavy marijuana user for a about a year. I was headed home after meeting with some friends for a car meet and smoking a little. While driving I remember feeling kinda weak and as my mind became more and more focused on that I kept feeling worse to the point that I felt what I could best describe as a heart attack. It was to the point where I thought I needed to pull over and call an ambulance. I was able to keep driving and it very slowly went away. I knew then I wouldn’t forget it. But the next morning I kinda forgot about and for the next couple weeks to a month didn’t really think about it. 
One day I was with my sister going to eat lunch with my mom. I decided to take a hit of a wax pen right before. When I got there to eat I immediately regretted it. My mother didn’t know I smoked so it started making me anxious. Long story short I had what I believe to be another panic attack. 
I soon after quit smoking. I summed it up to the weed making me paranoid. One time after that I smoked with friends, hardly any considering how much I use to in the past. This once again gave me a panic attack to the point that I had to step away from my friends and to get some air and try to calm down. 
I quit all together after that. I never thought experiencing that would give me the anxiety I have today even after not smoking for almost a year now. To this day I am dealing with social anxiety and the feeling of depersonalization none of which I had before having a panic attack. This is just an open discussion for which I’ve never really spoken about with anyone but if there’s anyone reading that’s had a similar situation or dealt with panic attacks or social anxiety before I’d really appreciate hearing what’s helped you in dealing with it. Thanks.",10Apr2020,1
54,"After 2 solid years of progress, I went off my Vyvanse and relapsed with self-harm on March 6th. Landed myself in the hospital with stitches but avoided inpatient. I have since been going to therapy every week but I just had my first appt. with a new psychiatrist and it did not go well. She thinks I’m skimming for pills (because of the Vyvanse, which is a stimulant used to treat ADHD and *can* be abused if taken *incorrectly* ) and refused to acknowledge the fact that I have been diagnosed repeatedly with ADHD since I was 12. She wanted to put me on mood stabilizers and an antipsychotic and I’m so distraught. I have a doctor that refuses to acknowledge my proper diagnosis, and I’m going to be drugged to oblivion.

But it doesn’t matter how much I eat before or after taking them, it doesn’t matter what meds I’m on, they still makes me feel sick. Even the thought of taking them makes me feel ill. And if I don’t take them I binge eat, and my self-hatred just skyrockets. My parents think maybe it’s my body getting re-adjusted to the dosage, but it would still continue long after I should be adjusted. I usually just end up going to bed directly after taking them to avoid it.

56,"I was diagnosed last year and I'd pinpoint that as the time my self-esteem hit rock-bottom. I've always had a horrendous relationship with my appearance, but it didn't reach the point of self-loathing until I was in recovery from my diagnostic laporoscopy in March of last year. 

After my laporoscopy I was warned that my chances of ever conceiving are very slim, which is a hard blow to take at 21. We've been trying since with no luck. During recovery I was bloated from the gas they pumped into me and had complications with my stitches. I've always been very slim but my stomach looked huge and despite the fact that it was keyhole surgery the scars made my tummy look ugly and messy. 

I'm not going to lie (and please bear in mind that this is not my opinion of other women suffering infertility, this is an angry internal judgement I project on myself) I've felt like a failure as a woman since. My bleeding (literally) insides don't work, and it's just feels like a sick joke for me to be so dysfunctional throughout.

Over the past year it's been hard. I'm at the point where, without even thinking, I'm vocalising in the mirror: ""you're disgusting, why do you even bother?"" I can be doing something mundane and just hear myself say aloud  ""no one likes you"". I've dropped to a size 6 from a size 12 in the past 12 months, not even purposely, I'm not controlling my food intake or excercising (at all), I just can't bring myself to eat or see it as worth it most days. It's like I just don't have the energy to keep myself going. I've become obsessive with my appearance (this coming from a girl who has worn a full face daily for the past ten years) to the point where I am spending 5-6 hours attempting my make-up, only to end up frustrated, crying and even punching myself in the face. I feel like my face is a Picasso painting, just awkwardly thrown together and asymmetric and strange. My temperament's become awful, and I see that I am so difficult for everyone around me to deal with and understand. It's not even like I've got a stellar personality to compensate for everything that's wrong with me. I feel ugly, broken, barren and completely pointless.

I'm scared of myself at this point. I'm genuinely worried I have some form of mental disorder. The lockdown has definitely made things worse as I'm alone with myself and I hate that, and it means I'm really really struggling to find any access to mental health support that doesn't cost money, and the NHS is under too much strain for me to consider that right now.

I don't even know why I'm writing this or what I'm looking for. I guess I just want to know if there's anyone like me who's experienced anything like this so that I'm not completely alone. If you have any advice, I'd be really grateful.

61,"Hi friends, I’m new to reddit and really hoping for some help or advice here. I was diagnosed with Lupus when I was 11 years old by proxy I now also suffer from arthritis &amp; fibromyalgia so I suffer from minor to severe body pain nearly every day. I do high intensity workouts every day and eat right! I read a lot and spend a lot of time investing in my hobbies. Most people would consider me to be quite extroverted, however I have severe anxiety when it comes to being sick/weight management/relationship related trauma. I’ve been through 5 serious relationships and have been able to end them all on a really positive and civil note with no problem. However, my most recent breakup ended in a peace order because I was being stalked/having my phone blown up like crazy from this guy saying he loves me then saying I torture him and everything in between. Nonetheless, it was a terrible toxic relationship that I’m glad I escaped. However, my anxiety has been absolutely OFF the raiLS!!! I went the a therapist this morning who suggested I take .5 mg of klonopin twice daily. I’ve tried it in the past and quite liked it although I have a very low drug tolerance naturally and am going to cut the pills in quarters to start. I’m usually very good at restraining myself when it comes to drug use as I’ve dabbled with alcohol, coke, lsd, mushrooms, uppers downers everything whatever, and I’ve had no problem coming off of any of them. I had a coke bender many years ago for about a month and haven’t done it since so I don’t think I have an addictive personality. However, I’ve read a lot about how Benzos can be highly addictive and I want to get better and have the k-pin assist me in getting better but I do not want to grow entirely dependent or have to up my dosage. Anybody have tips or personal stories? Sorry this was a little all over the place I felt like there needed to be a little bit of background. 


Bottom line, do you think I will be okay taking .025 or .25 daily? I’ve been prescribed .5 mg. I really really just do not want to grow a dependency.",10Apr2020,1
62,"About a month and a half ago my boyfriend of 2 and a half years told me he wasn't ""feeling"" our relationship anymore and didn't want to be with me. Later he said that maybe it wasn't definitive and that we could possibly work things out.

Fast forward to now, I've been out of work for 27 days. He's an essential employee so he's still going in. This has left me alone; locked in an apartment that we picked together filled with pictures and shared memories. Over the past week I think I am starting to realize that he doesn't actually have an intention of fixing things. The denial is wearing off and any glimmer of hope dissipating. I suspect he kust said that because we still have to live together in a 1 bedroom apartment until our lease is up in September.

Days are getting really hard for me. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think of anything but this failed relationship. Still having to see him everynight is getting harder and harder to deal with.

Today I broke down and he told me to stop over reacting. I asked him how he expects me to be okay in this situation and he just brished it off. I'm never going to be able to get over this when the ONLY person I'm able to see and have seen for the past 27 days face to face is him.

How am I supposed to be okay living with a man I gave my heart to and who I thought loved me to? How am I supposed to not sit and cry while I think about how we already named our future kids which will never exist now? How am I supposed to deal with the fact that the person I thought I'd spend my life with doesn't want me anymore? How do I deal with not being enough? How do I deal with my EX being the only person I'll see for god knows how long? I have never felt this heavy before. I feel like I'm torn in a million pieces. It honestly hurts everywhere. I feel like I'm drowning under the weight of rejection.

I know. We get this all the time. 

But this feels different from people dismissing my better known, more common disorders. For major diagnoses, like OCD and depression and bipolar etc. These are well known, and there are plenty of people to back you up in knowing your struggle is real and documented -- that some rando with no expertise is just full of shit. But since this disorder is rare, I feel weirdly deligitimized. It's painful. 

It's painful. When a condition finally receives a name, you feel legitimized, but by giving it that name, you leave it open to randoms to give their opinion suddenly too. And randoms assume, because it's new (newly described actually, but they assume it's ""new""), because they cant compare it to anything they know, because they cant compare it to anything they've ever experienced... it must be made up by weak snowflakes begging for attention.

66,"So, I bought an iPhone SE just a few moths ago. I'ver never used iOS device before and I really wanted to try it because even nowadays in 2020 I can see people running around with their iPhones (older ones e.g. 5, 5s) and they still love them. I've always known that iOS is way more minimal that android is. My average screen on time on my android was aroud 8-9 hours daily which was crazy. Yes, I used my previous phone as my laptop too because it could easily handle all of the tasks I needed to be done. But I was sick of it. I was really anxious after staring at my screen for such a long time. I needed some change. And here we go - I bought used iPhone SE in 2020. I use it only for texting and using apps such as Telegram or Facebook Messenger to communicate with my friends and especially classmates (especially now due to COVID-19 situation and online classes). I have no other apps there. No games or anything like that and it's pretty distraction free in my opinion. Except for those apps I alredy mentioned, I also use podcasts, listen to audiobooks or listen to the music in general. And that's it. I've had this phone for around 1,5 month and I'm really really surprised. It really did help me. However I kept my older phone (Redmi 7 which is way more powerful in terms of battery performance) I don't use it that much. I allowed myself to check my social media only once a day (every morning) and play games on it when I'm done with all of my responsibilities. Also, I have it for Netflix or Youtube due to its bigger screen. But like I said - I don't use it often, I don't carry it with my everywhere and I keep it home. iPhone SE has become my daily driver, it can do whatever I want with a smooth performance and I'm really happy to be able to say - I'm fighting successfully with my phone addiction.",10Apr2020,1

All of this occurred in November, one of the hardest and longest months in my entire life.

In these 2 weeks I've felt like my family members are just looking for reasons to scream, yell, fight and basically make life hell for each other.

Their fights give me literal headaches now and I've developed a habit of just running away from any kind of conflict or confrontation.

This lockdown has now doubled my misery with nowhere to go and my brother also joining in the screaming matches. Feel like I'm living in a pressure cooker that keeps blowing up every few minutes. Mentally I'm very tired and now I'm starting to resent the very family that I thought I would die for.

73,"Edit: Okay this turned into way more of a journal than an actual discussion. I would love for you guys to read my story. It's clunky and I stopped being so descriptive cause I realized I was rambling. At least read the first 2 paragraphs. 

  I am going to start by saying, I am currently not a danger to myself or my loved ones.   I am looking for advice, insights, anything that anyone is willing to offer into what to do with my life or how I got here. I am using Grammarly, but English was always my weakest subject in school, so please disregard any grammatical errors that I use and bear with me.  This will also be a long post with several questions that can be answered.  Here goes nothing... (all the stupid descriptions and details I put in are relevant if you read the whole story. I describe my relationships in depth because there's a big shift.) 

My current situation 

I am a 28-year-old white male in the United States. I moved back in with my parents about 2 1/2 years ago, and have been unemployed ever since.  I currently cannot be left alone for extended periods, while I'm aware of it.  I say ""while I'm aware of it"" because if I'm asleep we have no problems.  If I know one of my ""lifelines"" isn't within a short drive of my location, I go into full panic mode.  Anxiety, crying, full hysteria you name it.  I can no longer drive long distances (especially at night or when it's raining) or the same thing happens.  When I am alone, the only reason I am not in full panic mode is that I know my parents or my niece and nephew will be home shortly.  My mom traveled across the country recently for a funeral, my father was still here, and I had to take clonazePAM every day for a week to prevent from having a meltdown.  I currently have a psychiatrist who prescribes me Zoloft, BusPIRone, and generic Seroquel.  I'm too scared to seek employment. I'm scared of what I will do to myself if my parents aren't around in the future to help me.  I'm too scared to live my life. I've missed countless weddings, birthdays, you name it, all because I cannot get a grasp on my mental stability.  How do I put my life back together? I was never this co-dependent until these past couple of years, but now I am crippled by it.  

 I'll explain in more detail so you all can get a better grasp of the situation that lead me to this point in my life. This is going to be a pretty long detailed story so if you just want to comment on what I could do to improve my life please skip all of this background information and leave your suggestions.  Also another disclaimer, I'm going to sound like a whiney privileged kid, but that's not who I am anymore and  I need help. I'm a little biased but it's a pretty decent story 

Growing Up

 I had a relatively easy childhood. I never had any anxiety or panic attacks growing up until I went off to college.  I'm from a conservative household with one sibling (who is now alcoholic.)  I was one of the ""cool"" (BIG "" "" on cool) kids in highschool.  I had and have deep connections with a large number of friends who I partied with every weekend and still talk to regularly.  I was in advance placement classes. I was all-state in sports, but I never really worked for any of this stuff.  I am gifted with good verbal memory and soak what teachers say like a sponge. Above-average grades came with minimal effort. I will say the one thing I never really had was a girlfriend or boyfriend.  I was sexually active with women from the age of 16, but it was all party hookups, etc, and no serious relationships. Most of the women I persued are my really good friends now but were never interested in a relationship. I'm not like drop-dead gorgeous, but I'm an okay looking guy. Money was always tight in my family, which really ""cramped my style"" (I hate teenage me) but college was always in my future. My brother had flunked out of Ole Miss and I was not going to be the failure he was.

 College part 1 

(I'm going to sound like a douche but I promise I'm a genuinely nice guy) Upon graduation, I got accepted into the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.  It was the first and only school I applied for and received a full scholarship (again not facing failure).  It is about 4 hours from my home town, which is rather small and I was intent on escaping. The world was my oyster at this point.  I couldn't be stopped. I was going to major in Biochemistry. I was going to become a doctor, and I was going to be living large. I pledged a fraternity (paid for by scholarship money) and partied till the sun came up. I was hazed pretty hard, but I don't have any PTSD from it or anything that I'm aware of. It was just something that had to be done on my way to my ideal future. My grandfather died this same semester, he was my homie, my fishing buddy.  It devastated me and it was the first time I came face to face with mortality. I was determined to do him proud, but this cost me my faith.  I couldn't understand why God would take him away from me. Some of the shrinks like to focus on this point as my downward spiral, Idk what are you guys thoughts? Continuing, I finished pledging maintained good enough grades to keep my scholarship and wrapped the semester up.  Had some of the sex with women, but no girlfriends still. I was introduced to Adderall it was the most amazing drug holy moly.  All in all, came home from my freshman year of college about how I expected. Like I was above my home town, high school was so below me, etc, etc. (super condescending I know look I promise I'm like the sweetest most genuine guy and I'm coming off like a super douchy chad. I turn it around bear with me.)

 I go into my sophomore year an active member of the fraternity, living in the house, classes are still breeze, life is good.  I smoke a lot more weed this semester, but everyone's doing it so what the hell. (I'm a huge closet nerd anyway I love getting baked and gaming) We do these things called ""date parties"" where you dress up to a theme and invite a girl, usually some girl you hope to hook up with, to the party.  I didn't have a date so I asked my roommate to set me up. (His date is now his wife which is soo so sweet but I'm getting distracted.) He hooks me up with his date's roommate. (We'll call her Shannon for privacy's sake) Shannon and I dress up as hippies, get drunk, kiss, stay the night together, but don't do anything besides kiss. We both agree we want it to be more than a one night stand. I had finally found someone that wanted to be in a relationship with me, and she was perfect.  She's beautiful, she works with mentally challenged children, she's so smart, and above all else, she quotes ""Mean Girls"" the first night we meet. For a fraternity kid, I'm not into all the manly stuff.  I don't really like sports, manual labor, and my favorite movie is ""Mean Girls"" So when Shannon says, ""that's why my hairs so big"" and I instantly shout out with elation, ""because it's full of secrets!??!?"" My heart was won. She became my first love and only love I've ever had. 

  \*Trust issues enters the chat room\*

I'm getting too detailed here I'm sorry I'll pick up the pace.  Long story short I had girl friends and she had boy friends we both trusted each other it wasn't a big deal. Then she breaks up with me randomly doesn't say a word after 6 months.  I find out later it's because she had cheated on me with one of her ""guy friends"" My trust is ruined. This scars me to this day. The sophomore semester ends here with her breaking up with me on the way home.  I stay home for a month and I can't take being around my family. (I'm a smoker at this point in my life my parents don't know) So I sign up for a summer class and travel back to Knoxville so I can do me.  This is where things start to show.  I lose 30 lbs. I'm clearly in depression from the break-up but no one notices. I just kind of truck along and take my classes to get a small job at a telemarketing company to help pay rent (no scholarships during the summer).  I smoke copious amounts of weed with my roommates and play league of legends all summer.  My class does not go well.  Time for the big breakdown.

 Junior year of college 

Shit just really hits the fan at this point.  I'm taking substantial amounts of Adderall to keep up with my constant partying and weed smoking.  I get a new girlfriend she's sweet and cute but it doesn't have the same spark.  She drives me home for thanksgiving because she lives close. I haven't' slept in 2 days from studying and when I finally arrive home, Catatonic breakdown.  Combination of smoking weed, Adderall leaving my system and just generally being a piece of shit the entire semester, I lose it and cry for 12 hours until my mom takes me to the hospital.  We decide I don't need triage so we leave and go to a General Physician. He prescribes me Xanex and tells me to talk to a shrink in Knoxville when I go back.  I become a huge tool bag and say terrible things to my girlfriend while under the influence of alcohol and annex.  I don't go see a counselor. I break up with my girlfriend because it wasn't healthy for her to take that kind of verbal abuse from me. ( I am not a physical person and I never laid a hand on her, but I am an asshole when inebriated apparently.)  Long story short, I smoke a lot, I drink a lot, I'm in full crisis failing classes, etc. I call my crying telling her sorry I'm a failure. Mom says it's okay to fail sometimes. It all went to shit I lose my scholarships. so I finally go see a counselor.   Post counseling (I'm trying to be less detailed here I'm sorry I know it's a lot to take in)   It all just goes away my fear of failure. I become vice president of the fraternity.  I land a smoking hot girlfriend who was a pageant queen.  She's great to show off to the family and that's how I treat her like a trophy.  We have no real connection we just have great sex that's about it. Surface relationship.  All while I'm failing smoking weed etc. I just quit caring.  I'm on Lexapro for a while at this point and the counselor teaches me how to manage my anxiety with breathing and I think this is the end of it only up from here. 

  Senior year

 Gosh, it's all just such a cluster fuck from this point I'll quickly note it. I get a job as a bartender. I'm a huge stoner. I drop out of school.  I'm actually gay but repressing it all because I think I'll bring shame to my family (being conservative).  I hook up with my first dude. After that, there is no going back. Every woman I try to be with after that... things don't work properly.  I hate myself for the entire year telling myself, ""I'll wait till they die and then I can live my life.""  I live this newly found double life for the rest of the year.  Being the cool bartender fraternity bro that ""slays women"" while secretly hating myself and hooking up with dudes whenever my roommate left town.  This causes breakdown number 2. I cannot even make myself say the words, ""I'm gay."" When I finally do things start going so much better. I start telling my friends they all don't give a shit. I tell my family they kinda give a shit but whatever. It's fine I can work with it.      

The 7 years of college.

 I eventually reenroll keeping my bartending job paying for a few classes at a time. No more weed. Only Adderall and booze. I do this for 3 years after my projected graduation date until I actually graduate.  Everything was fine. No anxiety, no self-loathing. I just kept telling myself, just finish school and then you'll figure it out.  Then boom 1 month after graduation, I have full anxiety break down.  I'm afraid I'm going to hurt myself cause I'm so anxious. (I had no plan, but that's how my brain was working that day). I go to the ER. and find out there's not that much they can do for me.  They give me some antihistamine and it helps for the next month.  I end up getting food poisoning and can't keep the anti-anxiety meds down.  I have a full break down again and my parents drive 4 hrs in the middle of the night to save me.  and that leads me to where I am now.

 Ever since I was rescued by my parents I can't be separated from them for extended periods, which brings us to the current day.  I do no drugs, I don't drink, I take pills every day, and I still can't be alone. This is my story.  Please tell me someone has something similar. 

TLDR: Lived alone for years and now can't be alone for longer than 12 hours.  I never had anything outside of anxiety before.",10Apr2020,1

84,"Hi, I just wanted to remind you that whoever and wherever you are, you deserve to be happy. Everyone deserves to be happy. To anyone who thinks they aren’t good enough, you are enough. Like everyone else, you deserve to have happiness in your life. Well done for getting this far and persevering, that goes to everyone, you deserve praise and appreciation for going through so much. Even if you don’t feel like you deserve the praise, you do, you’ve come so far, keep going. All of these hardships that we face will lead us to a more peaceful and happier life in future, it will be worth it. I’m not saying we won’t struggle in the future or that things will automatically get better, but I’m saying there’s always a rainbow after the rain. Keep that in mind, things get better. You are strong, even if you don’t know it/feel like it. Reach out to someone, it’s good to be listened to, helped and  have someone to positively counter all the negative opinions and thoughts in your mind. You are enough, you deserve love, you deserve happiness. Don’t tell yourself otherwise. When you overcome things, you become more able to help others with the same things you suffered with, that’s the best thing you can do for someone, understand and help. I’m proud of you, no matter who you are or what you’ve got going on. Keep going, it’s okay if you make mistakes, we can learn from them. You’re doing great and I’ll never stop believing in you. Don’t let your negative thoughts fool you, you have value, you have worth. Accepting yourself is hard but when it happens, it’s totally worth it.
You deserve to be happy.
:)

Note: Hi, I hope this helps you, someone reminded me that there’s a brighter future waiting for me and tbh I really needed that.

86,"I’ve self quarantined with my family since the first week of March already and so much is going on. It’s all really taking a toll on my mental health. Normally I’m very upbeat and rarely feel sad but this is different. 

To start, I’ve been isolated from people for a month already and by state orders I have another month to go. 

Because of this I am unable to see my dad, brother or uncle because they don’t live with us, but we are very close and it’s hard. 

Then it feels like my friends are slowly removing themselves from my life and it feels like I have no one to talk to. And when I do I feel as if I’m annoying them. 
I’ve been questioning if I am mentally stable enough to be in the relationship I am, but I also don’t know if I want out of it. I have so much to focus on, it’s just hard. 

Lastly and the hardest part is my cat. She’s 19 and had a stroke last night. She’s doing okay for what she can but still needs around the clock care from me and my mom. I’ve never been without her and I just want her to pass peacefully, if we have to put her down due to the quarantine we can’t be in the vet with her and that breaks my heart. 

TL;DR - I feel like I’m going to break, I feel so alone and I don’t know what to do. I have no one to talk to, I have never felt this depressed in my life and I don’t know how to cope with how much is going on right now. I just want a hug.",10Apr2020,1
87,"I've been ill for several months. I have this health condition where I can't digest food very well, so eating is a real hassle. I'm physically sick and weak most of the time, everytime I seem to think that I'm getting better something happens and I'm bedridden again.
Two days ago, I had a ""flare-up"" and I never felt weaker than I am now. I've lost weight because I'm not eating (I'm already underweight to begin with) and I look horrifying... I can't bring myself to look in the mirror. It's not that I don't want to eat, but the pain and the discomfort that accompany eating are too much to handle, not eating suddenly seems like a more viable alternative. I've truly lost all will to eat, I only eat because I'm on medication and because my mum makes me. I know I may sound whiny, but it is what it is. I'm very ill and I'm very sick of being ill, it's too much to handle. Suffering on daily basis has made life much more difficult for me than it already is (I'm going to avoid talking about other stuff bc I don't intend to make this any longer).
I'm feeling really depressed. I wanted to get better before, now I just don't care. I just want the suffering to end. I'm not even suicidal, or thinking about suicide. I'm a person who really fears death and the unknown, but when I'm in physical pain all the time, this fear vanishes and suddenly it seems like I can let go easily...
Today, I had to weigh myself and found out I'd lost 3.5 kilos while I'm already underweight. I felt mortified, but somewhat relieved?? Is this normal? I'm sure it's not. I think that I felt that the end was a bit nearer and it's all very ridiculous! I want to get better and I want to gain weight and be healthy, but why can't I find the will to do so?",10Apr2020,1
88," So there's a lot of elements here. But basically, I forget up to 6 years of my life if I feel like I'm under threat, scared, or accidentally hurt myself (i.e. stubbing my toe). I usually forget back to February 16th, 2018, and don't remember my boyfriend, new friends, memories, or anything. I've been misdiagnosed with epilepsy and was on the wrong medication for 1 year. I'm now getting psychological help although there is only so much they can do since they can't use hypnosis.

I have PTSD now and many of the common symptoms. Staring into the distance for hours without realising, flashbacks of false memories (and real ones), panic attacks, hallucinations, etc.

Why hypnosis? I used hypnotherapy for relaxation back in 2015, but it quickly turned dark and sexual. By mid-2016, there were several online individuals who were controlling my mind. I don't remember a lot of this time thanks to memory blocks, but bits and pieces come back in flashbacks late at night. I have around 60 trigger words that can completely change my personality, make me do and feel things that aren't real, and even believe I'm in a completely different reality. I was made to believe I was a person called Winter who lived in a hostel, carrying out sexual favours with very little IQ. I have had two 'forgets' that have been so bad that I've reverted back to her, and my boyfriend has had to deal with it. In early 2018, I was 'strongly advised' to look for someone who could own me full time which would potentially lead to sex traffiking or complete loss of self. That's when I met my boyfriend and he helped me get out of everything.

I haven’t made any friends this year, despite being in a small program where you’re forced to interact with one another, which makes me feel so defeated. I felt so much discomfort throughout the school year because I just didn’t have another person to talk to in class or to hangout with after class. normally I don’t have a hard time socializing with people and forming relationship, but this year I just felt so exhausted in every social situation I was put in. I feel like a lot of things are out of my control and it’s so overwhelming; Especially considering that everyone around me is building great friendships, or getting into new relationships, or just being young adults while Im stuck in a weird place in between high school and college. 

I feel so much regret and it gives me such heavy anxiety which is incredibly difficult to deal with when you’re alone. The worse part about it all is that if I want to transfer I would have to get better grades but it’s extremely difficult to do so when you feel entrapped by sadness. 

What should I do? I was planning on going to see a doctor or therapist to get anxiety medication because it’s definitely something I’m struggling with right now, but with everything closed, I can’t. I also wanted to see a therapist to help me more productive about my feelings but can’t do that either. I kind of feel like I’m slowly drowning.

Long story short, last august I tried weed for the first time but stupidly, I smoked a lot more then I should have for a newbie (2 joints). While high I felt extremely anxious and had this constant reoccurring thought that I couldn't understand human language (even though I can duhh) and a general question of how am I able to do anything (for example I can move my hands, I can talk but how am I actually doing this? I have no idea).

Anyway after getting high this constant reoccurring thought is literally always in my head even to this day. For example I could be listening to a lecture then suddenly bam, how am I able to understand what the lecturer is saying, maybe I can't? Obviously this is completely irrational but the feeling of discomfort and I guess stress is still there. I might be talking/listening to a friend and bam the same thing.

This is so weird I don't whats wrong with me. I never had issues with anxiety or depression ever before in my life and I used to be super happy but now I am literally sad all the time. I even split up with my girlfriend because I just wasn't happy with life. I'm not a stupid person, I came third in my first year of university and I know these thoughts are irrational but still they keep coming to me.

97,"I have general anxiety/panic attacks and OCD but don't have a fear of being poisoned in general.  I recently went on a tinder date and my date started talking about how she thinks people are poisoning her in public (bartenders putting windex in her drink was an example she used.)  She was pretty hung up on the topic and seemed to be paranoid about it.  We got off the topic and went to a bar and I left my drink on our table when I went to the restroom and when I came back she put a coaster on the top of my drink, saying she thought that was the polite thing to do...I have no idea why she did that.  Since the date I started feeling anxious that maybe she poisoned me when I left my drink alone with her and her obsession with being poisoned may be related to her doing that.  Is my anxiety about this completely irrational?  I didn't get sick or have symptoms, is it possible to have been poisoned or had a harmful substance in your drink without symptoms?

101,"I am really struggling today. And yesterday. I know that there are bigger things to worry about, and that I'm selfish to feel this way when so many other people are out there putting their lives on the line so people like me can stay at home and be safe. I know all of that. But it doesn't make it go away.

It's so sunny today, but when I look out the window and see people in their communal gardens, all sitting so far away from each other, I don't feel that joy and sense of community that everyone keeps saying they say. I just see sadness. I hate this. I hate that we're all suddenly so afraid of each other. I went out for groceries a few days ago and a woman wearing a mask tried to talk to me, from a safe distance. I leaned in ever so slightly as I couldn't hear her from behind her mask and she jumped away from me so far. I laughed about it at the time, but now it just makes me so sad. This isn't what humanity is. Is this what it's going to be like from now on? All so scared of each other?

I should be grateful to be alive. I don't feel alive. This isn't living. This is barely existing. I should be grateful I even have the option to go outside but when I do I just feel worse. Seeing all of the little cafes and bars and shops that made me fall in love with where I live, all closed off for god know's how long. It's just too sad to see. 

I should be grateful not to have lost anyone so far. And I am. But I'm also so acutely aware of how far away I feel from everyone that I have. A chat on the phone is not the same. Video calls are not the same. Having my flatmate here to chat to is not the same. I want to hold my partner. And not knowing when that can happen is crushing. Maybe if we knew when we could be out of this. But then maybe that wouldn't help at all. I don't know if I can do weeks of this, let alone months.

I know how much of a workaholic I am, which is a whole other thing. I should be grateful I'm just on furlough and haven't lost my job. And I am. Or at least I tell myself that I am. But not working is hard. Having no routine is hard. I tried to make myself a new one and it does help a little, but it also highlights how fucking useless I really am. My job doesn't matter. My job doesn't help the world. My job is so self-important. Just another frustrated creative chasing the money that comes with the world of advertising. Furloughed. Not necessary right now. But the truth is it's never necessary. It's pointless. People always tell me how good I am at my job, how much they admire me for going after what I wanted. But why? Why did I even want it? What's the good in being good at something that has no real practical purpose?

Mostly I am just so ashamed and disappointed in myself. Everyone is always telling me how strong I am, how much they admire how strong I am. That I'm always so optimistic and practical. I'm so ashamed that none of it is true. Right when I should be showing just how strong I can be, I feel so disgustingly weak. I haven't answered the phone when my mum called me three times today, because I know my voice will crack and she will want to know why. I haven't messaged back my partner. I can't even bring myself to open the message it's nothing awful, just a simple Happy Easter, but the second I open it that means he'll know and I'll have to reply.

I can hear my flatmate downstairs in the kitchen. I know that I should make an effort to eat something no matter how little I feel like it, but I don't want to go down there while she's there. I love her dearly, but I can't pretend to be chirpy right now. And i don't want her to see me like this. I don't want anybody to see how fucking terribly I'm coping right now. Because what's the matter with me? What am I even coping with? Who am I to fall apart?

I just want this to be over. I want to fall asleep until it's all done. I want to fast forward and have my life back. I want to scream at everyone telling me to 'Stay home, save lives"". I know that. I fucking know that. I don't need it hammered down my throat every 10 minutes on social media, or on TV ads, or online ads, or on posters when I bother to venture outside. I don't want to do this. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. This isn't what human life should be. What's the point of having your life when you simply can't live it?",10Apr2020,1

103,"I woke up yesterday morning full of energy, and immediately went out to get my errands done, i.e. shopping, laundry, filling up the gas. Then when I got home I ran a 5k, which is something I've been trying to do lately. Throughout this entire period I was anxious and high energy, yet hyper efficient in completing my tasks. I did not eat until after I had finished. Once I had eaten, it was like my body shut down, and most of my mind did as well - I felt exhausted. Yet there was still a whirring tension that kept me from taking a nap or peacefully doing low stimulation activities like reading or video games. I was forced to just kind of lay like a potato and watch youtube for much of the time. In addition, I had difficulty thinking, and could not feel emotion. This started around 1 pm yesterday, and although i was eventually ablebto talk on the phone some with my beother around 7, it took until this morning (8 am) to feel 'normal' again. 



I must say, this has happened many many times before, and even during my high energy phase I understood what was happening and knew that there would be a downfall. I oftentimes try and overeat or overcaffeinate in order to eegain energy/feeling, but that oftentimes does more harm than good. 



Anyway anyone else experience this? I mean I understand it's like the bodies way of shutting down and preventing too much stress, but it's frustrating as hell and it has fucked with my attempts at going to college in the past. Any advice or insight would be appreciated.",10Apr2020,1

105,"My real problems started 15 years ago, together with heavy weightlifting at that time, developed a severe posture of upper/lower crossed syndrome, from my body constantly being in fight/flight mode. This affected the anxiety/depressions was shooting it through the roof. I continued a few years but at last I had to go to psychiatric emergency. They’ve tried so many meds during the years. 

All meds that has lifted my mood has at the same time triggered muscle tensions as if my brain see it as a threat and the fight/flight mode is on. SSRI has this effect almost immediately, at the same time it makes me more creative but make the system go overdrive (is it making perhaps light bipolar or any adhd symptoms worse?! 

Lamictal was the only medicine that has really worked to lower the tensions and also raising my mood and stable the anxiety. After some research I think it’s worked better than others because of the glutamate antagonism. After that I’ve tried Valproate/Depakote, Cymbalta, Amitriptyline with not the same success. Also I’m really sensitive to norepinephrine in the last two ones. Lyrica helps relaxing the nerves a little for a few hours but makes me feel really slow and dumb.

Are there any other medications that work on minimizing glutamate and have uplifting effect same as Lamictal?

How about newer atypical antipsychotics? Is it worth trying (don’t like the idea of playing with dopamine receptors. Rexulti, Vraylar? I tried Abilify for a few days and it really made me creative but same there, it triggered and activated the tensions. I don’t know if it would continue because I dropped it after a few days.

I was thinking about saying that I had a depressive episode which isn't a lie since I have depression and that was probably a big cause for the psychosis. However, I don't know if saying that I have depression will look so good either.

Had a bad alcohol problem, stopped eating, lost contact any people I knew and attempted suicide 3-4 years ago (bad idea) and can vividly remember how empty that feels.

Of course I still have ""those"" days or weeks, but I'm becoming better and better at noticing when I have those crop ups, it's not a pit of darkness but more like a flashing light now. Slowly through developing healthier coping mechanisms like going for walks or cooking, which may sound retarded, but really helps ground my thoughts and and realize it's just my mind playing up; it took me years to push myself to go for a walk so I know how hard it might be but once that first one's done you've made a huge step.

I have had depression since 12. But when I started a new school last year this all become alot worse. I didnt fit in with the other girls and because of my social anxiety I didnt even know how to talk to them. I spent months without freinds, and I started wondering WHY dont I fit in. I began comparing myself to other girls, finding things wronge with me. Things they didnt do, and I did. I tell myself everday that no one could love me unconditionally, that I must be perfect to be loved.I started trying to change myself to be like them, and to be perfect. But it wasnt working. So I decided I would punish myself, I have long nails and would pinch myself every time I did something wrong. But soon my skin got used to this, so pinching didnt hurt, so I cut every couple days so that when I pinch it does hurt. Ik its sick and that no one can be perfect, but I need to be or I'll go crazy.
 I punish myself for anything and everything, eating to much, saying something stupid, being weird, laughing to loud, slouching, not doing excersise, doing something dumb, not studying. I've done this on and off for a year, I have also become obsessed with my weight. I tell myself I am fat, I weigh myself 5 times a day. Whenever I get more than 50.5kg I will diet untill I go back to 47. Dieting means I only eat half my dinner, no lunch, no breakfast. I've gone weeks only eating 800 calories a day.
I'm tired of living like this, and hating myself. I look at the girl I was a couple years ago and I have become a shadow of her.

But that doesn't stop me from being absolutely livid at myself every time I misplace something and cannot find it.

Worst part is I almost never seem to find back what I'm looking for on the first search pass, I'll usually search the spot where I'll locate what is missing 2-3x before I actually find it. And usually waste over an hour looking. Then when I do find what I'm looking for I never feel relieved, I feel even more enraged at myself for not finding it sooner.

This happens at least once a week and basically ruins a whole day when it does because start calling myself ""worthless"" and a ""stupid piece of shit"" because I lost something *again* and it's hard to get out of that mindset; it's not even just when I lose things but when I forget things I find myself getting angry at myself because I forgot something *again* (I was on SSRIs for 7 years as a child and blame my completely shit memory on that)

Like seriously maybe I'm just really stupid but swear it's like the moment I tell myself I need to do something there's a 50/50 chance I instantly forget to do it.

I take pictures and aufios to make sure that what I just heard is real. I slept the whole day afterwards, so I did get sleep. But this time I didn‘t sleep at all and I am not tired. I texted my psychologist and she said she can tell me when she has time on tuesday. I don‘t have any medication. It‘s hell to go through that. My thoughts scare me all the time. I really don‘t know what to do. I don‘t talk about this to anyone of my family. Just to two friends and my psychologist. My stomach hurts since 2 days, I guess because I am nervous.
I really don‘t know how to get over these days. Was anyone in the same situation?",10Apr2020,1
117,"47 year old male here.

2 days ago my (ex?) GF (43)  stormed into our bedroom and told me to leave. This was completely unexpected. Sure, we've had our share of conflict, but nothing serious (no cheating, stealing, physical confrontation, etc).  It seemed to be just a normal relationship.


A little background: Last year shortly after she was released from a rehab facility for alcoholism we were on the couch eating popcorn.  I heard what sounded like her snoring and went to get her up to get her into bed, but she wasn't snoring...Her heart was in arrhythmia. I called 911 and did CPR while waiting.  She apparently died and they were able to resuscitate her when they arrived. She went into another episode in the ambulance on the way to the ER where they stabilized her. It traumatized the fuck out of me, to be frank.


I was by her side 24/7 for the first several days, but had to go back to work. After that, I was there every morning on my way to work and every evening on my way home. 


She, understandably, hasn't worked since then.  She does okay as her employer has kept her on and she's receiving about $2400/mo from a policy.  She just has to do the co-pay for her health insurance. I pay the rent and most of the bills.


Her ejection fraction rate is at 15-20% which is worrisome, to say the least.  She's not getting enough oxygen to her brain and is almost in a very light dementia state where she's forgetful and often can't put two and two together. She hasn't really left the apartment in months.  I do (or did) all the shopping, banking, etc. We'd go out for dinner before the pandemic and do some things but I could tell that she was feeling more and more isolated. I tried to encourage her to go out while I was at work and see her best friend that lives a few blocks away and do lunch or have some tea at one of the shops in the neighborhood.


Fast forward to a couple days ago: She storms into the bedroom and unexpectedly announces that we're done and she wants me out. She declares that if I don't leave that she'd get family involved and call the cops. I ran some errands, packed a bag and left.  I'm at my Mom's for the time being sleeping in a bed that I haven't slept in since I was in highschool.  


A few weeks ago I had radial head replacement surgery on my elbow and then shortly thereafter was put on furlough from my job.  I'm still waiting to get my unemployment approved.  


She kicked me to the curb when I needed her most. I can't believe that she'd throw me out unexpectedly with no money, a bad arm, and into a pandemic.  


She texted me last night saying that she's going back to Arizona at the end of May. She claimed that she's going to live with her ex-sister in law and niece, but I have a sinking feeling that she's actually going to be moving in with this couple that she knows who are (supposedly) ex-junkies.  She's a good person with a really big heart and I know that they're going to take advantage of her.  Both her mother and brother have committed suicide. 

I don't know what else I can say right now. 

I'm devastated at everything that's happened. I do love her and she's really the best friend I've ever had. I've been through plenty of breakups before, but this all just seems completely surreal.  


I'm broken up that she'd do this and genuinely fearful for her if she goes through with this.",10Apr2020,1

119,"Uncertain of the title.
Woke early with some clarity. Took notes for clarity, I thought it was very helpful to me and thought I'd share in case it is for anyone else. I hope there are more such mornings ahead.
...

Clear lucidity this morning after waking from a dream. Clarity of memories. The forms of childhood, the stacks of experience unfolding ongoing which unwittingly comprises who I am.
To begin born with a defective ear which caused such constant blinding pain it was an experiential course in managing that pain through difficult acceptance, understanding, avoiding and distraction, strength and endurance and sometimes escape through medication, surgery, physical surrender and bursting eardrums and periods of alleviation. During times of alleviation there was ""normal childhood"" which I presume would be the standard experience growing up outside of intense lightening pain for most others though we all have our particular unique life paths. Some times were good and fun and most importantly safe. Unfortunately in the 70s in my neighborhood there were a few young boys slightly older than me who found their fun in kicking me around, maticulously torchering my happiness away through physical pain and violence, mental and emotional manipulation, continual betrayal of trust and cruel actions such as destroying my favorite toys. I was imprinted by pain and became branded as a child you could beat on. It continued out of the neighborhood into preschool, kindergarten and gradeschool, as did the gradually lessening but still regular intermittent anxiety through painful ear episodes until finally through puberty they had grown into place. Meanwhile a little plastic tube placed in my ear as an infant had fallen in and not out a few days after it was surgically implanted without the aid of anesthetic and would remain there agitating further the underlying conditions until eventually finding it's way out in my late thirties. 
Toys were a respite from the pain and filled my little world with wonder and escape however fleeting. Adults were largely not present in a positive way though I know I was loved and cared for by my mother despite her own troubles at the time dealing with my father and their relationship and I was adored by his father and my mother's mother. My father was incomplete and though he knew he ought to he had trouble loving me unconditionally. I imprinted largely on my mother and was absent a steady fatherly hand. Our interactions mostly ended in his frustration and/or domination. It was great to do things that would not end up that way, like tossing a ball, but there was little time for the opportunity of patience and space to align. Otherwise he'd have fun with me joining with my sister and tickling me excruciatingly. I hated that, would laugh-scream and wet my pants which seemed to be the point. Perhaps they just liked making me laugh so hard and thought I liked it, I can give them that break - though I seem to recall some recognition of foul play be mentioned by mom.

Gradually as I grew through the pain and childhood subordination I discovered fighting back against the bullies who found delight in me as a target and I would enjoy the chase for my part but not the beatings or taunting - finally after returning a first kick it was all over and so I began fighting anyone who'd challenge me for the next couple of years, quickly running through my few friends and finding myself a stringy haired loner with a can-do fuck-you attitude. I'd also discovered stealing icey treats in my shin guards from the local convenience store a way to make friends on the soccer team. I was shown to steal by some of those older bullies, as well as one time (after third grade I believe) being coerced and cajoled into entering through the window of my summer school classroom where a (substitute) young female teacher was really laying into me in an awful way for some reason I did not understand and completely turning the place over in a fury of resentment fueled retaliation. That preceded the notion of thieving, had set some stage. I was never approached or caught for it though I'm sure she must have known it was me - I believe she even returned to the classroom with the class (they were on a field trip somewhere and I was not allowed to accompany them I have the impression) as I scurried out the window, looking back at a distance finally and seeing her bewildered head tilting out the unfolded lower window I'd climbed in and out of. I was trouble for athority, talking back to teachers in little and big ways. I hated scouts. I was fiercely bullied there by an overgrown beanstalk named Kilo who'd mercilessly squeeze the back of my neck to make me yield to the suffering which I would not. Other scouts would look on without saying a word as I recall. Motherfucker.
I'd been graced by an insightful teacher in 7th grade who helped give me an experience through leadership camp that would change my trajectory by offering me positive alternate social experiences, reliable adult role models and meaningful usable tools for self growth, understanding and progressing with personal drive and command. Thank you Jeff Stark.

So this morning as I recall this alignment of important impactful experience, the small details of smells and small spaces and faces and names long forgotten, awkward situations, uncomfortable, mooreless, absent of positive role models, etc I realized something like this...
There were conditions I was born into of horrible physical excruciation, terror set upon my innocence by others older and capable of it and pain streaming between the two and weaving amongst my family members and in any voids would be filled in with witness of space or the occupying of that time with freedom to choose, and what I would choose would be pleasure, antidote to pain, with imagination and enjoyment of whatever my senses could contact and I could control. These times seemed few and far between though also incredibly important.
I wanted instinctually to be loved and accepted. Anywhere. By my self, by my mom and dad, grandparents, sister, friends, other parents, teachers - anybody. I had trouble finding any feeling of security in this though, due to circumstances beyond our control or reckoning and filled the void however I could manage, successfully or not.

It is important to see this for my own personal understanding of my self and the form of my life, to chart my course and location, realizing the relatively, the recognition of what had occurred prior to the overwhelming destraction of obedience to law and the dollar and debt, paying with constant time and attention all the while being unpresent and gradually increasingly ignorant of what being truly present is. Who I am. Not an expectation or role or rectangle on an org chart. Just this experience I call me and an understanding of what's really included there (with the benefit of some perspective) which feels enormously helpful and full of meaning. I had to write it down lest the next wave of distraction pulls me way away again. It's perhaps an opportunity of the disconnection from the juggernaut of modern money making society that created the quiet space sufficient for this lucidity. In any case I prize the fortune and hope earnestly to allow greater such space to distinguish other myriad connections and flowers of feelings and unfolding understandings or clarifying the misunderstandings. Thank you.",10Apr2020,1
120,"I (42F) am finally ""dealing"" with my mental health problems.  I was suicidal and hallucinating about 6 weeks ago.  Spent 2 weeks inpatient, 3 weeks in PHP, and this was my second week in IOP.  Everything has been helpful and I'm  doing great.  Monday was a very productive day.  

This past Tuesday, I was seated at a table, using my laptop to participate in a ""virtual IOP"".  I was writing some notes and suddenly, my field of vision telescoped into a small point of light.  I started to fall forward and thankfully came back awake before my head even hit the table.

The IOP therapist called me an hour later when the group session had ended.  I told her that I have had this happen many times, I've already been tested and all my physicians know about it.  

On Thursday, an hour before the next IOP group was scheduled to start, she called me again.  This time, she told me I need to have my medications reviewed before continuing the program.  I immediately messaged my doctors, asking if they thought it might be a medication issue. 

It's not.  I've already been tested for everything.  The last time I had this same blackout experience was in the days and weeks before my hallucinations.

I'm not sure if I should I try to continue this process, or take a break.  Whether or not I continue IOP, I also have my weekly CBT therapist to help me.  And... I'm also on the waitlist for EMDR.

I live alone and I'm retired.  My fear is that I will ""lose my head"" again and may end up hurting myself.  Not sure which is the greater risk:

1)  Continue IOP online, hoping that the therapist will call me if I blackout again.

2)  Quitting IOP and just follow my treatment in weekly CBT.

I’ve never really been a fan of animal crossing and I don’t even own a switch, but watching videos (funny moments, wholesome moments, or just people talking about their builds) calm my mind when I feel like I’m going insane!

Animal Crossing makes me feel useful when I feel I can’t do anything in the real world even when it’s not really me playing. When I’m doing schoolwork and getting overwhelmed I think about what my world and character would look like if I had the game and it always calms me. In a world where I feel like I can’t do anything, it’s nice to look at an alternative world where you control everything and everything is wholesome even if they’re living on tents and the world is called “poopsvill” or something.

122,"Hi, A little backstory, I'm a 25 year old programmer/game designer, I was working at a small company developing commercial web sites for all sorts of clients. 

Sadly, job started to get stale, my boss started to take advatage of me and started overworking me like hell. At the sime time a friend of mine who's working at a game development company (whe knows I'm also a game developer) offered me a chance to send a resume to his company and get an interview, he told me how safe it was and that he had talk to his bosses about me.

Without thinking that much about it I quitted my job and prepared myself for this important  interview, I took it and It went well I'll say, I really connected with my potential employer and I seemed to have all the skills he was looking for, so of course I got really excited and validated (working at game development company is a dream job for me). 

Sadly, a couple of days after the interview the COVID-19 outbreak got really serious, causing me to lose EVERY job oportunity I had (including my dream job that I was sure I got), pretty much every company I tried to send my resume to has said that they would love to hire me, but they cannot because of the current economy. 

This honestly has made all of my insecurities and depression to come back to haunt me, I feel like shit, like a no talent nobody. I can't even motivate myself to work on personal projects and my mood is awful and violent, in fact I'm pretty sure my GF (F25) is about to break up with me because of my mood swings. Making me feel way more lonely (we haven't talk to each other for like 3 days now) 

I'm super afraid of this, I feel alone even while living with my parents right now, I honestly don't feel like I'm gonna make it, My GF has tried to ""cheer"" me up by telling me that is out of my control and that Everyone is having a terrible time right now with the outbreak... but honestly that doesn't make me feel better at all. If anything it makes me feel worse.

What could I do to repress this feelings? or at least how should I try to live this out without hurting myself?

I've been doing exposure and today I did an exposure that was quite high on my ""fear ladder"" post exposure I'm struggling with a lot of anxiety, my anxiety definitely didn't decrease by half during, it did go down a bit.
Now am struggling with post exposure anxiety, and worrying about future exposures does anyone have any advice/experience dealing with anxiety after exposure...or to prepare for future exposures?",10Apr2020,1

127,"So, I (20F) am having a really hard time with my mental health. I have always had issues, but I am getting to the point where its constant and unmanageable, and I really don't know what to do. I also don't know if I'm overreacting, but I feel crazy. I just no longer seem to have any control, and I'm genuinely getting scared. I've made an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I have to wait a while because I'll be a new patient. I just really wish someone could give me an idea of what's happening to me. I'm listing my symptoms below to see if anyone experiences similar things, or may know what's going on with me.


(TL;DR Cant focus w/o background stimulation (Netflix-- same shows on repeat) &amp; cant focus w it, dissociation, I zone out frequently, procrastination, self esteem problems, rapid mood swings, forgetfulness, monopolizing conversations, nail biting &amp; picking at lips/pimples/skin, sleep struggles. Does anyone struggle with similar issues?)


- I can't sit quietly. I need something entertaining me... I keep Netflix running all of the time just to have something in the background. I think its because I hate being alone, but idk. I do it when other people are around too, and cant function well without it. This is not just down times, its always... during chores, meals, in the shower, driving, etc. On the other hand, I can't focus on 2 things at once even though I need the sound. Like I cant read with the sound on, but without it I get frustrated that its not there.


- I often dissociate (this started last year). Im not sure if thats the right word, but I get really aware of my periphrial vision and everything looks like its moving too fast and isnt real. It scares me. 


- I have trouble focusing on what people say directly to me (when they talk a while, like lectures). I hear them for a little bit and then I start thinking about the fact I need to pay attention to them, and then I lose whatever they were saying. Has happened since I was younger, but my parents always coached me to stare at people's forheads when they're talking so it looks like I'm paying attention. Has been a problem in class for me... I look like I'm paying hard attention, the prof then calls on me bc Im looking at them, and I have no idea whats happening and I have to bs my way through.


- I struggle with procrastination incredibly, but I WANT to do the work. Its hard to explain. But like I spend more time thinking that I need to do stuff, and that makes me anxious, and so I take longer to do what I need to. Ive taken trig three times now bc of this, and I havent read 1 book I've been assigned all the way through since high school (at least when theyre assigned -- I can read stuff that I want to no problem... I read at a 10th grade reading level in 3rd grade, and by 6th I was reading at a college level). Ive not read one book I've been assigned this semester at college, like not even a chapter, and I'm an English major! I read summaries to get by bc I have to read things over and over in assigned books to understand them. Im just good at b.s.ing things, but Im scared for the future/my career bc I dont really know anything. However, I had a 3.9 GPA in high school and a 3.6 now. 


- I'm struggling horribly with my self esteem. I truly do not like myself. People think I'm annoying/mean/ too forward. My boyfriend says that I present as ""too eager."" This is frustrating, but I tend to fixate more on my weight/appearance. I can barely get dressed w/o breaking down. 


- I cant stop forgetting things, especially due dates, even when theyre regular assignments. Ive missed several assisgnments in one of my English classes now, bc she has discussion posts due every Sunday and I always forget. I have to keep a calendar and check it every day, multiple times for assignments, and I still forget. I also pay almost every bill that I get late, even though I have all of the money on hand bc I pay things w loans. Oh, also, I dont respond to texts/snapchats on an extremely regular basis bc I forget that I got them, which I think affects my ability to make friends &amp; keep them. However, I never forget big stuff, really, like due dates for a midterm or something.


- Im having more frequent mood swings, and my mom talks about how Ive been very prone to anger always. These mood swings make my emotions feel like theyre amplified by 10... I get sad and think of s****de, and I get angry and want to be violent. This is a recent development.


- Im worried Im pushing people away. I feel like my dad with a lot of things, especially when it comes to anger/ mood swings. But I also find myself monopolizong conversations like him (though he is worse... hasn't asked me how I am and meant it for several years now. When introduced to my bf he didnt ask one question and talked for the entire dinner about rocky), and interrupting people (while not being able to stand that happening to me). I feel hypocritical. Also, I struggle having more than like 2 friends... I fixate on them, basically, and cant handle the responsibility of having aquaintences.


- I dont eat all day long. Like every day. I just dont feel hungry. Im too busy, I feel like I dont have enough time, but then I dont really do anything. Then, I eat dinner, and then snack for the rest of the evening... I cant break this habit its horrible. Its affecting my weight. Bf wants me to mention that i dont drink fluids either (he estimates maybe 2 glasses of water a day, with him making me). I dont notice the water thing -- I just drink when Im thristy.


- Boyfriend wants me to mention nail biting, and my picking at pimples and lips. Also, he says I grind my teeth. 


- I cant sleep well, like at all. 


For background info, both father and paternal grandfather have been diagnosed with OCD, and anxiety/depression runs on my mom's side (though it's never been formally diagnosed on my mother's side because they ""don't believe"" in taking medicine for that stuff).

129,"Have there been any studies made that address the correlation between types of stressors and suicidal thoughts?

For example some practices interpret dreams to have symbolic meaning or definition that can then be applied to an individual's consciousness in order  to help with personal problems or conflicts.  Whether by luck, placebo effect, or legitimacy, some individuals can change their entire trajectory based on dreams.

Can the same approach be applied to treating suicidal thoughts?  Can we conclude what types of stressors an individual is dealing, or failing to deal with based on the form of suicide they imagine?  Or can we at least learn the intensity levels from how violent the suicide is?  If the suicide thoughts are violent, or peaceful can these indicate a person's level of reasonableness, or other important details that can help to more effectively treat the affected areas of a person's psyche?",10Apr2020,1
130,"I’ve never had a friend in my life that has lasted more than three or four years. Every time I seem to get truly close to someone, we have either fallen out, broke away, or they’ve turned and bullied me. This has happened with well over a dozen friends, at around 7 or 8 different times in my life. Naturally, after so long I began thinking it was my fault. 

Cut to me now, having had two periods of depression, struggles with self harm and currently suspected bipolar. I feel like shit. Quarantine has apparently given my friends the perfect excuse to forget about me and I haven’t spoken to some of them in months. People keep telling me to start conversations with them but that’s all I’ve done, and seeing as they haven’t gone out of their way to contact me for quite some time now, I can only assume they don’t care about me. Of course I’ve had most of these friends (have a guess) for just under five years now. 

I thought I finally made lifelong friends. I thought I finally found people who didn’t hate me. I guess that people get bored of me after a while when I open up. What’s the point in ever making friends if they’re all going to leave for no reason anyway?",10Apr2020,1

So umm, The last month has been really hard on me, I don’t know if it’s because of quarantine or something else, but my mental state has dropped so so much, it’s making me hard to sleep, to think, to do anything. I can’t even spend 10 minutes in the morning to eat cereal in peace, my mind is already taking me to the darkest places possible. 
I have a problem with overthinking and over analyzing everything. I might say something to someone and that persons response will be in my mind for at least a day and I will come up with every possible that will hurt me. 
I just want it to stop, it’s hurting me so much. It’s hard for me to open up, I just want to wake up and feel like everything is okay at least for a minute, but I can’t. Suicidal thoughts come back as well, I try to ignore them but they just don’t leave, I’m so scared that I don’t wake up one day. 
I don’t know what to do, I’m feeling so low I can’t even gather the strength to call my therapist.

136,"I have had mental health issues my whole life and have MOSTLY handled them, bipolar 2 is my current diagnosis but it's been through several to get to that one.

137,"I have been depressed, undiagnosed, for the last 9 years of my life.

I kinda learned how to cope with it more or less but what irks me alot is mood swings.

I am searching online and there is nothing like it.

I experience  several mood swings daily.

Around 6 pm I feel happy and confident and that nothing can stop me. When I wake up I feel like shit, doesn't matter when I wake up.

My positive mood reaches its maximum at 6 pm or midnight and if I don't sleep, feel worthless in 3 am in the morning or when I wake up. 

There is bipolar disorder but that is meant for people who have mood swings weekly or monthly.

Nothing ever comes up for daily or hourly mood swings. These mood swings are absolutely awful. When I feel overly positive I am aware of it, same for overly negative.

Since I am aware, I can sort of know that what I am feeling is irrational but its so annoying.

I never told anyone. But when I was 14/15 years old I use to scratch my leg around my ankle until it bled when I was angry/ upset because of my mum. No one ever notice because I wore long socks in school and sports (requirements) and made sure I had long pjs or sock on at home.  

At one point I use to feel fat. Still do sometimes. Same age before and I use to not eat but people started to notice to I started to throw up. And then I stopped. Can’t remember why. Turns out my mum knew about me not eating and noticed I lost weight. And I was hurt she never talked to me or helped me. 

Anyway when I get upset and angry sometimes I can’t help punch the wall. I know. Not the best idea. It just helps for a moment. 

And sometimes if my mum upsets me really badly. I’ll stop eating. I don’t know why. I just won’t eat that day. Even if I feel hungry I just can’t eat. When I get to the stage I’m at atm I’m just to upset or angry I lose my appetite. Again my mum knows of this because in the past I’ve yelled well now I’m not eating. And I won’t at all. 

And she never talks to me about stuff afterwards. Like apologising and talking about it afterwards. It doesn’t happen we just pretend it didn’t happen. 

I moved away for a year to work and yeah I had a breakdown or two (it was stressful. Pretty much everyone has a breakdown in their year too). I was happy. I hate healthier. I lost weight without too. And still ate what I want. I was so happy. And now I’m bad. It took awhile but I’m feeling worse than ever. Especially with the coronavirus. I’m very upset and scared and no one in the house gets what I’m feeling and my mum always takes it out on me.

She helped so much and I started to use her as an emotional crutch essentially. She wanted me to get professional help but I couldn't bring myself to do it as the stigma of my current career was kinda on me (I work in EMS) and over the past few weeks things just got worse and worse.

Then I said something really stupid to the one person who I was letting in on what was going on. She rightfully got angry for what I said. And when I realized that the one person who I could talk to was angry with me and didn't want to talk to me I broke down completely. I was awake the entire night. Just in my own head.

158,"Shortening the story, a cat scratched me and my mom last month. She had a ""deeper"" cut than mine (I didn't see any blood, just a little scratched skin). We went to the hospital and the nurse said the cuts were very superficial and we didn't need the vaccine. She also said to keep an eye on the cat for 10 days. I was put on amitriptyline and valerian the same week, with a consultation with the psychiatrist this month, but with the pandemic this was canceled. 

Being the paranoid that I am, I watched the cat for 8 days. I stopped right there because I was already feeling much better with my medication and left this problem aside. Suddenly, a couple of days ago, I remembered that I only watched him for 8 days and I can't find the cat anymore. All the progress of the past few weeks has simply been excluded from my mind, for no reason. 

The worst of my paranoia started a few days ago. I left a [bottle of water]((This one more precisely)) in my room. When I came back from the living room to get it, my gaze went to the open window and then to the bottle and a thought formed in my head: ""A cat came in and LICKED the top"". The thought started small and I managed to ignore it easily when it started, but it increased every time I drank water from the bottle. When I could no longer pay attention to the book I was reading with the bottle next to it, I had to put it away. The situation has deteriorated so much that I can't even get a glass to drink anymore, I'm drinking it straight from the filter. I know this fear is unreal and absurd, but every time I get a glass, I stop and think, ""Why take the risk?"" I am torn between ""having undiagnosed rabies and going to die from it at any moment"" and ""not having rabies, but contracting it by the saliva of the cat that licked all the cups in my house""

I live in a city of 6,000 inhabitants, having to travel 1 hour to a bigger city to talk to a psychiatrist, and I'm afraid that when I finally get to talk to him, he will simply describe me a bunch of meds and say ""deal with it"". I just hope this is temporary and I don't reach a point of no salvation.",10Apr2020,1
159,"I've been doing research on Schizophrenia as part of my Psychology class and I read that one of the ways it can manifest itself is a feeling that everyone can hear your thoughts and feelings of persecution. Reading that made me remember of a few years ago in middle school when I always thought that everyone knew exactly what I was thinking and that they were all in this group to humiliate me for my embarrassing thoughts. All this stopped around when I was 13, I'm 16 now and it's been pretty rare for me to get these feelings since then but I still am wondering if this is something I should bring up to my GP at my next appointment?",10Apr2020,1
160,"Hi, i've recently realised that I haven't really been feeling emotions for a while now, I don't feel numb but more or less just an absence of something that i used to feel, over the past 3 years alot of major things happened such as family passing away/falling ill, getting into uni, losing my virginity and etc. 

Throughout all of them i felt nothing, no grief, no excitement, no happiness nothing. It never really bothered me since i still forced out things like tears, laughter and etc when i'm around people but there's nothing when im alone. 

I don't have anything else that suggest that i might have a mental illness but i'm not entirely sure, i don't want tie up any resources nor risk getting infected myself during the pandemic so i'm currently avoiding going to a psychologist or therapist, but i'm looking to get some input so i can have an idea of what i should do next.

161,"The poor utilization of social media to accomplish things more than stupidity is meager. People usually want closure, benefits, sate their needs.  I'm not under much obligations just coping with the madness.  Just ego decimation anymore, I am going on 34 shortly.  I hadn't reached my goals do to error and crippling health traumas.  I am sorry for myself and got to find something to do for myself.  Wanted to be a big god damn hero and all, lament on being badgered since my youth.  Being put down, genetically, metaphysically and intellectually insulted since I took seed in the womb.  I'm ill bred, I can perform at standards but I am still crippled and horribly handicap, I still out perform much competition, I can survive.  Working with my disabilities is agonizing though, it broke my mind a few years ago.

I'm like off the register just hanging on out of morality.  I don't want to go into the grimace of self annihilation, I do not believe in it.  We must survive, I am abstaining from pro-creation.  I have yet to find a woman who's code is of my desire for the kin.  My genetics could be cured in a few generations and just hope some of this bullshit gets bred out.  People shouldn't be born with extra effects and all fucked up. I  do not know where this came from, god damn celestial or something is rumored. I've joked about it in the past, it was in good humor and brought me quite sensational mockery, that's real great.  We can't be all descendants of some Celestial Juggernaut, or we may be.  I was missing my Grandpa' and all, I never got to know him.

Shits been rough in the world, going on about the dogma's and bible's, it breaks people.  It breaks me, you're preaching to the choir is the contemporary term.  I try to have humor and morale, It's just grave I be naive towards the bestiality of humans.  Bestiality always gets a rise out of folk, I was chastised about the swine.  I had not stuck a pig in the heat of the moment, I almost did when I was a kid though... Fucking hide the animals around the teens.  I wasn't a bright kid, but I didn't stick my prick in the swine or chickens.  That's how you get a wyrm or some salmonella on your dick.
Brother, fuck some raw tenderloin in a tube. Now we're talking, we just talked about this on reddit. 

Things are bad now, I'm not trying to break anybody down thumpin the bible.  Beware of the sicko fucks in this world.  Powerful people, corrupt evil, corporations, invisible boogiemen.

Stayin fit and shit.  I hate gout.  Wannabe a Soldier.  Miss Sweden, never been there, wan to go back to there.  It's where the Hearth is... Or Oslo, or Glasgow or Hamburg...  I'm not a real people person, just culture and affinity.

162,"I've been on antidepressants a long time now. Sertraline (think you americans call it Zoloft) for nearly 3 years now. I've tried others too. In some ways I'm still depressed and don't think the pills have/are going to help with that. In other ways I'm a lot better than I was, but I don't think that's got anything to do with the meds (more to do with meditation, healthier lifestyle, changes in my life, therapy, etc.) and now I want to come off because 1) they seem pointless and 2) it takes me AGES to orgasm, among other side effects, so would be good to see the back of that.

But the prospect of coming off them (I'm gonna talk to my doctor, and slowly edge off them by bringing down the dose in installments) worries me. I'm worried I've just not noticed how much they've helped. Or that no matter how carefully I ween off them my body will still basically be addicted to them and coming off will push me into a depression.

The internet is filled with horror stories of people who came off antidepressants then realised it was a massive mistake (I mean one of my favourite authours Davod Foster Wallace killed himself after his doctor recommend tapering off his meds) or who had bad withdrawal systems or 'brain zaps'. I'm interested to know if anyone came off them and was totally fine, or if anyone actually feels like their mental health improved from coming off them? I believe antidepressants are just bullshit, there's no real evidence that they work, altho there does seem to be evidence that long-term use of them can prolong a depression that might have otherwise ended by itself. So thoughts on this? Or just general thoughts on taking meds for depression?",10Apr2020,1

Lately I've been thinking about beating the fuck out of people and killing them or myself. I feel like eventually I'm gonna snap and kill someone and myself. I feel like my friends aren't here for me, I get ignored by pretty much everyone. I message people that complain about having no friends, like hey you guys seem cool, tryna hang? They just leave me on read, it makes me want to confront them. I think the worlds going to shit/NWO is coming, mandatory vaccinations, RFID chips, one world government. I sit and think all day, having conversation with myself, ALL DAY. I can't stop it at and sleep at night unless I'm exhausted. I have HPPD (permatrip, comes with anxiety, paranoia, delusions). 

It's really hard to not just take a bunch of pills and go out and tell everyone to fuck themselves. I can't do that to my parents and friends, but as time passes, it seems more and more reasonable to kill myself. I don't know if I should put myself in a psych ward to get checked out. I'm on no medications and probably wont get anything that will work for me since I'm a drug addict. No benzodiazapines that would be very therapeutic and help me stay calm.

The world slows, freezing.

The outside voices become quiet as you sink deeper.

Vision becomes blurry and messy…distant.

Although, you wonder if it is really happening, whether you really are spiralling or drifting, or whether its a made up concept by yourself to make yourself able to relate to the situation.

To understand it.

However, when you try to explain this spiral to others they brush it off.

Maybe you’re just being weird.

But during the spiral,

Nothing makes sense, you cannot grip on reality. 

You hear the outside voices but they are faint.

Lights dim and blur.

But you’re probably just imagining it because you don’t really exist.

The spiral continues as if endlessly.

Until you are pulled up and out.

Saved from the infinite loop of reality.

Its a coping mechanism they say.

A way of living through life.

But you cannot live through others bodies.

So why judge the grip of the spiral and compare to your own?

170,"On December 1st, 2019, my wife of four years rolled over in bed and told me she needed to talk. Over the next three hours, I learned that my wife was no longer in love with me and didn't find my physically attractive anymore. Three days later, I was leaving our apartment for work for the last time. I've been living with my boss and his family for the last 4 months while I work on getting myself right.  


Part of making myself right was a lot of self-reflection and meditation. I realized pretty quickly that I didn't want to be single. I married my wife with every intention to spend the rest of my life with her. Another man and her change of opinion in me obviously affected her long-term plans as a couple. I rifled through the emotional baggage and came to the realization that I wouldn't go looking for a new mate, but if one were to walk into my life, I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid it or resist it.   


Along came Robin (name changed). About a month after I moved out of my apartment and divorce paperwork had been filed, I reconnected with someone I'd had a huge crush on almost a decade earlier. I'd known her since middle school. We had been friends in the past and even touched on the idea of a relationship long before I met me soon-to-be ex-wife. We started talking again and it was as if no time at all had passed- we were laughing and joking within minutes of meeting up for the first time in 8 years.  


As the weeks went by, my feelings for Robin grew and she was having the same feelings for me (which was quite a shock to someone who was still coping with the fact that his wife had told him he's no longer physically attractive to her- my self-confidence wasn't willing to accept that Robin could possibly like me). In late February 2020, Robin and I began discussing a relationship again. She had been hurt in the past and so had I. I wanted to be respectful of my ex, my marriage and of course Robin so I made the decision I didn't want to start a ""real"" boyfriend/girlfriend relationship until after the divorce was finalized (May 12th is the date).   


We continued to grow closer and then the lock-down started. We texted every waking hour, it seemed. We FaceTimed regularly, sent videos and even had a few quick visits early on before stay-at-home orders went into effect. I had fallen in love with this woman and I knew it. She told me she loved me. 

On Wednesday, April 8th, Robin died suddenly in her sleep. I was the last person she had talked to. She was 32 years old with a 10-year-old daughter. She was a wonderful human being and she liked me for me, as cheesy as that may sound. That meant the world to me.  

I'm at a complete loss right now. Considering how the last two relationships of mine have ended, I've made the decision to step away for a while. I won't go out of my way to turn away from a potential match down the line, but I don't think I can handle any more heartache.",10Apr2020,1

I am a 17 year old female high school student, and like every teenager experiences at some point in their lives, I have terribly low self-esteem and confidence. But I think it's getting to the point of compromising my mental health, because I seriously cannot stop looking in the mirror and crying for hours, sometimes days, about how I look. I have even thought about suicide over this. 

The reason I think it might be Body Dysmorphia is because I have heard that you seemingly see yourself different than as you actually look. People always tell me I am pretty, and have a good body. I even did one of those dumb ""Rate Me"" things on Reddit as a last resort and got mostly 8s, some 9s. But I still can't help but think I am disgusting, fat, and ugly. I don't think there's any point of living if my looks are going to get in the way of me being happy, having a husband, and starting a family. I don't think I will ever find love because of how I look. 

I honestly don't know what's happening to me anymore. I am very intelligent, I get good grades in school, so I have a lot of potential. But slowly, I am losing all my motivation and dedication. Over something that's so superficial. I am no longer happy in life anymore. I just want to go back to when I was younger and didn't care about these things.

*Is multiplanes theory real? Do we believe in our multiple versions of ourselves each living slightly different lives, maybe they already made it to the next quantum state, is it a race? Do we search space for aliens or are we looking for ourselves. Are people that interested in black holes looking for space-rips, man-made holes in space from other timelines. Probably.*

180,"I did cross-post at r/depression... hope that is okay.

For context, I struggle with both depression and anxiety. Both are fairly mild compared to what I know other people wrestle with, and except for short periods, I have always been able to remain high-functioning in spite of it. Both are well managed through therapy and lifestyle, with one brief stint on mild antidepressants for about 6 months several years ago to get my head above water during a difficult time. But I've been struggling lately and thought that this would be an appropriate place to share.

Awhile back, I experienced an intense loss that still keeps me awake night. I had to walk away from a relationship with someone I truly loved. Truly, intensely loved. I had entered into a relationship with someone who also struggles with depression and anxiety, but at a time when theirs was well managed, as well. And had been well managed for quite awhile, with them also possessing a great deal of personal insight about triggers, activators, and healthy coping. There was always quite a bit of moodiness, but it wasn't at a level that I couldn't deal with. And then like the flip of a switch, everything changed. They became angry. Hateful. Toxic. Unstable. It was obvious that their mental health struggles had gotten into dangerous territory very quickly. And I became the target when I was trying to be the support. The outbursts of anger were unbearable. The constant need for reassurance that I still loved them in the midst of all of it were exhausting. The mood swings were like something out of an overly dramatized Lifetime movie about an abusive relationship. All of the personal insight that they possessed about their struggles disappeared overnight. They would repeatedly threaten to end the relationship and I would beg and plead with them not to until they reconsidered. We would go from being happy and talking to them becoming angry at me and refusing to speak with me for 24 hours, not to even say ""good night"" or ""good morning""... and I would have no idea what I had done to set them off. And then there were lifestyle issues added on to it. One example was self soothing with compulsive shopping, adding to their already sizable amount of credit card debt without a sizable income (or any savings) to pay it off.

Fast forward a few weeks and their doctor decides they need to be on meds. Now, I am not anti-med at all. I think they are often necessary. And when used right, they are amazing. But the reality is that not every psych med agrees with every person's body. And that not every doctor is fantastic at the whole psych med part of the equation. And then the patient's brain ends up turning into one giant chemistry experiment. And that is exactly what happened. The first round of meds made things worse. So more meds were added to fix it. And then more. And then increased dosages. And then this med to try to cancel out the side effect of that med. On and on we went, sometimes with multiple med changes each week, until the anger and the moodiness and the outbursts were even more uncontrollable. But now there was paranoia in the picture. Out of control paranoia. Delusional reality in the picture. And again I remained the target. I begged for them to see a different doctor. To get a second opinion about how much had been added how quickly. How in a matter of 5 weeks we had gone from ""maybe we should talk about starting you on an antidepressant"" to ""you need to be on these 4 meds."" Some days were constant outbursts of anger, some days were exhaustion to the point that they could spend the vast majority of 2-3 days at a time sleeping. Every day was completely unpredictable in terms of what person I would get that day. I begged. I communicated how difficult this was becoming for me as best as I could. I cried. I begged some more.

And it finally got to the point that, to protect my own mental health, I had to walk away. After one particular outburst where a conclusion that they jumped to (the paranoia element) got them so worked up and in such a fit of rage and anxiety that they ended up needing to go to the ER for an emergency psych intervention. My resiliency was exhausted. My own anxiety and depression were moving from ""well-managed"" to ""problematic."" I was laying awake crying instead of sleeping. I have kids to think about. Both about in my ability to parent them if my depression and anxiety are out of control, and in terms of what they would grow up having to cope with if this remained. I had to walk away. The anger after I walked away remained intense. I would get calls in the middle of the night several times each week ripping me apart. The meds increased. The delusions increased.

And the dialogue became ""you gave up on me."" ""I will get better, but you gave up on me."" Until I was shut out completely. The pain of that is still heavy. The grief of that loss is still intense. But I had to protect my own mental health. And I had to think about what was best for my kids. And I had to think about what I want my life to look like. But I had to walk away from someone I truly, intensely, passionately loved. And I'm still having a hard time coping with that. Managing my depression since that loss has been much more difficult. Some days I am in ""just one foot in front of the other"" mode all day. Some times I go days without truly sleeping at night. Full days without having an appetite to eat anything. Some days it doesn't seem real. That I had to watch the person I love be consumed changed, destroyed. That I had to walk away from someone I truly loved. The grief is so heavy.",10Apr2020,1
181,"I see so many things everyday that make me so sad. Myself, since my appearance has declined right along with my mental state. My family, because I think about what they could be thinking watching me decline as much as I have these last few years. My friends, because we aren't as close as I'd like us to be and then I see people with these amazingly close friendships. My mind just won't accept reality. Keeps hoping for something fictional to happen but it doesn't. And I feel crazy and stupid for it. 

School is suddenly harder because online school is not my thing at all and I am still getting used to it. I tried online school before during high school because of my mental issues and now I'm truly forced to go through it again. I just need to be able to have in person accountability, if that makes any sense. 

I lose track of the days. I lose track of when the last time I ate was. I lose track of when the last time I bathed was. I lose track of what even happened during my days. They just float right by. Sometimes I start to think that I'm getting better and then I have these days where it's like ""Who are you kidding? It'll happen at some point. You'll do it at some point.""",10Apr2020,1

    I think i might have some seriuos problems and i want to be sure that those things will not happen again.
   Every time i felt attracted to a girl i would become obsesive and desperate. 
An example it would be the first time when  felt such emotion.  I would try to make her like me with gifts and poems and sometimes even stalk her so i can find her patterns, like when would she leave home and where would she go, all so i  could pretend i just had a random encounter with her. 
 Because of this i let myself in being manipulated by her so i can humilate myself for her amusment.

I'm not trying to push off some bullshit I'm trying to find people that agree.  It's basically alternate things, not entirely delusional thinking, I'm trying to think deductively.  I'm all about my peanut gallery methods of investigation.   It's the shit I constantly deal with, I'm a humble person, I can be an arrogant prick, I guess.   I'm not a scholar or professional gist.  I got some mechanisms that work and am still learnig as things carry on.
We don't all operate off the minds eye anymore, it's some loonie business.  It can take you places, you meet people, some people demand its function.  However, it isn't perfect, you can be bamboozled, keep your wits about you.
Cultural perspectives are something to reason with and part of Chivalry.  We're constantly in feud over metaphysics and trying to tell people the truth.  I understand people don't care or are ignorant, or clashing ideologies - independant, slavery. 
Things are typically shrouded in bullshit, I am uncertain why.  Man has to fend for itself some and we're coming along at times.  I am unaware of the future, trying to see the future.   It's safe to assume there are orgs out there that would prefer to resume slavery or a new form of subordination physically and metaphysically.  I had a come one come all attitude and had been serving me.  Some people prefer safety and closure in the domination of others through various methods.
Other than all that I'm absent merits and vanity and greed.  I'm pretty much black and white dealing with psychopathy.  I miss being a soldier and am sad I didn't make it... I did make, I made in and got some in Iraq, I didn't make it back in after a long great R&amp;R.  I took care of myself at 34 I'm in respectable condition and maintaining my youth like Peter Pan.  I'm never going to grow up, I'll never grow old and there's more of me in Sweet ass Sweden.   I've never been there but I seent some pictures of some Joe's over there in Militaryporn and like they looked like me, lots of them looked like me.  Them guys are made of better stuff than me, That's the good brood right there and made me happy my pack was in good health and all.  Those kids are wolven, intelligent individuals, sentient, cognizant and in various cultures, prepared to lead your Kingdom to Glory.

188,"I have struggled with depression, anxiety and those were so severe that they caused hallucinations and psychosis symptoms.

The uk mental health service (chams) was quite shit tbh, I got a therapy appointment every month and a half-if not longer- and I struggled so hard by myself.
I still to this day wake up and just wish I was dead sometimes.

I was so close to dying, but since no one could see it no one cared.

People who have disorders which effect their physical health (eating disorders and such like) get so much attention and support and constant everything from all the services and everyone else. It seems like no one takes into account how people with self harm and suicidal tendencies are so close to death every single day, it’s like no one can see risk is the same.
I got a therapy appointment every month if I was lucky, usually every other month. But someone I know who has an Ed gets seen all the time gets everything they need doesn’t get told any bullshit, gets sent to hospital when they need, doesnt just get told to get over it.

I hate how all of this has been treated, and I hate how she’s using her Ed as an excuse to be an absolute bitch. 
I’m just tired of the mental health services not caring about people who are just as close to death.
I am struggling with my mental health so fucking much and I feel like I’m not allowed to because “oh no but she has an eating disorder she has it so much worse”

190,"so it's weird to be posting this but my university counselors aren't working due to COVID 19 so please let me know if you have been in a similar situation and how you overcame it. 

So to start at the beginning, my first sexual encounter was when I was 8ish years old with my cousin who was the same age. He initiated it and we did like oral stuff but not much further. I had other encounters like that with some of my school friends in elementary school as well. I think it was just harmless experimentation but my parents found out about it and thought I had been molested. So this is kinda my first issue because I don't know if I've dealt with that and also it scares me that I might be gay because this happened. 

I got really chubby in middle school and that continued until pretty recently where I am now skinny-fat. There were not a lot of gay kids at my high school and the ones that were were already in relationships. I joined Grindr and tinder around sophomore year of high school but could never get the confidence to meet up with anyone or go on a date because it made me too anxious. I think that came from me not liking my body and fearing rejection but also something deeper I cannot place right now.

I think that came from me not liking my body and fearing rejection but also something deeper I cannot place right now. 

So when I got to a big state university I joined a fraternity that had a few gay members but I stayed in the closet until very recently because I wanted to have male friendships that weren't hindered by me being gay. I had lost a significant amount of weight over the summer after high school (looked skinny in clothes but chubby when shirt off). I'm still a virgin at this point and while I have chatted with many guys on tinder and Grindr I still cannot work up the courage to meet any of them because I am so scared to. A lot of it because I have really high standards because I want to lose my virginity to someone I'm not only attracted to but have a good, longstanding relationship with them. And the fact that I look skinny/fit in clothes and pictures scares me that I am chatting with guys out of my league who wouldn't have sex with me.

Bottom line is that I don't like my body or my sexuality and I wish I could change it because I am really craving a boyfriend but all anyone wants to do is hookup and the guys that want relationships on tinder are not very cute at all. I don't know what to do with myself and my mental health is deteriorating quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Im struggling currently, like i think most people with some thoughts of depression and just overall sadness. So, here is a rundown of what life has prepared for me, in the last few months that just kinda crushed me today.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago, in late october my mom died, quite suddenly after a hearth attack. Really harsh thing, but to be honest i am to some degree over it. Well, back then i had my GF to support me, but to be honest she didn´t really know how to. There is no helping, honestly. With loss there is none, certain holes can´t be filled just like that. But, anyways. We where together at that point with my GF for three years. A bumpy ride, but we kinda just somehow made it. So starting with that november, i was kinda down, but got back into life normally, i would say. Wounds heal, after some time passes. But yeah, my relationship got worse, worse, worse... we lived together, but had no feelings anymore. I was tired, all the time, and her crap and my crap was just... too much crap i guess. So, after a rough couple of months, with discussions and fighting and tears, we broke up. Before Christmas, last year. To be precise actually one day before my birthday. And i hate that day ever since my mom died. But, anyways... broke up, but decided to keep together till january, since... you know, we had a contract for the flat we lived in. And breaking these news to our families would break them. Or harm them. So - we kept it a secret. January came, i told my Dad, my only close relative still alive (In 26 Years of my life, i was on 8 Different burials. Some family, some good friends) that i will need to go back to live with him. Truth is i could live alone, but i am... too afraid to be alone, i guess. He took the news like a champ to be honest. No dumb questions, no nothing, just understanding, giving me a shoulder to talk to, and... well, middle of january i moved. Left her, left our dog (i miss the dog, i really really do) left the flat, the memories... and went back home. Moved in during a single weekend, built my room where my room was before in the flat of my parents. Actually, my dads. After i moved out to live with my GF, my parents reworked that room into their bedroom. So, after i came back, we had to renovate it. Lots of stuff from my mom still around, my dad never really went into the bedroom it seems. Her apron she used to wear while cooking still hung on the very same place she put it, before she passed away. Same place, still there. Throwing that away hurt, and i think it broke some wounds open that where... i dont know, if closed or just repressed. A few weeks went and came. Got stuck in a loop again, work home work home. Didn´t really talk to my colleagues either about it. They have their own issues, and i am horrible introvert. So, then this outbreak happened, without me using any day before that to socialize, talk to the few friends i have and that care. And now i am locked in this house, and it all comes crashing down on me like an avalanche. I can´t sleep, i nap during the day and stay up late. I read books and do my hobbies but... hell its not getting better. I wish i could go out, have some drinks with my colleagues and just talk. I crave for any interaction to be honest. I even wish and this sounds super wierd, for any interaction with the opposite gender. Is flirting the right word ? Idk. I am not outgoing, nor a flirter, i am not even good at any of these.   
I just feel burned out, absolutely on my ground, and nothing i do that helped before helps. My hobbies don´t mean shit. I can´t even play videogames because after an hour i just loose focus and the will to play more. All i really enjoy is drinking coffee. I feel trapped, and hurt, and i have no idea how long this will continue. I am not considering to end it, either... I love life, i truly do. But this pain just numbs me, makes me absolutely numb to everything. I help my dad as much as i can, i am worried as hell for him. He is 60 now, and has Diabetes. Smoker. He is in risk, i know that. If i get infected, he will too, since we live here together. The though of loosing him now scares me. Terrifies me. Its not even fear, its like a panic. I just have so much going on currently, and just... needed to vent. Loosing him would destroy the only thing i have left. I am pulling at straws to keep me going. To keep working. To keep my hobbies. And to talk to the few people i do, that i just can´t open up to. Its like a curse. I wish i could tell them, but i cant. I tried. I tried and tried, but only time it worked is when i was drunk... i am at my wits ends. Just numbly tulmbing trough each day till the sun goes down and rises again. I´d love to share this with someone. I think i didn´t get over the breakup properly. I wish i could just cry. I wish i could find someone again that would help me, be a bit of a crutch... worst thing is, that for most of my colleagues and friends, i am the crutch. I help everyone, i know what they are dealing with, and keep telling them to keep their hopes high and just push trough. Little do they know, nor will they know, that i am even in a worse situation. But i have to help them, too. They deserve it. They need it. And i do my best to stand beside them. And even although all of this, i can´t share my feelings with them. I don´t want to. Whatever the reason might be.  
So, this is my story, i guess. I just needed to vent all of this out, and hope it willl.... i don´t know even. Get me some little nugget of solitude in my hearth that it all will be beter. Someday. Sometimes. Not this year, but someday. Maybe.",10Apr2020,1

I feel like I have no control over what I say and even if Im thinking something completely normal what comes out just sounds shitty.

I think I've been doing it for sometime but im not sure.

Its causing me huge issues in my relationship and I really want to fix this part of me.

I have mental health issues and my girlfriend thinks i may have autism and I think I might too, I don't know if this is related.

If anyone has any ideas on how to essentially take back control or just help me manage this better I would really appreciate it.

196,"I am an 18 year old dude and my friend who we will call Claire is one of my best friends. It has been a known fact within our friend group since freshmen year that Claire’s mom is batshit crazy. I could go very in depth but I’ll give a quick example: freshman year when Claire was 15 we were at a party, and her mom knew that she was drunk. Her mom was texting her paragraphs while my buddy and I were doing everything we could do to sober her up, but she was really drunk. We expected that Claire got yelled at on the way home, but found out the next day that her mom made Claire get in the drivers seat and DRIVE THEM HOME! Her mom definitely knew she was drunk, and did this as a “got ya!” , thankfully they made it home safe. Her mom definitely has some loose screws and it has been apparent to me since I met her. 

Anyway I’ll get to the point. I recently went on a trip to Claire’s family’s lake house with a few of our friends. We have known that Claire’s mom does crazy things like calling Claire every time she sees her location near a fast food shop, but I was shocked at what it was really like. At first, Claire’s mom would just text her paragraphs while we were at the dinner table about how she needs to not eat that much, she essentially wanted Claire eating a half-portion of everything, including beverages. Also, I should mention that the ‘paragraphs’ I’m talking about were texts the entire length of an iPhone screen with insane rambling and nonsensical anger. My friends and I didn’t see the texts until after dinner, when we were reading more insane paragraphs that she had texted after dinner, about how Claire didn’t tell us that we could eat on the deck (???). 

On these second morning, Claire received a loooong text from her mother and asked our female friend to come read it. I didn’t ask any questions about it, but for that entire day Claire absolutely refused to go upstairs and see her parents. She avoided them the entire day, Claire made us go up and pretend to get food for ourselves and give it to her. The third day, Claire’s mom yelled at her several times (not uncommon) about how she needed to stop eating. She searched our rooms and was not too upset about finding vodka bottles, but lost her shit over finding 7 granola bar wrappers under Claire’s bed. Claire’s dad is present, somewhat normal, and sometimes yells at his wife when she makes comments about Claire’s eating habits. However, he is unaware of the literal CONSTANT barrage of texts that Claire gets from her mother. I should also mention that it is commonplace for Claire’s mother to serve us all Taco Bell and pizza rolls for dinner, it’s not like she serves her daughter healthy food. 

Claire’s mother had anorexia as a teenager, I know this from Claire but I don’t know the extent of it or if she was treated ever. I believe that going to college next year will be extremely beneficial for Claire, but I’m extremely worried about her mother’s impact on her mental health. Claire is no doubt more athletic than most (her mom forces her to be), and she is all around very healthy. As a guy, and a stupid 18 year old, I really don’t know what I’m supposed to do to address this. I may not have expressed it well in this text post, but Claire has literally been psychologically abused for as long as I’ve known her. Can we please have some discussion and advice if you feel like you may know more about how to respond to this than me. All of our friends (including Claire) are as close and comfortable with each other as humanly possible, so bringing it up with Claire wouldn’t be an issue. We’ve talked to Claire about this issue a lot and we have talked to each other about what to do about it. If I didn’t provide enough info just mention in the comments, with Claire’s discretion in mind. 

tldr: My friend’s mother, who used to suffer from anorexia, acts like a nazi guard when her daughter eats food. Her mother sends paragraphs of text to her every day about her looks, athletic skills, and popularity, compared to the ‘mean girls’ group of girls in our grade.",10Apr2020,1

i normally wouldnt share these things online but i think its important. i am 13 years old almost 14 and a female. i have diagnosed aspergers autism, depression, adhd, and anxiety. over quarantine i have been thinking a lot about my past. i know reddit isnt a psychologist but i really need closure rn. since i have relapsed with self harm i an starting therapy again soon. i went to a psyche ward in august 2019. rather than healing me it made me afraid to share me feelings ever again in fear i would have to go back. me and therapist are gonna work on this. i think i may have PTSD. i do not want to self diagnose myself so i want thoughts. during my 2nd - 6th grade years a lot of my mind goes blank. im in 7th grade now bc i was held back. it might be because it was long ago but idk. basically when i was in 1st grade was when it all started.. my parents divorced and i moved to a different state in with my mom, her fiancée, my twin sister, my older sister (now 18), and his son who was 2 years older than me. my mom was not aware how terrible a person he was. he was extremely manipulative and sexist. he made me and my sisters and my mom do all the house work. his son did nothing. my mom was not allowed to work or have friends. over time my mom began saving up in hopes one day we could move out. i dont have many memories from this time bc it was extremely traumatic for me. is it normal to have just random gaps of your life missing from you? it feels terrible... even though it was only last year i remember little to nothing from sixth grade. i attempted suicide and moved back home to my state near my dad and now we have money. i know i used to have ptsd despite not being diagnosed. i would have nightmares abt my moms ex threatening to hurt us. its very triggering for me to talk abt so i would rather not too unless someone messages me... then i might be comfortable. i think i currently have ptsd from a psyche ward and my past. i have nightmares from the ward all the time... sometimes i have panic attacks where i still feel like im going to go there even tho im probably not. i just dont know if this is normal or something to worry abt. i have trouble talking to people face to face so i have trouble telling my therapist these things and im also scared shell send me to a hospital like my last one did i ever tell her anything.",10Apr2020,1

Truth is, I feel like nobody understands me. I've opened up to maybe a few people and regret it. Basically, it seems to me that everyone conspires behind my back to act emotionless, knowing how emotional I am and hence invalidating my emotions. I feel like everyone actually hates me and plots against me whenever possible. 

My ""friends"" almost found out I'm pan, and since then they don't talk to me. I swear on me mum's life, they must've made a separate messenger group to gossip about me.

I'm so tired. It's always me who has to conform to others whereas nobody in this world has even a dim idea of what's going on inside me. I'm pretty much dying inside. I'm a pariah, an outcast. Nobody wants to at least try to be understanding.

It's a long distance relationship and she has a lot of disabilites: DID (multiple personalities), clinical depression, bipolar, schizotypal personality disorder, PTSD, anxiety, (autism and ADHD too, but I have those too and they don't bother me in the slightest) and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting.
I really really love her a lot, but whenever something happens she starts dragging herself down and gets upset because she wants to make me happy. And I kinda do the same, I get insecure way too fast, feel like anything I do upsets while I only wanna make her happy and can't stop dragging myself down which is starting to annoy her. Is just feel like I screw everything up and I hate it. I just want to make her happy and be happy together. I feel lost and have no idea what I can best do to improve myself. I feel so hopeless and lost. I'm sick of screwing things up, of not being able to go to sleep happily, while she stayed in the call with me till I was asleep. Instead of her leaving upset blaming herself and me crying because she is upset and me being upset myself.
I feel like everything is a battle between my emotions and my rational thinking, a battle emotions win every time. I have to learn to carry the burden of feeling like crap better, to deal with it till it can be properly resolved. I have to learn to slow down and have more patience within the relationship. I have to learn more about my girlfriends conditions and how to deal with them. And I have to learn to deal with my insecurities and this constant need of validation I feel in the relationship. I don't say that to drag myself down, that's just the sctual stuff I have to work on, but it's hard. I'm sick of feeling like I screw up everytime.
I just don't know how to do it and how to do it a as fast as possible. I want to be a good boyfriend for her, the best I can be. I just don't know how I can get myself there... someone... please... help....",10Apr2020,1
206,"I haven't been the same since I left my 3 year relationship. I caught him cheating so I left but I haven't been able to fully regain happiness since then. I was extremely codependent on him and my entire life was revolved around him. It's been 7 months since it happened and I have finally learned how to live without him but I feel so empty. I decided to start sleeping with other people to try to move on but that has made things so much worse. I feel like I am never going to be happy again. I want to learn how to love myself and be happy without male attention but I can't do it. I've tried therapy but that doesn't work, I can't express my feelings verbally. I am so lost and it just keeps getting worse. I go through phases where I am doing great but then the depression comes back sooner or later and usually it's worse. I just want to be happy again.",10Apr2020,1
207,"TW: depiction of child mental abuse and of very negative and painful memories / feelings

I really need help, so whoever feels like it, please? (Sorry all of this is longer than what I intended it to, but it is literally the summary of 19years worth of life heh)




Sooo the story begun when I was 3, I went to school for the first time of my life. As I was a ""weirdly demanding child"" according to the teatchers, my parents got me tested by a psychiatrist and they discovered that I was intellectually gifted. So now that they would understand how I functioned, things should have gone smoothly, right? Right.

Life goes by, I am left handed and I experience a fair amount of injustice from the teatchers (the hand of the deviiillll noooo) but this is still not the problem, as a child I did not give much attention to these kind of rude treatments by the adult at school, I kinda grew used to it. I was 4-5 years old at that time.

Then comes the real problem. I was 7 and met the person that was literally going to ruin my life. This evil woman was my teatcher, and as my parents did with my previous teatchers, they explained to her that I might be a little different from the other students and that I was writing slowly because I was younger than the others (I jumped a class, forgot to mention it). She played nice, and this b*tch (can I curse?) then proceeded to make me feel like the most worthless piece of human garbage ever conceived. I am going to summarize what I have gone through to make it short, here we go:

- verbal humiliations in front of the whole class (like half an hour explaining to me that I was a liar pretending I was gifted, that I was a fraud and that I should be ashamed of myself)
- never letting me speak, and if she did, it was to scream on me afterwards because no matter what I said she absolutely hated it
- excluding me from the class by using any reason she could find (I eventually started to do everything I could to get excluded because the hallways felt more welcoming than staying in her sight)
- she made me write more than the others as a punition, often giving me stuff to copy while she was giving class I was actually interested in

It is hard to summarize everything, there is much more but I am still recovering memories today, 12 years after, and those I have are mostly feeling of fear and deep emotional pain.
I never talked about it to my parents, it is my grandmother who noticed that something was off and talked about it to my parents. I only spent half of the year in her class, but that was enough to cause damage.

Around that time, I have distinct memories of wanting to ""end everything"" a lot of questionnements of dying and thoughts of ""trying to fly through the window"" (the point of it being dying as my parents had warned me about it before, since we were living on the 3rd floor). 

From that point on, I had no sense of self worth, self love, or even inner peace, I lived because I was supposed to but not much gave me a spark of happiness, my family did, books did, but everything outside the house was always bringing me pain somehow.
But looking back on it, I am proud of the young me for carrying on so well, I never gave up on anything and it might be what made me do so well for a long time.

Middle school added trauma again since all my friends turned my back on them because I was two years younger than them. They picked on all the things I hated about myself and made my insecurities worse. 

Again, I was lucky to have very loving and caring parents who agreed to let me out of school and to be homeschooled. Since I had jumped two classes, I passed my last two years of middle school in three years (one year and a half for each class) to enable me to go back to highschool with a smaller one year age gap with the other students. 

During those years, I really drowned into what I call the ""dark episodes"" everything feels numb (or hurt), the world loses its colours, I can't focus on anything and nothing seems interesting. I had a few of these episodes, but never expressed with words how I felt, only being a difficult child. The best way to describe it would be a blinding emotional pain that would not allow me to think or feel anything else, the thought that I was going crazy and then nothing. Just a feeling of exhaustion and emptiness that would last for some time. A few days or a few weeks, it depended how much I wanted to pick myself up. 

Then high school. That was also bad (who is surprised at this point?). I somehow managed to make friends with a narcissist pervert. She isolated me from my family, making me believe that they didn't want to help me and that she was the only one who would. Not going to lie here, she helped me a bit, giving me the presence I needed when I needed it, but the relationship grew extremely toxic afterwards. I was feeling worthless, disgusting and lonely, which was just another dark episode that I was in fact masking. A lot of panick attacks, fainting, insomnia was going on during that period, which was not helping with getting better grades. 

Eventually I got my diploma and got out of this living hell.
During the summer I worked extremely hard on my mental health and it got really good, especially thanks to my religion and spirituality (which is the only thing on this planet that gives me peace).

Now in university, I found friends that I genuinely care about and am really happy. But! The dark episodes didn't stop... I thought that it was normal that I got them on anniversary dates, around September and November, and I had found a pretty good way to handle it. But right now I am in a big one, and none of my coping mechanisms can do it because they involve going out or meeting with people (basically fake it till you make it, works for me most of the time).

So now here I am, feeling that things are slowly going downhill in the darkness, and I can't do anything about it, it seems beyond my control this time...

So if anyone thinks that I might have something specific (so I could research it to understand it) or would have some coping mechanisms to share that would be amazing! 
I might need to go to a therapist after this but can't bring myself to trust them sooo... what should I do?

I only started to come to terms with myself recently about the fact that yes, my mental health is fucked up, no I can't fix all of it myself and that I might actually have something.
Depression seems a close match but I don't want to self diagnose myself.... 

But yeah to make it short, I know I could just find other coping mechanisms and get over it, and keep monitoring how I feel to make sure that I don't become and empty feelingless doll again, but i don't want to. I find it exhausting to control myself all the time. I want to live and not survive. I am fed up with all of this.


To whoever read all of this : thank you so much for your time, you have a beautiful soul, and any insight and thought on my situation is welcome! (do not be afraid to trigger me, sometimes it makes me recover some memories of the trauma and it helps me a lot somehow)
Have a beautiful day / night 💜",10Apr2020,1
208,"Fashion Design and Illustration has been the greatest medium for me to deal with depression. Recently I have been coming up with all new designs, illustrations, concepts etc. but it seems as if I’m not capturing anyone’s attention or making an impact on anyone’s life. Even with everything that’s going on, I still want to be able to bring innovation to peoples lives in these tough times. My optimism is slowly diminishing, since I had a mental breakdown over my recent OC’s not receiving any type of recognition, I feel as if no one truly cares about the designs I was putting out. Feedback wether it is positive or negative is truly what keeps me going, but when I send my peers new designs and art for them to just turn around and ignore them completely really ruins my self-esteem. I practice everyday and put a lot of work and effort into all my work, but what does it even amount to? Has any artist or designer ever had this feeling before?",10Apr2020,1

211,"Ok. I’m just posting this here because I don’t know what other subreddit I’d post to for this type of question.

I’ve been unable to focus on anything for a very, very long time. It wasn’t always this way, but somewhere around age 11 or 12 I stopped being able to focus on homework. I always attributed this inability to focus to the fact that the work was getting more difficult and I simply didn’t want to do it. Basically - just lazy. As of now, I struggle with being distracted while I’m trying to work 24/7 - especially since I’m stuck at home because of the virus. The problem with my original reasoning behind my focus problems is that it isn’t just things I don’t like that I have trouble focusing on. For example, I play guitar, and I like playing guitar, but it’s extremely difficult for me to focus on just playing for even five minutes at a time. I’ve also noticed that even while watching a television show I enjoy, I can’t focus enough and will always have to be doing something else as I am watching, usually on my phone. Sometimes I will spend hours doing a pointless task such as making a random list rather than do anything else, even if I’m able to do something I enjoy. thought that my lack of focus on things I enjoyed stemmed from my depression, but I’ve been on medication for that for about three months. My sense of self has improved but the focus has not. I’m not sure this has anything to do with depression or not, but I was wondering if anybody knew what could be causing this? I’d assume it has to be something to do with my brain. I’ve recently started my first year of college and it’s really becoming an issue now because I have much more work than ever before. I don’t know, maybe I am just lazy, but if there’s something I could possibly do to help this I would really like to know.",10Apr2020,1
212,"Depressed schizophrenic here. 
  
  
Today was really long, and it's only half over, I'm sure. 
  
  
I've been having a lot of family problems recently, and as of tomorrow, I'm off work for a while, so I'll be spending a lot of time with this volatile family of mine. 
  
  
A quick side note; I have an old phone that I'm using as a surveillance camera now because my family likes to sneak in my room while I'm away. I sat on my bed, and I heard my phone making a little noise saying that my old phone (the makeshift camera) had picked up a lot of motion. I went into the app, and I'm deeply concerned. 
  
  
I guess this afternoon was just way too much, so I went to my room, locked the door, took of some clothes for whatever reason, tore up some plastic bags, grabbed my plastic pumpkin from halloween, proceeded to stab it until it was too weak and the knife came out the other end, cutting my palm a little with the blade or the hard plastic or something, and then just sat on the bed for a while staring at the floor. The whole time that I was doing this, I was switching between grunting and just breathing heavily, like I had just finished running or something. I saw myself doing this on the camera.
  
  
I sort of remember doing all of this now, and I remember the light sting in my hand when it got cut, but I usually don't do this kind of stuff and completely forget about it like that. If I hadn't made such a mess, and if I wasn't still lightly bleeding, I wouldn't believe that I had done any of that, but it's all there. 
  
  
I don't really know what I'm supposed to do now, other than just clean up. My head is pounding, my throat is completely scratched up, and my hand is cut, but I'm relatively calm now. I feel so weird and uncomfortable knowing that this can be triggered by a few bad arguments and a stressful day at work. I really hope it doesn't happen again, or, really, I hope I don't forget again.",10Apr2020,1
213,"I suffer from depression, and have had a lot of low points. One of the best tips I could give to you to help deal with it is to do something you truly feel passionate about and something that makes you happy, regardless of what other people think. Because you have to look after yourself and make sure your well-being is good before you can help others. You might find that talking to random people about it is easier as they are less judgemental as they don’t know you, if you agree with this then please feel free to drop me a message at any time and I’m more than happy to talk things over with you and give you advice, regardless of how bad it gets (and I know how bad it can be) there’s always light at the end of the tunnel and I want to help you realise that. :)",10Apr2020,1

218,"Greetings! I am a new member of this subreddit, coming here to find some sort of reasoning as to why I am feeling difficulty in overcoming my mental struggle.

I am a 19M from the US. I am currently a freshman in college. I am currently struggling in college: not because I can't do work, but because I am being brought down; lazy, unable to focus, too many distractions, and with too much time on my hands when I don't know how to manage it all. I also struggle with mild autism spectrum disorder as well as clinical depression. Both of these disorders have disabled me to a great degree, but I have no idea how they interact with each other. I realized over the course of college that it seems that my mental health is playing a much being role in my struggle in college than I had originally thought. I have been struggling with mental health issues since middle school when I first started noticing autism and depression getting the better of me. I became unable to focus on my school work, unable to form good relationships, and have kind of remained stuck in my ways. I have tried an assortment of different treatments: from antidepressants to therapy to talking with my liaisons and parents to journaling. Over the course of my time with these disorders, I have developed coping mechanisms, but college is just a whole new beast. On top of that, I feel like the way I am approaching fixing my mental health has not been adequately helping both disorders at once. If there is someone here who understands living with both autism and depression, and could explain to me how they are getting their mental health on track, that would be great!

221,"I would like to preface this post by saying that I understand the fact that I am by no means a professional and cannot tell for sure if I am a narcissist or truly do exhibit narcissistic habits; however I have made sure to study the matter as much as I can to get a good understanding of what I believe to be acting as. For years, I’ve scoured the internet and countless books to look for some sort of explanation as to why I act the way I do and why I feel the way I feel, but nothing has opened my eyes up more than the subject of covert narcissism. I apologize for any misinformation I may share.

All my life, I’d been a rather quiet child. Due to being raised in a household in which I was not nurtured properly in and experiencing sexual exploitation from an older brother at a young age, I’ve found myself to be very withdrawn growing up. Because of this, I would always stick with the kids that were willing to take initiative; people that would be willing to reach out to the damn mute that couldn’t speak up. One friend in particular that stuck by me for years had a manipulative and critical mother herself; she’d take out her frustrations on me and project her own insecurities onto me. She’d criticize me for every little thing I did, whether it be choosing an ugly set of clothes that day or failing to successfully do a handstand. I’d eventually become heavily insecure and hypersensitive to what others thought about me. Since elementary, the girl’s been put into counseling and she’s been doing well for herself. I’m truly glad for her, though I wish I could say the same for me. Not to say I’m not doing well, but I want to be able to stop being so superficial. 

I’d constantly get agitated thinking about what other people might have thought about me. So much so that my paranoia would cause me to keep myself from trying new things or speaking up; I refused to put myself out there no matter what. I kept to myself and a few friends, those of which, I hadn’t gotten the chance to open up to other than on a surface level. I would never admit it then, but in hindsight, I’d always compare myself to them. I’d see them letting everyone in our grade get to know and play with them, be recognized for how great they were. I always scorned at their likability and capabilities in comparison to mine, believing that if I truly got the chance to show myself off that I would be better than them; but I’d always end up cowering away in fear of being noticed for how less I was compared to them. It pained me to feel as if I were superior to them at those times; I didn’t want it to go around that I was an egoist, so to combat my feelings of superiority, I instead put myself down. It would be a constant internal battle between making myself feel like a hidden gem to the world’s worst abomination that didn’t have a place on this earth. I abhorred the thought of me being outed as an egoist, so I would openly put myself down in front of my friends. It would range from little things like my ability to draw to things like my place in friendships or family. Friends would often show overwhelming support and care, but looking at it now, it just seems like a huge ploy to get people to give me positive reaffirmation. To show me that there were people who cared about me. At one point, I tried chalking this behavior up to me being an adolescent at the time, but as friends had felt comfortable enough to open up to me, I realized I am an anomaly. That my feelings are wrong and that I’m a manipulative power freak that thinks I’m better than others. That manipulates and exploits others, not being able to form any genuine bonds with anybody because there’s always some underlying purpose for my actions. (Post-Vent Author’s Note: To clarify, I am not directing this anger and these insults to anybody who is a narcissist or exhibits narcissistic traits, this was pent-up frustration towards my own past actions and behavior. I apologize for any offense I might have caused) Not only would I internally put down those around me, but I would have these daydreams playing out in my head; scenarios ranging from me either being picked out and mentioned especially for my contributions or conversations going well in my favor to me establishing my point of view in an argument or opening up to people about how I truly feel about myself. I never go around to executing these daydreams, but at times, they are what have given me a sense of hope. It’s truly pathetic.

This discovery wouldn’t have hit me as hard if it didn’t affect my personal relationships. When high school first started, I was as every kid was; confused and unprepared. But after a while, everybody seemed to go along with it. They didn’t necessarily understand everything, but they learned how to deal with not understanding. They powered through their insecurities and took initiative to better themselves. They found people that they can trust and stick with. I always stuck around in my own group, but I wasn’t ever able to connect with others. I’d always see friends coupling off with their one close best friend that I’d never have; when I attempted to form a close coupling of my own, I’d always back out or shut my mouth before I could let myself grow any closer emotionally. This has grown to be a habit I can’t drop; even during quarantine, I’ve found myself opening up and trying to stay optimistic, but nevertheless, I still find myself backing away from being able to form steady relatiomships with my peers. A friendship of mine that recently formed from someone willing to reach out and talk to me has been going really well, yet I still can’t find the courage in me to not become blunt or absent at times because the thought of establishing a closer relationship with someone overwhelms me.

Writing all this reminds me of how much of a coward I am, pushing all my blame and regrets ono my past experiences, acknowledging my faults yet not being able to change my ways for the better. Over the past few years, I’ve been trying my best to improve and make up for all the wrong I’ve done in the last. When freshman year first began, I made it a point to become more open with my feelings and outgoing; to let myself loose. And for a while I thought I did, but everything eventually caught up to me because all I really did was evade my own personal problems. Up until the second semester, it kept getting harder and harder to keep up this facade and at this point, I don’t want to deceive anyone further. This self-quarantine isolation time was really what I needed to open my eyes and keep me away from endangering anyone else with my selfish, manipulative behavior. I don’t know what about me is real anymore, I don’t know if the me writing this right now is genuinely coming from me, the child stuck in my body, or if this is coming from the false-self that I’ve developed from exploiting others for so long. I want to be able to be a real person; I want to enjoy life, make strong, close bonds with my friends and family. Hell, I have a little brother and a dog and I can’t help from eluding either of them. I try to keep away from them so as not to harm them anymore emotionally than I already had, but I can’t even grow close with either of them. I hear and see their disappointment in me as a sister and as an owner, but nothing I do is working. I just so desperately want answers and I want to change, but I feel like I’m on my own. Nobody else I know is aware of these feelings, and as of right now, I have no access to any counselors that can guide me through this. So I’m asking somebody, please, lead me in the right direction. Not for me, but for the sake of everybody else I know. For all I know, this could have been some scheme for me to garner other people’s attention and sympathy. I can’t tell if these words are really coming from me, but what I can tell is that I need help. Please.",10Apr2020,1
