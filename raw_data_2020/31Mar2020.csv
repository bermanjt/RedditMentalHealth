0,I am done with life. Done with being treated like a piece of crap. I'm done with everything. All I wanted was someone to show me affection and everytime I get taken advantage of. Why can't I get some affection? A hug? I just want to die...and I am going to.,31Mar2020,1
1,"For the majority of my life I have had severe anxiety. Social situations, unknown places or at some points it was so bad it was at one point told to me that it seemed like i was agoraphobic by a therapist I was talking to at the time.

For the last 6months or so, my anxiety has completely disappeared. 

I don't know why, it even took me some time to realize that it was gone. But at some point I started doing things out of character for me and afterwards I would sit to myself driving home and think about it. I didn't panic, sweat, clench my teeth, have a million thoughts in my head, no flushed face, no heart rate increase even. Not even a flutter in the most stressful situations.

I just don't feel anything. I don't do any substances and have not been on medication for anxiety or depression. I am depressed but I have been for as long as I can remember and am I chronic pain patient.

The very few people in my life have all noticed a dramatic change as well. I don't feel human anymore, I say and do things that I would have been nervous to do without a thought and barely notice things I have never done before. I feel like I could lie about anything or just plain hurt others and I wouldn't notice right now, I have no motivation to do that but it is how I at the moment.

Any insight? Is it just years of depression catching up to me? Or am I just displacing my feelings in some way?",31Mar2020,1
2,"It’s been about 5 months and I’ve been feeling some type of way. I feel like there’s nothing to live for, not that I want to die, I just wish I was never born. Everyday feels the same and my life feels like a dead end (I’m a teenager). I’ve talked to teacher in what was probably February, they told my mom about my situation and advised me to see a doctor. Idk if we were actually going to do that or not but now we can’t cause of isolation. 

I once saw some comments on YouTube about how that feel this way but they don’t know if it’s true or not, like if they’re faking it. And I feel the same. I know i should be able to tell if I’m sad or not but I just tell my self it’s not true, now idk",31Mar2020,1
3,"So, let me start off with this first.

I have this close friend that left my state in order to vacation to another state about 3 weeks ago now. They were only suppose to be there for a week, but because of the lockdown orders that have been happening in many states, it ended up affecting the one that they went to as well. So, they are now trapped until that state decides to release the order of lockdown. For the first 2 weeks, they were talking to me, they seemed okay, just annoyed of the fact that they were stuck in a state that they didn't belong to. For this third week: They stopped texting. Which is something that was very sudden, and very unusual.

Now to bring you up to point: I've spent the whole week that they never responded in, texting them back and forth in hopes they would respond. (i've really only been sending 3 messages each day.) But nothing still. It is absolutely driving me insane. I have not slept for the past 2 nights, trying to find any way to find out if they're okay. I've let some of my friends know of this situation, but they believe that I'm overreacting about it. Now, they're bearing in mind of a bad habit that I carry with me:  Whenever a friend suddenly disappears for a while, even two days be it, I start to worry extremely about them, and have sudden feelings that something horrible must of happened to them. However, this is only because of past experiences that I have had with people disappearing for longer, and then coming back to tell me that something awful did happen. Unfortunately one of my friends used this habit in a cruel comment when I was telling them how much I was worrying. 

I know that it's only been a week since they said anything, but again, this is something that has never happened before with them and they're usually very active in texting. I've already tried the other ways that I can communicate with them and they haven't responded there either.  So, am I overreacting about them? They're one of my closest friends that I have and all I want is for them to be okay.",31Mar2020,1
4,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I figured it was worth a shot?

So I'm currently living with my grandma because I got kicked out of college due to the COVID stuff. Her house is kinda old and there's something about hardwood floors and like stuff sticking to your feet from it that triggers me so much. Anyway, every time I take a shower I feel uneasy because I have to walk across the floor with kinda wet feet. Showering already bothers me because I don't like feeling dry after showering so this makes it 20x worse.

Tonight I got out of the shower and just went into complete panic attack or sensory overload mode or something because I just felt gross and wet but dry at the same time. (i dont know if this is a common thing??) The feeling of putting products in my hair, clothes on my body, towels, and lotion just made me want to vomit.

What can I do to avoid this? This kinda thing has never happened to me before but I did *not* like it. Obviously I should get some kind of shoes to wear out of the shower, but the ""after-shower"" feeling would still be there, y'know? help",31Mar2020,1
5,"While this may sound like an overdramatization, I genuinely feel as if every decision, action, or hell, even sentence I say is wrong on some degree. I don't mean that what I do or choose is morally or inherently bad, I mean, if life were a serious of multiple choice answers I keep picking the wrong options. 

Say what I think is a funny joke to friends or family? It was either some how disrespectful or poorly received, or no one understood the joke.

State a cool fact I found online? No one believes me and everyone disregards what I have to say because ""I found it on the internet"".

Share a piece of writing I make with friends? Even though it's all constructive criticism, I can only feel like what I've made is terrible.

Make a commitment with some friends several days ago? Well, my father decides today to do some intensive yard work, and I chose to hang out with my friends.

Play D&amp;D with my friends, but one friend keeps forgetting the rules and stats? Sure I'll help and give them pointers. Nope, they turn it into a huge argument and now everyone thinks I'm a rules lawyer and am trying to kill the fun of the game.

Ask for help with my taxes from my parents? Why would we know how to do your taxes, go take it to HR block or someone.

I take my car to get fixed at my local shop? Turns out the place 3 miles down had a sale going on for 30% of what I just paid.

A lot of the time it feels like I'm supposed to know things before I ever encounter them. Honestly, I just can't get the thoughts out of my head I'm always wrong. I mean even now, as I'm writing this, I can't help but think to myself I'm wasting the free time I have from this virus by being lazy or watching TV. How do I stop these thoughts? How do I keep myself sane amidst all the failures I have?",31Mar2020,1
6,"Recently I've started to realize just how socially distant I am. I (15F) have always had a hard time socializing with others, and I get super nervous going to hang out with a group of people larger than 10 (sometimes smaller depending on the people). I can never keep a conversation going and most of my conversations are the other person talking for most of the time and me not knowing how to respond. I also have a hard time focusing on the bigger picture of some projects I have to do for school, several times I've had to ask a friend what we're doing because I didnt understand anything the teacher said about how to do it. Another thing that's been happening recently is I've been getting stressed over some events that have been happening because I have no control over what's to come. Loud noises have also stressed me out on my worse days to the point I just have to distance myself to my room for a while to calm down and try to get rid of my headache. I could just be overreacting and I'm just really stressed from lockdowns and online schooling due to the corona virus but I dont know. I just need some advice.",31Mar2020,1
7,I’m 22 years old and I think I wanna be death but not cause I’m depressed I just think is so beautiful to think about not being alive. Is it wrong that I think that way?,31Mar2020,1
8,Is anyone else completely losing it over covid19? I have serious mental health issues and I spend 90%of my time chain smoking through anxiety attacks. This has made it so much worse and I feel like I'm just existing waiting to die from this horrible virus. I feel like I can't clean enough even though it's all I do and I have young children.  I feel so useless to them... I also feel like something's going to happen and they won't have me. I'm trying so hard not to focus on it  but nothing is working . I feel like I'm suffocating...,31Mar2020,1
9,"Does anyone have any kind of videos of personal stories (specifically about how the person copes and resists the urges) dealing with pyromania? I have watched every single video on the Internet...believe me. I am hoping there is someone who has something that isn't on the Internet or that is personal that I can watch.

I am not hopeful....but I am curious (and bored...can you tell?)",31Mar2020,1
10,"I've known I'm different all my life. People told me I was weird when I was a kid, and they still do. 
I'm not simply an introvert. I hate being around people. Can't understand them. Can't care about them. Don't want to touch them and specially their germs (I know how most people don't wash their hands properly and then go and touch gross stuff.) can't stand that. I get super nervous about what I'll say.
That's just part of it really. 
When I was a kid the only diagnost I receveid was Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. From what I know about it I most likely do have it. But then I was diagnost in a country that's really behind in mental health. As later on in life I've learned about many other stuff.
I found out about asperger when I was getting in my teen years and it was obvious how much I could relate. I was certain I had that, but there was never someone to confirm it. 
In my teenage years it was clear I had depression. Every month I get my depressive episode. Sometimes it gets skips one month, but comes back stronger the next. 
Not 3 years ago I learned for the first time what anxiety was and I knew I suffer from it. It pretty much describes the way my brain works all the time.
And just a few weeks ago I learn I might be Hyper sensitive. Which kind of feels like a little seasoning that makes the whole meal more intense.
Based on what I've learned I have:
-Anxiety
-Depression
-Obssesive Compulsive Disorder
-Autism Spectrum Disorder
Also I'm hyper sensitive. But that's not a mental health problem is it?

One day for the first time ever I did something I never did before. I ask my family for help. They called a group of whatever that talked to me and they decided it was best to take me go to the emergency room. I was put into the psyquiatric wing for 3 days. My anxiety rarely gets as bad as it did. I was so grossed out by the bathroom that I didn't sat on them for the whole 3 days no matter how badly I needed to go. I was feeling in hell with all that people. I just wanted to get out. If they thought I was going to kill myself (which I was kind of suicidal but I usually only think about it but never do anything about it.) I was getting suicidal out of the desperation of having to be there.
I was able to remain calm on the outside as I've learned to internalize all my troubles enough so that people mostly ignore them. Which help me get out of there sooner. With the condition of a stupid program that I had to go every day for like 3 weeks. I thought I would get help somehow but instead it was stupid classes of some sort with a group of people. Talking about your problems is hell to me. Being around people is hell to me. It was terrible and I told them so they let me go after the first day with the condition of going to therapy. Again, I internalize all my problems enough so that I look I'm more stable than I really am.
Therapy felt useless, but somehow it was fine. I didn't gain anything but talking for a bit about it felt ok. Until having to go made me anxious so I stop going.
I mostly blame the country I come from for all the shame on mental health. I had to internalized all my problems all my life because of it. My family didn't know how to deal with it and I just withoug realizing end up closing up entirely. So I can't ask for help. I'm too close up to even accept it.
Currently my life is purgatory. Unlike hell no one is torturing me, because there's no one. I feel entirely alone. Without a soul. Without a purpose. I haven't had a motivation other than the recurrent obsessions I get ever so often, but in the last year not even the obsessions are enough. My thoughts are getting more and more intense. I even developed insomnia in the last 3 years. Is not all the time. But when I'm at my worst I also can't sleep. I wake up at least 3 times during the night. My sleeping schedule shifts. One day I wake up a 11am. Next week I'm waking up at 5pm. Then at 3am. I feel tired all the time. I'm emotionally dead.
I hit bottom. So much that even the idea of killing myself sounds like a hassle. Everything is a hassle. It has been most of my life.
There's no point. To any of this. I just wanted to post about what I think I have and see what happen but end up exploding saying all this shit.
Also my self esteem is shit. So despite not even knowing if is true or not. I feel entirely convinced no one gives a fuck. Despite understanding that logically that's not the case. I know no one cares. I've self reflect about all of this on my own for years. I've reached conclusions. I've learned a lot and in the end it never changes anything. It just makes me more hopeless. When others say that ""you're not alone"" when I finally understood what that meant. That more people are feeling like me. That just make me feel worst. What good does that do to me? If they're feeling like absolute shit like me, they're as helpful to me as they are to themselves. That doesn't give me any reasurance. It just makes me feel the whole world is going to eventually turn into something like me and everyone is going to end up dying of starvation because suicide is too much of a hassle or something like that. My family is no help at all. They're too ignorant about mental health. Once I went to therapy once they just assumed the problem was not theirs anymore and they start acting like the problem doesn't exist. So I just play along. Waiting for one day to just explode. To finally have a bit of energy and a little motivation to finally kill myself and end this shit show. 
Save the fucking cliche comments showing your worries and shit. They always make me feel worse. Just look at the long stuff as a way of figuring out if I do have some of the things I mentioned at the beggining. At least having a name to put to the shit I go through gives me a bit of ""at least I figured that out"" feeling.",31Mar2020,1
11,"I feel like replacing my spine and shoulders with a rake, because I have no backbone. 

I have no diagnosed illness, maybe anxiety who knows. I blame my internet usage personally. I think everyone has different things that they are immune or allergic to, and should seek ways of self-identifying those weaknesses to better help themselves in their lives. Maybe it’s the isolation, but sometimes I catch myself seeing patterns in things and making delusional guesses to justify my poor work ethic.

Social distancing had become part of my life prior to Covid, but now it feels accentuated and purposeful. 

I don’t enjoy turning my back on life to make sure that danger isn’t following. I feel like I’m walking head first into that tree over there because I was trying to count my footsteps.",31Mar2020,1
12,I’m not sure if that’s the proper term for it or if this is even the proper sub to post this to.. but can panic attacks cause a brief loss of memory? Ex. Someone coming out of a panic attack and not remembering what triggered it?,31Mar2020,1
13,"20/F/USA Hey, I’ve had a major issue for the past year or so with doctors insisting on antipsychotics for me. I’ve been on Abilify, Haldol, Olanzapine, and Seroquel (I think?). I asked a doctor last week if I had any diagnoses I wasn’t being told about that would require this. She said no, but there were notes of possible bipolar disorder. I was put on Haldol for a severe undiagnosed stomach problem and developed uncontrollable, painful facial movements that wouldn’t allow me to sleep. I was never told about this side effect or that it might be permanent. I’ve even had a psychiatrist refuse to tell me side effects while in the confines of a locked unit. While I was still suffering the facial movements (they did eventually go away) and was locked in another psych unit (for the stomach issue, but nobody believed I had a physical problem), the doctors were insisting on another antipsychotic that I can’t remember the name of, insisting that I sign the permission slip. To their credit that was the only time I was truly asked for informed consent. I read the paper of side effects and said I wasn’t comfortable with the possibility of that side effect getting worse. They kept insisting that it’s extremely rare and they never see anyone get it, despite me painfully gnashing my teeth as they spoke to me. They refused to offer any alternatives and kept insisting on a signature and I left that unit after a week and a half with barely any help. My stomach issue was diagnosed, cyclic vomiting, and amitriptyline has been helping a lot. But I guess general doctors won’t prescribe it and I need a mental health doctor of some sort. At this point I was very distrusting of them. I tried a new doctor, explained the entire situation in tears, how I was unwilling to try antipsychotics and I was open to literally anything else. She told me she was gonna put me on an antipsychotic. I said no and begged for other options. After some persuasion she offered me a “new antidepressant that is working well with a lot of people.” I accepted it, and found out later that day that it would cost me $900 a month with insurance to be on it. And today I looked it up out of curiosity, and it’s Vraylar. Another antipsychotic. 

I feel like multiple people have been trying to trick me into it. I’ve felt for a long time that I’m losing my rights as a person with every new label. This is just one of many issues I’ve had but it’s the biggest one currently. 

I guess my question is, why am I being misled? Is it legal to deny telling someone side effects? Can I be hospitalized if I refuse medications often enough? I just feel like I’m losing the right to make my own choices and it’s scary. Thanks in advance.",31Mar2020,1
14,"So I’m 15. I have your typical depression and severe anxiety and used to be suicidal but I’m not anymore. I’m in “therapy”, but in reality he’s a “bible-oriented family counselor”. Overall I guess you could say I feel very devalued and misunderstood (being gay in a small town in South Carolina. Didn’t wanna bring it up cos then comments will probably focus on “oh it gets better” thx but Ik it does) which is okay because I’m trying to learn to help myself and support myself emotionally.

During this quarantine, we’ve been having to do online schoolwork. Being from the boonies it’s impossible for us to get internet. Therefore, I usually have to go out about 30-40 minutes to do schoolwork. Then, I have two options. One is to drive out to the McDonalds parking lot and try to adjust myself with a computer in my lap to sit comfortably in my Kia Soul (I’m 6’2” and after two weeks of trying I couldn’t get anything done. This also leads to our main problem). The other is to go to my grandparents’ business and sit down at the back desk (I live with them now so it’s normal). Either way, I have had trouble doing work. In both instances I have a severe problem with concentration. I cannot focus on anything and this has always been a problem, but to a lesser extent until this instant. (I have trouble focusing but can become hyperfixated on the weirdest stuff like my fingernails or my arm hairs or some pattern on the ceiling for long periods of time. I kind of self diagnosed that I could have ADD, but I’m not a doctor I’m just a kid).

So anyways, today I got to my grandmother’s car lot (she’s like 69 and been in retail her whole life. She’s seen it all) and got on my computer for the first time in a week to do schoolwork. I log on and it’s been seven days that I’ve missed. I’m overwhelmed immediately when I check my PowerSchool and the grades for the 9 weeks are posted. I have a 53 in one of my classes. So I’m freaked out. None the less, I decided to try to go get some work. I try my hardest to get some assignments completed and got one thing that was due last Tuesday turned in after about an hour of struggling to concentrate. Then I looked down at everything that was still due. I started panicking because I knew I couldn’t do it all. At that point I had put my head down and could feel blood rushing to my head. I started to sob quietly at my desk so that my grandma couldn’t hear me. Eventually, my mind began racing. My good grades are the only thing I can think of that will get me out of this town and into the life that I want and with that thought I began to panic and spiral. I began feeling trapped and overwhelmed and that’s when I lost all sense of rationality. My crying became more violent and my grandmother came into check on me. She asked what was wrong but I couldn’t speak. I was starting to shake and get mad at myself. That’s when I started to bang my head against the computer. (I had had dramatic panic attacks before, but this one was different because usually I don’t try to harm myself) In total, I had ended up scratching surface skin from my forehead, banging my nose to the point of bleeding (it still hurts), clawing skin off my right hand, and trying to choke myself on a wet paper towel when my grandpa tried to put it on my face to calm me down. Eventually I did and we called my Bible-oriented family counselor. He expressed little concern but fortunately told us that we should ask for paper copies of the schoolwork.

It’s about 7 hours later and I’ve been really tired. Oddly enough I’ve still felt anxious and overwhelmed and had that weird desire to cry. About 4 hours ago I noticed myself starting to dissociate. I then started panicking and feeling like I was going insane. I felt like I wasn’t human and that I was drifting away from reality. (I’ve dissociated before, but it’s usually in a much more peaceful manner). Fortunately, though, spending time writing this Reddit post has allowed me to process the events, get them on “paper”, and ground myself back to reality. 

I guess my main query is what happened in a psychological sense, and is there a name or possible diagnoses for any of this?",31Mar2020,1
15,"I dunno. I'm just on here to ask how to keep everyone calm and prevent bickering over dumb stuff during quarantine/social distancing in our houses. I feel like everyone's on edge, and any small issue is largely magnified. 

Also do any of you feel the pressure related to this quarantine? How are all of you managing?",31Mar2020,1
16,"I come from an area locally known as the red zone, it was quite a violent place, people were murdered all the time, lost family members, it was the bread of the day, the red zone is statistically one of the most violent places in the world, always top 10 (yes of course it is in south america). I didn't get bad education, even when I was very poor, so I eventually ended up in the west.

Now I am mentally insanely sturdy, after all, it's a lot different from folk who have never saw this, vs someone who grew there; I can digest a lot more than the average folk, and I can tolerate things that would break most people, after all, attempted assault was something that you faced every other week, and I am not exaggerating, and I am pretty good at keeping calm and avoiding trouble, as well as reading people's true intentions; most of my success in life I attribute to this troubled childhood, keep your head high, think cold, and keep going.

I am not even kidding migration ran me a mental health checkup, to which I came, very very clean; not only I had nothing on me, but I was resilient. But of course, I am conscious, but what when I am unconscious?...

The problem is when I am sleeping, my dreams are testing me, all the time; and they have gone too far recently; now I've had bad dreams like this since I was a teen, what a shocker; usually it involves avoiding some threat, sometimes I am the threat, and the dreams can be, of insanely realistic nature, and fairly disturbing, but, I never lose, and roles reverse very often, so I become the threat to what threatens me. Just like I never lost IRL, I keep my cool, so I am never stressed about it, they were more of a nuisance, like why dreaming of all this trouble?... maybe to keep my practice for real life situations.

But now I am in the west, zero threats, zero; maybe the neighbor chihuahua, that thing is scary; and these fucker dreams have doubled down, seriously, it's like, they are refusing to lose, because they always lost, and now they are winning at times, to which they go to the literal extremes, so extreme they'd hit me in real life; and that upsets me, after all, it's myself, and I myself know my flaws, so they will use them. Because my dreams cannot lie to me, they can't put a monster that I can't defeat because I think cold, monster don't exist, they'll put me instead, make me think that I am crazy, they'll make me think I am my own enemy, they'll do everything to make me think I am crazy, and they'll break all the rules of a dream in order to make it seem like it, yes dream have rules, like, your eyes are closed right, well... fuck that my dream says, they'll do AR dreams.

I think the worst most extreme dream, nightmare thing I had was of this lady; she came in a bus, I was suspicious of her, she said she'd perform a ritual but we needed to follow one rule and throw away our goods that might have any relation to religion or otherwise we will end up cursed, now I just happened to have a golden virgin Mary collar, which I hid in my pocket, because, thief, that's what I thought, all she said was nothing but crap; as she started the ritual I got teleported to an elevator, because I broke the rules, in an infinite void with infinite doors, that you couldn't escape of; think cold, so I did, this reality can't be real, such a machine can't be built and infinite elevators don't exist, never lost my cool; but then, it doubled down, I opened my eyes, physically, I was in my room, ah yes, I am in the west now, but shit, I can't move, I was getting a flow of adrenaline despite being calm as my heartrate seemed ok, yes I counted my pulses, I was still calm but the dream was refusing to let hold of me, it wanted to make me believe I was crazy; this was realworld but my room was totally covered in blood, and I couldn't move, but why my eyes were open?... and why my legs had spasms, that feel ridiculously uncomfortable; this is clearly unreal, I am hallucinating, but, why?... am I crazy?... I thought I was moving around my room, but I wasn't, every time, I realized, I was back to the bed, teleported, some minutes pass and it's gone, click, I can move, I can blink, but my legs keep on the spasms, they keep doing that shit, for hours.

As if this wasn't nearly enough, today I had it even weirder, similar shit happened, but the strange thing is that the dream didn't have any background, I was in my tent enjoying the countryside or something and away from the cities because coronavirus; very cool dream, so it's odd because I never really get ""nice dreams"", then I hear someone screaming, and I open my eyes, I see my room clearly, fuck my nice dream, this woman starts screaming so loud and so close to my ear, in a foreign language; wait, hold on, it's too close, and it's yelling me shit, literally yelling me shit, screaming at me, almost going to burst my ears; I go try to reach my phone to put on some music or something to stop listening and think about booking an appointment with a psychiatrist, fuck I lost my mind I thought, and I feel the same odd rush of adrenaline, without a change of the heartrate; suddenly, the screams stop, even when I was belly trying to take my phone no I was actually with my back on the bed, left arm extended to the ceiling grabbing my blanket (that was supposed to be my phone what the fuck), totally unatural sleeping position which means I moved, I was paralyzed, kinda... but not really... I moved... This dream was so bad, I am not sure if the neighbor actually screamed, because that shit was clearly Finnish, and my upstairs neighbor is Finnish; but that can't be, because it was way too loud, and way too angry other people would have come out, and I felt it way too close. As you can see the dream is leaking into real world to confuse me, it wants me to ask my neighbour if she screamed, but of course I won't, my dreams have gotten so fucking hardcore, they have started to challenge me into real world because they can't win in dream world. Not to add I hear a shitload of footsteps right now, and guess what, 100% they are real, fucking neighbor is awake, bullshit dream kept this into consideration, it is insane; but there's no way someone screamed for like 5 minutes straight that loud and none else came out, heck I should have been able to react with such stimuli.

It creeps me, because what will it come with next?... It is upping the game... what is it I am fighting against now?... how can I defeat it?... it is literally myself, mastercrafting dreams; this isn't a threat in a dream; it is me vs me; one designs intrincate dreams and uses all it can and breaks all the rules of dreaming (fucking eyes opened AR dreams what the hell is that?) like I would do if I had to pose a challenge to myself, normal dreams wouldn't work, normal nightmares wouldn't work, they have to be special and hard to decipher. Meanwhile the other me tries to unwrap the dream and figure it out.

It is the same process you use when you are threatened but on steroids, it totally seems like someone else takes charge on these dreams, they are just evil; I take the someone trying to kill me and my family dream any time before this garbage.

Fuck I have a literal headache.",31Mar2020,1

18,"I've hurt a lot of people in my time. For as long as I've known myself I've been problematic. I didn't have a great childhood and it seeped in to my being in ways I'm only starting to notice in the past few months unfortunately.

My father was never there for me, he was always there, but he was never emotionally available. As a child I was expected to man up and deal with my own problems. Ingot bullied at school for being intelligent, later for being ugly and eventually my lack of looking after myself due to my severe depression from the aforementioned bullying. Depression which I haven't truly beaten even now.

2 years ago though everything changed, I met a woman from my past and we fell in love once more. Admitted to.one another that we never truly forgot the other, that those years apart were just spent thinking of the other. Eventually I moved to America to be with this girl and we were so in love, we truly were. 

We did everything together, and one day she looked at me and told me ""I'm pregnant."" I was so happy, last June 26th we welcomed them in to the world.

Three words.

""It's a boy.""

I hurt the girl though. Why did I do that?

I was narcissistic, a liar, just a truly awful person in those last few months. I did more than I had too to make them both happy, and I just hurt her more than anyone else in the end.

I really was just trying to make them happy.

But why the fuck, why the actual fuck did I do that?

I lost my son last September, she just decided I wasn't seeing him anymore and I've been fighting for him ever since. Trying so hard but he just stays out of my reach.

I'm not a bad father, even she admitted that. She just thinks I don't deserve him because of how I hurt her. I'm so sorry that I did. 

In the past few months I've begun to see that I'm not always the problem, but I often am, and that I've hurt so many people through the way I see myself and the constant struggle with my feelings.

It's time I make amends, for her, for my son, for myself.

I'm going to start of small, tiny little deeds.

Then I'm going to make amends to everyone I've wronged I can remember.

Then I'm going to try changing the world one little piece at a time.

I truly want to end my selfishness; because till now I've hurt everyone I've tried to make happy.

I have to be better.",31Mar2020,1

Where are you now and how are you functioning on an everyday basis. Living with these illnesses makes everyday life very difficult for me. I know that I'm only functioning at a fraction of what I could be and not living my life to my full potential. It's really frustrating being self-aware but not being able to do anything about it.

20,"Hi everyone, I have anxiety and ocd.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been dealing with irrational worries that plague my mind and take over everything I’m thinking. I’ve had some amazing days and memories basically ruined because of anxiety. My latest is that I sold my soul.

&amp;#x200B;

As many ocd sufferers know, if you just comply with the urge, the urge goes away. Myself and friends were talking about rappers who sold their soul, and when I was alone I felt compulsed to say “I sell my soul to the devil” so I did, to be rid of the compulsion.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my anxiety wrecks havoc thinking I have. I think every good thing that happens to me is because I sold my soul.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I know god owns all souls as it’s said in the bible. I’m also spiritual but not a strict Christian. My brain can’t seem to accept facts or rational thoughts. Can anyone help me? I’m usually so happy and I have great days ahead, I want to enjoy life again! Please help me.",31Mar2020,1

I'm on counselling waiting lists and obviously because of this pandemic I'll be waiting much longer than necessary and in the mean time I'll be getting ten times worse. I've been off of work since Christmas so just a few days before I actually got raped and I am nowhere near in the slightest ready to go back. Nothing is going good for me.

I just show my face downstairs once a day just to show my family that I still exist.

The only thing I eat is cereal, my sleep pattern is fucking gone, I really can't be bothered washing myself anymore and I even started doing the one thing I swore I'd never do, I started harming myself.

22,"My brother is ruining my mental health, and he does everything that will lead me eventually to suicide. I need help. I tried with it many times

What do you think of my brother? It’s going to be long. Please help me, I can’t deal with this anymore. Be honest.

I suffer from severe depression and anxiety. My brother also suffers from it.
He is really abusive towards me whenever I disagree with him, he calls me awful names really hurting my feelings.
I often listen to him for hours about his problems, I try to calm him down, not to think about the worst scenario. But it’s too much for me. I have many problems in myself. I suffer from suicidal thoughts every other day. I feel fucking hopeless and I have many stress issues right now. I stayed alone in my apartment and didn’t go home to the family. 
And I have to repress all these feelings because whenever I tried to share anything with him he betrayed me, made fun of me, increased my fear and anxiety, and even victim blamed me.
Examples:

When I told him I was sexually harassed by a 40ish married man when I was 17, he made fun of me, how I am a w***** and even told everything to my parents who are really conservative and it just created so much shame in me yet I shouldn’t feel guilty.

He often made fun of me how I am a feminazi and nobody will have sex with  me and I will stay a virgin forever just because I don’t have a boyfriend. He made me so upset that I told him how I was basically raped when I lost my virginity. He laughed about it, told my parents again: She was raped. She was raped.

He always calls me cringe whenever I post something on facebook. How pitiful I am, this basically creates anxiety in me. How I am not going to find a boyfriend: just because I posted a photo with a sketch about a guy on a wall and me together and the title was: me and my boyfriend ( it was supposed to be sarcastic) and he also said now: women don’t behave like that.

Some days ago I shared a post on Facebook, how it sucks to be alone and your mind can just basically go crazy and I envy the people who spend their quarantine time with someone they love. And he just made fun of me again. How I am behaving like a celebrity, like I am Kim Kardashian. How pathetic I am, they will use it against me.


I once shared a post with a really dear friend of mine on Instagram and I mentioned how she has always stood by me even when everybody bullied me. And I got it again: how I am behaving like a celebrity, you are not a star to share your bully story. Every bullied person deserved it. 

I mentioned him once that I was dropped out of a group ( in one of the university groups because they created an official one for us newbies and their group chat was basically a private group chat) and he tried to plant the idea in me that they threw me out because they talked about me or laughed at me. It made me anxious again and sad.


He blamed me for other things like: he accidentally sent a mail to a lady containing the text: die rat and he wanted to send me.

He blamed me when a married man ( I didn’t know) hit on me, talked for a week on whatsapp and his wife found me and I stopped talking to the man and told everything to his wife because she asked me. And how I ruined other people’s lives.

Yesterday was my birthday, his friend sent me a Happy Birthday message on Facebook. I texted him: Thank you, have a good day ( but if you talk to my brother it won’t be hahaha) just being sarcastic. The guy also laughed it off. And on my fucking 25th birthday that I spent alone without any cakes, friends, loved ones I had to talk to him for 2 hours because how he was insulted and I ruined his friendship and now his friend behaves odd.

I just can’t deal with this anymore, it’s really toxic, I blocked him everywhere but he is sending me nasty mails containing every swearing you would describe the shittiest person on Earth.

My mental health is really bad now, his behaviour really hurt me. He is selfish, he only cares about himself, he just ruins me. And I can’t cut the contact because he is 23 and still lives with my mom ( she and my father also endured a lot : including: putting a gun to my mom’s head, breaking my father’s finger, constantly verbally or physically abusing them) plus he always blackmails me(e.g.: he uploaded my lost photos from my really old Iphone to a computer and he threatened me to share my private ones on the internet and I will commit suicide, he threatened to curse me, he made up a story  about him being involved in the mob and he was smuggling stuffs and he lied about it that he needs money or he will be killed and I loaned money from a bank and he even created panic in me how the mobs know about me and they are going to kill me if I mention anything to anyone: I escaped to my friend’s dorm she was also scared, I cried and had panic attacks 6 times a day that I will be assasinated, it was exam period I couldn’t do my exams I was a f-ing mess and still suffer from it) when I talk to my mom he just takes aways the phone and doesn’t let us talk on the phone. I rely on him now as well because he has to send my medicine via the post office and I don’t want my mom to do it because she has diabetes and she is 60 so I don’t want to endanger her.

He doesn’t go to college, he doesn’t work, he just does nothing, he sometimes goes out with his friends and that’s all. 
Oh and yeah my parents far from perfect but he can’t take responsibilities for his mistakes. It’s always somebody else who is to be blamed.


Please help me what to do or what you think about him. Am I wrong here?
Whenever I talk anything about him to a friend he calls me a traitor.
If he knew I posted this here, he would destroy me.

(ik extremely selfish of me to do that to my SO) i had the suicide hotline number saved on speed dial in case of emergencies. it was my first time calling I was greeted by a women named ""May"" she had a sweet southern accent and even sounded motherly. she was able to calm me down long enough for my boyfriend to get out of the shower and find me in the mess I made. she asked to talk to him so she could make sure that I would be safe and be able to get help if I had the thoughts get worse. my boyfriend was understanding but ofc a bit hurt. he had got in the shower thinking I was just having some anxiety that would pass and I had reassured him I could hold my own. anyways needless to say I'm sorry for the people that have experienced bad from these hotlines, I do hope you guys can get positive help in the future.

26,"I'm finding it really hard cope at the moment. We lost my dad about a year ago but leading up to it was really hard. He had been ill for awhile but the last 6monthsof his life were horrendous, no exaggeration but I genuinely believe hell would look like paradise in comparison to what he went through 

So I am borderline and have anxiety and depression. I've been single for the last 7 odd years because of it. When my dad fell ill I went on meds which seemed to help. We lost him and it was traumatic. I completely broke but I had to get my shit together for my mum because I need to support her both emotionally and financially. I was doing well but then in the new year I stupidly felt ready to have a relationship again. Things were going well until we spent the night together. I missed two doses of my meds but didn't realise it at the time and ended up having a psychotic break. He got the brunt of it and things ended. When I realised what happened, I explained everything, the good, the bad and the ugly and took responsibility and apologised. I have tried to make it up to him since but he wants nothing to do with me.

Part of me is heartbroken because he was the first boy to be kind to me and I haven't had a connection like that in a really long time, so I'm having trouble letting go. The other part of me feels like, I don't know. I'm so scared of losing my mum to the coronavirus. She has some underlying health conditions and she's like 65 and she's taken such a knock the last year and a half with everything with my dad. I feel like if I lose her I'm just going to be completely alone forever because it feels like no one will accept me or love me for me. I feel like at the moment I'm only living to support her and if that goes I have no reason to be here. I am so low at the moment and I am struggling to keep things together everyday because all I want is for the pain to stop. I know I'm being selfish and self involved and I need to get over it so I'm sorry, especially at a time like this but I don't know what else to do",31Mar2020,1

It was a pretty bad reaction and we didn't see anything about a rash in the Zoloft packet so he went to the doctor who told him to get off it asap because it would spread to his organs (only on a couple weeks so no withdrawal quitting cold turkey.)


His doctor then proscribed Effexor. Same thing, but she told him to stop as soon as he said his armpits were itchy again.


Then he was put on buspirone, no rash but did not help at all after a few months. Now he is on Abilify, starting tomorrow morning.


I tried googling but am having trouble. Is there any way I can find a common denominator that might be in these medicines? There was a third medicine that caused a rash too but we can't remember the name. So we are just trying to research ourselves since this has not been going so well..

31,"Can someone help me describe what emotions I am feeling. I think part of my problem is that I’m not even sure what I am experiencing, and I want to know what it is so I can finally begin the process of feeling better. I will keep this as short as I can. I am currently a sophomore attending a 4 yr university. I made the big mistake of not choosing a major when applying to universities because ultimately, I wasn’t sure of what I wanted to study. I spent the last 2 years of my life as a walking corpse. Not knowing what I wanted to study led me to a deep state of depression and it only got worse the further I progressed throughout college. It was tough seeing all of my friends find clubs and friends through their majors. Flashforward to the present time, I have finally settled on a major but I feel as if I denied myself access to that “enclave” forming period of my life. My major has less funding, less clubs, and less resources. Nothing compared to anything the college of engineering has.

I should add that I was a top performing student in high school. Not that high school matters much in the grand scheme of life, but I was in the top 10 of my high school class and was successful in many high school sports/extracurricular activities. Most of my other peers in the top 10 went on to good schools and good majors. I ended up going to UIUC (top 10 u.s engineering school) undecided. Ultimately, I developed a strong dislike towards myself for not applying myself in the time it mattered most. When I was 18 I wasn’t really sure of what I wanted to study and engineering wasn’t on my mind at all. Now that I am a little older and understands how the world works a bit more, I now know that with an engineering degree, had I chosen that major, I would be in a better financial situation post-grad than most.

To add to this, my younger brother got into the same school as I did for engineering. Now I feel as if I am living vicariously watching him succeed and do all the things I could have done (we have mostly the same h.s stats). It doesn’t help that he constantly makes jokes that belittle me since I am not in his program. I hate how he views our lives as a competition. To add to all of this, we come from a very poor family and I grew up watching my parents struggle financially (file for bankruptcy, having to wear hand me downs, only being able to eat as much as food stamps allowed for us). I guess I had always told myself that I would go to school to better myself, because I didn’t want to experience what I had to with my parents struggles. I never had the nicest things growing up and I still don’t. Now I feel guilty all the time because I feel like I’ve let myself down. I couldn’t transfer into engineering at my school due to the prestige of the program. And it doesn’t help that I go to a top engineering school where it is literally engineering or bust.

I’m not really sure what I am feeling. Is it guilt? Shame? Disappointment? Jealousy towards my brother? I’ve been working to accepting that I have made a mistake and have been trying to not lament over my past actions. But this is obviously easier said than done. And if it's not one thing or another. I felt some ease when I decided on a major, but now it's a new hurdle. All my friends are landing internships and I'm not because I'm a little late to even deciding what I wanted to study in the first place. This all just adds on to my low-self esteem and it makes me feel so shitty about myself. I'm literally useless.

Any insight or help is appreciated. I am really trying to not self-pity myself. I know that I need to get over myself. But it’s just hard for me to accept when I think I have truly experienced a “failure” in my life. I’m not sure of how to process/handle this. I will say I am in a better mental state than I was a few months ago. But I am constantly living with anxiety, an almost fear of the future. i want to land a good paying job. I don't want to move back home like my older sibling who went to college and has now been home for 5 years. But those months where I was truly depressed, well they were rough on me to say the least.",31Mar2020,1

34,"It's half past five in the morning here, and I just broke down crying and need some advice. This may become lengthy.

For context: I'm a 21 year old female university student. I live with both my parents and my younger brother.

Throughout nearly all of high school, I felt in general very down and lonely. I absolutely hated that time. After high school, I went to study abroad for ten months, and my mental well-being got better while there. I returned home, started university and the first year was great. Suddenly I had friends, also some I was quickly very close to, and I didn't feel lonely. I went out to do things with them a lot, and looked forward to going to class and seeing them everyday. I was motivated and studied quite a lot as well. It turned out I was studying more than necessary (was a straight A student throughout my whole life and my parents had incredibly high expectations for me, were very pleased with my results that first year and even said I might want to tone it down a little). Since then, I started studying less and less, my motivation and concentration slowly fell to a minimum, and I didn't look forward to going to class anymore.

I have never liked being home. The relationship with my father is almost non-existing, I don't like him as a person and am constantly avoiding him while walking on eggshells to avoid his weird outbursts. I actually despise him, am convinced he has some kind of personality disorder, and think my mother deserves better. I honestly love my mother a lot, and I know she loves me, but our relationship definitely isn't great. We have personalities that easily collide and have a very nasty way of fighting when we do. We both know what to say to really hurt the other. The thing is, my mother has an obsession with grades and studying. This sounds like some exaggerated ""my mom is so annoying""-talk, I know, but hear me out. I hardly ever had any intrinsic motivation to study. I didn't really care if I just passed or had high grades, but since I easily got high grades in elementary, she's been expecting them since. I was honestly afraid of coming home with anything under 80%. In high school, this was fairly easily achievable. The rare occasions that I did ""badly"" (passed with less than say 75% on some small test or project which would still keep my final score in the 80's or 90's) were horrendous. I got scolded, got immensely long lectures on the importance of studying, got predicted horrible futures if I didn't improve drastically immediately, got compared to her as a student, and had to find logical explanations for my error, none of which were 'correct' except ""I didn't study enough in purpose, feel extremely guilty about it and this is my detailed 3 month plan for studying in the future and I'll report to you what I study every day"". Mind you, this is when I was around 16 and no teacher had ever even thought about failing me. Often, she'd call in my father who would just start yelling, though he has never taken any interest in my life or school.

In short, IMMENSE pressure on my academic achievements. Not on anything else, my mother isn't like that except when it comes to grades, and I don't fully understand why. It hasn't bettered over the years. My brother (18) is in his last year of high school and trying to communicate to our mother that he's ""empty"" and can't do it anymore and stressing out, but she ignores that message and keeps lecturing him on having to get higher grades.
On top of this, she is extremely controlling about anything school-related (wants me, a 21 yo university student, to adhere to a study schedule during these corona times, that she made. Expects extremely detailed information about my brother's maths excercises without even understanding what they're about,...). I have tried arguing and literally calling her out on this multiple times, but the message ""we're empty, this isn't helping anyone and this is not healthy behaviour"" doesn't seem to arrive.

I feel like it is actually gradually getting worse. A month or so ago, I had a nasty break-up with my long term boyfriend and while I was trying to pour my feelings out to her, she turned it into a lecture about how I couldn't let it affect my grades super quick. Same thing when my cat was dying.

Well, for about a year now, I've been feeling increasingly stressed and unhappy. Had to deal with very stressful situations like having to talk a friend out of suicide, the problems in my relationship with my ex, etc. which certainly didn't help. I sometimes just cry because of my general feeling. I feel very alone (even though I still have those close friends) and lockdown at home isn't helping. I have zero motivation for my studies anymore, while getting more and more stressed about them. I stress about going out of my room because I don't want to tun into my father. I hate it. More and more, I feel the need for just a hug, comforting words and some useful advice on me feeling so down from my mom (she's a psychologist and could actually help). I miss a normal relationship with her, even though I never had that. I hardly tell her anything anymore, in fear of her turning it to my grades (which have fallen dramatically, I have to retake at least one this year).
What do I do? Is there any way of restoring/building a loving and close relationship with my mom? I love her, I really do, and I need her now, as mother instead of a surveillant. We get along fine in most everyday settings, we can laugh, I know ger opinions on things better than my father does and we agree on a lot of things as well, but anything study-related seems to be in the way of a close relationship. I have a hard time telling my mother anything serious, because I already have to come up with answers to her questions when she somehow relates it to studying.

I don't know how to tell her that I don't have any motivation or concentration and feel very down, as this is obviously study-related.
Please help. I just want a hug from her.",31Mar2020,1

While the car SUV approached a red light then was sitting there waiting, The Passenger of the SUV, got out, call me walked up to me and then kicked me right in the left-thigh. My reaction to that when he kicked me I screamed AHH or OWW or something along the lines of that. 

He didn't even say a single word, I looked back to watch him calmly and quietly get back into the SUV and then when the light went green, The Driver of the SUV drove off quite quiet and slow, without even a single screech of the tires.

To prevent this from happening again, I am no longer going to be rude to people in traffic. 

the other reason would be money. 

I was spending probably somewhere roughly between $12-$18 on alcohol everyday, averaging about $15.  

So I thought I would really benefit financially from giving up the habit entirely.",31Mar2020,1
41,"I thought that sleep deprivation might be the reason, but i got a good sleep and... nothing. The only thing I feel is fear of losing what I have because of my state, because i can't pretend good enough that I care. I feel like i'm about to cut down all my communication with friends, my girlfriend. I don't know if I love them, but I'm definitely afraid of losing them. 

But I used to be a normal person. I used to care. And now I just do everything that I did, but only because I'm used to it. I look normal from the outside, but inside I feel shattered, broken. Like I big part of my personality has been ripped off. Like i'm not human anymore. I don't want to die, but i hate to live in a world where I can't feel anything. Last summer, even autumn I used to have emotions. These were colorful, they made me happy, but i had panic attacks every day and now they're gone, but i all my emotions too.

I just want to feel. I want to feel happiness, love, sadness, all of them. But I can't.

42,"(This post is approved by u/AgitatedSpinach5, the subject\[M\] of this post.)

(Note to r/mentalhealth community: I'm not sure if posting this here is appropriate, I'm sorry if it isn't. If you are reading this post, please know that the following may be a stressful situation.)

After making a post on a subreddit to make friends, I got messages from a boy (I’ll refer to him as M). Looking into his profile, I realized that people have been identifying him as a “troll”. M made a bunch of posts asking people to be his friend, and messaged many people asking for help. I decided to talk to him anyway and see for myself, as he seems like someone who desperately wants help.

After knowing him for 5 days (and talking with him quite a lot), I want to write this post to response to the information about him being a troll, as well as to introduce him to this community. Note that I have decided to trust him for the most part, and I don’t agree with labelling him as a troll. Please protect yourself in any case.

I hope this post will contribute a bit in leading him to help, and advocate for a friendly and empathetic community.

**The reason M got labelled as a troll**

It is understandable that M got labelled as a troll, and people have been spreading the message so that others won’t fall into the trap.

1. He has multiple accounts, he gets a new one when an old one got banned. The post history of these accounts are similar, consisting of posts with titles and contents along the line of “PLZ HELP ME” or “please talk to me”, posted to many different subreddits including social subreddits and mental health subreddits.
2. He also mesages lots of users. He talks about crying and screaming nonstop, that he needs help and wants someone to be his friend. However, he is naive and non-understanding in many ways, which makes conversation exceptionally hard, and potentially harmful.
3. The number of posts and number of users he messaged are high enough to have him banned.

With these points, it’s reasonable that people, especially a few users who had more elaborate experience with him, have warned others of this troll, and advised others to not interact with him. For detailed description see: [https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/comments/ddf5bn/l\_please\_be\_kind\_to\_me/f2gib00/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/comments/ddf5bn/l_please_be_kind_to_me/f2gib00/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

**How M is NOT a troll**

I know M’s behaviour has more or less made him a troll, but with my interaction with him I believe it is not intentional.

1. While a part of what he says seems untrue, it is consistent. It is possible that he does believe in what he said however untrue it seems or is.
2. His intention is genuine. In these five days of interaction with him, he has not tried to make me do anything, except to help him get a friend in different ways. A troll or someone with malicious intentions is not likely to spend all these time and acts to get to nowhere. You will see his kinder side if you get to it, but his frustration takes hold a lot.
3. He has denied any history of mental illnesses. I cannot diagnose him as I am not a professional, but it is evident that he is struggling with communication and mood problems, and according to him he has no social support and also cannot function in daily life. He doesn’t speak and act that way to annoy people; he does it because that’s the only way he knows.
4. He is vulnerable in ways. And he has encountered bad people on reddit which added to his despair. According to the chat logs he showed me, someone tricked M into sending them his money, by guilt tripping M into helping. There were also many rude people who told M to kill himself. These are unacceptable in all cases.

M asked for help and indeed he needs help, but as the troll warming mentioned, what he really needs is beyond what the online community can offer. M wants someone to help him, and he insisted that the help he needs is a friend and that will save him, while he likely needs social workers and professionals. He wants someone who will be nice to him and will not abandon him, which is tbh an innocent and humble wish. The thing is he wants to be saved and satisfied, and he doesn’t understand how friendship works for other people.

I hope we don’t label M as a troll anymore, and hopefully with some more genuine interaction with people, he will one day get the help he really needs. That said, I am fully aware that precaution is needed.

**Points to note in interaction with M**

First of all, please be serious when you decide whether to interact with M. If you are not ready to commit into a difficult and genuine conservation, it is better for you to do nothing and not interact. If you decide to interact, please be patient and empathetic, and note the following points.

1. Set boundaries. Know clearly what you will and will not do, and define your role. I say define your role because you may approach him as a potential friend, or as a helper. I’m not saying you can’t be both, but these roles do have different requirements. If you decide to be a helper, adapt and try to understand and convey your messages to him, and help him with things within reasonable boundaries. If you decide to be a friend, be yourself, be kind and casual, but committed.
2. Keep check of emotions for both of you. Either of you may need time away to rest and calm down during your conversation, and it’s okay, give each other time to rest, and take a rest anyway if you need it.
3. Be gentle, but direct and clear. You may find him not understanding you and keeps repeating things like “I need help”, “why are you doing this to me”, “then kill me” and sad faces or gibberish. Acknowledge his frustration, but don’t lose your stance.
4. DO NOT ENCOURAGE HIM TO KILL HIMSELF. YOU SHOULD NEVER DO THIS TO ANYONE. 
5. Don’t let him insult you, and don’t insult him either. Please take very good care of yourself.
6. Know that most likely you alone won’t able enough to solve his problems, you are not expected to (despite what he tells you).

Although I have written all these, I know that I am just one ordinary person who don’t have the power to save M, and this long post here may not even be appropriate. The reason I made this post is to make things clear, in hope that bringing this to light will help in a way. Maybe you will encounter (or already encountered) him when you make a post, or you may try to get in touch with him after seeing his posts or this post. In anyways, I hope things will get better, for M and for everyone. Please feel free to comment if any part of this post concerned you.

Thanks for reading and wish you all the best.",31Mar2020,1
43,"So I want to apologize in advance, I'm stressed out and tired and I suck at writing all of this down anyways but anyways to whats going on:   


About 2 months ago my mother started acting really strange, just staring out of windows and commenting about how funny it is to see the cars passing by and during conversations she would just blank and forget what she was talking about.   


Ever since then its been getting worse and worse, she is now hearing people talking about her from outside, every car that passes by the person is flipping her off, there is always a car accident up the street or a fire or something.. Of course I dont see or hear any of this.   


 Just within the last 2 weeks its gotten to the point where she runs outside and starts shouting at every car that passes to slow down, or shouting out the window at the neighbors. It was extremely bizarre one day because when she was talking to me about the neighbors I noticed that she was staring right through me, I waved my hand in front of her face and she didnt even react or flinch or anything. According to my brother she had a full conversation with me in the garage by herself today.

&amp;#x200B;

The cops were called on her a week ago and she was hospitalized but she got out a day later telling the doctor she is fine. 

Whats strange is whenever a doctor or a police officer is talking to her she acts like she is normal and nothing is wrong 

I just don't know what to do to help her at this point, she is refusing help. I tried to get her into multiple doctors and talk to her about it but she gets angry with me and just tells me to fuck off. I'm seriously worried for her that it may be some sort of brain tumor or dementia or something. Does anybody know what I should do to get her help? Is there anything I can do?",31Mar2020,1

i may not want to actively kill myself or be planning to do so, but remembering i’m on medication that is essentially preventing me from paving my own way towards my death bed makes it less redeeming. what’s next from here? i’m having trouble looking ahead towards the future. i thought by now i’d be feeling an excitement for life, but it seems that life almost has less of a purpose now that i’m not self destructing. wondering if anyone can relate. feeling pretty hopeless",31Mar2020,1

49,"I (F,20) have been dating my boyfriend (23) for only six months now. He’s easily my best friend, and we spend everyday together. We both have been previously diagnosed with GAD and anxiety. His anxiety is a lot different from mine (I have OCD) as his is almost entirely social anxiety. There will be times I’ll do something that cause him to worry ex. Think I don’t really love him, care about him etc. The problem is that those instances are things that are totally normal occurrences. Today for example I decided to watch a documentary instead of the show he recommended a few hours earlier. He made some passive aggressive comments/jokes and it wasn’t until I asked what’s wrong he said he was bothered I didn’t watch his recommendation. I told him now that we are quarantined I’ll have plenty of time to watch it. He tried to explain to me his anxiety but it pretty much came across as “I wish you’d watch my show right now because it makes me sad that you’re not”. This REALLY upset me. I dated someone 2 years ago that had awful anxiety but it really took a toll on my own well-being. They’d insist I come over in the middle of the night if they were panicking, etc. I can’t help but compare these occurrences to my previous relationship, they are very similar problems. The difference now is that my SO is trying very hard to handle his anxiety. He’s seeing a psychologist and openly talks to me about his feelings. But every time this sort of thing happens it turns into a huge fight. Today I told him what happened really upset me because It made me feel like I had to police my (very normal and mundane) actions (like watching Netflix)  in order to alleviate his anxiety and assure him I love him. I told him I wish he’d be more upfront with me about the anxiety rather than being under the table about it. In response he says he feels like he can’t share his feeling because I’ll be upset.

They show it in a different way, they start swearing and yelling an excessive amount while joking about it. A bit unusual in my opinion, but that’s just how they are. My mom continued yelling while my brothers started throwing things. They weren’t throwing anything fragile, just plastic bottles and things. It was making lots of noise though. I started breaking down, and my mother shot at me saying that THIS is why she never tells me anything, because I take it too personal. Prior to this, she wasn’t throwing any animosity my way. I wasn’t crying because I was getting yelled at. Nothing was directed at me. So why did I start breaking down?  They told me I was being a child, and that I might as well get used to yelling.

60,"Is it possible to completely overcome an addiction or a compulsive disorder in just a matter of seconds by experiencing a sudden emotional catharsis, without relapses or even feeling withdrawal symptoms afterwards?

I ask this question motivated by two conversion testimonies which I haven't been able to wrap my head around. I just lack the psychological expertise to provide a satisfactory explanation for them, and so I believe they will be interesting case studies to analyze here.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Testimony 1**: [From Atheist To Believer In Jesus Christ - How Jesus Cured My Eating Disorder - Christian Testimony](https://youtu.be/hyHAFvPn-ik?t=948)

This testimony has many details, but I want to focus here on the eating disorder aspect of it (from 15:47 to 23:34), and the experience this girl had that made her free in a matter of seconds. This girl had been suffering from bulimia and anorexia for 4 years and had not been able to defeat her eating disorders no matter how hard she had tried. According to her testimony, in December of 2017 she was in the bathroom throwing up in the bathtub, and while she was doing this she felt very impotent and hopeless, which made her enter into a state of despair. In this state she says she cried out in her mind the word ""Jesus"" and immediately, in a matter of seconds, a feeling of immense love and peace came over her, her sadness was gone, but most astonishingly, her 4 year bondage to bulimia and anorexia was immediately gone. According to her testimony, this experience happened 2 years prior to the recording of the video, and ever since she has never relapsed or even had the desire to.

She spends quite a while in the video describing her bathroom experience and uses an interesting analogy: she says she has a 5 year old son for whom she feels a deep maternal love, specially when they hug each other. Then she proceeds to say that the feeling of love that came over here in the bathroom surpassed that.

I find this testimony impressive. There are 2 aspects about this testimony which intrigue me a lot:

* She experiences an emotional transition from deep despair to immense peace and love in just seconds. How is this possible?
* Not only that, but also as a result of this experience she was completely healed from bulimia and anorexia (despite suffering these eating disorders for 4 years straight and numerous failed attempts to stop them up to that point).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Testimony 2**: [MY TESTIMONY: JESUS SAVED ME FROM DEMONS, ATHEISM, SEVERE DEPRESSION &amp; MORE!!](https://youtu.be/4ZFhNIKjYPw?t=1657)

This testimony describes a somewhat similar experience to the first one. In short: a woman tells that for decades she used to deal with severe depression, strong anger and hatred issues, porn addiction, stealing addiction (compulsive stealing). She also used to be a lesbian, and for many years experienced sleep paralysis at night and felt ""evil presences"" during these episodes. According to her testimony, one night she had a very intense ""attack"" during a sleep paralysis. In similar fashion to the previous testimony, she cried out ""Jesus save me"" a couple times, she broke down emotionally and cried for 1 hour, and afterwards she began to experience a sudden deliverance from all her addictions and mental health issues, without ever relapsing again. This experience is described from 27:37 to 33:41 in the video. But there is more. In [42:41](https://youtu.be/4ZFhNIKjYPw?t=2561) she tells that she changed so dramatically that she didn't even realize but after 3 months that her attraction to women was also gone, she was not a lesbian anymore.

I find this testimony incredible. She had an intense sleep paralysis ""attack"", then she cried for 1 hour and afterwards all her addictions and mental health issues and even her attraction to women were completely gone. I just don't understand what the heck is going on here.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So, I'm really intrigued to know a psychological explanation for these kinds of testimonies. I imagine that if we could learn how to tap into the power of our minds to suddenly turn our emotions into peace and love (like in the first testimony) or experience a strong emotional catharsis (like in the second testimony) to free ourselves from years of addictions and unhealthy compulsive disorders in a matter of seconds, that would just revolutionize therapy and addiction recovery programs.

So, what is really going on psychologically in these testimonies? Do these experiences have a name? How is it possible for a person to suddenly be free from years of addiction or compulsive habits or mental health issues in a matter of seconds, without therapy? Whatever is going on behind the scenes, can we tap into this to enhance addiction recovery programs?

I don’t know who I am and I know I’d be better off if I had just been born someone else because there is nobody around me that is completely similar to me and it’s really hard for me to be able to be friends with people. I’ve had the same group of friends since the seventh grade and I know they all have their own issues, but I feel like (in the LEAST self-boosting way ever) I am different from them? Even on quizzes online that are like “Which are you most like” the highest I get is ~80%. I don’t know how to act like a normal person I don’t know how to be a person because my overly active brain just controls me completely. I feel like anything could happen at any moment, like my brain is on edge but my body doesn’t care enough to do anything about it and too tired to move. Sorry about all this. I wish I had a parental like figure that could guide me through all this, I’m just a teenager. I don’t know what to do I don’t know how to block it out",31Mar2020,1
65,"I’m deeply in debt and ignoring payments, I have nothing to do because of the pandemic so I’m alone with my thoughts, and I’m desperately holding on to a relationship I’m nearly certain will end.

My debt is due to idiotic spending on credit cards and being careless with money in general and I feel like that will work itself out eventually. Maybe not idk fuck it

None of my friends are in town during the pandemic so I’m trapped at home trying to stay occupied without video games even though I hate video games and I’m bored of TV so I sit alone with my thoughts and feel useless and designed to fail.

My girlfriend of 4 months told me she needed a break (we all know how this typically ends) and she started seeing another guy and I’ve seen other girls but I’m not interested in anyone but her. She’s only ever dated me and needs to get out and experience life which I understand and I’ve done well the past 2 months but now it’s hitting me I’m so close to a mental meltdown.  I get so angry I want to break shit and hurt myself and just freak out until I have a fucking brain aneurism. I want her back bad and she still loves me and we live together still and I don’t want to be alone.

I can’t handle my life right now. Why the fuck am I like this.",31Mar2020,1

I wanna explode and no matter what my mood I'm incredibly hypersexual, even though I don't get much out of masturbation. I don't really like it and in the past it caused me to dissociate. It really exhausting dealing with all this emotional (and non-emotional) intensity.",31Mar2020,1
67,"i don't pretend that people on this subreddit can diagnose me or anything  but i need to talk about this, at least i can feel better, i have been dreading going to a psychiatrist because i feel too embarrassed to do that and also because i didn't really feel the need to do that (i will explain why), besides in my family we don't really do that, i feel like i would be making a big deal out of whatever i have if i do that, my family is  the kind of family that will blame you for spending money on going to a psychiatrist instead of dealing with your stupid mental issue, especially my dad , Okay here we go i will try to explain what is it that i have even though it's a little embarrassing for me to explain that, ever since i was a kid i always felt like i wasn't very normal, i wasn't like the other kids, for instance even though i was very active and always misbehaving, i was at the same time extremely shy but fortunately being a kid helped a lot because when you're a kid you're not really that self-aware you're just busy being a kid you know ? therefore the mental issue that i have ( i don't even know if it's a mental issue) didn't really manifest itself although at times i remember acting very weirdly and my twin brother would notice and he would make fun of me because we were kids, like for example i remember this time when i pretended (or really thought) that i liked watching the news and i was maybe 9 or 10 i would pretend to be concentrated on that maybe because i thought that was cool, but the issue wouldn't end there i would make that my personality i remember thinking like this ''yeah that's cool, watching the news is cool i would be that now'' and i would make that my personality, now i know what you think, kids do that, kids act like that, its a way of developing a personality, i know, but that for me (i think) is when it all started, now as i've mentioned before  being a kid prevented the issue that i have from manifesting itself too much in my childhood, Now coming to my teenager years i dont really remember all of that  but i remember it being more intense and this is where i think i can explain the issue a little bit clearer, what i remember from this is practically having no personality at all, like my personality would build itself on whatever i have around me, and this would be more intense because i literally can't think or use my brain unless i have an object with that i keep with me or that im using, with that object i can think, i can be intelligent, i can live a normal life, i can have friends, i can be social and everything, like for example i would have a little rock in my hand that needs be held  in a certain way for it to work, or for example if not a rock i would have a cover of a pen this time held in different way (oh my gosh i feel so embarrassed) there were times when i didn't need an object i would just use my hand to hold things in a specific way then it would work, i would have a personality i would be intelligent, i would be social, however there were also times when one of these ''tools'' didn't work and i would be mad at myself so i would try to switch between these tools when they didn't work, like my depression or sadness isn't caused by normal things like in the case of my friends or the people that i know, normal people, it's caused by the fact that one of these tools didn't work so i needed to switch that with another one or create a new tool, usually when one of these tools doesn't work i would stay in like a state of pause or standby, no personality no nothing, and i stay like that for hours just thinking about a new tool that i can use, also in these teenage years i wasn't really self aware of this issue so i never thought about asking for help or asking if someone has the same feeling, maybe sometimes i would wonder, especially when i was in those standby stages and in my late teens if others have the same thing, if others used object like and depended on them to create their personality and be normal. In recent years however as i was exiting my teenager years something would change in my mental issue, maybe because of normal physiological growth that i didn't have control over or maturity  i don't know, but it was something that caused it to change, also i was becoming very self-aware of it, something that also i didn't have control over is this change, it went from using and relying on objects to create my personality and be normal, hence something concrete to something abstract, it also became very very complex and very strong something that i can't live with, like for example remember when i told you sometimes i use my hands in a specific way and that becomes my tool right ? now i don't have to use that anymore because it has become in my head ( this is extremely hard to explain not to mention embarrassing), like i just have to picture myself touching that object in a specific way and it works, that would create a personality for me, make me intelligent etc.., there's plenty of other abstract tools that i have created that for some reason- maybe because i have have matured or something - take the form of aspects that are present in normal people like for example a behavior reflecting a very low self esteem and lack of confidence, like me pretending to be someone else more confident, more popular, charismatic, a celebrity for example, i would study the person i wanted to pretend to be for hours, picture his body in my head, try to remember it and then i would pretend i'm him, there's other ''tools'' that i've used that resemble that, anyways you got the idea of the abstract ''tools'' that have ''replaced'' the others i dont have to mentions them all, now as this issue changed drastically i also changed, i was becoming very self aware of this issue and this would manifest especially when one of these ''tools'' wouldn't work and i would have my usual stage of standby but i would also become extremely depressed and i would think to m self ''why am i not normal, why am i not like the others, i know for sure that the others don't have this issue'', i first had these thoughts when i was in my freshman year of college, at that time i was pretty confident  i was the only with that mental issue, when i went to college overseas this mental issue became very intense, at that time i was very exited to go study abroad in a country that i love, also i wanted to make a lot of cool friends, but i also knew i was very shy and not sociable, so i needed a strong tool that would allow me to make friends and be intelligent and social, i decided to use the one that i was used multiple times- that was the least one that has failed me- i used the tool in which i pretended to be someone else, someone very cool and social who wore hype clothes and was very handsome, Unfortunately although this tool has proven to be very effective at the beginning as i was really making friends and being cool, at the end it has failed me, there was something about Italian people maybe the confidence, the spontaneity the social skills that they had, that has caused my tool to fail, how u may ask (or may not), i couldnt pretend anymore, it worked with my the people that i know back in my country but i doesn't work with them, it ended up with me acting very weird therefore i would be very self-aware of the issue that i have, also on the academic level it didnt work as well, (oh my gosh there's so much to say) simply because i couldn't use my brain when i was pretending to be someone else therefore i cant focus in class, i cant focus on two things at the same time, anyways when that ''tool'' has failed me, i became very very depressed, i finally acknowledged that i have something wrong with me, it wasn't good, it wasn't right, it was wrong, not normal, i remember i would get very very depressed for months, those two year in college were very decisive and important, for the first time in my life as i admitted to myself that there was something  that wasnt  normal with me i tried to abandon those ''tools'' i tried to live without them, i realized that i couldnt do it in a very painful and depressing way, the first time i let go of these tools was in the ending of the first year of college, from there my life went downhill, i wasn't doing very good at college, there was something about me becoming an adult and being responsible for my own life that made these tools that i so much depended on my whole life ineffective against the real problems of life outside the cocoon of the family, like academic life, university debt, social life, etc, but when i realized that i coudnt do anything, i would be depressed for months on end, i started drinking to then become an alcoholic, i abandoned University, i abandoned friends, everything, sometimes i would get back to using these because i would be tired of being depressed, but i would realize that the tools changed, the previous ones don't satisfy me anymore, they have become even more abstract than before, like for example i would read a book then i would pretend that my life is that book, or my life is a novel, recently it has become worse because these tools have become a mix of old and new, a mix of concrete and abstract tools, so i dont always use them, being alcoholic has helped me a lot, because when im drunk i dont to use them, i dont to think about them or even obsess about creating a good tool for me, in fact i love being drunk, hey listen i don't expext anyone to understand me i know im not making any freaking sense i just needed to get this out otherwise i would really find myself in a sick home, i just want help, i want to be normal",31Mar2020,1

My wife and I have hardly left our apartment for two weeks because of the lockdown. I’m not more depressed per say, but I feel forgotten. It feels like if I never came out of this apartment no one would even notice.

If you feel like I do, you are NOT forgotten. You STILL matter. Someone texted me that today and it made me feel much better, so I’m passing it on to you.

69,"I’m deleting this once I get enough insight from an outsider, I just felt like this was the most appropriate place to ask.

Without being too specific, since the beginning of the year I have been trying to heal from a situation that, though I don’t consider it traumatic at all (, it’s definitely taken a huge toll on my mental health and it was the last straw that sent me back into a depressive episode that had been creeping up on me for a few months prior to this.

Anyway, along the process of me healing from this, there have been certain situations that “trigger” me (for lack of a better term; I feel like it’s too strong a strong word for my situation but I digress), and make me spiral into an anxiety attack. There have been a lot of these, which have made it harder to move on from this. Just a few minutes ago, one of these “triggers” came about, but I feel nothing. In fact, if anything, I feel better; I had been on the verge of an anxiety attack all day long and this thing that just happened would have surely sent me into one, but nothing happened and I feel better than I felt all day, except maybe just a little lightheaded. Is it my brain just dissociating? I don’t know, I feel like I’m making this whole thing bigger than it actually is, but it feels odd to know that I’m not at all anxious right now.

I have experienced dissociation before, but it was after an actually traumatic situation; I felt almost thr same as I feel right now, but, again, I don’t consider *this* specific situation as traumatic, despite the bad effects it’s had on me.",31Mar2020,1
70,"So basically I was staying at my dad's house with his new kid and new concubine. The girl clearly doesn't like me and they've been trying to make up excuses for months for me to move out. I for one don't want to move out because that house is just a walking distance from my university, which I'm prioritizing. 
With the covid-19 quarantine, I needed to buy a few things so my mom picked me up. My dad and the girl became furious with me going out and used that as an excuse to pack up all my things (even my display items and spraypaints) and have me stay with my mom. 

My mom's house is really small (its basically just a room and three people can't even sleep at the same time) and I can't do my plates or schoolwork there. All my stuff is currently in my mom's car because it can't fit in the house. 

Now I'm trying to figure out a way to cope with the situation. Usually I paint or craft to destress (I'm a Fine Arts student) but since I can't paint here I really am just sucking it all up. I've had a really bad history of self-harm and since I can't even go out to get fresh air, I'm getting desperate. 

Thinking of where I'm going to stay next and probably having to get a part time job when I can barely handle schoolwork is daunting. We're not rich and I don't think my mom can afford having to pay rent. 

All of this stress in the midst of the covid pandemic is just depressing.",31Mar2020,1
71,"I have a huge insecurity about not being smart enough and just an hour ago two friends were picking at that jokingly. This triggered me, badly. The moment I expressed that this was triggering me and that I was crying because of them they immediately said things like “Oh, [My name] you always turn a good situation into a bad one.” Eventually this situation got worse (I’d rather not say how) and I was giving hints to me wanting to hurt/kill myself. They weren’t catching on so I outright said that what they were saying made me want to kill myself. Them two and me all have mental health problems so they start saying “this doesn’t only affect you!” Even though they said that they still didn’t think that understanding my side was a good thing to do. They begin being very petty and currently I’m near the edge. I know this seems like a toxic relationship but I haven’t left them because when we aren’t mad we’re great friends and they have actually helped me through a lot. The last message I sent to them was “Bye y’all. Have a nice life without me.”
I’m slightly better now but I want to self harm, I’m nearly 2 years clean (yay) and I know it would be the bad choice. I was and still kind of am considering suicide but that’d be worse than self harm. At this point the only thing I can think of is to scare them; the only way I can think of making it so I don’t self harm or commit suicide it to make them think I’ve killed myself. I know this is a horrible thing to do and I should not be justifying it but it’s the only way I’ve thought of. I need help deciding what to do. I don’t want to talk to them, I shouldn’t self harm, and the only way I’ve thought of to make me feel better is to scare them into thinking I’ve killed myself.

72,"Hey, I just have to write this down and ""say it out loud"" 

Recently I've been struggling AF. 

I have an SO of 6 years whom I love. She's been struggling to with diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety since 3 years back. She's been able to get through an education and 1 year ago landed a entry-level job at 70% salary, 70% of an already laughable salary.. 

It's nice to finally have one more person to help pay the bills but it's just not enough. I'm still on my knees trying to get money left over each month. I'm soon 30 years old and I cannot see that we'll be able to purchase our own apartment any time soon. 

She's been talking about kids for a while now and I simply just cannot fathom how I'm supposed to break it to her that I cannot see a future where we have children. I'm not sure she'll make it, what happens if she gets one of her episodes when I'm away working? Where would we get the money to support a child? 

I wouldn't change a thing if I could go back 6 years to the day we met. It just feels like we haven't gotten anywhere in s.i.x years. 

I got her 2 pets to ease her mind when I'm not at home. 1 died recently so we had to get another. The newest one is a demon which goes wild at night so now I'm sleep deprived, as I'm writing this I got 3h hours of sleep last night. She gets to sleep in since she works afternoons and evenings. I don't know how I can say to her that I want the pets gone, they ruin our furnitures and simple perform sleep torture on me. 

To this she asks if I would be the same against a baby: that this is good training for it. Whenever she says stuff like this I just feel dead inside and my heart breaks. I'm afraid that she mistakes the thought of a baby with a cure to her depression.

I recently changed career to get an increase in salary but I loathe it, but I've been taught my whole life to get up at 6, go to work, shut up, get paid, pay the bills. Rince and repeat. 


All of this causes my to lose hope of the future. We're so far behind that I'm not even sure we'll have it better in 10 years. I see my life slipping away, I'm just walking around like a zombie trying to make it, I've trained on faking a smile good enough that my workplace says I'm a great co-worker that brings a smile to the force each day but in truth I sit in my car each morning and each evening crying my eyes out because I see no possible way out of this. 

Whatever I do I'll make my SO crash, hard. And I'm honestly not sure if my own mental health could handle such a crash. I'm hardly holding it together as is. 

I'm chasing a dopamine rush wherever I can, be it so through alcohol, nicotine, spending money, going to the gym. 

No help are to be found during these times of corona and social distancing. Yes, I've contacted several psychologists and what not. 


If you made it this far, thank you. If just one person reads this I'm glad. 

Take care, each and everyone of you have my love.

76,"Posted over in r/askatherapist also.

Admitting these things publicly is hard. I'm trying to be a better person. Please help. I am a 36 YOF EMT working 50 to 60 hours a week during a pandemic with little off time. I'm also (a)... 

Pathological Liar; to make self look better, to get away with stuff, to fit in, to manipulate a person or situation, not always to own benefit though sometimes to help people. Excellent lying skills, proven by the stuff done without getting caught. It sounds r/iamverybadass but it's not a good thing. Useful skill but not good. I'm ashamed of it. 

Manipulative; able to control people, do so without thinking sometimes, not always for selfish reasons though also to help people. Not typically done in a cruel way, if done right they wouldn't know. Wouldn't want to hurt people. Ironically hurting them without them knowing I guess, by being manipulative. Ashamed. 

Actress; nobody sees true self. Great concern about what people think in order to maintain facade. Fake personality, fake interests sometimes. I change depending on who I'm around. 

Confused about Self; not sure of Identity, maybe from all the pretending. Feels like a mishmash of traits learned from other people not my own person. 

Antisocial; doesn't like rules, doesn't follow many of them, strong mistrust of authority. Doesn't like most people, dislikes societal norms, annoyed with social expectations. Has broken some serious laws (major drug laws/theft) in past and continues to break some laws (drugs/driving laws/other minor stuff). Never caught. Has not physically hurt a person or animal. 

Uncomfortable with Intimacy; emotional intimacy is difficult/awkward and nearly impossible but I do experience it with partners and after that I'm afraid they'll use it against me somehow. Because some have. A lot of the time I fake intimacy because the real intimacy makes me feel too vulnerable. I hate it. 

Sex Issues; faked every orgasm for 20 years, difficulty with orgasming via partners, gave up trying because it took so long and became so frustrating. So now sex is a show put on for the partner, playing a part like a performer depending on what the partner likes. All while legitimately caring about the partner and wanting to please them. Eye contact during sex is incredibly uncomfortable. Difficulties made worse by years of SSRIs. This is really sad isn't it...I'm starting to cry now. I don't think I'll ever be able to truly enjoy sex for myself. It's always about doing a good job for them. 

Charasmatic; able to socialize and fit in with any social group but it's a mask. Seemingly outgoing, friendly, funny, energetic, bubbly, but finds it to be exhausting if done for too long. Everyone thinks I'm awesome... I'm not. In social settings it's like I hear myself talk and I think ""how am I being so cool right now"" and I wonder who is this person! How am I being charming? People are paying attention to me and I'm making them laugh? It's like a switch flips on and suddenly I'm likeable. But I'm not really likeable. I'm easily dislikable as you are finding out.

Analyzer; quickly able to figure people out and what makes them tick, figure out their issues, weirdly good at diagnosing psychological issues, but needs perspective to do so for self, clearly. Always good at helping people with advice and their problems. Mostly able to do this in order to manipulate. But helps me relate to psych patients at work, I love making them feel better. 

Empathy; has a great deal of empathy for animals and children, less so for adult humans but not to a sociopathic degree. Tries to help people. Tries to make people feel good. Tries to make a difference in people's lives, make their lives better. Feels real pain for people's suffering. At least I'm not a sociopath, I know that for sure. 

Guilt; feels a great deal of guilt over past failures, past mistakes, past behaviors that hurt people who didn't deserve it. Guilt for current behavior too. Lots of guilt. Lots and lots of guilt, I'm drowning in it and I just keep piling it on with new terrible behaviors. 

Morally Gray; murder can sometimes be justified, means to an end thinker, rules can be broken, would kill a baby to save thousands type of person. Currently sleeping with a married man who has two small children and somehow I don't feel guilty enough to stop. I never in my life thought I'd do something like this. I broke a cardinal rule for this guy and somehow I'm cool with it. Sometimes very moral; anti corruption, anti pollution, anti oppression amongst other things. But lots of gray. I like gray. 

Risk Taker/Impulsive; 95+ speeding, treating stoplights like stop signs, does some drugs like weed and uses black market Adderall for weight loss. Risky sex sometimes but that's unusual. A little bit promiscuous at times but not too bad, 14 partners total at age 36. Irresponsible with finances sometimes. But not always.

Binger; Binges on things until they get boring; food, video games, shows, shopping, hobbies, and even people. When interested in something, will crack out on it like crazy and then suddenly drop it/them. Well with people I just don't hang out with them as much, I'm not a total peice of crap. 

Love/Relationships; has had several long term relationships ranging from 2 to 7 years long. Also some one night stands. Does feel love and cares deeply about partners. Some abusive relationships. Doesn't actually want to hurt partners, but clearly has control and trust issues. 

Depressed; failure to see the point of life. Trying to enjoy life but it's hard. Mostly dark with little flashes of light. Bouncing from one tiny flash to the other barely hanging on in between. High functioning thanks to Paxil. No suicidal ideation but still not happy. Clearly. 

Example of recent terrible behavior:
1) Creating a fake ""problem"" in order to make partner feel like I need his help. He enjoys saving the day and feeling needed, lots of people do, men in particular. He hasn't felt needed in a long time and I feel like it brings him some confidence and some happiness. I like making him feel good and this is one messed up way of doing it. I thank him for helping me, I tell him I appreciate him so much, and that I love him. Which is all true, but the problem never existed. Does this lie benefit me? I don't know, maybe. I know it's messed up and it's a behavior I've done my whole life. But the intention isn't about me. I just invented a reason to appreciate him and make him feel good. Why did I need to invent it? Why am I like this? I'm pretending to need his help and I don't, I just want him to think I do? Why! 

2) I created a fake ""situation"" to see how he would react to it, to see how he feels about me. He reacted in a way that shows me he cares about me a lot. Because apparently I don't believe men when they say ""I care about you"". Which is sad. However my stupid crap caused him some stress and now I feel guilty about it. But now I know he cares, and I won't do it again. Of course I never should have done it in the first place. I'm so stupid. I hate myself for this. It's pathetic and wrong. I am so sorry for it. I just feel like I don't deserve anyone because of this thing I do. 

3) Well I'm still faking orgasms and man I am great at it, I've got the twitching, the breathing, the noises down perfect. My partner says he feels like a superhero for being so good in bed. It makes me happy knowing that I can make him feel that way, to give him such confidence that makes him feel sexy and awesome... but then I turn over and try to stop myself from crying. Not because I feel sorry for myself, but because I'm lying to him and if he found out, he would be devastated and it would hurt him so much. The guilt I feel over this is crushing. But I know, 100 percent, if I tried to actually have a real orgasm with him, it wouldn't happen. I've tried to fix this for over 15 years and I've given up. And it makes me so miserable, because I don't think anyone would want to be with a girl who can't have orgasms. So I fake it. Every time. Last night even. I'm sobbing right now. 

What is wrong with me? Is this a personality disorder? BPD? NPD? I'm not a sociopath but I have the skill set of one, and I use it for both good and bad. For self and to help others. What even am I? Am I even human because my behavior seems too inhumane to be. I feel like an imposter of the human race just trying to fit in. I'm always pretending. I'm so tired. I'm just exhausted. 

My new relationship has made me want to be a better person. I want to stop lying and pulling strings. I want to stop pretending. I've been doing it so long I don't know how to stop. Do I need therapy? Absolutely. Do I have time for it with work and COVID going around? No. Everyone tells me I'm so brave because of my job and how I'm so amazing for saving lives or whatever... I want to tell them I'm a coward. The worst kind of coward. I'm not an evil person and I'm not good either, I'm a dark shade of gray and I don't like it. 

Please tell me what is wrong with me. I need your help with a diagnosis. I can at least read and learn and try to work on it myself until COVID is over.",31Mar2020,1

About four or five years ago I was diagnosed with social anxiety, which made sense. I try to do everything right for people, don't want to hurt them in any way, and am very afraid of what people think of me and how I act.

Then three weeks ago I was diagnosed with ADD. I came with the idea myself because I kept on getting distracted during homework and kept almost falling asleep in class. 


Backstory that you don't have to read but it kind of explains why I'm here:

My two best friends (they don't know eachother because one I met at work and one at school) both have ADD, which I found funny because what are the odds? They also both are on the autism spectrum, and my schoolfriend has social anxiety like me.
And so at one moment we were talking about my diagnosis of ADD, and I mentioned how funny it was that both my friends have ADD and are on the autism spectrum, because out of all the people in the world I chose these two. And she's been reading a lot of autism books because she only recently got diagnosed, so that's why we talked about autism.
And she was like ""... Is it?😁""

And then she explained that I was one of the few people who understood her, like all the struggles and stuff, and my workbestfriend said this too a few months ago (""I love how we can just be quiet and read fanfics by ourselves and it's not weird or anything"")

And then she said (very carefully, she wasn't in anyway trying to convince me I had autism, but she just wanted me to be aware it might be) that it wouldn't surprise her if I did have autism. 
I asked why.
She said the following things:

 - You're, just like me, not very stereotypical. What she meant by this was that we don't really fit into the groups of other people at school. We're kind of differeny maybe? I mentioned my ADD diagnoser said in the report that I made an immature impression and that I felt like a kid compared to other people my age and she showed me the exact thing that her diagnoser said, which was basically the same.
Everyone is moving out, getting in relationships, starting careers, and I'm just here, always covered in a blanket, and not planning on moving out any time soon because I'll miss my family too much and I don't want a new home because I've never moved before.

- You're gay. And apperently many people on the sprectrum are part of the lgbt community.

-You understand me. Which is apperently hard for a lot of other people except her boyfriend, who also isn't very stereotypical.

-You have social issues. As in, I always misunderstand things and am awkward around people all the time, never sure what I'm supposed to do.

-You're maybe asexual. (Maybe, because I'm not sure). I feel very awkward talking about those kind of things, and I'd rather be thinking about holding hands with someone than doing... that.

-I have specific interests. In my case, gay people, cute people, just people basically. When I discover someone who makes cool artsy things and who also turns out to be incredibly sweet and kind, I will get obsessed with them and think about them a lot. I will look up fanfiction if they're a character from a movie or series, I will look up youtube clips of them if they're real people, I will read all their interviews, look up cute photos of them, even if I don't have a crush on them. I just like them and like their positivity.

-My other diagnoser who asked questions about my history, said I should keep in mind thay it might also be autism instead of ADD, but the the other diagnoser later shut that down because instead of not caring about people I cared too much. But according to my friend that's just one of the stereotypical symptoms and doesn't have to be true for everybody.


I'm kind of hesitating whether I should get diagnosed though because most of the time when I do those online tests, they show a negative result. And I know that often those tests suck, but I just don't know where else to look.

-I care about people and always want to make sure they're okay

-I can look people in the eye very easily unless they're super intimidating (or very tall. I'm short), I say hi to everyone I meet on the street (which is kind of common here, but apperently not in many other countries), I

-I don't mind change that much (I don't like it but I won't have a meltdown unless it's something big). I even went to London (from the Netherlands) by myself to see a musical that was about to end, I booked it maybe two days before so very last minute, I'd never travelled alone, so like... I can handle some change and new things.

-I like a lot of foods and always want to try everything (I figure if it's not nice, the taste will be gone in no longer than five minutes. And if it is nice, then I've found something else that I love to eat).

-I'm very sympathetic. I once teared up because someone selling toys on the street couldn't sell anything and looked utterly devastated when kids where trying out the toys but everyone just put it back and walked away


So there's that. Any advice? Should I get an official diagnose or does this not sound like someone on the autism spectrum?",31Mar2020,1

2. Even though some young people are dying, the chances of dying if you are healthy and below 50 are still relatively low? Obviously no one wants to get it, but if you're under 50 and get it the odds are still pretty good for you correct?

They say it looks cool or they like it, but when I walk away my mind says, they didn't like it, it's horrible, they only said that so you would be happy. No matter how hard I try my mind kills most of the drawings I have, and I try to get better, but I look at other artists that are better, I strive to be like them, but in the back of my mind I think, 'I'll never reach that high,' I don't think that I have anxiety or depression or any others, but I want validation from other people, people that don't see the mistakes that my mind picks out, it's like I have to have someone say that a drawing is cool for me to even be able to think it's cool.

84,"I'm (26f) autistic and schizophrenic. I was once involuntarily detained in a high security mental ward and strongly medicated for two weeks. It was not rehabilitative for me and I spent a year bedridden at my parent's upon discharge, and two years building up my abilities gradually before I, against all odds, bounced back, and was able to move out, and become a functioning member of society again. 

All without the use of medications, aside for that which was forced on me in the ward, which had adverse affects. I was cooperative with western medicine, and am still convinced that I require a strong western medical form of support for my conditions, but the detainment fucked me up so incredibly badly, that I have resisted the long trek of seeking proper treatment again, and I now have fallen through the cracks.

I managed 4 years without psychoses, and 2 years of being a functioning adult again before alas, this pandemic hit.

My partner (first friend and companion in 5 years), who, although I have been with him 1 year, does not know about my conditions in depth, just broke up with me, and now I am forced into absolutely zero human interaction for the remainder of the self isolation period. I have no supports in the form of friends, family, medication, and therapy, and the emotional pressures became too much for my partner to continue seeing me.

I almost always feel like the feeling of wanting to listen to my favourite song but I cant because its part of a score and I f*cking hate scores at that point In time. My head feels heavy often too, and I dissociate a lot due to my mind perceiving the shiz from my childhood as trauma. The worst part is just not knowing. I cant remember it. My parents do that toxic parent convo with me I'll feel sad because of it but then not even remember what was said. I hate that because the second I get to see the school psychologist I cant tell her the full picture due to not remembering anything but the emotions behind it. I have such a lack of emotional support without quarantine that my mind has reoccurring dream characters that I'm closer with then my own friends and family. I just feel so worthless and like now would be the right time to die, and at the same time like death is not an option and that I would not let myself do it. I am just so confused... I just wanna feel ok. how do I feel ok? someone please tell me the secret to happiness because right now I just wanna close my eyes and sleep till this shiz ends. till I wake up in a place with big emerald towers and where monkeys and pigs can fly. where your worst enemy is someone who is severely allergic to water. like... really allergic to water... where I can be with my friends and they dont ignore me or hate me or think I'm annoying.

He abandoned us and later in life when I would eventually visit him he would beat me ( I was 8, he left when I was 4 and would fight with mom many times before that ). It’s present day and I have just recently discovered/learned of D.I.D. Or dissociative personality disorder. Otherwise known as multiple personality disorder. I’ve made connections with my life and the way I act/ cope with things and how they could be symptoms of D.I.D. And it’s terrifying. Since the past year I’ve created what I believed to be an imaginary friend. I had a vague idea of an him but never actually put him and the way he was set in stone if that makes sense. I knew that having an imaginary friend was normal for people so I didn’t think anything of it. But I’m worried mine isn’t just a figment of my imagination but a separate consciousness. He looks just like me and has the same haircut, he essentially is me just a lot more fun, laid back, and funny kind of guy. Happy go lucky ya know? He basically is who I am around my friends or anyone who I’m being friendly with. Sometimes I even have conversations with him in my head as he walks around the room or environment. Sometimes I imagine him next to me for example on a walk or something for example. I’ve recently given him the name “Allan”. Anyways, I thought this wasn’t anything weird until like I said I have discovered that it well.. might be. Now that I’ve been thinking about it I have a horrible memory sometimes and my friends have in the past blatantly said that I was in denial when I said I did not remember certain things. And I literally cannot remember anything I did the day before or even some things I did earlier today. This is very frequent. I will even forget that I even did homework the night before and just not turn it in. I also have a “friend” who essentially embodies my anger, which used to be a big problem in the past for me. The bottom line is I am worried that I might have some sort of personality disorder seeing as I might have the relating symptoms as I just described above.

102,"Hello

This is probably going to be a long one. I think i need to start to talk about my experiences in life and maybe i can get some advice to as to what i feel and how to make choices. 

To start i am dyslectic,not native English speaker and my tears are making it hard to see the keyboard and screen. Sorry for this

I am a 25 year old male.

I have also been to therapy for many years, but i no longer qualify to speak to a therapist.

I feel like i have to start with my childhood. I were physically and mentally abused from i was 5 till i became about 11. I was beaten and abused by my older brother(who had again by his because he had been to war and had BIG problems after that). And no, before you say, throwing your little brother down the stairs (yes throwing) is not ""older brother sibling dissagreements"". I have had my sholders damaged for life when he forcefully bendt them so my tendons stretched too far. Its not a big of a problem, just my shoulders hurt from doing certan movements and such. And the mental abuse was worse. So much worse. I tried telling my parents when i were 6 and they grounded me for telling lies, even tho i had the bruses to confirm my story. The smile he had behind my parents back when what he had said (when mentally abusing me) happend broke me. My parents from then started decreasing the time they were with me, and gave it all to my brother. I didnt have anyone there for me at sports events. Even tho i did wery well at them. I had scouts from people equal to my state, and even had my national team interested in comming to one of my games. But i got prolapses and my doctor said i were not allowed to play anymore(i was 15). So now the only thing keeping me up was now ripped from me. The school was equally as bad. I was bullied. I had older guys comming to beat me up. The people changed but there were allways about 2-4 at the same time beating the living shit out of me. What broke me mentally about that was the teachers seeing it, and turning around, ignoring me. I lived like this till the 7th grade when i got my first friend that had my back. I had grown alot and were one of the biggest guys in school. ( we unfortunatly are not friends anymore because of me. And i plan to one day apologice to him when i meet him)

I started from then living life a little easier. The abuse in both places stopped, and life seemed to be going well. 

Before i continue i need to tell you how my skitzofrenia i unknowingly had works. Everyone who has it, has it different. Mine is a big problem. The voices to go kill myself, telling me i am not worth anything, noone would care if i died were the least of my problems. The problems were my visual hallusinations. There were no transition to when i got them. I didnt see a lepricon in the corner, for me it was complete 100% hallusinations. It would feel like the real world, sound, touch, taste, pain, everything was there, but time was relevant(you will get it 2 lines down). But it was not my world (if you have seen like Sword art online, kinda like going into a world like they do, exept not putting on a helmet, no transition and the world was the same as real life). And my visions was bad. I saw things i can only compare to SAW and HOSTEL.

 My 10th worst vision was i was talking to my mother and drinking some tea(i really was). I felt weird and became sleepy, looked up and saw the creepiest most evil smile on my mother, and blacked out. i woke up tied to a bench similar to the torture stretching device. Over the next couple of days i was tortured by my own family, while they enjoyed what they were doing. They cut into me, drilled into me, broke my bones, was partially flayed, eaten, mutilated, and much much more.  And i felt everything, and i mean everything. I spendt 5 days like that before my mother (in the real word) noticed i were gone and shook me ""awake"". For her i was gone for like a sentence or 2, for me it was 5 whole days. And what was hard was, is this a new hallusination, or is this the real world. Because i have many times gone from one vision to another. And there were no actual way to difference them. 


When i got to school for ages 16-19 i noticed something was wrong. And when i was 17 i utterly broke down infront of my sister. I am not one to cry and show feelings, so when i did it was highly unusual. I told her i was seeing things that werent there and hearing voices that werent there, but still i heard them. She completely rejected me and told me i should be ashamed of myself, and that my seasonal depressed mother had it alot worse. 
Later that year i completely broke. My body and mind turned off, and i were like a walking corpse not able to do anything. That is when my parents decided they had o help. After 6 years of abuse, and unknown amont of time with skitzofrenia. For me it became the normal to have those voices and milder visions, so i cant know when they started. I am now 25. Therapists i have talked to before are not helping the issue. My skitzofrenia is gone. 


I dont know what or how i feel, and i am useless when it comes to making desitions for myself. I just got out of a relationship about 6 months ago and she  fluctuated between being decent and beeing mentally abusive of me. My self worth is equal to nothing. I get told i am very kind and get compliments that i am handsome ( not bragging, just trying to show how low i am) and have rated me a 9 or even sometimes a 10. But it only makes me uncomfortable from after the years and years with abuse, and i dont know what to do with it. So i just fake a smile and thank them. 

I have met this girl, and i am clueless as to what to do. I really like this girl but there are certan things keeping me back.

*I dont know if i am ready to be in another relationship with another person. Some part of me says i need to work on myself and start to love myself, before i can truely love another. 

* She has 3 kids and i dont know if i am ready for such an incredible amount of responsebility when i am broken myself. I have gotten better theese last 4 months, but dont know if i am well enough. I have met them and i have become to care for them too. And she says i am really good with them

* She is good for me. She has talked  me into taking up school and become an engeneer like i have allways dreamed of. She has dreams of becomming a nurse, and has started school, so she can go to nursing school. 

* The same time i feel like she is enough, i feel like something is missing..

I refuse to drag her along because ""what if somewhere down along the road"". That is a horrible thing to do to another person. But i feel like i love her, or do i love her because she has shown me basic kindness. Have actually done the things she says she is going to do. Tried to understand when i have talked (very little, but atleast some) of the things i have experienced, and not been dissmissive and uninterested. Has stopped me when im beeing stupid kind, so i wont get used. Makes me feel a little better about myself. 

I dont know if i love her for herself, or that she is showing me basic human kindness. Please help me.. I am lost",31Mar2020,1

(TRIGGER WARNING) i self harmed once when i was 13 or 14 by scratching the skin off my knuckles but other than that my forms of self harm were more about like under/over eating or self sabotaging relationships etc. last week i had a moment where i freaked the fuck out and decided that everybody hated me. i don’t have many friends and i only have one semi-close friend right now so feeling unloved/unwanted is a sore spot for me. i had a moment, it lasted a couple hours i think, it almost felt like i was high, and i completely unable to rationalise my emotions, decided everyone hated me and cut myself. i dont remember if i’ve experienced something like this before but it was very scary and i realised i can take myself to very dark places. also forgot to mention that i was absolutely set on killing myself by the age of 18 but as i said earlier i had finally started feeling better and thought things were going to be okay. i don’t know if i should add this but i think i’m going to cut myself again tonight. it feels good and i like seeing the marks on my body. lately i always tend to wake up during the afternoon and get high at night to be able to function. i just realised today that i think there is something wrong with me that i need to get help for. my parents are not people who i can confide about my mental health in as my mother refuses to believe shes mentally ill (she very much is) and turns to drinking as she thinks there’s something wrong with being medicated. i don’t have a relationship with my dad, to me he’s just a man who lives in my home. but i still live with them and they are the ones that would have to take me to the doctors/ pay therapy or treatment etc. i don’t think they would do this as my mother didn’t want to pay for my brother’s therapy either. i’m scared of the things i can or could do to myself and i think i should get help but i don’t know how. i also know a lot of people haven’t been able to see their therapists lately because of coronavirus so...do i just try to push through until it’s over? i’ve spent the past couple years thinking i could manifest better help or that if i couldn’t help myself no one else could. i’m realising this is not true and even if i get ridiculed by my mother is it probably worth it for the help i could receive. i just don’t know where to start?",31Mar2020,1

Im pretty sure im not her dream partner and in dating me, She lost opportunity to date someone better looking/just overall nicer. Its a bit hard to live with a visions of being dumped. 

My other ""friends"" are either people from school that dont give a shit about me but they would pretend I was someone only when I would kill myself, so yeah.

Those who i know from internet only chat with me once a week, probably because im a douchebag.

I am actually coming here though, because I began to watch things like criminal minds, forensic files in an attempt to expose myself to these things, but seeing how they identify these murderers. They all seem to follow a similar path. I began to question myself, and what is wrong with me. I am a sexual sadist, degrader, ith a death kink (knowing you have the power to kill someone or they have the power or kill you) I enjoy fighting, I am extremely charismatic, and have found myself lying and manipulating people to get my way. I have a large list of mental health issues from PTSD to paranoid personality disorder. I was physically and verbally abused as a child. All of these qualities and my lifes background well I think you get the point. I could never kill someone, but i am terrified of myself.

128," 

So I want to apologize in advance, I'm stressed out and tired and I suck at writing all of this down anyways but anyways to whats going on:

About 2 months ago my mother started acting really strange, just staring out of windows and commenting about how funny it is to see the cars passing by and during conversations she would just blank and forget what she was talking about.

Ever since then its been getting worse and worse, she is now hearing people talking about her from outside, every car that passes by the person is flipping her off, there is always a car accident up the street or a fire or something.. Of course I dont see or hear any of this.

Just within the last 2 weeks its gotten to the point where she runs outside and starts shouting at every car that passes to slow down, or shouting out the window at the neighbors. It was extremely bizarre one day because when she was talking to me about the neighbors I noticed that she was staring right through me, I waved my hand in front of her face and she didnt even react or flinch or anything. According to my brother she had a full conversation with me in the garage by herself today.

The cops were called on her a week ago and she was hospitalized but she got out a day later telling the doctor she is fine.

Whats strange is whenever a doctor or a police officer is talking to her she acts like she is normal and nothing is wrong

I just don't know what to do to help her at this point, she is refusing help. I tried to get her into multiple doctors and talk to her about it but she gets angry with me and just tells me to fuck off. I'm seriously worried for her that it may be some sort of brain tumor or dementia or something. Does anybody know what I should do to get her help? Is there anything I can do?",31Mar2020,1

133,"I'm posting this here as it has such complex mental health elements I'm not sure the normal relationship thread would be suitable. I hate that I'm posting at all but I'm questioning myself so much  I feel like I'm just running in circles.

So I've been with my husband 6 years now married 3. We were extremely open about our mental health problems from the get go. He has ptsd and is suspected to have some type of bipolar. I have cptsd, and depression. In the beginning that was fine we dealt with our problems together probably not using the healthiest coping methods but we got through it. We moved in together and things were still great. I'm not going to say there weren't challenges but we managed. Then 18mths in, we found out we were expecting. The pregnancy wasnt easy but we were still great, we were already planning on getting married so this was just good news. 

After the baby was born I had a lot of complications. I was in and out of hospital for nearly two years. This is were the issues started. During this time while I was sick my husband would sleep all day, leaving me to care for our child. Then during the summer he started getting super paranoid I any time I opened a window he shut it. Trying to keep the house cool was practically impossible. 

I mean we talked about all this and he would apologise and cry about how he hates not being around and sleeping all the time. After the birth of our second child he went and got help finally. Two years in and his episodes have been so much worse. I dread the summer coming. Last year, during an extreme episode I had to wrestle a knife from him as he was going to cut himself in front of the kids. I called the emergency team, I called his mother, i called his gp. No one would help me. After hours of juggling the kids and his paranoia his mother did appear only to say he'll be fine and leave. This particular incident set off my mental health issues so badly I was really struggling to keep things ""normal"" for the kids.

Now the summer is approaching. We're in lockdown and hes sleeping until 3/4/5 in the afternoon. I'm so god damn lonely and no one seems to understand. My family think I'm being dramatic. I have him what am I complaining about atleast he can help... yes he could but he doesn't. No matter how much he may protest that he does his bit. It's kinda hard to parent from your bed. I'm tired of doing everything and being told it's still not enough. I could be more supportive, I should have the house spotless, the dogs need x/y/z so do the kids. And god save me if things aren't as they should be. The house isnt clean enough when he gets up he will sit and tell me I'm not doing enough. I need to get on top of the house. So I do that and while my back is turned the kids are going wild. So I get grilled on why they were in the hall or in at a drawer. Well I dont have eyes on the back of my head! Dogs need walked fine I'll take them but who's watching the kids. Oh that's right his mother cause he wont watch them by himself. 

Like I know I'm complaining A LOT but I do genuinely love him. When hes good things are great but once his mental health goes it just affects every single part of our lives. I feel awful for being so annoyed. I truly do understand a lot of his issues cause most of the problems here but would I be cruel to say I'm done dealing with it? I'm done staying up for 3 days making sure he doesn't hurt himself while the kids are asleep. I'm done caring for the kids on no sleep and shot nerves. I'm done being triggered and having my own episodes, only to be left alone with the kids. Having a panic attack and flashbacks and disasosiating is all incredibly hard to deal with, then add two young kids who need to be cared for. 

Am I wrong for feeling so badly towards him?",31Mar2020,1

135,"I have been depressed for I think my whole life. I have always had existential thoughts, one of my first was in preschool. I hurt myself, and the teacher picks me up. In her arms feeling I thought ""What if she is a robot?"" then promptly concluded that then I would also have to be a robot and continued with my life. Now I am 18. I have been smoking a lot of weed. Or I was, I have calmed down a fair amount. I had an ego death from smoking a shit ton of weed at my college parking lot and having uncontrolled thoughts which triggered a panic attack. I kept thinking and thinking, and thinking. About what I could truly know, about what the purpose of life was, how do i find purpose? And then suddenly something snapped. I was not me. I was a human observing the world. Immediately this made my panic ten times worse. I spiraled. Basically lots of thoughts of whats the point? and some crazy shit like thinking we could be in this 3D plain with no idea of higher dimensions. I had a lot of suicidal thoughts during this and after. For a long time I have been searching for what truly matters, nothing physical seems to interest me, no activities and no joy to be had. All my thoughts were negative. Which lead to this one moment where I realized the true vast emptiness of the world and myself. Fast foward a couple weeks. I had been trying to grip with this crazy experience trying to understand it, constantly doubting my thoughts and coming to new ideas. Then i smoked again and let my brain loose. I realized many things about myself about my desires and how they are in-bodied in my ego. This has led me to many conclusions from things as simple as: I have to stop doing compulsive things like chewing many nails, to things like I need to start giving myself more acknowledgement for my actions. Finally, enlightment, Or Im not sure. I hate calling it enlightenment because that implies i have learned all that i can or some secret. It is the complete opposite, it is a way of thinking. A way of thinking that was brought on by necessity, If I did not find this path, I would not be alive. The first thing is you must acknowledge is you know nothing or at least very little. You must accept that true certainty is nearly impossible to obtain. Second, recognize youre emotions. Why do you feel the way you do? and youre desires, not only thinking about them but addressing them completely and wholely. Third You must learn to accept existence. Im not sure how to explain this yet. This the main one, it is with everything i have learned that i have come to this conclusion how must you accept it exactly? Hopefully from what ive said. My advice to anyone who is depressed: seek out philosophy and do not subscribe to one. You must find youre own truth, but learn from those that have already learned and pick what you believe to be true. 

My theory on this enlightenment is that I achieved this through the opposite means of most. Budha achieved his enlightment through structured thinking and meditation. I let the deep rooted issues in my subconscious mind run wild until they had resolved. My idea is, its almost like a circle achieving the same goal through different means. Almost like if you go far enough left on the political spectrum you end up right and vice versa. Any thoughts on this? I would like to say that my theory of enlightment is not that of spirituality I believe in no spirit, for i have no reason to. But I also have no reason to doubt I have a spirit, so the question lays unanswered. Everything I have said refers to simply understating yourself, reality, and the nature of finding happiness. If you feel that you do not get happyness from anything substantial, you must find it within yourself, by simply existing and that being enough. Im very interested to see where this goes as prior to this experience I believed I had a chemical imbalance in my brain, and very well still could, and just have been trying to make sense of manic non sense. But if it makes me feel good to feel empty and i always feel empty isnt that the main goal? I have read that ignorance is the source of mental anguish and yet it is always frequently described as ""bliss"". And I have to say ignorance is bliss, and the source of mental anguish. That which you cant understand causes uncertainty which causes mental anguish, that which you dont know cannot hurt you. Coming to the realizations of enlightment, has made me realize that, that is what depression is, trying to understand this reality without the proper tools to do so which results in anguish. Some live in bliss but i guess if this theory were to hold true, people with depression are simply just too aware, but have not found full awareness yet. You must pursue it. Dive into the unknown, and come back knowing you know less.",31Mar2020,1

That is, when a psychiatrist evaluates a  patient, and determines that the patient no longer has that mental illness, what is that called? Is it considered a diagnosis to essentially say that someone no longer has a mental illness or is it called something else? 

Second, what standards exist in professional bodies and diagnostic manuals, for psychiatrists and psychologists to determine that  someone no longer has a mental illness? Is there a general timeframe for symptoms to have not appeared before a ""diagnosis"" of ""no mental illness"" has occured? 

Any literature on the subject would also be helpful.",31Mar2020,1
140,"My name is Aaron (23M). I had a really really rough childhood. Full of physical, mental, and emotional abuse from my parents. Drug use running rampant amongst my family. Domestic abuse on the regular. If was very difficult. I also have a crippling disability on top of it all.

For years I had been extremely haunted and troubled by everything I had been through. Throughout all those years I had never once seen a psychiatrist or therapist. I was left alone to bottle up and compartmentalize my issues and traumas from my life. It weighed on me heavily every single day of my life. I was tortured and full of sorrow. 

It wasnt until August of 2019, when I was so close to giving up and no longer having hope, that I finally swallowed my pride and started to see a therapist and a psychiatrist. I was against it for years. I was put on Lexapro, and started seeing a therapist to talk semi- regularly. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD and GAD.

At first it was a hard adjustment and I was iffy about all of this working, but overtime my medicine started to work and taking to a therapist let me start to take the cork off the bottle and let some things out. I started feeling a gradual, but slow change in my mood, outlook and feelings.

Now it is April of 2020. Amidst all of the chaos going on in the world, I was sitting on my bed. Just casually eating lunch and watching a YouTube video, and I thought to myself ""I actually feel somewhat content. I feel okay. I feel fucking OKAY for once.""

Wasnt even anything major, it was just that small moment of for once in my awful life, feeling some sense of happiness and comfort, even if it was in a small activity, that felt so good to me.

I am finally starting to get to a point where I'm starting to feel HUMAN. Starting to feel joy and content, even with the brief and minuscule things. All those years of complete misery and darkness, thinking it will never get better. That my life was pain and that's all it would ever be. I finally feel a shred of what it means to be okay.

I'm not magically better, and I'm still coming to terms with my PTSD, but I am only going up from here. I refuse to let myself go backwards. My friends and family have all noticed an improvement in how I feel and act since starting the medication and therapy, but the change I feel within myself is insurmountable.

I just want to let anyone know who is struggling and losing hope like I once was, that it CAN get better. You've probably heard that 1000 times by now, and think it's bullshit just like I did, but if you hold on to even a bit of hope, things can and will get better.

Talk to a therapist, hell, talk to SOMEONE. Seek medication if you are okay with it, but dont let all of that bottled up trauma and sorrow turn to a poison that slowly kills you. 

You deserve better. You can be better.",31Mar2020,3

I am a 17 year old girl and i was diagnosed with GAD, OCD and Tourette’s . For as long as i know i sometimes had a lot of trouble going to sleep ( indeed sometimes it was because of my anxiety or intrusive thoughts ) but other times i just can’t get myself to do it, and if i do try to lay in bed and wait to fall asleep it’s just almost impossible, i’ve always found sleep so boring and i always wanted to do something else . I also have restless legs syndrome and i feel the urge to always move my legs. Just sitting there and looking at the ceiling while trying to fall asleep it’s so annoying and boring i just want to jump out of bed . I always imagine scenarios in my head and sometimes this gets me through but most of the time my mind won’t shut down . The thing is that i don’t feel anxiety behind this, i just feel agitation and restlessness, like the need to do something . It’s not that i’m going to bed too early either, it’s actually the other way, i can only force myself to go to bed at at least 4am and then it takes me like 2 hours or more to fall asleep .

together and at 2016 i believe my mother divorced my father due to not being able to handle him anymore)and i think there is no way to convince him to take any form of medicine to cure whatever he has.I assume he has schizophrenia or something like that as sometimes when he calls us(i have 2 brothers) he asks us if we can hear some voices that he hears and he told us that he talked to an insect and an alien,but for those two im not sure if he was joking or not because he is usually very playful and says stuff like that.I really love my father alot and i dont want to accept the fact that he will eventually become unable to understand and i want to make sure i can at least try to do something for him i really really love him and im tearing up alot writing this any suggestion will help alot thanks so much for listening really anything will help and i forgot to

It’s so tiring being in “the prime of my life” and not even having one experience to look back on of being invited to a party (not a kids birthday party because those invites were usually done by the parents) or invited to a group gathering and genuinely being wanted there

I try so hard to be a likeable person but many have suggested it’s just my Age (I’m a teenager). I also suffer from autism so my mind works completely differently from those around me so I’ve never really understood how people my age act so petty and selfishly. I try to do everything for my ‘friends’, I make them things, I bake them cookies, I’m always there if they need a shoulder to cry on but everyone in my life has just spat that in my face and acted so horribly towards me.
I had to even transfer schools due to bullying from rumours and lies started from my “friends”

It just hurts when you feel like no one even wants you alive.
I know that I might get a pm or something from someone, I appreciate that, but I don’t want to be online friends with anyone as it scares me quite a bit (due to past experiences and the fact I have no idea who I’m talking to)
I just want to be a normal teenager, I want to be invited to parties, I want to be messaged and text, I want people to be nice to me, I want people in my life to talk to me and want me to be around.

Ever since this fucking quarantine shit started happening just, it feels like everything has been going down hill. On Sunday a friend of mine felt unwelcome and like a burden on a chat we were in together. Cause of this she felt frustration and left the chat and it sparked an argument. Then tonight on Tuesday 1 am, I am- or used to be now that I don’t have any roleplay partners and servers- a role player. And tonight we did an angst event with some characters, these were comfort characters for my friend and we always did events with em and they hold a special place for both of us. But tonight I just, I did an underwhelming reaction for a characters death, I described one dying from heart break and this one, I wanted to have a different reaction but I guess I couldn’t get that across. She’s upset at me and she not only wants to stop using them but stop roleplay all together. She doesn’t want to talk to be cause I just, made her upset. We’ve been trough so much together but lately it’s just been so, GOD. It feels like everything is going back in time. When I fell asleep on her having a panic attack and all kinds of other shitty behavior I fixed or tried to. But now it feels like everything has gone through the shitter.

One day, I think that everything is great, things are getting better but nope!!!! It’s not. It’s getting worse. One day we’re joking on a voice call the next, next she leaves the gc. And doesn’t even like talk to my friends about the issues she’s having she just leaves.

I don't know where my thoughts are coming from, like obviously from my head but who is putting them there? Even things I did mere minutes ago! They were done by another version of me that keep switching out, so I didn't do those really. 

I can't search through my mind to try and figure out who I actually was before because it's like it's not there anymore, it's easier for me to think as someone else than as myself. Like thinking as if I have another identity (which I don't even realize I'm doing until I remember that it doesn't line up with who I actually am) Sometimes I won't recognize my own voice so I end up either trailing off or I'll blindly stumble along the sentence hoping it makes sense.

 When I think about losing weight/exercising to lose fat &amp; feel healthier, I feel almost guilty when I realize people will treat me differently/nicer when I weight less and gain more confidence. We should already br doing that regardless. I start comparing myself to what I see on social media, lose hope, and can't focus on working out again for a while.

She cannot walk (same for going to toilet) without someone holding her or else she may fall because she has no function or strength on her right arms and leg(right part of her body). She's been under medication since she was a baby.
When she was in the nursery and 1st grade, she was in school and could run and play around but occasionally she used to get attacks then she'd fall. After that my parents decided to take her out of school as it was risky keeping her in school. She has violent outbursts of anger and sudden mood shifts too. She still thinks like a kid and is very child like. If she sees toys in shops and malls she would act up until she gets it.

II’m looking for advice on how to best help my partner. I’ve been doing lots of reading but there is absolutely no information out there on adults with Tourettes. He really really struggled with it as a young child and a teenager, but gradually got better going into adulthood. He struggles with alcohol and substance abuse and uses it as a way to escape, but it’s a vicious cycle as the next day when he wakes up he feels awful for the things he done drunk. Tics aren’t exactly his main problem, it’s all the underlying conditions that come with the condition: OCD, depression, anxiety etc etc. I’m really REALLY worried about him with the lockdown conditions, he feels trapped and has started ticking again and his mood is constantly up and down. He’s hyper and looks visibly okay but is actually extremely restless and angry. He’s worried about receding into himself like he did when he was younger, and I am worried about that too. He’s just started a new job, we are moving into our first flat &amp; we are due a baby in August. I really want to help him but I have to admit I really struggle with him using alcohol as a coping mechanism. On the very few scientific studies done on adults with TS I have found that being part of a group and having a project is a really good thing. So in the meantime I’ve got him to join a Facebook group for adults with Tourette’s because there isn’t much we can do with the lockdown.

Hello. I’ve suffered from health anxiety my whole life but it’s been at full force since 2019. Also have depression because of this. Does anyone have health anxiety/hypochondria? I’ve had times it was so bad I was shaking crying and screaming in my bed because I convinced myself I had a terrible disease. For weeks I was depressed and anxious I caught syphilis from protected sex (yes protected) among other things 

A Hernia from coughing , a torn tricep tendon (I weightlift so losing that would be very important to me and need surgery), multiple sclerosis, melanoma (deadliest skin cancer) a torn pectoral tendon ,  and now afraid of a brain tumor or lymphoma cancer. Every time I get over one thing something new pops up and takes the happiness out of me for 2 weeks at a time. And it feels soooo real . If you can go to my profile I recently posted a picture of my eyelid/eyebrow area. Im pretty sure I woke up 3 days ago and they got thicker/puffed up but not swollen, and I’m gonna assume I have a tumor behind my eyes. Especially the fact I seen an article about a girl who had a droopy eyelid and it ended up as a brain tumor. And even worse , if I did I wouldn’t be able to get medical help because of the pandemic! Perfect . And this morning I noticed the skin on my nose is peeling and cracked , accompanied by the unusual rashes I’ve been having for weeks has me thinking I’ve got some type of blood cancer or systemic disease and again, can’t get medical help so it’ll be too late and I’ll die by the time this is over . Also I know this is not healthy but anytime I catch myself laughing or having fun I’ll immediately stop and tell myself I don’t deserve happiness, my life is terrible and that’s what it’ll be forever",31Mar2020,1
177,"Hi all, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm in a bit of a bind. 

I have a friend (17M) who I've known for a year, but have never met in person due to us being long distance. He has frequent depressive episodes (apathy, self loathing) and severe anxiety attacks. I do relate to him quite a bit, as I have BPD myself, but my attacks are nowhere near as long or often as his. He has one maybe every three days, (I am aware of them as he talks about them/ghosts me for a half day or so) and is on medication for them, I believe. 

But my question is, how do I support someone in this situation? I don't have friends with the same symptoms as his, and I just feel really helpless. I really care about him, and I feel like the only thing I can do is offer to talk. This situation is doubly hard because of the distance, and I can't give him a hug or sit with him or anything. 

I don't know if there really is an answer to this..but I'm also writing this partially to vent myself. Any advice/encouraging comments is greatly appreciated :,)",31Mar2020,2
178,"I was diagnosed 2 years ago for bipolar depressive and have been on medication for 1 year. It's helped out at times. There are moments where I am genuinely at peace and overall, I can say that I'm less depressed. The Inferiority complex I have not been diagnosed formally. It's something that I think I have. It's related to a few things:

1) I have stopped communicating with girls who were clearly interested at the potential of what ""this"" could be. The thoughts I have are, ""she's not really interested"" when texts aren't returned or whatever. One girl in particular chatted with me for about 2 hours. I got her number the same night. The vibes felt good. But my mind just jumped to ""she's not interested"" because honestly I am under the impression that if a girl takes more than a few days to get back to you, she's not into it. I stopped because I wanted to leave gracefully.

2) I feel like I'm not as cool as other men. I have a pervasive sense that I don't belong in any social group. I don't really go out much anymore. I just isolate but was taking steps to get back out there before beerflu happened.

3) When I achieve something, I feel relieved. Not happy. At work, I constantly feel like I can't do some of the more challenging assignments but my work is, for the most part, well done. I feel like I'm not intelligent - just average. 

4) When a friend doesn't text me back for weeks or generally ignores me/bails out on plans, I feel like I'm less than. Like I don't really have much value as a friend. It's happened in the last few weeks from multiple parties, and I confront them. But I still feel like they'll ditch me in a heartbeat. For voicing my opinions and all.

These are the areas of my life where I struggle. I realize that in order for me to be truly happy with myself, I'll need to change the way I see myself. I don't really know how to do this with the quarantine in place. I'm not depressed right now - at least I don't think so. I'm just trying to improve myself.

TL;DR: I suspect that I have an Inferiority Complex and it's affecting multiple areas of my life. Want to improve myself so I can live a better life.",31Mar2020,1
179,"Hi. I’ve got no idea if someone will ever read this I’ll try to keep it short. 

i suffer from body dysmorphobia and struggle every day, it even makes me cry whenever I see other women with a “better body”. This disorder comes along with anorexia and bulimia, I often starve myself to death just because I can’t accept my body the way it is. I’ve been doing workout until fainting forever but it doesn’t help my poor body, I never loose weight or shape it the way I want it. I feel in competition with other people, always. I’ve been taught like that and I realize how wrong it is. 

I’ve been in a relationship for almost two years now and once, I was scrolling through Twitter I noticed my partner liking other women pics, naked or sexualised (porn). I react with extreme anxiety all the time. My partner is loving and caring, I can’t complain but this social media approval is seriously killing me. I don’t understand why he needs to see other women when he says he loves me and only attracted by me. Our relationship is honestly healthy and we talk about anything all the time, we try not to hurt the loved one. He explained himself saying those body are just body and he wasn’t sexualizing them. He likes art and says nudes are art. I agree though it makes me sick. I can’t help but think I’m not enough to him or he may be fantasizing better or hotter women. It’s killing me I suffer from this, small and insignificant thing that’s a like or a follow on a virtual platform. It makes me cry I can’t help it.

185,"i normally live on my own in an apartment out of state. i decided to come back home to my parents during the quarantine because there’s greater access to healthcare and i could be with my family should anything happen or anyone need to be taken care of.

now we have travel bans and i cant go back home so its safe to say im stuck here until the quarantine is over. my work is remote so im still working and paying my rent for my apartment even though im not there.

i moved out at 17 because i was literally going to kill myself if i had to stay here. my mother has something mentally wrong with her and has absolutely degraded my brother and i for the majority of our lives. nothing is ever good enough for her. she constantly complains about us putting things in common areas and how it’s “her” house not “our” house. we’re basically told every day that we’re useless and worthless and disappointing and a waste of space. she never took us to a counselor as children so my brother and i were diagnosed with autism and adhd (respectively) at ages 20 and 19, and have now had to deal with the consequences of those untreated conditions.

one example is that i had some of my books on the shelf in our office and she yelled at me saying she hated them there and wished she could have the room the way she wanted but couldnt because of us.

she also said she hates the house and would be happy if she could change my room into a room for her hobbies but obviously she cant because of me. she acts like she resents us for existing because its keeping her from her happiness.

every time i say anything she cuts me off or walks away halfway through my sentence.

because of this, i have decided to keep myself in my room for the rest of the quarantine. the downside is that this is probably going to kill me. i am too upset to eat. i haven’t eaten in 18 hours already. aside from that i don’t even want to go down and get food because ill probably be yelled at for dirtying the bowl or plate i use for my food or get yelled at for taking food out of the fridge and dirtying the kitchen. it’s too hostile of an environment &amp; i don’t see myself even being able to eat because of being so upset, should i overcome going down there to make it.

needless to say i know this is not healthy, and i should just suck it up but im honestly tired of hearing about how im a horrible good for nothing just for going to make lunch or putting my stuff out. my only option ive come up with is to just change my sleep schedule so im up at night and eat at night when she’s asleep and do all of my tasks through the night.

if anyone has any advice id really appreciate it, yesterday i felt like i was going to just commit myself cause i couldnt take it anymore. im probably going to take up smoking again while im here unfortunately. i dont see myself lasting 30 more days... and some people are saying the quarantine is going to be 90+ more days... im not going to make it that long like this...",31Mar2020,1

I think he, Alex, might have formed into a separate person in my mind. And he is in so much pain.It is sort of like a switch when it comes to the heartache he feels. Cause it is not like what I read with people with multi personalities. There is not black out times, no switching people. There is disassociation but I am unsure if it is connected or not.But I have hard a hard time making decisions, some times the things I say contradict things I have told someone recently and I do not understand why I said them.

But the person Alex was created for, who Alex fell in love with, who gave us the deepest feeling of love I have ever felt to this day.. is now toxic. Not purposefully.   But we came out and told her everything after 10 plus years of lying. Hoping maybe all the ""love"" she had, that what I am wouldn't affect anything.Well Alex is heartbroken.

187,"So I really hate talking about my mental health but it’s gotten so bad recently I feel like I need to go get help for it from someone because I have no clue what’s wrong with me and was wondering if anyone would be able to give me any advice (not trying to self diagnose and after iso I am getting help for this). My family has a history of bad mental health from my mum having schizophrenia to depression to bpd, and since around 13 I’ve never felt quite right. I noticed I’m to caring and I trust and get close to people to quickly. Yet as I grew older I’d attach myself to certain people who I’d value so highly and then get so hurt and quickly switch if they let me down. I always though I think to much of people but me being ‘fickle’ has caused a lot of issues because one second I love someone the next I can feel hatred towards them. My emotions have basically been majorly blown out of proportion. I think to much and always trick myself into believing scenarios that can lead me into being angry with someone even if somethings just in my head and I know it’s in my head. However in the past 2 years or so with stress I’ve struggled keeping on top of work because I drift off and my head goes to another place in stressful/upsetting situations and this leads me to look emotionless and feel empty and numb quite a lot of the time like I’m a robot just in auto pilot drifting through life. This is stressful because when this happens I usually can’t remember much and forget important things/ what’s happened to me. I’m majorly impulsive and cope with my issues in the wrong ways ( I don’t particularly want to go into that). One of the worst things however is quite recently I’ve started to feel out of body when stressed/upset, it feels like I’m looking at the world in a VR head set and I can’t come to grasp that my hands/ anything is real, familiar faces no longer look familiar and it’s almost scary. My worst night mare is losing the people I love for example my boyfriend I’m terrified Of losing him and I never feel good enough even though he’s so good to me, I need constant clarification he loves me. I feel so guilty because especially with the people I love I’m so fickle and I can go from hugging them and laughing to being completely silent and them not being able to get through to me. I’m either so low and so sad, completely empty, or majorly happy and hyper there seems to be no grey area and I know this isn’t normal I just don’t know was wrong with me so before I go and get professional help if anyone has any advice/ anything for me to look into.",31Mar2020,1
188,"I have been caring for my younger sister for over 6 months, and when I say ""i have been"" I really mean my boyfriend has been supporting me and my mentally/emotionally disabled sister.

Back story;
My boyfriend and I started dating about 3 and a half years ago, when we met I was an erotic dancer. As our relationship developed (about  year in) we agreed that I would stay home and do the ""house wife thang"". Things have been going pretty well with some ups and downs. About 7 or 8 months ago my sister started staying with us because she was living homeless and had run out of family members willing to deal with her. (She can become very verbally violent)

I also have to add that this is not the first time I have taken care of her, (as children I was always the mom) I also messed up an arguments with a previous sugar daddy so I could care for her. Helping her at that time got me kicked out of a very nice down town apartment.  That was about a year or two before my current arrangement, so about 5 years ago to date.


I got her on meds (for the first time), going to group 3 times a week, lots of organization trying to help her with getting disability and finding her own apartment .

Today;
Now we are going throw this covid-19 pandemic 

I am once again putting my life (life style) on the line for her and I just fell like she is so ungrateful. She never helps around the house, unless I have to give her step by step instructions and have to show her how to do everything,  which means I'm doing all my house chores two times. Daddy and I NEVER get alone time which means I'm not getting any or very little (3 or 4 times in the past 7 months). Even when I try to get her to go for a walk or ""DO ANYTHING BY YOURSELF"" to get some alone time, she just does not get the hint. I had to flat out tell her ""we cant have sex because you never leave the house!"" She still has not given us any space. 

I also suffer from M.H and  I am having a hard time chasing away my dark thoughts when I feel like I am doing all I can to make her life easier but it feels like she is doing all she can to make my life harder.",31Mar2020,1
189,"TLDR: I have not been happy in many years. I want to try therapies beyond my regularly scheduled talk therapy with my psychologist. I am not a fan of SSRIs. Can anyone make a recommendation in the Boston area for an alternative therapy to help me change how I think and perceive myself?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone. I am a 31yo male engineer living outside the Boston area. I've suffered with depression for the last 10 years or so once I got out of school as things became unstructured for me. I've always had self-confidence issues and have hard times making friends and developing relationships. I am not close with my family as I have lived far away from them for more than a decade. In some sense I want to be far from them as I feel more independent that way. In my mid 20's after living in somewhat a social isolation I started to have physical symptoms that I think were directly related to my loneliness (depression symptoms, panic attacks). Around the same time I luckily found myself with what I though was my dream job and I ended up moving to the Boston area where I've been for the last 5 or so years.

Since moving, my next goal was to find myself in an intimate relationship. I tried a lot of things over the years (social sports, dancing, group exercise, meetups, online dating) but I was only able to find a few dates and I was not able to establish any real attraction. A lot of this has to do with poor social skills and what I think is a lack of emotional intelligence. I was very lucky this last month to have met a girl at an event who I ended up clicking with. I am having some problems though gauging the relationship and I am starting to doubt if I am healthy enough to be in a relationship. Recently I have not been able to be present with her and I am not able to enjoy myself. My friend/family are telling me that if I am not enjoying myself when around her then I should consider breaking up with her. I need to talk to her about how I am feeling but I also need someone else (a professional) to talk to.

I suffer from a lack of interest and confidence in social situations. I have also come to the realization that I no longer enjoy recreational time as it has stopped bringing me pleasure. I have been burned out at work for probably the last 6 months and I have not really taken a vacation (traveling is stressful and not really relaxing for me). My attention span and motivation have shrunk noticeably. I cannot enjoy media (movies or books) because my mind just wanders away towards thoughts of sadness and regret.

I am trying to get more serious with meditation but have not hit the point where I see improvement and the habit becomes established. I'd like to believe that my lack of awareness and attention can be improved by this practice.

Since moving to Boston I've been seeing a therapist regularly (weekly in the past few years) regarding topics of anxiety and depression. It's basically talk therapy. I have made some progress over the years with getting over anxieties and fears. I feel though that there might be better therapies out there for me. I think that the way I think needs to be changed.

My family believes that since I have not been happy for so long there must be a chemical imbalance and therefore I need to go on antidepressants. I have been on an SSRI before (Zoloft) for about 6 months. I do remember feeling very dull and having almost no pleasure in anything. I really don't want to have that experience again. I'd like to believe that there's treatment out there that does not involve SSRIs but I just haven't found it yet. 

Can anyone recommend a clinic in the Boston area? I really don't know what I am looking for..

Many thanks :)",31Mar2020,1
190,"Alright, so this is a lot of stuff to read, but I just want to let my thoughts out here. It's all confusing and uncertain, but I'll try to explain things as much as I can unscramble.

&amp;#x200B;

When I want to be a part of a conversation (for example, one of my teachers had headphones that a bunch of my classmates complimented today. I wanted to compliment it too), I always worry that when I would say something, it would feel out of place with everything else everyone is saying, that a bunch of people would find it unneeded, that the result of my contribution would end up being so humiliating and awkward that I'd regret ever saying it. I'm always worried of what people would think of me if I did something even slightly out of the norm in the moment, of gaining attention, of gaining criticism. In other words, I feel like I'm too sensitive and paranoid of humiliation and being looked down upon. A lot of times I feel like no one really cares about me in a conversation or group in class too when I do get involved.

Sometimes I'd like to talk to someone (whether I talk to them much or not), but I wouldn't know what to say that wouldn't come off as weird too. And a couple of times when someone would talk to me, there was a part of me thinking to myself ""I don't wanna be here anymore, please stop talking to me"". And when someone invites me to do something or offers something: I reject. It might be because I'd prefer not to interact with people or that I don't want to ruin things somehow. But it's always such a stupid habit of mine to say ""No thanks, I'm good."" and then regret it after a few minutes. I want to have more friends, but I also don't, and I know I should have some more. Some people in my classes seemed like they would be good friends, but I never talked to them too much. I didn't really feel like doing it.

I don't feel so many emotions anymore. I don't feel much sympathy or sorrow for anyone, and if it's something bad that happens to me (ex. on a video game I do something bad on accident and I have to reset my save file and start over all that progress I made, or maybe I drop my food on the floor), I only feel a LITTLE more disappointed than if it happened to someone else.  I don't really feel that much excitement anymore either. I'm just neutral most of the time.

There's a lot of things I'd like to do, such as watching a new anime, finishing or starting a drawing, starting to write some kind of story or draw something based on ideas I just had floating in my head, clean my room, do chores, just take care of myself and have things to do. But I never do them. My mind just goes ""ehhh, I'll just do that later"" and what do you know, later never comes. My mom always complains about me not contributing to life, but I just never feel like doing it. I don't like it, but I don't do anything about it.

I’m really tired today and ya know it’s that time of the month. I was really stressed because I couldn’t bother her for an hour cause she was working and I was afraid the dress was gonna get sold (vintage) then she just refused or whatever. I was so upset and confused I was started crying a little bit. Not sobbing but just crying. I just lied on the floor and stared at the ceiling for a second. The she accused me of manipulating her with my emotions. Which I wasn’t! I get this sounds childish and i hate doing these things. I apologized to her afterwards. I always apologize afterwards. When I was talking to her afterwards I had my phone down on my knee and she accused me of recording her. Which was kind of insane. We sat down and discussed it. I said I would pay for part of it and my dad would pay the other part. I would work out more to fit it better. I showed the dress to her. She eventually bought it for me. Which was very nice of her. I never really got mad at her. I was just acting immature. I’m so sick of acting like this. I’ve gone to therapy but I always seem to stay the same. Please help :((((,31Mar2020,1
193,"Hello, 
I’m currently a college student and due to quarantine I’m forced to stuck with my emotionally and physically abusive parents. And last week my mom did a lot of things that made me really upset and when I called my boyfriend to rant, he said something as a joke which really triggered everything in my mind and we started a fight. Looking back I realized that I was so manipulative and toxic in the way I texted him and I was sick to the stomach when I went back to read the things I’ve sent. It took me two days to completely calm down and analyze the situation and this time I’m really concerned for my mental health and for the people who deeply care for me. Due to the condition I grew up, I would say that my mom’s psychological manipulation on my mental health has really influenced me to be very extreme when I’m upset. 

I have this violent side of me that constantly gets jealous, irrelevant, manipulative, etc. My boyfriend has always been so nice and understanding to me. He is always willing to put anyone before him and help them out. Sometimes when I’m upset, I find myself only remembering the mistakes he did and the negative things that happened in our relationship, and I lashes out to insult and manipulate him. The thing about this is that I would feel guilty immediately after and apologize. 

It’s really hard to explain and its also unbelievable how my characters can be so extremely different. I’m generally really soft, gentle, reserved, and kind, like everyone described and that’s how I feel most of the time, but when I get very close to someone such as my boyfriend, best friends, and my sister, I could explode when I’m triggered with pent up anger and end up hurting them in a way I just couldn’t believe that I did it. I can feel so hopeful and inspired, like right now, and when that dark side takes over I’m all over the place and can only think about the bad things that has happened to my life. I don’t think this is a normal thing at all and my boyfriend and I recently talked about this and we wanted to take a break so that he can help me out as a friend first. I’m going to seek professional help at my university next school year.

I have dealt with severe suicidal thoughts before and it has gotten a little bit better when I go away to college and away from my parents. But during this quarantine I realized that it’s still there. When this dark side looms over I found myself contemplating suicide a lot because my biggest fear is to become just like my mom. When it takes over, my mind just feels bigger than my head. It’s a mess and I literally can’t see any good memories or think positively when I’m upset and angry. 

Based on the summary of information I gave I want to ask if anyone has experienced this pattern? If so, how do you overcome with this?

The cost for professional psychological help is very expensive, though I know that I highly considering to seek professional help, and I will. However, I would like to reach out from this community to ask if anyone is experiencing the same thing. If anyone is having similar situation or has been through a similar situations, it’d be wonderful if I can contact you in DMs and I can share more details with you.",31Mar2020,2

195,"I (34F) have crippling anxiety, which is really rearing its ugly head during this pandemic. I took 20 mg Citalopram daily for about 8 years, then I got pregnant so I stopped. I did well off of it for a couple of years, but in the past 4 years (starting around the time of my separation and eventual divorce) the anxiety has come creeping back and it’s been bad during the past 2 years or so. The problem is, I’m terrified of restarting the medication that could possibly help me. I have frequent chest pain and heart arrhythmia and have seen a cardiologist who assured me all is well, but it’s still a huge concern in my life and one of the potential side effects of citalopram is increased heart palpitations, as well as increased anxiety initially. I need the help of anxiety meds now more than ever—I’m on edge, irritable, fighting off panic attacks every other day, and I’m getting visibly frustrated at my 2 young kids who are with me full time right now. But I can’t handle the prospect of having worsening heart symptoms and increased anxiety even if it’s just for a few weeks, because I’d have to ride it out solo since I can’t call in anyone to help me (I’m in a U.S. “hot spot” for COVID-19 and everyone is under a stay at home order). I’d be afraid to seek medical care right now also. It’s a Catch-22, and I feel like either choice I make is wrong (starting vs. not starting). I have the pills, it’s just a matter of taking the plunge. I’d appreciate insight from anyone who has had a similar fear or concern about starting medication.",31Mar2020,0

198,"I started losing weight rapidly when I was 12 and at the time I didn’t know what an eating disorder was. I would starve myself because I was afraid of being fat (since I had always been ridiculed for it by friends and family). But after 2 years passed I was completely normal again. All the weird habits I had in order to eat less eventually went away. I never stopped starving myself. I would never eat breakfast or lunch. When I was around 14 I started to eat somewhat normal again. I didn’t have a care in the world. I just wanted to live my life. Well when I turned 16 it all kind of changed. I slowly began cutting my calories and I would count Calories all the way down to a small nibble. I would guess how many calories were in things and would guess high just to be sure I wasn’t eating more calories than what I told myself to eat. I was at a normal average weight at the time but I told myself I was fat and I didn’t need to eat that much because I might get “fatter”. I started out eating 1,200 calories and exercising as much as I could. I became vegetarian so that I couldn’t be told to eat the dinners or lunch my mom made me. I started to eat under 800 calories everyday. I was rapidly losing weight and I couldn’t figure out how to stop because I was so scared about weight gain. I would have a “cheat” day on Saturday where I would eat as much “healthy” foods as I wanted which was probably about 2,000 calories I was consuming. Afterwards I would feel so guilty I didn’t eat anything the next day. One day I had a breaking point and I just stopped starving myself like this. I started to eat 1,800 calories. But I never felt happy. I just couldn’t stop eating and then I would feel so awful afterwards, crying for hours. I tried so hard to get “back on track” and once again starve myself, but I had been deprived of food for almost a year that I never felt satisfied with however much I was eating. I would binge then purge and it would start all over again. It took me 6 months to get over it. I’m 18 now and I always look at old pictures of me when I was skinny and I can’t help but be sad of how I look now. I know that being skinny doesn’t change who I am as a person, it doesn’t make me happier either. I can’t really tell u why I seem to always relapse every few years. I’ve had anxiety and depression for a long time now though. I just don’t understand what causes me to desire to be skinny. It was hell and I don’t know why I want to put myself through it again. I just don’t like my body. I don’t know what to do because I’ve gotten so much help but I can’t seem to flip my mind around. I know everything hurts me but for some reason I’m okay with hurting myself. I just don’t want to go through what I went through. I don’t know if that makes any sense but yeah.",31Mar2020,1
199,"Hello,

I am an American but live abroad (in Romania) and am seeking a therapist at the moment. I have been in therapy on and off for the past fifteen years, and am struggling with problems related to addiction, self worth, past emotional trauma, and various related things. I don't really have the option to find a therapist to see face to face because, aside from coronavirus, I don't speak Romanian and also have to move frequently due to my residency status here in Europe.

I've heard of things like betterhelp and am not really sure how they stack up as I've heard a lot of bad things. I'm seeking help from a licensed, professional therapist that can guide me through some new emotional and psychological territory that I'm dealing with, and think there's no reason why doing it via videoconferencing shouldn't work. However, it's all quite sensitive and serious for me, so I really want to find someone who is well trained, knows what they are doing, and who I can really trust. I just don't really know how to go about finding someone?

Also, I don't have any health insurance, and I am a bit worried about pricing. I can afford something in the range of $70USD per week for a 50 minute session without too much difficulty, once it gets above that I start having a harder time.

Any advice here would help, I don't really know where to look. Thanks!",31Mar2020,1

202,"So ~3 weeks ago (before the quarantine, so hell I might not even be able to do anything till after things open up) I was prescribed Lamactal because I reported mood instability. 

I’m two and a half weeks in, so I already increased from one to two pills as instructed, but things have gotten worse. Like I’ve been pretty consistently wishing I were dead for almost a day now, when usually (without meds) the suicidal thoughts only last an hour or two. The quarantine hasn’t been helping either because the park where I go to (sorta) meditate is closed.

I’m also worried that because of my regular marijuana use that that’s effecting the meds badly. Thing is, It keeps me calm and gets me out of breakdowns.

Anyways should I just stop the meds and tell my psychiatrist that they’ve been making things worse? Or just commit to them at least until I can see the doctor again?",31Mar2020,1
203,"My mental health support was through my college. When Corona shut everything down and I had to go to my parents’s house, out of state, and I was informed at the last minute that I would not be able to use the counseling or psychiatric centers because my group therapists and my individual therapist are not licensed to practice in my parents’ state. And to top it off my psychiatrist quit unexpectedly. 

My friends were the only ones that understood my mental health problems and now every single one of them are hundreds of miles away. (I’m now in Texas and all of them are in Iowa or Florida). I can’t talk to my family about the depression or anxiety because I really am the first person they know who has been professional diagnosed and tries to openly talk about their mental health issues. So they just don’t /get/ what my issue is.

I just feel real alone. Abandoned by my college. I have zero motivation and I’m afraid I’m going to fail all my classes. I have no privacy at home, someone can waltz thro my door at any moment with no warning. I have sleep issues so I don’t fall a sleep til around 4-6am, but my family hates me “sleeping in to ridiculous hours” so they wake me up at any where from 8am-11am.

204,"I am a care assistant for a nursing home that has had this mentality of not taking illness as seriously as they should for staff.  


This is what happened last sunday:  
My entire body is in aching pain in the muscles and I got a sore throat. I said this to a few members of staff on the day before and it made them laugh.  
""Government policy - if you have a new persistent cough or a fever then isolate yourself for 14 days.  
My workplace policy - if you don't have a temperature then quit your b----ing!""  
The nurse on duty on Sunday is ""A miserable old moo"" (in the words of 1 resident).

During that shift the pain from the day before was getting worse in my muscles, in my joins, my head, my throat... At **7pm** another care assistant ask if I was ok, and I told her that I was physically struggling.  
She got a second care assistant and both removed me from the floor and asked if they could take my temperature, I was about to say no but becau... and they left.

&amp;#x200B;

Why take my temperature if I know I don't have a fever, temperature wise I felt comfortable. I knew why they were taking my temperature though. 36.8 Celsius, Yeah... no temperature so I was told just sit in the office and take it easy.

No high temperature (38 or above) so I wasn't going to be sent home, and full quarantine procedures were not needed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At **8pm** It's the end of the shift and the nurse said to the other girls that she thinks some members of staff are ""putting it on because they want to be home with their families because of the virus"".

 I dropped out of college to be a care for my farther when he had a heart attack.

That is how i got into care but I have no family now.

&amp;#x200B;

 I could of complained about being in pain but I felt like I didn't have a temperature so I knew I wouldn't be sent home so what would be the point in moaning throughout the entire shift? Didn't tell anyone I felt unwell and in pain until other staff asked If I was ok an hour before the end of shift.

&amp;#x200B;

This post isn't about a nurse that couldn't care though, there is another occasion when she has been insensitive towards me when physically hurt (open wound).

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing this post because It's 11pm for me now, tomorrow I'll start my morning shift at 8am at a job which thank you is just politeness, not gratitude. A care environment which shows concern only after formal complaints.

A environment where the welfare of staff is disregarded and indirectly puts service users at great risk.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I volunteer for a humanitarian organisation, sorry no prizes for guessing it right.

My line manager for that organisation told me to self isolate and questioned why I was even at work considering how I am in contact with people vulnerable to CoronaVirus.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is getting to be a long post to here's a TL;DR:

**Normal stress symptoms for me: Upper back pain**

But we're not given face masks at all, I won't be sent home unless my temperature is above 38 degrees Celsius.

As hospitals have been cleared ""bed blockers"", demand only goes up as staff numbers are heavily reduced.

**Since last Saturday I've had pains throughout my entire body, muscles, joints, headache and sore throat. Could this be Covid-19? I don't know.**

**Caring for others will be the literal death of me this year!**",31Mar2020,1

223,"Long story short: I'm studying a final research year for my undergrad. There's a lot of pressure to do well in order to get into a PhD on time next year. I need to get Honours First Class in order to get a scholarship.

I really don't think I'll manage that.

I have pre-existing Bipolar II. I've just been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD. My mother is dying of cancer, has dementia, and doesn't understand why she can't just go out like normal right now despite being on chemo so we've all but had to barricade her in her house and we can't visit her and she hates us for it. My sister keeps bringing up the fact that we are going to have to hold her funeral this year with less than ten people because of the restrictions, and that my brother and his family in Queensland won't be able to make it down because of the state borders closing. Here in Sydney Australia we are now deep into social isolation, so I can't even go out to try and get away from my thoughts. I can't sleep - last night I probably got \~3 hours. My honours project has been cancelled TWICE because of covid-19, and I'm the only person in my entire cohort that has had their project cancelled at all. I was meant to be doing lab work all year but now I'm literally just at home writing a literature review instead, which is the worst possible option for me, because I have mild reading comprehension issues. I only found out yesterday that I was on the wrong track and now I have to get a draft presentation and project proposal done by 5pm *today* without having read any fucking papers for this topic, when I'm expected to have done \~30-60. Which are hard enough for me to do, because I did Health Science (Speech and hearing) for my bachelor's degree and my honours year is in Neuroscience, so I don't have a lot of the understanding that's assumed and each paper I read takes hours because I have to look into the background information. I just can't seem to get the readings done at all because I can't focus enough to read for more than 5 minutes at a time. I have a psychologist but I can only get in to see her once a month and very soon I won't have access to her because I had to quit my job to study and she's paid for by my old job. I have been desperately seeking a psychiatrist to help me get medication for ADHD and anxiety but I can't find one that charges less than $500 for the first consultation and has an appointment available soon. I applied for Austudy two months ago but they haven't approved it even though it's now well past the date I was told it would be done by, so now I'm down to my last $300, I don't know when I will get any money, no jobs are available near me, and three of my immediate family members have been laid off because of covid so I feel a responsibility to help them in any way I can. I'm not suicidal so, realistically, the chance of me getting help from the community mental health team is very very low. 

I want to tell my honours supervisors that I'm not coping but I desperately don't want to give them the impression that I am not a good candidate for a PhD. I already choked during my first presentation because I hadn't slept because my mum needed care so I know I haven't given them the best impression so far. One of them has seen me perform better in other assessments so I hope she knows that it was a one-off, but that bad impression is the only one the chief supervisor has seen. Any time I try to tell family members that I'm not coping they just say I need to keep going, which I *know*, I'm used to having to be stubborn and keep going, but I'm in so much pain right now and don't know how to stop it. I'm meant to submit my drafts today and all I can do is sit here and cry and write this and I don't know what to do.

I KNOW I am good enough to do really well. I know that if all this weren't counting against me, I would be firmly on track to get a scholarship, even though I have ADHD and bipolar. I know that I am really good at presentations and assignments and that I've been learning at a phenomenal rate considering my existing lack of experience. So all of this has an extra level of frustration built over the top of it because I know that what everyone else is seeing isn't anywhere near my actual potential.",31Mar2020,1

I've gotten death threats and been asked why I personally spread coronavirus because of my race.

I was hanging with my gf today and she brought up a sensitive topic that has to do with something that happened 6 months ago.

Needless to say, I started to get emotional. I started crying and hugging her for comfort. 

This sounds pretty normal so far (atleast for crying it does) but what happened next is what shocks me.

When I started to talk about how I felt on the situation, my thoughts went everywhere. I found it hard to talk, to breath, and to move. 

Then out of no where, my breathing went out of control. I was breathing fast, I couldnt calm down for what felt like forever.

 There was this static feeling that started in the back of my head and went down to the rest of my body. 
I asked my girlfriend to check my heartrate, it was 43 bpm (it's normally around 60-70). 

My vision was blurry, I wasnt even crying as much anymore, so I'm sure it wasnt my tears.

Then when it was all over, I felt really cold, and couldnt eat my dinner, despite being hungry before it all happened.

I had a random bout of it that seemingly came out of no where and lasted for a month (it was extream affected my ability to sleep, and go to school) after that I felt hazy, and like I kinda have tunnel vision for months. But I couldn't figure out what was wrong and I thought the anxiety was situational? Maybe because I was just stressed ?. I have a psychiatrist appointment tomorrow at 9am thank God. But has anyone else ever experienced that?",31Mar2020,1

231,Does anyone else do this? Whenever my mental health has a moment of clarity and I feel good i immediately assume i have something wrong with me and that i am either faking being happy or i have mania and i shouldn't really be happy or something along these lines.,31Mar2020,1
