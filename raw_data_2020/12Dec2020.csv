2,"or ‘not trying tright way’?

This has happened to me and I have seen this a couple of times and it feels kind of ableist/victim-blamey. Here are some examples:

I had a professor who pretty much yelled at me and got extremely angry at me when I was behind in class. When I told her I had a mental illness, she reprimanded me for not already having found a therapist or telling my peers about it first.... even though both of those things can be pretty challenging af for mentally ill folks (I have depression, anxiety, CPTSD, obsessive compulsive tendencies). Like, seeking a therapist and takes a lot of trust and energy... which is especially hard if you’re anxious or have had trust-shattering trauma. Not to mention all the stories I hear from friends about having bad therapist experiences. 

Also, I’ve seen neurotypical people say things like “I have nothing against mental illness but if you’re not actively trying hard enough to find treatment then I won’t have sympathy for you.” But like, sometimes mentally ill people barely have the capacity/energy to find treatment.... especially since it’s a super long, uphill journey. Like when you’re extremely depressed/numb... sometimes you really want to give up. And we didn’t choose to have a mental illness either. So when people say ‘it’s your fault’ or ‘you deserve to suffer’ ‘cause we are not trying hard enough to fix it’ feels like thinly veiled ableism... or simply a lack of empathy.
I do believe that people are responsible for their own mental health problems, but where do we draw the line? Mentally ill people shouldn’t be expected to do everything perfectly to solve their mental illness, when it’s already really hard to exist in this world with a mental illness in the first place!!

Or am I wrong on this?
Curious to hear thoughts from people here. 
Thanks.",12Dec2020,1

4,"I've always had imposter syndrome when it comes to mental health. It took years and years before I admitted that I was depressed and then to admit I had anxiety. Now for the longest time I've had this feeling that I'm actually bi-polar. 

I don't want to go into all the reasons why I think that but whenever I consider it I always convince myself I'm being dramatic or something and just want an excuse for all my behaviour. I even feel bad posting on the bipolar subreddit. (They've all been lovely there, I just always feel like an imposter when I make posts) 

It's just frustrating because it feels like anything could count as a 'symptom'. Regular dreams? Could be bipolar or just anxiety or stress or basically anything else. Sudden fear of loved ones dying? Could just be due to the state of the world right now. Trouble sleeping/sleeping too much? Could be diet related which has come from stress which has come from blah blah blah. I feel like I'm always trying to justify things and go the other way. Sometimes I wonder if I want to know if I have it or not. If I do then it would help me understand myself more and I'd also be able to find others who I can relate to. Or I want to know that I don't have it because then maybe I'll feel more 'normal' and these feelings will eventually just go away on their own. 

Or like does it even matter if I know or don't or have it or don't? I'm too scared and poor to go back to a therapist. Meds are also scary since being on Zoloft for a few months made me super suicidal and I had loads of headaches and scary dreams. So knowing or not doesn't really make a difference so why do I even care. 

My memory is so hazy nowadays that I barely remember how I felt months ago. Maybe I constantly feel this way and it's not due to any episodes or a anything. Maybe it's something completely different like ADHD or something. Seems like once you're depressed and have anxiety then it's like a goddamn skill tree of all these other disorders that are also unlocked. Fuck",12Dec2020,1

6,"So, I've been suffering from Pure-Ocd for a long while now, but thankfully it's on its way to being gone, as medication is helping massively. However, at this last hurdle, I've kind of been floored by an intrusive thought; not of a fear of doing something I didn't/cognitive distortion from the past, but an actual memory that I know happened, where one detail has been forgotten, and now the implication of it is now causing me panic attacks. Naturally, my brain - even more so because I have Asperger's Syndrome - has fixated on this since Thursday night. It's worth noting at this point (unless this is misunderstood as a post): my sexual interests have always been/and are for women my own age,or minimum two years below/above.

The memory is from February 2017, when I was newly-turned 19 and for the first time ever, I explored an online sexual role-play community on the 'Amino' app. Over the time that I used it intermittently until New Year's Eve (as I got bored of the artificiality of social media), everyone I spoke to was between 19-22. I never sent anything, as that makes me uncomfortable, just like I never asked for anything. On one morning, I was looking for someone to talk to; me and this person began talking about everyday chitchat for a while, then eventually it became a role-play that was very boring as far as I can remember, but with a sexual element to it that was built up being the two of us, equally, over about 20 minutes. I was scared to be spontaneous with that kind of talking, as it doesn't come easy at all, so I eventually asked this person how big their mouth was, and she sent me an image of it, and then I humped the bed until ejaculation (an awkward method I developed a few years earlier).

Now, as far as I can remember, she was 18 years old, and I remember double-checking her profile before I even spoke to her in any context as it wouldn't sit right with me for a conversation partner on there not to be at least within my age range. What I started worrying about once last August and then in December (then it went away very quickly), then again this past May (also for a brief few hours) &amp; most recently since Thursday afternoon (as the result of being over-tired), is what if she was 15 going on 16? I'd never thought about that day since it happened until over two years later, and at those above times, my immediate recall was that her profile said 18. However, I worry about whether this is true, and fear the opposite.

I spoke to my brother who is 27 about this, (I'm now 23) and he said; ''Everything you've told me there is absolutely fine, it's perfectly natural. I was 13 sexting people on Habbo Hotel who were 18, everybody does it. You were still a teenager, don't be so hard on yourself, bro. You do that a lot''. My close female friend said, ''You didn't force her to talk to you, and even if you did misremember the age, it's not even that bad''. Another female friend said, ''I was 13 sexting with guys in their 30's, don't worry about it''. I'm wary of using a 'matter of degree' analysis here, as 'normalcy' as a concept is quite subjective, and not necessarily reflective of good things.

I don't know if I'm overthinking the morality of the situation (which I tend to do, in general) or not. I only remembered this when I happened to be talking to myself about misogyny during a self-reflective assessment of my general history/attitudes towards women and girls. I have a tendency to overthink things a hell of a lot, and I don't know if I'm just over-worrying here a.) because of how strange it seems relative to my current age, &amp; b.) because unlike most people, I was quite late to the whole 'doing sexual things online' thing, to the extent that I didn't know what a 'nude' was till I was 19.

9,"TL/DR: I have not been good at keeping friendships with people and my lack of friendships are making me feel worried about my future.

Hey Reddit,

This is a throw away account and I am a 27 y/o Male living in the North East of the US.

I am honestly just feeling lost with life lately. I am sure everyone felt similar at some point. Back when I was in high school I was not the most popular person around but I was friends with everyone from different groups at the school. I had friends from my sports teams and friends that I played games with.

When I graduated and went to college hours away I started to drift away from all those friends expect for 2 of them. During college I was not a partier, I had a couple friends who were close and a friend from high school went to the same school. At the time I Was going through a rough breakup with my long distance girlfriend, and I just felt so confused at the time, I started to struggle with school and eventually had to leave the friends that I had made to move back home.

Once I moved back I noticed that I just stopped connecting with the friends that I used to have in my life and did not try to make any new ones. I was still close with 2 friends from my high school and we would hang out all the time. But for me they were all of the friends that I had outside of people I met while playing games online. Eventually I met my now current gf and drifted away from one friend. All throughout this time I have just never had a strong grip on what I wanted to do with my life. I flirted with so many potential career options but it felt like nothing stuck.

A year ago my gf and I moved to the West coast for a new job opportunity for her. I eventually got a role at the same company and my coworkers there became friends to me and I was looking forward to every day at work. Although I still did not know what I wanted to do with my life I was feeling happy at 26 years old. This entire time I have been my own worst enemy financially making okay money but never saving to the point where I just closed my savings account because I have been constantly withdrawing from it and saddling myself in credit card debt and personal loans (never enough to cripple but enough to be a thorn in my side)

Now 2020 happens, we needed to move back East due to family concerns and I had to quit my job in the process. I am back in my home state and I feel alone because I lack the friendships that I had made over the last year. I finally feel like I know what I want to do with my life but I also feel like I am running out of time. I have reached out to a few friends I used to be very close to back in high school/college but I both feel this fear of not having friendships or making an impression on peoples lives. I also feel terrible because for the last 5 years of my relationship so much has fallen on my significant others shoulders and I just want to start really taking the burden from her.

How can I reach out to old friends and reconnect, how can I make new connections, how can I truly improve myself, how can I help myself to continue moving forward and not let every change effect me so much.

That was super long and basically my life story in a nutshell, to any one who reads and the offers me any advice I truly appreciate you.",12Dec2020,1

I dont think i have schizophrenia because i dont have delusions. Or maybe i do because sometimes i think i do but i have to talk myself out of it. Im just exhausted and think of suicide on a daily basis. Not serious thoughts, but just like, “i wouldnt have to do anything if i was dead”, or “i wonder what dying is like”. I also have intrusive thoughts that i have no control over and sometimes it stays in my head for so long that im annoyed at my own conciousness. I have no motivation to do anything and a lot of the time i dont feel anything except a pit in my stomach and anxiety. I just need some help.",12Dec2020,1
13,"I feel like every bit of my personality, every side of me, what I do, what I aim to be and what I admire is not a result of my genuine passion, talents, interests. It's not pleasant. Rather, everything I do, is just a result of my internal voice, which tells me I don't deserve a thing if I'm not good enough. It's hell.   
I bet you thinking about your dreams, plans and future are excited and fascinated, jumping into the next day with a purpose.   
Me, I wanted to become a doctor, get into a medical school, be a professional and whatnot. But it's not like I feel any excitement about this. I am petrified. Thinking about the utter struggle, all the days I will have to plan and analyse. There is no happiness about any success I have. Whenever I come closer to my goal, I feel more and more tied up, closed in tinier and tinier box. I wish I could enjoy what's important to me.   
Some might say, I possibly just didn't find my path. I did. It's naturally, and has always been a talent of overanalysing people. Every move, glance and word, I reconstruct.

14,"I'm a 24-year-old extrovert desperately missing my old life. I've come a long way this year with beating my mental health problems, they'll always be there I expect but I finally feel like I can be myself and live the life that I want. However the life that I want involves doing things that we can no longer do because of the pandemic.

I almost don't want to believe that it will end, as I'm so afraid of getting my hopes up and being disappointed. That's happened a lot this year and it affected my mental health really badly. I'd rather assume the worst and be pleasantly surprised, but the thought of not getting to do the things I enjoy ever again is unbearable. My social life is what kept me going through my most anxious days and it is a huge part of my life.

I wonder if anyone else feels the same? I kept being told it will be over by the end of May, it will be over by the end of June, it will be over by September. None of those things happened and I've lost all hope now. It feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel.

16,"This is something I have always struggled and still do to this day. I have always believed that asking for help with anything, small (advice, how to do something) to big (mental health) is a sign of weakness and it is something that I have now begun to unlearn and make peace with, to begin to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Asking for help I have learned is such a crucial part of Happiness and Peace. It is ok to ask for help and the amazing thing is, is that people want to help, I just have to be the one to ask for it. It takes time and I am learning how to ask for help slowly, even if I still get anxious, nervous, begin to dwell, allow myself to speak negatively about myself, it will be broken, day by day, moment by moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

The life I have lived of 23 years has been everything but ""ordinary"", but who's life is ""ordinary"". I sometimes think, oh I wish I didn't have to face the things I face on every single day, my Transness, My Self Induced Numbing, Myself, where I think about a life where everything is ""coasting"", which makes me realize, that, that life, isn't for me. I am grateful for the ups, I am grateful for the downs, for the pain, sadness, hardships, tears, growth, peace, happiness and most importantly for my life.

&amp;#x200B;

It has taken time, but everything does. This life we have all been given is a blessing. Every moment to breathe, every moment of time for ourselves. The smell of fresh air that brings relief onto my body, the sunshine, taking photos of moments that are being lived which we don't realize is such a drastic change for our life, conversations with friends that are so intense but at the same time so, easy. I am so lucky to have this life that I live, it is truly a privilege. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday I practice Gratitude. Everyday I practice Presence. Everyday I practice Stillness. Everyday I think that I am not doing enough, enough for my mental health, enough for my craft, enough for the ones around me. I am Enough. I am doing my best and I have realized in the past short time, that, that is all I can do. I Breathe In, Hold, Release, Out. Relief. God, I Thank You. I Thank You for you. The one reading this now, or in the future. You are loved. You are respected. You are supported. You are valid. You are enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I love you.

21,"So... Today I hit my breaking point and my marriage is over.

I have been with my Wife for around 10yrs, married for 6 and I recently saw past incidents for what they were.

The back story... My wife suffers with anxiety and depression which is a result of childhood abuse from a family friend. She usually dealt with this by drinking, usually by going to the pub with her parents. We have a child together which meant that whilst she was at the pub I would be at home looking after our Son. She would be out drinking a couple of times a week and would often drink at home as well. Now at the start of this I had no issues with it as I just saw it as her enjoying herself. However the problems arose when she came home (usually early hours) drunk. Pretty much every time she would wake me up wanting attention. It being early hours and me having to get up with a then newborn or being in work I wouldn't give her this attention (plus the fact that doing anything with someone when they're drunk just seems wrong).

Initially she would accept this. However after a while she started to become abusive. It came in different forms. Sometimes physically, sometimes emotionally. Quite often she would try to get attention from others after being rejected by me (trying to phone/text male friends of hers).

Because of this behaviour I have developed anxiety myself for which the only trigger is her drinking! I have asked her multiple times over the years to reduce her alcohol intake and have explained the reasons behind it. She would stop/reduce for a short period of time before it would gradually increase again until a night out/night in would lead to another incident.

One such incident was a few weeks ago. I was due to work some overtime so I went to bed. She stayed up drinking alone. Because of my anxiety I cannot settle or sleep when she drinks. I go down a few times and ask her when she's coming to bed to which I got none answers!

Eventually, just after I went down to ask her, she came upstairs, sat on the edge of the bed and told me she couldn't cope with me constantly harassing her when she's just having some 'me' time (she works 3 days a week, and generally has at least 2.5 days through the week when I'm at work and kids are in school whereas I never have any time to myself).

Today has been the proverbial straw that broke the camels back.

I was off work today after working until the early hours of the morning. Finally got to sleep at about 0400. I woke up late morning, wife had sorted the kids, taken them to school, came home and gotten back into bed.

We wake up, order something for dinner and all is well. Until her phone rings.

Turns out that the phone call was a reminder for a works 'night out' (meeting at 1400 at a pub local to her workplace). Anyway... It doesn't really register with me until after she's left, we're in the middle of a pandemic and she has gone out socialising with colleagues.

I send her a message asking why she was there when she shouldn't be, mention she's breaking guidelines and could be fined. Turns out they have concocted some sort of story in case they're stopped by the police.

After some back and forth I call them all selfish pricks (was I wrong to say this). They all work together in a care home by the way.

I tell her she's putting not only her family at unnecessary risk but those vulnerable people who they all look after at risk as well. They think it's OK because they all get tested weekly.

So after an argument and after a lot of stuff that has happened in the past I have finally had enough. I have spent time this evening starting to get stuff sorted but it's going to be a slow process getting out as I currently have nowhere to go.

I know it's a long post but I just needed to get some of this into words, I haven't really explained it very well but I can't cope with her anymore. I don't really have any close friends anymore because of her actions whilst drunk pushing them away over the years and I'm not really close to my very small family.

It's going to kill me leaving my children and I just hope she doesn't use them as a weapon against me!

25,"I was in a really bad place in the summer where I was   just riddled with debilitating anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I wasn't sleeping, I was uncomfortably skinny because I rarely had an appetite, I had multiple panic attacks a day some days but at least once every day for a good couple of months. I was certain I wouldn't see this winter because I was so suicidal that I was actually making plans of when and how I'd kill myself. I had even gone as far as making sure my loved ones knew my passwords.

Then, out of sheer desperation, I figured I would give antidepressants a try for my mother's sake. The meds slowly lowered my anxiety and the frequency/intensity of my panic attacks, increased my appetite and started helping me sleep. I didn't feel so suffocated by my thoughts and started making some slow progress in therapy. I work hard in therapy, my doctor actually pointed it out to me recently how hard I've been working and told me that it seems like I'm doing much better. My therapist also recently made a comment about how I'm doing better and that I may be good to wrap things up soon. 

I agreed to them but secretly I feel like they're wrong. I feel like I have gotten better at internalizing my feelings and shutting up and just dealing with things. I feel like I have been numbed out enough to not feel the need to constantly verbalize how awful I'm feeling. I have realized the impact of my negativity on my loved ones so Ive gotten better at covering up how I'm feeling and faking a smile for them. I feel like inside, it's still as bad as before. I still feel all the same bad things I felt before I started my meds, except now I am almost too numb and lazy to care enough to talk about it or do anything about these feelings, so I sit around depressed wanting to die still but just don't complain. I don't know how to even explain it. Its almost like the pills granted me the ability to fake it and now I'm just really good at acting okay when I am actually at the very end of my rope and have no clue how to tell anyone anymore because they all think I'm doing better.

I also feel like with all the work I've put in, and all the time my therapist has spent trying so hard to work on me, I should be doing better, which is another reason why I have just started shutting up and dealing with it internally. I am embarrassed that I am still doing so bad and still feel like I need just as much help(if not more) than I did in the summer when I was ready to kill myself. 

I don't know. I am externally doing better but internally feel even worse. Does anyone know what I mean?",12Dec2020,1
26,"I've (22f) been with my bf (24m) for 3 years, we'll call him John. We are both a bit socially awkward and depressed. Tbh my shyness is a worse than his but he seems to have worse luck with friendships.

He recently made a new friend at work, after having social issues at various jobs for years due to essentially just not really clicking with anyone. He's not boisterous or obnoxious in any way, he has a few interests but is generally pretty withdrawn and stoic.

Anyway, we recently hung out with this new friend together. Everything seemed fine, it was me, him, his friend (we'll call him Tim) and Tim's best friend. We were more on the quiet side and Tim and his friend were more energetic than us. I thought that was pretty normal especially if you're hanging out with two people who have been really close friends for years. Fast forward to 4 days later, John is at work and Tim comes in because they work together, and all of a sudden Tim is acting different and not really going out of his way to approach John anymore.  Tim was joking around and talking a lot more to the other coworker instead of John. Which was out of the ordinary.

&amp;#x200B;

So John comes home on his work break, distraught and crying because he thought he finally made a friend at a job but now after hanging out Tim seeps super disinterested in pursuing the friendship further.

I tried to comfort him by telling him that it isn't a reflection of his flaws and that sometimes people just aren't compatible as friends, much like dating. He's not really hearing it though and says he doesn't really want to live anymore because he's tired of being so dislikable and not having friends.

I'm trying really hard to be supportive and let him know that it's not the end of the world but I realize how hurtful this situation is. I understand his sensitivity regarding it, I've been there, I've just sort of reached a place of acceptance that I'm generally different but that it's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone please give me some ideas on how I can be more supportive and maybe some wise words of advice? I really hate to see him so upset and hopeless about this.",12Dec2020,1
27,"So today I have come to terms with the fact that a part of me will be constantly hurting and I have to accept it and live with it. I forced my self to go shopping alone today in a long time, and for that moment I felt good, I listened to some of my old favourite music and that made me feel happy for that time. But once the world around me was silent and I lay in bed that pain came back and I cried. I wanted to talk about it but not everyone will be there for you, understand you and you can't do anything about that. So I cried, and I let myself feel the pain instead of fighting it.

 I'll hurt like this everyday, and I know only I will be there for myself, so ill cry as many nights that I have to but I will also find my little happy places. I will recognise that not everything is my fault, or even is in my hands to fix. If it hurts, to not try fix it as quickly as possible but to come to terms with it and just fucking accept it and keep moving forward. 

Too many years, too many days, too my precious moments I have wasted on fixing things which had nothing to do with me, but I vilified myself, tried to gather courage to fix the fights and situations even though I was still hurting inside. So now i'll take a step back and let myself feel the hurt before forcing a bandage on it. 

I matter, my emotions matter and I need to prove this to myself not to others. I will treat myself the way I treat the ones I love around me.",12Dec2020,1
28,"For short: After a week full of tasks, I lost control of my emotions and I'm feeling hopeless. 

I seemed to be fine until two days ago.

This semester was a heavy one at college. Being isolated due to covid probably doesn't help. I had to finish my graduation thesis and finally finished it, something I should be very happy about.

My teacher liked it so much that she asked me if I wanted to join the thesis contest, I said yes... The contest included 7 students and their thesis and it was more about doing a good oral presentation. Mine wasn't good because I didn't plan it as I should. I was among the two worse (all the other five won some sort of prize, that's how you know.) 

All because of a failed oral presentation. I'm better at writing anyway. A lesson learned, I still did a good thesis.

Still, I cried the whole day after. I felt stupid, humilliated, a failure... More than I should. I had never gone through something so ""official"" before, I guess.

Today I had, out of good manners, to attend to the final event. It triggered more crying and self-hating.

I do have anxiety. I'm feeling depressed right now, feeling useless, hopeless and thinking my future is ruined. Right now I'm full of ideas about how I have no chance at getting a master degree, because I think I should have gone through that research project I let pass by...

Anyway.

I'm sunk in self-hating. I cried my eyes out and threw stuff on the floor like I only do when I'm deeply frustrated. I'm also sort of ashamed about that. My parents aren't being so understandable and I'm stuck with them.

One more tiring week of exams and this semester will be over. It's end of graduation.

My mom died when I was 5. Recently, my dad attempted suicide, and I was the one who had to stop him (traumatizing). He's gotten a little bit better, but I have a lot of hate for him now. He's just a selfish person. Not because he attempted, but because he's made so many decisions that put him over his children. Like for instance, marrying three times after my mom died. The 3rd time he got married, me and my sisters begged him to marry someone without kids. What does he do? He marries someone with 7 children. And it's been a flipping nightmare.

Right now, I live with my dad, his wife, and two stepbrothers. I hate them all (deservedly), and these are the only people I have contact with.

Anyway, she started to get knives out of the kitchen and threaten to hurt me and the dog so thats when I broke and called the cops.  She was taken immediately because the first thing she said to the cop was that she wanted to kill herself. 

She was taken once a female office arrived and helped him put her in handcuffs because apparently she has an issue with law enforcement which I didnt know till now the way she was acting.  I assume its because she was scared.  She was making every excuse in the book to not go to the officer and even trying to walk away out the door on him.  They didn't ask if I wanted to press charges or anything because she was hitting me so I assume they are just getting her help at the hospital.  The hospital won't even tell me if she is there or not.

As much shit she said to me and put me through all these years I still care for her so im wondering if anyone has any stories on what it's like in there?

Hello all! This is my first post here so I really hope I’m not breaking any rules by doing it this way. For the past few years I’ve been really struggling to solidify my standing in life, financial, relationship, and college pitfalls just to name a few. 

Recently I’ve taken a hard look at my actions and what I’ve really been doing to help myself, especially when it comes to what I want to do in life. After multiple attempts to write it all out, I found that the best way for me to convey all this would be a video. I just held up the camera and started talking. I didn’t realize until I was editing that it turned out to be nearly [an hour long](https://youtu.be/TJJ-08YhR5Y). 

I’m very happy with how it turned, and want to try to turn this into a larger movement. I know all of us have had hardships this year, 2020 has been a ghastly beast for all walks of life. I really feel like talking it all out like this will help 1. Let others know that they’re not alone, that there are thousands of people that know exactly how they feel, and 2. To help us individually follow the steps we’ve taken and understand exactly how we’ve reached the point we did, wherever that may be! I’ve [linked the video mentioned above](https://youtu.be/TJJ-08YhR5Y) and I’d be extremely thankful if you checked it out. As I said it’s nearly an hour long (53 minutes) so I don’t really expect everyone to watch it all in one sitting.

My boyfriend is experiencing a manic episode for the second time in his life (first was 7 yrs ago) and this is my first time ever seeing mania firsthand. I just want to help him and make him better, but it’s like overnight he went from loving me to acting like he hates me. I don’t know how to make things better. Does anyone have any advice/experience dealing with this? I want reassurance that this isn’t our new normal. That he’ll go back to loving me. That he doesn’t mean all the hateful, nasty things he’s said the past few days. 

I know from research that he should try to sleep and eat and not drink caffeine or alcohol to help him come down from this. But he’s in a state where you can’t tell him what to do. He’s going on 7 days now and went from being a sweet, patient, calm guy to being extremely agitated, emotional, delusional, paranoid, etc etc. He’s barely eating and has been averaging a couple hours of sleep a night.

made me wait in their room for an hour while they get high knowing i get anxious around drugs

telling me i eat too much and making comments on my weight knowing i have an ed

telling me i was being dramatic and annoying for not wanting to walk around the store any longer after i had a spinal procedure done that morning. then asked me to wait in the car and called me a b1tch when i said no (i was in severe pain and wanted to go home) 

saying things about my family like “yeah ur cousin is def gonna end up a r@pist” he’s literally like 12 btw

said they feel above listening to other people’s problems because they’re too good for that.

interjected next opening up about my ED saying “oh that must be so bad for jenny” when it was about me before they started talking about their ex

only texting me for last minute plans saying someone else cancelled

using me to go with them to do errands so they weren’t bored and then ditching me

on the day of my graduation they spent the whole day talking about their friend they got in a fight with

compulsively lies about small things that made no mf sense at all.

bragged about not having empathy for people.

saying they get bored when they listen to me talk about my problems.

and so much i can’t even remember. 

so a few weeks ago i told them im done and i want them to treat me better. so they ghosted me. totally tell everyone i’m crazy and selfish. tells everyone they’re done “doing everything for everyone else” says they’re tired of always having to take care of me.

First of all I'm sorry if it's not the right subreddit but I thought this subreddit might help and shed some light on what exactly is my teen cousin going through.
My cousin sister is 17 and a bit of a recluse and always have been as far as I know. But lately she has started talking about killing herself and dying. At first my family being one of those typical Asian families were straight to resolve the issue by shouting at her and talking her out of it rather than understanding what's the deeper reason to this kind of behaviour. And in turn received and sort of medical support quite later rather than sooner.
It's been almost a month she hasn't changed her thought process yet but rather her symptoms as I may say have worsened. She doesn't sleep at night, her parents can hear here walking around all night opening taps etc, instead of crying she just does this weird howl thing, says she wants to kill everyone, nobody can touch her as she just attacks people ( she tried to choke my mom as she tried to touch her also bit her when she tried to unclasp her hands from her neck).

I am a college student and was left on a lease at 19 as well as had a car accident. I worked as a receptionist at a private practice and couldn’t make meets end... I grew up poor so my family was not an option to help my needs: so I started driving to another city on the weekends and dancing. When I realized how much money I could make, I ended up moving in with my best friend. I quit my day job and went total nocturnal mode. I lived in that city for over two years and thrived. I glowed up.. had time to study and literally only worked twice a week at most. Although it was extremely beneficial for my future aspirations, problems I faced were detrimental to my mental health: 

-I couldn’t have a normal relationship no matter how hard I tried.
-my family had no idea how the heck I was making thousands of dollars a month
-my “best friend” talked down on me and would tell everyone my secret 
-I felt more alone then I even did when my ex left me on the lease. 
-it left me with some trauma 

Even though I financially was so secure and doing well in school... I dreamt for a normal life. I stayed for so long because dancing is my guilty pleasure and always will be... I felt so elegant on the pole and did outrageous tricks. It truly kept me in shape and taught me how to love my body. 

When I got my AA I decided to move back to my home city. It was a leap of faith because I was lonely and covid made me miss everyone. I have all the things I need.. my car fixed... a fully furnished apartment.. and good credit. I am set and got a normal job (40 hours a week on week days 8-5). The problem is... I’m not financially comfortable like I used to be and I’m EXHAUSTED. I’m close to my family, I’m stable yes, and I’m living a normal life that isn’t tainted; but I’m struggling in multiple aspects. 

I miss the spotlight. I miss the money. I miss having me time when I feel like it, especially to study. I am supposed to finish up my masters and feel maybe this was all a huge mistake. 

I know It’s for the best, I’m safe this way right? But how can I stop feeling urges to drive back there and do it. It feels like I’m fighting an actual addiction, how ridiculous right? 

The truth is, I never want my loved ones to know this side of me. That is why I sacrificed my financial independence to finish school close to them. Being around them makes me feel a bit guilty even thinking about it... but I used to be able to give my mom money and now I can’t.

51,"I don't think that's a formal term, but that's the way I see it. Recently for almost 3 years I have formed almost no relationship, not talked to anyone about my feelings, or even do things for fun. I mean I had done some shit but looking back now it doesn't feel much. That was in school. Now that I'm in college, I have a lot of free time to think about things. I always get sad and anxious thinking about my future when left alone with my thoughts. I talked with some of my friends I made in college about my feelings and it felt so ADDICTIVE. Like, I haven't talked about things with people and now I can talk about myself and discuss things. Problem is, I feel like doing this all the time.. especially when I talk to new people. I want them to talk to me all the time about things. This created a serious problem for me recently. There was this girl I met in among us, asked for id, got talking and it was fun. That was day one. But she said she was busy with her work so she wouldn't be able to talk that much to me. I said it was fine. In my mind, it wasn't. I always questioned her motives, thinking that she maybe just wasting my time and making fun of me (I shared some of my problems with her and she also shared some of hers. It felt real nice :) ) I would always wait for her text to come because I said to her it would be better if she texted in her free time. This shit fucked me up. I became paranoid and thought that it was over. I don't know if this was the result of years of emotional neglect or just plain manipulation or me just being paranoid. What I do know is I haven't felt this uncomfortable in a long time. Does this happen to you guys or am I the only stupid fuck?

55,"I don't know if this is the correct place to post this but it certainly does regard my mental heath.

To put it simply: I'm bored.

Now when bored, i really mean to say indifferent to a lot that happens around me, the strange thing is, i wasn't like this when i was younger (atleast not to this extent).

A couple of days back i saw someone get severed by a train.  My reaction?

Excitement at the event for about 10 minutes followed by indifference, i just couldn't care about anything if i tried.

For example, a man near my house hung himself a few months back (money problems and a cheating wife i heard), i brought a nearby boy (who was unaware of the event) to watch the bloated corpse to see his reaction, naturally he was upset but aside from a mild sense of bemusement and some mild remorse for having done something like that to a child, i didn't really feel much.

I just feel like I'm drifting through life, i don't care about relationships and i increasingly care less and less about hobbies that i used to love (like gaming for instance)

Now this isn't to say I'm totally devoid of emotion and feelings, just that i feel like i have to put on this ""mask"" for society and I'm getting to the point where I'm scared of not feeling anything at all.

I'm sorry for the long post everyone, i just wanted to get an outsiders perspective into what i should try and do now, thank you for reading my post.",12Dec2020,1

So there's this thing that has been bothering me for awhile but i can't seem to picture my future at all. I can't see myself growing older, my future jobs, pets, etc. Even if I try picturing stuff only a week in the future I see nothing at all. It's just a void. 

I don't actually know since how long it's been going on but it's making me depressed. I can't see myself going anywhere so I just spent my days doing nothing. I've been in university for a month now and I've done absolutely nothing, no work, homework, studying or basically anything else.

Idk if it's related, but my whole childhood I thought that I'd never live past 18 and therefore would not do homework or study (or sleep) just to gain an extra hour of free time. 

Maybe thinking I wouldn't live triggered my absent imagination of the future? Or did me not being able to picture my life trigger me to think I would die? I have no idea.

Did anyone else experience this? How do you cope with something like this?

Repeats that no one cares about him, that he is alone, he has no friends... And i dont know what to do
I DONT KNOW, if its depression, as i said, its been going on for years, and part of me wishes it is... because that would mean that he doesnt have to veat himself over his feelings, that the reason comes from something bigger than all of us and maybe doctors can help and he will be better, but i just dont know, i know he has felt suicidal and i dont know if he still feels like that, i think he does.
I tried to convince him to go to a therapist, he said he doesn't feel prepared for that, so i told him we will start in January, he, me, and my other brother all together, because we all want to go, he said okay.

The places that are hiring are not following proper covid safety measures and/or paying basically nothing. Our savings are drying up, my wife got laid off as her company downsized due to covid losses.  Our apartment is a mess, we both have small bursts of cleaning and productivity but it’s not enough. Having grown up in a household with a mother with severe ocd toward cleanliness, has unrealistically raised my standard of cleanliness. My wife was one of four kids with 5 dogs, I do my best to keep the place clean, but I barely have enough motivation to get out oF bed. I feel disgusting all the time, I spend my day sitting in my office chair on the computer. My migraines have started becoming more frequent and I’m often nauseous, but even with health insurance, a doctor’s visit could cripple us. Our 17 year old dog’s health is rapidly deteriorating, she coughs all the time and we spend hundreds of dollars a month on her medications. My wife had her since she was two weeks old, my wife spent more time with this dog in her life than without. How am I supposed to tell her that we can’t afford to keep her friend alive? I’ve never had a pet before, I didn’t know I could love a tiny creature as much as I do, I don’t want to lose her either. But listening to her cough all day and wondering if she’s hurting or unhappy is breaking my heart. Some days she won’t even eat, I don’t want to lose her and I don’t want her to suffer. 

I’m not in danger of starving or being thrown out on the street. I’m lucky that I have a family that is willing to offer me as much help as I need. But it kills me every time I have to ask my parents for money, and my Mother (who never had to work a single day in her life) does everything she can to make me feel guilty about it. At the same time, I don’t want to ask my folks for money, how pathetic is that? I’m an adult, I’m married and every time I need money for groceries I feel like such a fucking scumbag begging my Dad for help.

I'm scared that I'm a bad person, although I don't want to be one. I think I'm not a bad person, but I guess I'm toxic. I guess people are bothered by me. Now when I look at this passage, my use of I and me suggests I'm narcissistic and self absorbed. Although I don't want to be as it is bad.

I think of taking my life on a daily basis and the only thing stopping me is that I have parents to take care of. They've seen a lot, I don't want to leave them in jeopardy.

At the beginning of this pandemic, I was happy the world was ending. Now I think I'm a bad person for thinking so too.

I just want to know if I'm a bad person. Why people hate me or despise me. Also if I'm incompetent.

99,"Let me start off my saying I’ve been through a lot of trauma from childhood to now. I’ve been physically and emotionally abused, I’ve had a traumatic death which I witnessed of someone I was very close with. 

I’m in my 30s. Recently I’ve gone through something pretty emotionally scarring and has lead to symptoms which I’ve always had at one time or another, become more severe.

I was also diagnosed with ptsd years ago. 

Symptoms 

An extreme fear of looking at myself in the mirror. I’ve had this occur a few times in my childhood and teen years. This time, I can’t put on make up or fix my hair without freaking the f out. 

Dissociating more. Now I’ve had dissociation episodes before but recently it’s so severe that I feel like I am not me. But I know that I am me but I feel I’m not. If that makes sense?

Memory loss. Bouts of time that I don’t know for sure where they went. My friends have to repeat themselves sometimes. I go somewhere but I don’t know where. 

Getting confused with my dreams and my reality. Sometimes I feel like I’m not sure of if I did something in reality or if it was just a dream. 

Those are all the main big ones that are very severe right now. Other symptoms are delusional depression (thinking of things that upset me that could happen but haven’t. Such as a loved on dying) , anger from super insignificant things, lack of motivation, feeling like others have an ulterior motive behind their actions, that no one cares about me. 

Can anyone please help me? I just started to seek counseling and have 3 weeks until I see a doctor. If it’s suspected that it is DID, how do I go about discussing it with my doctor? 

Please help.",12Dec2020,1
100,"hey guys so this is more of a question but still.

this happened two years when i attempted suicide. before i could i was stopped by my mother. after i went to my room i could overhear my older brother talking to my mom calling me crazy and saying i did it on purpose to hurt her specifically and just going on about how insane i was. i was mordified how he talked about me. he has attempted suicide before and was very close to me at the time. so i didn’t understand why he’d say such things about me. afterwords, he acted sympathetic to the situation around me like he didn’t say those awful things behind my back. and my mom.. whenever she talked about my attempt she’d call it ""my little episode"". (growing up she’d say i was overreacting because i’d cry a lot) during my attempt i broke a cup for jewelry that was in the bathroom by mistake and so on top of that she talked about how she was surprised i didn’t apologize for being so rude.

i don’t know why they reacted such a way to me, considering my mom has seen my brother after an attempt and has said how serious she takes suicide. i’ve mention this situation to her (not in details) and she has apologized. but it didn’t change my feelings. it still hurts so much. my brain have convinced myself she’s lying just so she doesn’t hurt my feelings.

even though it’s been two years i can’t go a week without it randomly coming back and hurting me. two days ago while i was trying to sleep i started crying over it which turned into a panic attack which caused me to start ripping out my hair. i tend to have a problem with overthinking and digging my worries deeper. 

i cry a lot thinking about this moment and recently been having nightmares of my family ignoring my pain and betraying me. waking up in sweat and tears.

whenever i look up why this is happening PTSD comes up. but looking up the symptoms i don’t think i have it. i don’t have nightmare about that specific event or relive it in a sense. i told my mom today about my panic attack the other night. i feel bad for telling my mom. i don’t want her to blame herself for me feeling this way but i needed someone to listen because i only really have my family and can’t even go to them without feeling like they would turn it around on me and pretend that never happened like they’ve done before with other situations. i’m scared. 

also i’m starting medication tomorrow morning for depression + anxiety and maybe therapy soon. i’m just scared why this is hurting me so much and why this is effecting me out of everything the most. i don’t know what it is. hopefully someone can explain it or give me advice. thank you",12Dec2020,1
101,"This is a long story of whats been happening to me lately in my life that I’m going to write. First off I’m an 18 year old male, I turn 19 in around a month and im a stoner (former now) with ADHD. As of right now, lately I have been very paranoid, I feel like I keep seeing figures, people, shadows, out of the corner of my eye but when I look at them they are just basic objects like furniture that I just see as black person shadow figures, it is not 24/7 all day but I will have periods of around an hour that I’ll just be paranoid and seeing figures out the corner of my eye, but when I do something to get my mind off of it I will stop worrying about it until I think of it again. This all started happening around 10 days ago, I had a THC weed pen this one night and I hit it too many times to the point i was seeing shadows around my room move around and were watching me. I saw one see through figure walking around my room sort of like the air you see at the top of a bbq when it’s closed. I’m Christian and believe in god and demons. So to me in my mind at the time I thought there was demons around me in my room, which made me nervous and very anxious, but continuing, I saw the see through figure kind of just glide on my bed and I traced it til my eyes hit my toes, and as soon as my eyes hit my toes I felt as if that figure pulled them and moved them. I don’t know if it was a nervous tick that tricked my mind into doing that but it definitely felt like my toes were being pulled up and tugged for around 3 seconds. I panicked big time and started praying to god immediately, I was high out of my mind and felt as if I couldn’t get through to him. (I know some of you arent religious so maybe my mind was playing tricks with me) Since I felt that way, I started thinking to myself, maybe since I’m high, god isn’t with me right now, so I decided I needed to confess and tell my mom what had just happened and maybe she can pray to god for me. I went to her room still anxious feeling the shadows were following me, i told her what happened, she was upset, but she prayed for me while I was with her. As soon as she started to pray for me I felt as if my high went away, all my attention was to her words, and these tears just started flowing from my eyes unwillingly, I felt as if I was connected back with god through her. (Btw when I tried praying myself I was trying make myself cry but I couldn’t, I only felt the tears get released when it was her doing the prayer for me) That was the end of that night. Since that day I keep seeing figures and shadows out the corner of my eye, it’s not as bad as it was that one night but I see them sometimes, i see them less and less every day, but only by 3% maybe. More things that have happened since that day is I have been having trouble sleeping at night, I can sleep during the day easy tho. I tried staying up 24 hours and went to bed at 12am but woke up at 3am and couldn’t go back to bed until 10am and woke up at 5pm. Lately 80% of my dreams have been nightmares as well, and sometimes while I’m drifting off to sleep I’ll hear a voice in my head when I’m half awake half asleep in my head say something related to what I was thinking of while drifting to sleep. For example, last night (10am for my schedule now) when I was drifting to sleep I was thinking about corona virus or something world related, I forget, but when I was about to be in full sleep mode, I heard a voice clear in my head say “it will kill them all” then I woke up and it tripped me out. Some other nights I’ll get very very vivid dreams that feel different then other dreams, they feel as if they are 3D and things will be being flown at me up close. One other night I felt like I heard my mom call my name while I was drifting off to sleep. The thing is I’m able to distinguish if these voices are real or not but they sound very clear in my head, and with schizophrenic people they can’t tell if the voices they hear are real. This also may be irrelevant but In my dream last night I made a song, as if I was putting the whole song together myself, picking instruments from thin air and putting melodies together and it was catchy, and I woke up with the song stuck in my head this morning, and it doesn’t sound like a copy of another song it sounds new. (This may be because I’m really into music and I make my own trap/hiphop music in a lot of my spare time) But continuing, this may be related to the toe pulling I felt the other night, but sometimes while I’m about to head to sleep my toes will start wiggling on their own and twisting and turning, and then it will go away, but if I start focusing on my toes again, they will start doing it again like crazy, but if I take my mind off of it they will stop, and again if put my mind back on one of them they will all start twisting and wiggling by themselves again. This has never happened before until that one night, but I try to ignore my toes all day so that they don’t do it (I also have restless leg syndrome I think I can’t stop moving it sometimes it feels comfortable to shake it, but this may be related to my ADHD/ADD) Another thing that has been happening through out the day is that I will have little muscle twitches, they will just start wiggling and twitching on their own, like my shoulder muscle, my calf muscle, my ab muscle, etc . It will happen even more when I’m falling asleep, they will all start doing little twitches at the same time 1 second apart from eachother, and it feels like I’m getting pressed like there are buttons, getting pressed around my body. Another thing that happens is for some reason as I’m falling asleep I will feel every hair on my body move, if one makes a little movement, I will feel it on my hand, leg, and even on my head sometimes I will feel my hair drifting across, I have never felt this before either, even as I’m writing this, just thinking about it, I felt a little hair on my toe move a bit. I feel as if my senses have gotten very heightened, I will notice every single thing that moves around me out of the corner of my eye, I will hear very small things too and feel very small things, like a spec of dust that lands on my skin. (Exaggerating a little) This may be completely unrelated also but I’m dealing with a small urinary tract infection right now, but it’s getting better on it’s own, I’m drinking lots of water, but I remember reading online a night ago that this might be contributing to anxiety etc but idk. I don’t think there’s anything else that’s been happening but overall, I’m just wondering what the fuck is going on with me and my life and my head right now, because these people and shadows I see out of the corner of my eye, and this paranoia I have of thinking that demons are around me is really messing up my sleep schedule, making every day non enjoyable, and I have been feeling down every day since I’ve been having to deal with this. I’ve quit smoking weed since this happened also, even though I want to go back to it, I don’t think it’s a good idea. I just need answers I don’t know if this will go away or if it’s the beginning of something bigger in mental my life.

PS 
I’ve always felt as if my mind and brain were wired very different then everyone elses, I think I’m a genius and very intelligent (creatively) , even tho my school marks are very low, or maybe Im crazy and think to high of myself. I’m just different, I’m left handed, Idk if having adhd has anything to do with it. I don’t connect well with other people, I have a hard time keeping friends or even knowing what to talk about with people. I remember when I was a kid my moms boyfriend was reading this biography book about Steve jobs and his mind or something, and he told her that it scares him because me and him were very similar as children.

105,"hi i’m sorry i’m so new to reddit so i don’t know how this app works and apologize for anything i do wrong? i don’t know, i’ll just say what i’ve been feeling. saying i like this girl is an understatement. i am HEAD OVER HEELS. we met a few months ago in an app and we moved to regular social media platforms (specifically instagram) and that’s where we got way closer. i ended up confessing and yeah, she liked me too! newsflash she said she needed time to think, i don’t remember. we talked like for a week romantically all that. till she asked to stay best friends and said i “just wasn’t someone i’d date”. it kind of felt insulting but i understood. cried for days and days, but what broke my heart most during that period of pain was when i revisited the app and went to her account. there was comments about her talking about a guy and how in love she was from dAy oNe! i would’ve been less hurt if the comments didn’t say “three days ago”. she apologized for leading me on and i was confused but the moment i read the comments, i knew. 

during the time we were talking, she was thinking of another guy. i raged and blocked on her on everything i knew but i felt bad so i unblocked her and made excuses. i cried and cried till at one point i was finally, FINALLY starting to get over her. but whoopsy doo, she suddenly comes out of nowhere saying i love you- calling me baby and says she cares for me. i knew she was being friendly, i knew it. all the feelings came rushing back, i thought she would change her mind about because i revisited the app and saw that the person she liked insulted her and i sent a huge paragraph to make her feel better and i got fooled once again with her friendly compliments. 

i didn’t go on the other app we first knew each other on till a few days ago. she had two posts. (this app is called amino so if you know what amino is you’ll probably get it) one for her “rants” and another for someone’s wall. (they were preferably wikis but this is rephrased for people who don’t know what amino is). i read the post for her rants and there was a girl there who commented so much and she had talked to her differently. she wrote comments saying “i love her so much. i love her smile.” etc. it was obvious she was talking about that girl. 

i never had a chance from the start didnt i? i read the comments in the other post and it tore down the last of hope i had. i stalked the posts for three days and started reading our old messages which didn’t help but make it worse, i was still hoping she’d come back. i now know that i always will stay as a friend but i’m still holding on. why am i doing this? am i being obsessive? i want to make it stop, it isn’t helping with my current situations i’m going through. it has made me more stressed and down, someone please help me. but basically that’s the end of it. if anyone read this huge dumb paragraph, thank you. thank you for reading about my pitiful situation.

114,"*trigger warning for suicidal ideation/attempts, sh, and eating disorders*

obligatory mobile user warning


so heres the background to what im wondering might be trauma.

in early 2016 i (f11 at the time) began to feel what i now know was depression. i wasnt really sure what was going on, i just knew i was sad. all of it built up to that may when i felt the urge to commit suicide (no clue what i was thinking) and attempted to overdose on melatonin supplements. this obviously didnt work and going into the summer i began to feel a lot better. 

that winter (around november) i began to feel depressed again and started spending my time journaling, mainly writing about depression. that January i attempted suicide twice (24th and 31st) the same way and again february 1st. this was also around the time i started self harming. by the 7th i believe, i felt so fed up with life that i wrote in my journal that i was going to end it all and do whatever it took to die that night. my friends were concerned about my behavior and read the journal and saw that passage. at the end of the day they went to their teacher crying who then told the principal. i was called to her office and she told me she would be calling my parents. they came, cried, i cried, and they told me they would be taking me to the er.

here's where i think the trauma may have occured. my parents had no idea this was happening were clearly distraught and starting going around to every doctor at the hospital telling them i wanted to kill myself. i was brought into a room with a doctor and my parents who began asking me about what had been going on. he asked if i had self harmed, thought of self harming, attempted suicide or thought about it before. seeing the looks of sadness and disappointment on my parents faces as they were waiting for my answer, i decided to lie and answer no to all the questions. obviously none of this was true but i didnt want to cause my parents anymore distress. i talked to a crisis counselor and continued with the lying. my parents brought me home, locked up all the craft supplies and medication in the house, told me i wouldnt be allowed home alone, to babysit my brother (5 at the time, i was 12), and that i wouldnt be allowed to cook alone. i immediately went back to school the next day and due to the small nature of the program i was in, everyone knew but just didnt say anything. i was stuck under these restrictions for at least 6 months until i finally saw a psychiatrist from the hospital. my mom again was in the room and i didnt speak. she printed out a list of things that had happened to me and within 5 minutes the psychiatrist told me i wasnt depressed and had communication issues, but would give me a therapist because it was mandatory from seeing the crisis centre.

i saw this therapist bi-weekly for a little over a year and kept up the charade. i did not go willingly and didnt trust her the entire time. during the summer of that year (2017) i began developing anorexic tendencies which have continued to now. after a severe relapse earlier this year ive decided to see a therapist on my own terms whom i completely trust.

since visiting the emergency room ive developed severe anxiety surrounding myself, socially, and my entire home life, which im now on medication for. my adhd has worsened alongside my anxiety in terms of procrastination and the inability to try to do anything. i feel like a complete stranger in my house and have zero trust in my parents and plan to leave as soon as i turn 18. 

basically ive had no idea why ive been like this and feel so helpless to my mental health and im focusing on other things with my therapist that this isnt a concern. part of me wishes i experienced trauma to know why im like this and have a reason to feel this way. so anyway, could this be considered trauma because all ive seen is trauma other people inflicted on you or traumatic events and i just dont really know if this counts.",12Dec2020,1
115,"I am a pretty confident and hardworking person. However I am prone to bouts of depression more than the average person. (I have been diagnosed but I don’t really like to attach those labels to myself) these bouts normally come about after a big life event (negative event). Where I am pretty much debilitated for months. I sleep 24/7 and barley make it though any obligations I may have. Anything I can get out of I will. And any diets I’m on stop, workout routine stops. And I isolate myself completely. 2 massive bouts have happened in my life (I’m 22) and I am just now getting out of the 2nd one. 

As I emerge out my depression I have learned a lot about myself and the world yet again. I am now the least confident in myself in my ability to handle responsibility. I am about to be 23. A real full ass grown adult and I am terrified of my ability to be responsible. My coping mechanisms for my depression shut out literally everything in my life and all of my responsibilities are thrown into the trash. I am a business owner and during my last bout of depression I really lost control of everything and let it go to shit. Simply bc it was too painful and difficult for me to think about it let alone work on it. 

I think about how I want kids in the future. I won’t be able to just hide away from them when I can’t handle the responsibility during my depression. I think about my wife and providing for my family and I feel a massive amount of distrust in myself. 

I’m scared now of taking this responsibility bc I cannot trust myself to know that I won’t fall and crawl back into my depression isolation habits if it hits.

so what i hear is my familys voices, i can hear them shout for me to come down stairs and when i get there they say they never shouted for me (they are both in shock everytime and they woulnt troll me). Then i hear my dad and brother having a mundane converstation and when i check it out it turns out they arent there and never had a convo. 
(all of the above happens at least once a week) 

then the ones i hear every other day are: stairs creaking, light switches switching door handles turning, sharp footsteps and a ticking noise coming from all around.

i have only seen only one thing ever and it was in the corner of my eye, it was this messy black ball (imagine a piece of translucent black paper scrunched up and violently rotating) floating down the stairs and i wasnt doing drugs and i had a good nights rest before

to add more detail, i am 14 i just moved to the england from south africa and i went to a new school and everybody likes me (what they said) and i have made a good group of friends who call me their friend. my school marks are all pretty good too. Btw i hear 80% of the sounds in my room where i stay and 20% in the shower.

another thing about the voices, i am not scared of them and the shouting is just kinda annoying but the other stuff is also ok i really dont mind it.

I was watching videos on youtube to fall asleep. before i know it (i assume i’m in a dream) im standing up on the side of my bed. it feels very real because i can still hear the video i was watching subtly so i started to think this was not a dream. then i’m looking at my nightstand which is against the wall, still next to my bed. i grab for a snack i had there (which wasn’t really there since i don’t eat snacks in my room). the night stand disappears as i have the snack in my hand. the snack disappears. i suddenly feel i have one of my airpods in my ear. weird music starts to play that i can’t recognize at all and i’m now i’m on the floor looking at where my nightstand was. i try to lay back on my bed, i see the night stand suddenly re appear. i close my eyes and still hear this music. also the video i had playing in the beginning is still playing. i feel i’m being watched i look at my door and behind me, nothing. the sounds finally stop. the reason i don’t think this was a dream is because the video had only jumped a couple seconds from when i last looked at it.",12Dec2020,1
120,"Ok I feel like when I talk to others diagnosed with GAD they tend to talk about general social anxiety with strangers. Example: feeling anxious about calling a restaurant to make a reservation, going to a party where they don’t know anyone, etc.

My anxiety manifests itself in a different way though and if you have the same type of anxiety I would love to hear how you deal with it!

Basically I can talk to strangers confidently for forever but when it comes to my closest friends and family I always end up convincing myself that I annoy them or that I’m a burden. 

It doesn’t even matter if they tell me otherwise I always end up overthinking all my friendships and convincing myself they all hate me.

Logically I know it’s just not true but I get too in my head and I begin to spiral. Would love to hear some advice or even just some solidarity because sometimes I think I’m going insane.",12Dec2020,1
121,"Straight the the point, every night I just have the same thoughts... that in the future, the time will come that all my loved ones will die,  which of course is natural... but the thought just keeps haunting me each night even when I try not to think of it, so I just end up getting pretty sad and losing sleep over it one night after another, same goes for other intrusive thoughts.  


That is just one of many negative thoughts but it's the one that bugs me the most, I'm still very young (20) but I feel that I just can't stop thinking of the most grim things that the future will come up with.

122,"okay first of all i just want to say im sorry if this is a disrespectul question - i dont mean it to be at all &amp; ive tried to look into this more but the answers kind of link back to the question in a way.

okay the thing is , when i last went to cahms for help they kept talking to me about ""low mood"" and i was always confused because i had assumed i would be diagnosed with depression (because i have and still have a lot of the symptoms) and i told them about the symptoms i had but they just kind of brushed it off and would call it ""low mood""

see now im confused because ive read up online and seen people / articles lump the two together ???? like please can anybody shed some light on this because my last therapist would use these words too when talking about my emotional state and im ??? does it mean its own seperate thing or?

so sorry about this question i just didnt knowwhere else would be an appropriate place to ask this !! :]",12Dec2020,1

You didn’t even mention yours with Tammy in that moment it was so wild to just see how worried you were about me I realized in that moment we were not friends we were brothers it pains me to hear you have passed on brother I will forever hold onto the Home videos we made, the pictures of us, The voice clips we sent each other, text messages, memories, and your favorite shirt, which I now have framed.

125,"I’m 34yo and have always been fairly level headed, but lately small things are affecting me more than they should. A stranger is rude to me, or I get cut off in traffic, or someone cuts a queue in front of me - I get annoyed at the time but rarely do or say anything about it, but it sits in my head for days and days, and I get worked up when thinking about it - thinking about what I should’ve done or what I’ll do next time, sometimes including physical violence. I hate that complete strangers have the power to ruin my day like this. I generally avoid confrontation at all costs but sometimes it just happens and I’m worried that one day I’ll just completely lose it.

127,"I know a lot of people are struggling right now, and I've been doing my best to be there for others in need, but I can feel myself sinking and I need help too please. 

I've recently moved back to the UK from a tropical country where I thought I was happy and doing well - turns out I'd been lying to myself for a long time. 

I'm also going through a break-up over the worst relationship i've ever experienced, where my ex boyfriend ghosted me for a month before a quick call to end things for good. He was emotionally manipulative and verbally and physically abuusive and his behaviour throughout the year we were together has really done a number on me. 

I'm trying to make sense of that, and makign some headyway - what is more concerning is that I'm experiencing new anxieties and issues on top of recurring depression/ anxiety.
Recently I've been feeling quite claustrophobic; if I’m in any room where I can't see outside I start to feel restless and panicked, not just in small spaces, but particularly thise without windows.

Similarly if I'm somewhere that is badly lit - especially in a grimy shop or somewhere public I start to feel panick and desperation.
I also feel like this often at work and end up crying a little (which is conveniently covered by my facemask ... small mercies!)

Everywhere just seems such an lonely, unfriendly and scary place right now. And everywhere looks so gloomy and unattractive.


I feel like I’m getting worse every day and it scares me that nothing interests me or brings me joy anymore: I've gone off music, podcasts, hobbies and exercise. 
I can't seem to stop my mind racing and I get so overcome with thoughts about both the past and the future that it feels like a brainfire sweeping in, I hate it. 
I'm trying to master breathing exercises and meditation but it still keeps coming back and I’m in despair.

But none of this matters in my life because I have a borderline manic/bipolar girlfriend who refuses to get help. She’s up and fine and happy for days then just lays in bad screaming crying and yelling and accusing me of all types of awful for days. She tries to shove pens in her ear for no apparent reason, rips of her toenails, calls me names, it breaks my heart to see because I know it’s not her fault.

129,"Logically, I can recognize I am not functioning normally or successfully, but it doesn’t seem to stop me from continuing my self destructive habits. I’ve been prescribed vyvance for the past two years for ADHD, but  since I’m notoriously self critical and doubtful/skeptical/ anxious I have yet to come to terms with the diagnosis which I think has at least partially contributed to me abusing my meds since it already feels like I’m manipulating the system by having the meds in the first place, so why not take them as much or in whatever amount I want. I was also recently diagnosed with depression (PDD aka functional depression) which only adds to my skepticism of my mental health. I’m deeply uncomfortable with how subjective these things. The only thing I’m decently confident about is that I have much more anxiety than most, but even that took a while to understand because it’s been present for as long as I can remember and I didn’t realize that my perception of thinking is actually constant overthinking. 

On the note of my first sentence though, covid hadn’t made things better but things were in a downward trajectory right before anyways so I can’t pin all the blame there. I have alcoholic tendencies where I’ll drink a ridiculous amount every night for a week and then sometimes stop for a week like it’s nothing so not necessarily an addiction, but definitely not okay. I drink out of boredom and to try and put myself to sleep after abusing stimulants or if I’m anxious or emotional and just want help making my brain shut up.  I’ve never had a great schedule with the vyvance but lately I’ve been running out of my monthly supply halfway through the month because I’ll take a little and I don’t feel the same energy and drive I used to so I take more and then I end up getting so focused on painting or something random instead of my college courses or job or friends or anything remotely productive  until the day is gone and at that point I figure might as well just drink myself to sleep instead of dealing with staring at the ceiling with my self shaming anxiety all night. I’m also addicted to nicotine now so that’s not great either.

My point of all this though is that I clearly am troubled, but I’m functional in all of it and very capable if making sure no one else sees my failure and my faults. Lately it’s been getting worse, but for the most part no one has any idea how much I abuse substances and show much my life is actually in a state of chaos. And while I know what I’m doing is wrong, it’s also just as easy for me to tune out the negativity and just live in a state of ignorant bliss and while I worry that this lifestyle isn’t sustainable and I need help, I somehow keep sustaining it and am deeply uncomfortable being vulnerable enough to anyone to open up about all this, especially considering I’ve been hiding my flaws and they are all completely unaware of the extent of my issues.",12Dec2020,1

In the first appointment he said my problem should be considered moderate anxiety, and maybe some mild depression. In the second appointment, he thought my situation got worse and started prescribing meds for me, but when I ask if it is for anxiety or depression (or a similar question, since I have always felt depression is a bigger problem for me), he said nowadays we don't really treat them separately.

I admit I wanted a diagnosis because without it I just feel invalid, but I didn't expect even after starting to see a psychiatrist it is still so vague. But then I don't know if that is the usual practice, or how others experience it.",12Dec2020,1
132,"My husband and I were going through couple’s therapy for a while, and the therapist diagnosed him with OCPD. One of the characteristics of OCPD is that the person does not believe they have a problem and their beliefs are, to the core, the only possible truth. Unfortunately his beliefs are wrapped in unfounded logic and anxiety. I understand that the pandemic has triggered a lot of stress for people, but his is to the extreme. 

Examples:
- he started an argument with me about opening a back window of a 3rd story condo (that faces out to zero people) in the belief that there is a possibility that droplets could fly through the window.
- when he walks outside, even just to get mail or our laundry from the garage, he has to immediately “disinfect” himself by leaving his clothes at the front door, running to the shower, and brushing his teeth. He will not talk to me until after he brushes his teeth for fear that he will breathe out something he picked up from outside, even though he always walks out with a mask. How is toothpaste going to kill off COVID germs? If you’re infected, brushing your teeth isn’t going to stop anything.
- he disinfects mail and every package by leaving it out all over our living room floor and spraying everything down with hydrogen peroxide and alcohol. He will not let me touch mail or packages for days. Our living room has become a disaster and fire hazard because he believes he’s saving us all from the virus.
- he cites news stories or doctors in regards to certain things about the pandemic, but if I bring up that the CDC says transmission is low to none on take-out food, he says they’re not being 100% safe on that call. Apparently he’s the resident expert, folks.

Okay, I’m all for masks and social distancing, but his is to the extreme. The worst part is that he does not trust me in making my own decisions. This is where it bothers me most. I’ve told him trust and communication are the foundation to relationships. We even went over it in couple’s therapy, but he believes I am being a bad parent and partner because I want to go on a walk. A walk, guys. “You are being selfish. Walks are a luxury, not a necessity. You are going to put us at risk for going outside on a walk in the middle of a pandemic, even if you are masked and distanced from people.” No. And so we get into these arguments about “safety”. When he yelled at me about opening the window, I emailed the pediatrician (since the window is in the nursery) to ask what her thoughts were on opening the window. She called me back confused, and I put her on speakerphone so he could hear her say, “Fresh air is healthy. Open the window.”

We got pregnant before the pandemic hit. Since then his favorite phrase has been, “... in the middle of a pandemic!” I literally never went out for anything (since I was wfh) unless it was to see my doctor. And now that the baby is here it’s gotten worse. Our couples therapist said she would not be able to continue our sessions until he saw someone that specializes specifically in OCPD. He called the insurance company and got a behavioral health screening over the phone. He told me his answers for some of the questions, which I believe he twisted to sound “normal” because he really does believe his actions are normal. One of the questions was about anxiety and if it paralyzed him from doing stuff. He said no because he still does stuff. Yes, he does stuff, but not like a normal, functioning adult. It takes him 3 days to do 1 load of laundry because he doesn’t want to go outside. My therapist said that they will not outright diagnose someone with OCPD from one questionnaire over the phone, and that he needs to talk to another therapist over several sessions to diagnose him if he feels he’s being misdiagnosed. It’s one thing if his anxiety is just affecting how he does things, but another when he starts imposing his beliefs on me. My therapist is worried about me. I find myself not going on walks that I need or doing stuff for myself because I don’t want the headache of having to get into another argument with him about something completely irrational that he won’t let go of. He starts fights over the most ridiculous things. I’m feeling so done. 

He keeps telling me he’ll find a therapist to deal with his stress (god forbid that he acknowledges that it’s actual anxiety), but I have yet to see him move forward in any actions. 

We’ve only been married for a year and a half, but I question how long this will last. I don’t want to jump into a divorce right away because he truly is a caring person, and I still love him. I know with professional help, things could get better. But how do you get someone into therapy who doesn’t believe he needs it? I’m at a loss, and I don’t want his illogical rationale to affect our daughter as she gets older.",12Dec2020,1

I had an argument with a close friend that I've known for many years. We are no longer friends. I was feeling like crap on Christmas. Father passed away from cancer 4 years ago. We put up the Christmas tree without him again.

I was feeling like crap and I sent my friend a snarky post on social media. He didn't talk to me all day and then blew up at me. I apologized and I didn't feel like I was owed his forgiveness but the truth is, I felt disregarded by him for many months now. He wasn't emotionally available. He wanted me to schedule a time/date just for serious talks. But it was okay for him to send me junk on social media just because I was okay with it? But a regular conversation that isn't serious is too much effort you them?

I basically lost my friend over anime because he was watching anime when I contacted him. Something I couldn't had known. He was also spending time with his family. Another thing I couldn't had known.

I'm tired of selfish fake people. I was being selfish too, I think. I think I vent too much to people. But what people don't get is that being both a man and struggling with mental health issues is so extremely difficult. We get shamed for everything. Everyone wants us to be an emotionless rock. I lost my friendship because my friend was sorta like this. He was super stoic. And he got pissed at me because I don't front and I'm honest with how I'm feeling at all times.

I don't regret ending the friendship. I stood up for myself and I have no time for people in my life that aren't there for me emotionally. No, I don't expect my friends to be my crutch. No, I don't expect my friends to be my therapist. I did none of this. I've been going to therapy for many months now.

Imagine being a young child brought up being told you are a worthless liar….imagine having to lie, to cover up the truth because you are so scared you will yourself be blamed

Imagine growing up watching someone manipulate situations to purposely divide people

Imagine growing up being isolated from your family because of lies made up to mask someone's own shortcomings

Imagine growing up watching someone isolate other family members from their own families because of their own, denied, narcissistic disorder

Imagine growing up where the only people you can’t turn to are your own parents

Imagine growing up in a house thinking that no one cares about you

Imagine growing up where you hope you will be put up for adoption in the hope that someone will care about you.

For many years I wondered why I was so such a bad person! We all make mistakes, but why me? How has this defined me? I have mulled over my life many many times and I believe I have finally found the answer….It wasn’t me. 

All of my life I have blamed myself for being such a bad person and why I was dealt the life I had, was I right? I don’t know the answer however I no longer feel sorry for myself and I no longer make the excuses for the person who felt the need to be this way, I do however feel sorry for the orchestrator of my life as they must be a very lonely person inside and although I can never forgive them for the parting words I was left with, I really do feel sorry for them.

I have learnt that life is sometimes cruel but you should always remember that your childhood does not define you. It is not you that is at fault for your upbringing and you should never blame yourself, you have been nurtured to what you have become.

Life's journey for some is easy, for others it is more challenging, but remember you are not alone. There are always people out there that care. Whether it is friends, carers, professionals or volunteers, people can help and people want to help. The most difficult thing is to overcome yourself. Throughout life we go through many peaks and troughs, with touch and go moments, but the shackles can be released and it doesn’t matter how long it takes you can make it! 

Please don’t be blind to the support that others can offer, It wasn’t until now that I realised and gained the strength to question my life, I am now in my 50’s and without the assistance of others I am not sure I would ever of get there, so please never ever give up hope, wherever you are in your journey.

151,"I have had panic attacks since the age of 9 but was undiagnosed until 18 (i am now 23), since then my anxiety symptoms keep evolving and a newer symptom is twitching like turning my head (often happens during action scenes as if i am avoiding the hits) and hand/arm twitches, they are pretty obvious and normally happen when i am anxious or had a long day. I also get strong almost intrusive thought type compulsions to twitch or repeat sounds, words or phrases (often ones i just heard or vines). And since i have been having a hard time atm they have been getting so often and strong that i cant ignore them even in public where i usually try hard to ignore or stop them because its embarrassing. It also has effected me doing tasks where i need steady hands because they tremble a lot and have little twitches. I have looked into it but from what i understand it cant be a tic disorder because it started so late in life, so I was wondering if it's just something some people with anxiety get. I have spoken to my family about it and my cousin and sister get similar twitches but as far as i know they dont get the compulsions. Do i need to tell my doctor or is it just another symptom of anxiety?",12Dec2020,1
152,"A little background. The first 25 years of my life I was frequently and regularly put in situations where I was physically or sexually assaulted; I never went to sleep when this wasn't a possibility unless I slept over at a friends house the first 25 years of my life. I went from home to my ex-wife's and it wasn't until last summer when I split with my ex that I finally slept somewhere I didn't HAVE to worry about being physically or sexually assaulted. I could, potentially, sleep and not have to have my guard up.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, its been a year and a half, and the night where I didn't have to deal with night terrors and fears of night terrors and fears of some sort of assault have not yet come. To be honest I don't think they will. Your brain stops developing at 25, it wasn't until then that I was finally safe. They say to unlearn something, it takes three times as long as it did to learn it. To be honest, it'll be a miracle if I hit 50 let alone 75! I will be honest, it has got better. But that stopped, and now it is all coming back. The night terrors are once again nightly. Its 5am, this is one of many nights I know I'm going to be up for 36 hours. Don't get me wrong, I could take my night medication RIGHT NOW and be asleep in an hour, if not 20 minutes; Im tired and want to want to sleep! But I dont want to sleep, I'm not tired. I don't want to get tired and I don't want to hit that point, because whether its 36 hours and things start bluring together or 72 hours and I'm hearing and seeing things that don't exist I am going to want to sleep.  


In fact I'm tired and want to have a good night sleep. But every time I've slept the last couple weeks I have been having night terrors. I woke up this morning covered in sweat, having a huge panic attack, crying/screaming, it took me two hours this morning to go from screaming/crying panic attack to actually sane. I mean literally I was not sane for the first two hours. I had a very hard time distinguishing between my night terror which was now happening folded between parts of reality and the reality that it seemed rather adjacent to. I was not at the same level of consciousness I have been the last 18 hours that I was the first 2 hours of the day. I was not confident of reality and was not fully aware of what was and what was not happening until those two hours passed. It was after that which I could finally draw a bath and do my morning routine to wake.

I'm scared. I'm scared of the night terrors which will wake me nightly. The marijuana helps a lot, and it does help more than any of my other PTSD medication, but it and the medication I'm on are not stopping whatever has been going on recently. Its worse these last few weeks, I can't pin anything down as a change in any part of my life around this time, life has been the same the last few months. Covid seclusion is how I always am anyway, so its not because I'm alone any more than I was, I really am not. But the night terrors are going to happen, AND I CAN NO LONGER WAKE UP AND BE DONE WITH THEM! 

That is really what is fucking with me. It was one thing when I was being tortured for hours a night, but when waking no longer frees me from the torture, when the torture becomes more literal and I am more aware of it when I wake, I don't want to sleep. I need to talk with someone to be honest. If you've read this far feel free to message me, I'm active on discord and am an LGBT non-judgmental person okay with however crude you want to be and you cannot trigger me. So feel free to say hi, even if you don't have discord, I'd gladly message here.

As this has been happening I have been having lots of feelings as though my day goes by in only a couple hours. Days last 12-13 hours, but I maybe due to the dread time is flying because I'm not getting tortured during that time. Maybe its because I am wasting 2 hours of it going from night terror wake to full consciousness and an ability to do anything but poorly tend to an immense sense of dread.  


I don't usually talk about this, this is a big thing for me. I think I'll message my therapist and psychiatrist about this, its really effecting me. I hope what I said made sense, I have not been getting good sleep and I can seem a little up my own ass and full of myself when I am sleep deprived and my charisma filter doesn't work well and my autisms are fully powered.",12Dec2020,1
153,"So a few weeks back I had a lot on my plate, I took on too much with two serious midterms happening. I went into my second midterm and had a 50 minute full blown panic attack. I haven't had one that bad in more than a year. I ended up having to abandon the course, it took me an hour and a half to come out of the attack. 

Now I am getting close to my final exam for this course and I keep having symptoms of a panic attack and feel like I am constantly on the verge of having one. It is preventing me from studying and making me scared about my exam and scared its gonna happen again.

What is happening here? Am I experiencing some pathetic little PTSD (not to say PTSD is pathetic it is 100% very serious, but this seems like a pathetic thing to cause PTSD). Am I just in my head? I am not sure how to go about fixing this!! Help!",12Dec2020,1
154,"A pretty significant decision determining the next few years of my life comes out in a few days, and I’m really stressed out. More than ever. I can’t think about anything else. I can’t focus on my work. My mental health is going south.

Anticipating the worst case scenario today tore me apart and and I highkey cried for a few minutes. I almost threw up. My heart rate is at 80+ BPM.

This isn’t me, usually. However, this decision plays an important role in my life and I really don’t want to even hope for the worst. It gets me anxious and worked up.

I’m sure all of us have such stages of severe stress and anxiety in our lives, and mine has come this week. For all I know, it can end up positively too. But nothing is calming me down.

156,"TW: mentions of sexual assault, toxic work environment, depression

I work at a small, family-owned bistro back home when I'm not at school, and it has been one of the worst experiences of my life. My boss refuses to follow the COVID-19 regulations in place, he does not let us wear masks, he pays no mind to the limits of customers inside at a time, often reserving 30 covers when our municipality doesn't allow more than 10. The pay is good, and the co-workers are great, so I decided to stay on there. I needed the money to help pay for the expenses of school, my phone, and other bills. I thought it was worth it.

At the end of October, my boss sexually assaulted me. I am an 18-year-old university student, and he is a man in his 50's. It was reading week and I was back home for the first time in a few months. I decided to drink with my best friend from home since I hadn't seen her in a while and the COVID restrictions on campus don't allow for visitors (rightfully so). Having been unable to drink since almost March, I went a little overboard and ended up completely drunk. I wasn't able to stand or walk around, my vision was fuzzy, my speech was slurred. Then, my friend and I get a message from my boss asking if we wanted to hang out with work friends around 3am. We decided we would go, which is decidedly a stupid decision on our part, but to be fair, this man was someone so much older than me; he was my boss and he held authority over me. Who would expect him to do what he did? In the three hours we were together, he drove us to the workplace, took us into the basement, separated my friend and I, and proceeded to kiss me, give me hickeys, grab under my clothes, and so much more. I was able to put distance between us later on, and while I had mostly blacked out at this point, my friend had filled me in on the rest of what had occurred. My boss had flashed by breasts in the parking lot, yelled at me, and drove us home high. The next day, I had to go in for a shift. I couldn't mentally take it, and about an hour later my friend had to come to pick me up. I had run out of the restaurant through the back door and didn't tell anyone where I was going. 

Flash forward two weeks and I had decided to report the incident to the police. Since then, everything had blown up. I had informed my other boss, the co-owner of what his friend had done and he assured me I had his full support. I made it very clear to him that I wanted to keep this as ""under the radar"" as possible. My workplace is very small, with about 12 staff, and they were all made aware of what had happened within a matter of days. I decided to let it go, as I understand it's hard to stop word of mouth. Then, he called me and begged me to keep the name of his restaurant out of the investigation. This is literally impossible; not only was the man who assaulted me, my boss, HE BROUGHT ME TO WORK TO DO IT. What really upsets me is that he told me he was going to look for a way to fire the predator so I could keep my job. He said he doesn't stand for that kind of behaviour in his workplace and he would do anything in his power to get rid of the man. Today, I found out that when the police questioned him in regards to my case and his co-owner's behaviour, he responded, ""I've known this man for 20 years and I know that there is no way he would ever do something like that."" It made it very obvious to me that he does not care about my wellbeing, and instead cares only about the reputation of his restaurant. It took so much mental preparation to overcome the roadblock in my mind that told me no one was going to believe me, or that my story would be swept under the rug and he would get away with this whole thing. I felt such a massive weight lift off my shoulders when I was told they were going to fire the man who assaulted me, only to have it come crashing back down twice as hard when I learned that he never even believed me in the first place.

This work environment is absolutely killing me. I can't tell my parents about what is happening because my mother is their real estate agent. I can't ruin the relationship between her and one of her best clients, that would make me feel awful. She helped get me that job, I don't want her to feel guilty in any way, shape, or form. I told her I was thinking about quitting, but I can't come up with a good enough excuse as to why. I don't want to inconvenience her or have my family worry about me. I don't want them looking at me with pity, or walk on eggshells around me. I feel very isolated and alone, and I just want to move on and pretend this never happened. 

That's so hard to do. The impact of this event on my mental health has been absolutely awful. I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, and this has only emphasized their symptoms in my everyday life. I couldn't get out of bed for three weeks after the assault, I fell so far behind in school it is impossible for me to catch up, and every time I try to sleep, I'm haunted by these God-awful nightmares where I just relive the entire experience. I'm so exhausted, so sad, and so angry. I can't let these feelings go, but I feel like they're slowly killing me. I don't know what to do, or how to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my message to whoever needs to see this: FUCK ANYONE WHO TOUCHES ANOTHER HUMAN BEING WITHOUT CONSENT!

158,"Trl (idk what it's called) - a couple of (white) stoner women from ""stoner group with anxiety"" attacked me for mentioning not every little thing in the world is a ""trigger"" and the world can't stop for them. Stoner white girls believed they are the spokespeople for mental health, and any different opinions is viewed as abuse. 



There's a FB group called ""I'm high and this is anxiety"". As someone who has used cannabis ""medically,"" and still smokes but much less now, I obviously thought it would be a great group to be in! 

Someone posted a photo describing how a couple days after Christmas everyone should jingle bells at 6 pm to lift the spirits of others (covid related). I think this is really sweet idea! 

But, other people FLIPPED. Saying they will hide in the basement, this is going to trigger them to point of no repair. 

Let me say I respect people with ptsd, I actually have cptsd. I don't find ringing bells a trigger, especially when we know the exact time it will be at. So ---

I made a comment - this isn't fireworks, gun shots, explosions, or worse. It's tiny bells with good intentions. This isn't a typical trigger that would impact or scare the vast majority of people, really it's only going to trigger people who have been traumatized by bells (like someone was in a horrible car accident with Christmas bells in the back seat, for example). I also said I don't believe in this idea of letting anxiety control you, and make every little thing become a trigger. We have to work to move on from triggers and not expect the world to stop moving for us. 

Well, heavy stoners with anxiety FLIPPED HARD. No effective communication, but immediate screaming and cussing me out. Admin blocked me from the group, and when I messaged her she called me a mess. When the people screaming at me told me to fuck off because I'm essentially someone who ""couldn't understand"" I replied - ""lol"". I admit I fucked up here, I went to their level.

Admin brought this up to me, and I said ""I didn't say lol, can you show me proof?"" I was in the heat of the moment. She sent the screenshot and even though I said lol to a woman cussing me out, I apologized to admin, and explain my intentions. Admin now believed I was ""gaslighting her. And I'm an evil person"", essentially for forgetting I said lol and then immediately apologizing -- this is her idea of gaslighting. 

They see one person's opinion that doesn't align with their's and since they are the self proclaimed spokespeople for mental health, I'm now toxic and evil for said different opinion.

For context, I'm a 29F and I'm White. I have CPTSD, but I'll be fucking damned if I let it ruin any more of my life. Yeah I used heavy amounts for weed thinking it would help, but no I was stuck in a clouded, dazed bubble thinking my problems were gone only to see when I was sober nothing changed. I started therapy in August, with an antidepressant. 

I have control in and of my life! I still enjoy marijuana, but I don't need it to cloud the mental pain. I want to be strong, I want to overcome my triggers, I want to fight and be successful. And I wish the same for other victims. 

I genuinely believe no matter how bad you have, someone out there has it worse. This is my motivator. There are people who have it worse than me, fighting and surviving so what's my excuse? I believe a lot of people want to believe they have it the hardest and they now get to make the rules and screw everyone else.",12Dec2020,1

Writing that down makes me realise that half of my triggers comes from social media and the other half from my family(with whom I still live with due to the financial issues).

169,"I don’t know what to do with my boyfriend anymore. I met my boyfriend early this year and we fell totally in love. After years of being lonely he seemed like a dream come true and said the same about me. Before covid he had a successful catering\* business where he pulled in $3-5k a month. Save for a few clients his business is still “open” but basically stopped because no one has a need for his service anymore. Due to us both falling on hard time financially we moved in with my parents this summer and have been paying them rent. In the first few months he did a lot of great home improvements my parents couldn’t do anymore but after personality clashes and fights (both sides are guilty of doing stupid shit) my parents and bf just hate each other now and I don’t think there’s much hope for it to improve. Honestly I’m lucky they’re kind enough to not kick him out. 

The past several months my bf has become badly depressed. He has PTSD from abusive experiences as well as ADHD, and he’s been having a lot of panic and anxiety attacks, almost more than he’s ever had. More than once he’s said he feels paralyzed living in this house with my parents, but we are stuck here. He’s become badly demotivated, making little to no attempt to revitalize his business or engage in a lucrative side hustle he’s had going for some time. He’s even mostly stopped working on projects in the house, mostly things he started months ago. I started going back to work part time in September and most days I’ll come home from work and all he’s done are 1-2 household chores, but is otherwise just hanging around. He tends to sleep all day and stay up all night with insomnia. Even on my days off it sucks because I want to do things with him but…he’ll sleep until mid-afternoon and not be ready to do anything for 1-3 more hours. 

It would be one thing if he was trying hard to get more clients, doing side jobs or trying to get another job and just not having good results…but he’s not even trying. All the money he’s been using for rent, food and everything else is from unemployment, but that’s ending soon and I’m getting really scared. He will yes me over and over that he’ll start to do something but it never happens. I’M starting to have daily anxiety attacks, worried about our ability to start a life together (we want to move out to our own place of course), and worried my parents will get fed up and kick him out, especially if he can’t afford rent. I absolutely cannot financially support him, even if I wanted to. The stakes couldn’t be higher, our lives are depending on him working but I don’t know how to motivate him to get his ass in gear. I know he’s smart, I know he’s got SO many skills, and I know he can be really hardworking. I tried to talk to him about it last night and ended up sobbing saying how scared I was. He was just quiet, he’s “bad at feelings”, and I though he tried to hide it he cried too and admitted he was also scared and didn’t know what to do. 

I love him and he’s a good person…but we can’t live like this. I’m also scared of my parents who think he’s a good for nothing deadbeat and an asshole ad what they might do if this continues and he can't pay rent. What can we do?

Hey y’all, 
I just went through a fight with my flatmate and am now clueless about how to go on. I had a few really bad days, normally we are very close, but these last few days I’ve been on the verge of completely breaking down. I told her about that so that she’d understand why I act differently. Today I slept 3 hours - I fell asleep at around 7 am. Because of those two things I’m so mentally and physically exhausted, I don’t remember the last time it’s been this bad. I told her that too, I told her that I don’t have any energy to talk or to do anything - I think about 5 times, only today. 

So a few hours ago I made a really insensitive comment which I will apologize for. This kind of got very big very fast, so I escaped the situation.  When I came back home she was sitting there waiting for me to talk to her, eventhough I told her I couldn’t. I unpacked some things in the kitchen and she went in there too and started talking to me. At some point I snapped and started yelling at her because I just didn’t know what else to do I guess. Neither telling her that I cannot talk, nor literally walking my away from it didn’t work, so I just snapped. At some point I slammed the kitchen door shut and she left. 

Now the worst thing I said was “fuck you” as an answer to her saying I should be considerate for once in my life. That hurt me the most because I’m always there for her, always listen to her, go out of my way to help her.

I just don’t know if I should apologize for snapping since it was like a panic situation, cause I felt so forced into the corner. I don’t know what to do. I will definetly apologize for the mean things I said, that’s for sure. I had so much aggression in me I bit into my hands and after hours it’s still visible and hurts.

174,"I have seasonal affective disorder yes, as well as regular depression &amp; social/generalized anxiety. 
And this year the SAD has hit me HARD.
I feel heavier (not like legit my weight, but like heavier in the sense of it’s harder to do things, like I’m lugging around pounds of negativity) &amp; it’s extremely difficult to do anything.

I can’t get myself to exercise because my body is exhausted &amp; even sore from tightening muscles due to frustration (I’m highly sensitive so I’m easily ‘triggered’ into upsetness/frustration) and I’m frustrated at myself solely because I’m unable to be in control of my own self when I’m as depressed as I am from this stupid fucking cold season that lasts half a year. 

I have no control over myself in the sense of mentally &amp; physically. 
Mentally I can’t calm myself down, can’t not react strongly to things, can’t let things go, and can’t see the positive, it’s as if the negativity of everything I attracted to me and the positive is repelled.
Physically I can’t get myself to do the tasks &amp; things I’m expected to do like clean my room, do the dishes, or even read a book, do some art, exercise/stretch. 

It’s as if something is invisibly tugging me back and preventing me from doing anything.
Also since I have no interest in anything anymore, doing anything seems pointless because I will just react negatively to then probably get myself in such a heightened negative state that I just explode. And that’s even more exhausting and honestly a bit traumatizing in the sense of “I’m hopeless”.

And I’m extremely upset because I actually had the best summer of my life. I’ve had chronic depression since I was 11 (I’m 22) and i had a mushroom trip this past spring which absolutely changed my outlook on life/my self &amp; prompted me to a wonderful &amp; actually enjoyable summer. I was inspired &amp; creating everyday. But now that the cold and dark season of winter is here, it’s as if all of that progress from that mushroom trip have just left. I’m back to where I was; an angry-at-self, depressed, useless &amp; hopeless walking sack of bones. And I don’t think I can take 3 or 4 more months of this.

I don’t purposely try to see the negative, obviously, I mean who actually wants to feel negative, it’s just trying to see the positive, nothing happens except the negativity taking charge. I literally can’t control it and I feel I’m going insane.",12Dec2020,1
175,"tw: suicide, physical/emotional abuse, eating disorder

I've been depressed for a very long time (I was finally diagnosed when I was 14, I'm now 19). It was inevitable, both my parents have/had depression and my home life was challenging.

My dad was an alcoholic (recovering at times) and I became his carer as my mum worked full time. I started caring for him around the age of 8 and had to be taught how to deal with seizures effectively (withdrawal caused him to collapse at least once a day). This was obviously traumatic and since I've been diagnosed with CPTSD. When my dad did drink (and only when he did) he was verbally and emotionally abusive and sometimes physically if I disturbed him. This left me depressed and with anxiety. I struggled with self-identity at the time and began to loathe myself which led to me not eating and becoming bulimic. My dad past away at the start of 2018 and it was a massive and complex loss but it was also a relief - I no longer had to care for him and would have more time to focus on myself and my education.

Ballet during all of this was my respite, it was one or two hours a week of doing something for myself which I enjoyed.

I ended up doing a third year at college, I'd given up aspirations of going to university as I'd done two of my A-levels the year previously and got a C and D which wasn't enough to go to any of my first choices. I had picked up an AS in my second year so carried on to A-level with that and fast-tracked (did AS+A-level) another subject. I would end up with four A-levels and if I did well in both there was now a chance I could go to some of my first choices. I did really well in one subject and my hope started to return. 

Between the death of father and this point in my life I had become severely depressed but had accessed all the help I could through the NHS and couldn't afford anything private. I tried to commit suicide a couple of times. I felt like a failure for not dying and set out to just get it over and done with. The night I was going to do this a boy in one of my classes messaged me. I had been crushing hard on him since I'd met him and thought he would never show any interest in me. We talked a lot and my love for him grew, I enjoyed going to college again because I would get to see him. Everything was great and I wanted to admit my feelings to him, only for him to inform me that he had a girlfriend. I was extremely upset to the point of being sick and apologised profusely for flirting with him. We carried on talking but as friends until a while later he told me he was going to break up with her. I didn't realise he was doing this so he could be with me and carried on feeling depressed about it and started contemplating suicide again. He broke up with her and asked me out a week later. I wanted to be happy about it but I just felt guilty that I had hurt someone I didn't even know. I got over it and we had a wonderful first date and it blossomed from there. Everything was fine, I was feeling less depressed, eating better, doing more and was happier until the pandemic hit. It wasn't too bad at first, we had convinced ourselves it would be only a month or so before we got to see eachother. Lockdown ended just in time for my birthday so my present was getting to see him. It was after this point everything started to go downhill. My father's birthday was approaching and it was making me severely depressed as it bought up all those emotions I had been repressing. During this time he had decided to take some time to himself which made matters worse for me. I really needed support and I wasn't recieving it from anyone. I started having suicidal thoughts again and when I admitted this to him he tried to break up with me - on the eve of my dad's birthday. He called me later that evening apologising because he felt overwhelmed. I understood and asked if we could meet up the day after my dad's birthday. When we met I tried to talk about it but he didn't want to. Things got progressively worse for me, my dream university rejected me so doing a third year of education felt entirely useless - the only good thing was meeting my boyfriend. 

I started getting triggered a lot and kept having panic attacks around him (I would forget what happened after I came around). I shut down for a period of time, even though I was now getting to stay at his house I just felt hopeless about my future aspirations. But I hadn't lost everything because I still knew I would have him. We ended up going to universities that were only a 10 minute train ride from each other and everything seemed like it was looking up. I had lost ballet but would get to join the dance society at my university. I'd also get unlimited access to therapy with them. Everything was going to get better.

He stayed at mine the week before I left and I was happy and so was he. But as soon as I left he stopped talking to me and a week later broke up with me. I felt like I had been slingshotted back to the same point I was at prior to starting my third year at college. He made the breakup messy by telling our friends it was mutual leaving me isolated. During this I tried to do what was best for him but he just became aggressive towards me. 

Due to this I slipped into a vegetative state and have subsequently got amnesia surrounding the start of university until about 2 months ago. Whilst I was in this state I suffered from a personality disorder which was a combination of a few types (so was diagnosed with a PD-NOS). Frankly, I was mean and horrible towards my friends in this time but I only have text messages and what they've told me to know that. I got a specialist therapist and was diagnosed with amnesia and the PD-NOS, they believed some past trauma had been triggered badly and the only person who I talked to in that time who would know information about me to trigger it was my ex. He's refused to talk to me since everything and I fear I will never get better as I'm now forgetting things everyday. My therapist has speculated that part of my hippocampus may have shut down (no synapse transmission) and it may be an area connected to the pre-frontal cortex which would explain the sudden irrationality and personality change. But without an MRI I can't get that confirmed.

I feel stuck again, due to a second wave dance at my university has stopped and I feel like I've lost everything I've ever loved. My dad is gone, my soulmate is done, I can't alleviate the pain with dance and I'm also losing myself. I don't want to live if I can't remember things and I don't want to live if I can't love. 

I don't know what to do and see no outcome to any of this. My dad isn't going to come back to life, everyday that passes I'm moving further and further away from the person I love and I fear that I will never get to properly dance again. I'm worried I will forget my dad who I only have memories of and I'm scared I'll forget that somebody ever loved me.

I don't know what to do anymore.",12Dec2020,1
176,"My friend told me she kept hearing voices that told her to kill herself in the head, she’s very depressed and has been for well over a year now, she’s been to all the therapists in town and went to the hospital seeking help, it hasn’t helped at all, I tried comforting her and letting her know I would always be there but I know that won’t let the problems go away

177,"In the Buddhist tradition, desire is seen as the root of all suffering - when we’re dissatisfied with our lives its because we’re attached to the idea that something better is out there that we don’t have. One of the reasons social media is bad for our mental health is because it feeds us a kind of highlight reel of other people’s lives and accomplishments, which increases our desire and unhappiness. We also get too used to normal, leaving us blind to the good things right in front of us.

So you might look at gratitude as being the antidote to that sense of dissatisfaction. We can be grateful for the important things like the people we love or our health, but it makes even more difference to take joy in the small things in our world . This might be sitting down in a comfortable chair, walking in the park or when you see a bird land in the garden. If you train your awareness regularly through meditation you can be more attuned to these small moments of happiness.

To really kick it up a notch and get the happy juices flowing, you can practice mindful gratitude for the normal, everyday, mundane stuff we usually don’t notice. Thich Nhat Hanh illustrates this with a toothache - if you’ve ever had one you know how painful it is and you’re aware of it all the time. You’d give anything just to go back to normal again, that feeling of not having a toothache. 

Once you go to the dentist and get it sorted out the relief is incredible and normal feels amazing - in mindfulness we call feeling that our non-toothache, the enjoyment and gratitude for simply being alive. We can feel this for our inbreath and outbreath, you can enjoy your posture, you can enjoy the feeling of your heart beating. When you get into the practice of enjoying the small things and the normal things, that’s walking the path of happiness. There is no path to happiness, happiness is the path.

&amp;#x200B;

* It’s nine am on a Saturday morning. On this inconspicuous day I’ve chosen to begin writing a journal. Whether this is the first of many or the first of few entries, only time can tell. I am incomparably relaxed and freely writing whatever comes to my mind.  I believe that having a creative outlet for my thoughts and anxieties will improve my mental health in the long run. Right now, my mind is attempting to correct all of the damage that has piled up over the years. Slowly, I am learning to accept the mistakes of the past and have begun to realize that my history makes me who I am today. By understanding and accepting my past, the future seems to be open. I am where I am today because of the decisions I made in the past. This is the truth. As painful as my failure in that which I care about is, I must accept that they were caused by my actions. The lack of willpower has had a detrimental effect on my growth as a person and the aversion to responsibility has further worsened the issue. I had thought that valuing promises to other people over promises to myself was a positive trait, but I now understand that promises to myself are monumentally more important than those made to others. Helping others before helping oneself is simply putting the cart before the horse. For my future, I must understand the intrinsic value of sticking to my own principles/promises. My ultimate goal is to turn my wealth of failure into tangible, real benefits - to act upon my thoughts and provide an outlet of my endless anxiety. The more I’ve understood about the world and myself, the more I feel I close myself off to it. My forced indifference to events and decisions has left me without a sense of who I am. An empty husk was all that was left. Whatever other people wanted to eat was what I wanted to eat. Wherever other people wanted to go was where I was okay with going. My thinking was flawed. I valued my own opinion  enough to disregard it. The oxymoron in my logic has trapped me between the two values, unable to proceed or retreat. I want to be able to express myself.
* Today, I am going to take steps in what I believe to be the right decision. The thoughts written down here were meant for the express purpose of laying myself bare before myself. A safe place to confess my thoughts. A personal letter to me, myself, and I. But I feel that I have closed myself off and withheld myself from discomfort for too great a time. I have kept pushing back initiatives to help myself with a near endless amount of excuses. I convinced myself I needed more breaks to combat overworking myself before I ever overworked myself. I convinced myself that I have a lack of talent in things before I have exhausted my ability. My fears have worked themselves deep into my psyche and have begun to affect my reasoning. Even now, I believe that my fears are not unfounded. Overwork, mental stress, and lack of talent are all real issues - but I recognize now that my brain has overcorrected the self-care into self-indulgence. Today, I am going to seek out discomfort. Today, I am going to post this first journal entry, initially only meant for myself, on reddit. Today, I will expose my thoughts to the world, and live with the outcome. This is my first step of a thousand miles. 
* To further discomfort myself, my introverted, opinionated non-opinionated, anxious self has decided to start a YouTube/twitch channel. I intend to focus the channel on my growth as a person and the steps I am taking. My hope is for others to draw inspiration and strength from my lack of it. To provide value to the denizens of the internet like they have for me. Even now, while attempting to move forward, my anxiety is slowly creeping up on me. I don’t have a banner, profile pic, editing knowledge, experience on YouTube/twitch, fast internet… the list goes on. My plan of attack on how I’ll generate initial viewers is still unfinished and my confidence in my ability to upkeep a habit is lacking - but I am taking this step regardless of what I consider to be a lack of preparedness. 
* Despite my lack of confidence, for some reason I have trouble lowering my pride and accepting help from others. In this interdependent society, my isolation has only brought weakness. So I am going to drop my pride and ask you, random people on the internet, to subscribe to my channel, and check me out on twitch.  I will further lower my pride and confess that I am not mentally mature enough to link either despite asking for your help. Hopefully I can improve enough to edit in my channels in the future. The most my monkey brain can concede is that I will be posting this on the reddit account I intend to use in the future. 
* TL:DR - Overly Anxious, smooth brained idiot decided to start a YouTube/twitch channel. What could go wrong? Subscribe, see, and grow together with me.",12Dec2020,1
187,"Hi everyone,

So recently I’ve been very anxious and emotional over my thoughts. Firstly, I’m starting to obsess over different mental health conditions which are causing me extreme anxiety. Examples of this is, schizophrenia, BPD, Bi Polar, paranoia and I feel like I’m starting to obsess very strong that my OCD is loving it and making me feel like I have got these illnesses. Is this a common OCD issue? Just thought I’d ask. Last night I was talking to my parents about a discussion and my mum said something and I automatically thought “is my mum saying that to annoy me or just to be nasty” it wasn’t even anything remotely nasty at all but it just came in as a thought and then I started thinking of all the times before that I can remember times that I have had weird thoughts like “what if my girlfriends parents don’t like me” I hate it but I don’t get them all the time just when I obsess over it and look it up online and ruminating over it and now my ocd makes me think I have these things? Does this sound common? Or is this something that’s going on? I honestly only feel like this when I have my OCD down days but when I don’t think about it my anxiety goes down by I’m stuck in this rut that I can’t get out of it and when I wake up in the morning I get anxious about having these thoughts. Anyone else?

188,"I recently stopped taking my medication because it hasn't been working that well anymore. I was diagnosed with MDD three years ago. I'm only 22.

My psychiatrist is in charge of this study. Where they inject you with a shot that has medication for depression every week, cause she did not want to add more meds or switch. So I said yes because I was tired of switching pills taking more to not see the affect. So they told me I had to stop taking all my meds for a 15 day wash out period. So I can receive the injection.

I feel like I am always one second behind. I get so overwhelmed  that I feel like I can't start. This happens with my work, and my personal life. I feel like no one understands me or what is going on in my head. Whenever I try to talk about these feelings with anyone, including my therapist, I end up crying which only makes it more impossible to articulate what I really feel. I feel  like there is something really wrong with my brain. I hate these constant feelings so much I wish they were caused by a brain tumor that could just be removed and all of these issues could be removed along with it. Accepting that these symptoms are probably/most definately mental illness means that it will likely never really go away even with medication and treatment. It feels hopeless.

Does anyone else feel like this? Has any medication or treatment helped you?",12Dec2020,1
195,"I’m really scared right now because of my behavior. I’ve been going through a depressive episode for the last week or so, and was having suicidal and intrusive thoughts. My partner was trying to help me and instead I lashed out at them. We decided to break up because we are both emotionally unstable and just hurting each other, but have been texting here and there. 

And then last night I saw that she was going out with a friend (who I am jealous of because they dated for like a month a year ago) and I completely lost it and blew up on her. I blocked her on iMessage and social media and then even went to unblock her later just to tell her I didn’t want to see her again.

Then I impulse bought some drugs (because I can’t cope) and felt horrible and restless the rest of the night. I tried to apologize but she didn’t reply and it just made me more upset so I blocked her again. 
I don’t know why I’m so irrationally angry but it’s really exhausting. 

I can’t see my therapist for another week or so. I’m at work right now feeling really dissociative and irritable. I don’t know why I’m behaving this way and I don’t know how to help myself.",12Dec2020,1
196,"My mom loves me, but hurts me the most. Her love comes with judgment. Conditional. This morning we talked on the phone and she’s giving me reasons why my grandma is upset at me and making a list to check twice. (Currently living at my grandparents) 
It’s shattering bc my grandparents are the only stable and consistent part of my life. So to be constantly reminded why I’m a burden is pretty hard for me to swallow. I’m like stupid sensitive. 
Well, this morning I did something I’ve never done. I slapped myself multiple times out of anger. I feel bad for doing that to myself and find humor now that I think on it. I just never imagined I’d be here doing these things to myself, I thought I was better on this mental journey :(

197,"Title, basically.


For context; I'm a 26 [M] year old that works in Law Enforcement. I'm an only child and have been in a turbulent, but honestly healthy and good relationship, for over three years. There were lots of issues to iron out between myself and my partner (which I'm aware is normal) in the first 2-2.5 years but since that time period we've risen above almost all serious friction points and get along very well. We're supportive of eachother and both emotionally mature enough to not abuse one another or stomach any bad treatment coming the other way. 


I've noticed in the last 4-6 months that I have had a measurable unconscious change in my thought process regarding how I see women in all but the most serious of circumstances. I may just be having some fucked up hormones or something, but it seems almost regardless of circumstances I can't control my vision becoming fixated on parts of women that are associated with sexuality. I don't mean the usual amount either, I'm aware that it's quite natural to notice these things but it's happening every time I see someone of the opposite sex, where it hasn't anytime in my life before.

I will also add this: I am not sexist, racist, nor do I hold judgement on anyone who looks a certain way that they can't control. That isn't some obligatory statement to make myself not look like an ass, either. I did some time in the military and I've been trained, essentially, that any human is capable of harming another physically, mentally, or verbally regardless of how they look. This thought process is the same I would want to myself so I try diligently to practice it.

What I mean to say is that I think I do have a hiccup in my mind that is causing me to think like a horny 16 year old all the fucking time, but when someone's thoughts, inputs or merit is brought into question I tend to forget about the sexual things and focus on the task at hand, for which I'm grateful. I am concerned though that a situation may arise where I'm so clouded by this random, repeated sexual thought process that I don't let someone be heard or don't do my job properly because of it.

If anyone has experienced something similar, or has an idea of resources that could help me I would be very grateful. I also didn't express this vulnerability to be belittled or insulted, I would prefer to only hear from people with constructive things to say.

Thanks",12Dec2020,1

199," Hello everyone,

My husband is reaching a tipping point (as am I) -- and I am getting VERY CONCERNED!!!

I'm struggling to explain what he's going through but I'll do my best (especially since he himself struggles to explain it to me).

First of all, a bit of background: He grew up in a family of 7 children (one of them died when he was 13). His father was a chronic alcoholic with schizophrenia, ADHD and paranoia (never formally diagnosed though). He was extremely abusive towards his mother and some of his siblings, never worked, eventually died of cancer when my husband was 6 or 7. They were very poor, they were literally starving (eating mouldy, hardened bread they could find under old rags, etc -- can't explain it fully as it affects me), so his mother got him to a sort of orphanage for about a year (together with his 3 brothers). After that, his mother was never really present because she was the only one working (his father died) and they were 6 children (plus she was severely depressed after the father and one of her children died), all growing up, all starving etc. So yeah, his childhood was very rough.

I met my husband 10 years ago btw.

He's been more or less struggling with anxiety/depression all his life. About a year ago he had a major panic attack (had to call 999 because he was that bad). He was prescribed some propranolol and that was it. Then it all started... I'm trying to explain what's happening on a daily basis. His ability to concentrate/think is 2% (according to him). He has extreme brain fog -- he is literally unable to focus to 'exist'. He needs a lot of effort to be able to walk, think or any 'basic' stuff. This in turn triggers his anxiety (so it's not the anxiety that's causing it, it's the other way around as his extreme brain fog causes him to become anxious/go into panic mode). This has become so bad now that he is AFRAID to be alone because he knows he isn't able to think at all. For example, he goes into panic mode when I go to wash my face (while he's in the bedroom and I'm in the bathroom which is literally ONE STEP away). Or he's afraid to go downstairs alone, again because he's afraid he can't think. Also, because he can't think, he doesn't trust himself to be by himself because he doesn't know what he might do (hurt himself or others) etc since he can't think and knows he can't think. This is amplified by intrusive thoughts -- e.g. if we're in the kitchen and he picks up a larger knife, he has very vivid images of cutting his fingers. So then he's afraid to be by himself around knives (once he even had to hide knives from himself to ensure he wouldn't hurt himself or me because he can't think/concentrate).

This makes him literally live in 'full panic mode' because he's unable to think to such an extent. He can go to look for something like a spoon and then he forgets what he was looking for, what he's doing... as if his mind has a 'blank' for a while...

He experiences feelings of... 'faining', 'losing consciousness', 'collapsing'. These last throughout the day. This feeling seems to 'start' at the top of his head and goes down (in a way, it feels like when you're having diarrhoea and you immediately feel so week that you might faint -- but he says it's not necessarily like that). This has been going on for many months (6+ if not longer).

He might also be dissociating, though we're not sure. For example, he doesn't recognise himself in the mirror -- he can't even look at himself in the mirror. His limbs feel like they're not his own. He is robotic, erratic in his movements -- like, he can't grab things or they slip through his fingers. He feels disconnected from his body, questions his existence frequently (often out of the blue, with questions like 'Am I really here though?').

He also has ADHD (he was diagnosed with it 2 weeks ago). Ever since he was a child, he has been pacing about the room ALL DAY LONG. Literally, from the moment he wakes up 'till he goes to bed. He can't lie down, he can't rest. To this day, he is ALWAYS UP!!!!!! He NEVER RESTS!!! He wants to so badly, but he just can't. If he tries, 5 or 10 mins later he'll be up again pacing about the room. For nearly 25+ years, this man has been pacing about and was never able to rest.

Today he asked me -- ""Am I asking for too much? To be able to rest in bed, watch a movie, do something I like?"" This is what he wants because he's SO EXHAUSTED!!!

To this day he has tried MANY antidepressants (partly because they couldn't prescribe ADHD meds since he wasn't formally diagnosed). Escitalopram, setraline, trazodone, venlafaxine, buspirone, duloxetine (at one point he was taking quite high doses of 3 different meds at one time). Nothing worked AT ALL!!! There was little to no improvement -- trazodone was the only one that worked, he takes it before bed and it helps him sleep. But everything else was A WASTE.

In October he spoke with a private psychiatrist who recommended Concerta XL as a trial -- 18mg/day, which is an incredibly low dose. This was to see if it would help him (as he has ADHD). It worked for 2 days (he was KIND OF able to rest for a bit), then it stopped. He was up and about again, pacing about the room 14+ hours a day. NOBODY LISTENS OR BELIEVES US WHEN WE SAY HE PACES ABOUT THE ROOM SO MUCH. NOBODY. Not the GP, not the NHS psychiatrist etc.

After the ADHD diagnosis he was prescribed lisdexamfetamine 30mg. This increased his blood pressure DANGEROUSLY -- 3 readings from yesterday were showing 153/101, 154/102 and 158/103 (taken 10+ mins aparts). He stopped taking it yesterday (plus the effect of the med was diminishing and most symptoms described above were coming up real bad).

He also has these episodes when he goes into a... manic obsession? Like... if he wants me to do something, HE WON'T STOP UNTIL I DO IT. Like, it doesn't matter if it takes the whole day, 2 days, it doesn't matter how much it affects either of us... he can't stop THOUGH HE WANTS TO (and he's extremely sorry afterwards). Please don't think this is abuse or manipulation in any way, but I know he can't stop himself, he can't control this mania... He can only stop after the deed is done so to speak.

I don't know what to do because NOBODY IS LISTENING TO US, to what he's going through, they're not believing us somehow no matter how much I try to explain everything!!!

I don't know if anyone can provide ANY advice. My husband tells me he doesn't know how much longer he can take it, he's afraid he'll really end up in a hospice for the severely mentally disabled. We think that major panic attack created a HUGE imbalance/problem with his brain. I don't know!!! The ADHD meds aren't doing much, the antidepressants are making things worse. I don't think he'll get better if he doesn't rest, but how can he if he's always up and CAN'T LIE/SIT DOWN for 10 mins??? The GP, psychiatrists etc ARE NOT LISTENING.

I need urgent help. My husband needs URGENT help and I can't provide it because I don't know what to do or how to help or who to turn to!

Sorry for the ramble/vent, but we need help...",12Dec2020,1

204,"I don't really know where to begin with this vent, so I guess I'll just start by saying I've had nieces and nephews for like 5 years. I've never wanted to have kids, and now I can kinda see why, because whenever my siblings bring them over for family events or for my parents to babysit them, I just fucking shut down around them. I'm not mean to them, I love them to death, and as a result I get anxious because I'm so deathly afraid of accidentally saying or doing something wrong that makes me a source of trauma to them. Ever since they were babies, I didn't hold them for fear of dropping them or not supporting their head enough, and now that they're toddlers I don't play with them because I don't want to do or say something wrong and be the creepy auncle (non-binary). And so I usually just pop my earbuds in whenever I'm around them or stay in my room.

I get depressed about it because I see others just naturally flip on the nurturing switch and they're just  100% there for the kids and handle the situation seamlessly. And I don't have that, every time I've tried to, I just get overwhelmed, shut down, and look for the nearest exit to the situation. I used to think it was just because I'm younger (I'm 21) and there's probably a reason that I don't do well with kids because obviously I'm not responsible enough to be a parent, but that was until I saw my teenage step brother and his gf just going into that nurture mode for my toddler step nephew like pros. Like HOW????! I'm not even jealous about it, I just feel like I'm missing something. 

And while I'm more afraid of accidentally fucking up and traumatizing my nibbling's, I do wonder how not being present for their childhood will affect them down the line if at all. Will it even matter if they don't have an emotional connection with me? Will they resent me for dipping out when they wanted to play or think I hate them? Will there even be a chance for me to be like, ""Hey, so funny story about that, I actually did love you, but if you don't believe me I understand and respect that. I really was just afraid of hurting you because I missed out on the nurturing gene that literally everyone else has, and so I just didn't even try which you probably interpreted as me hating you (nervous laughs or cries......or both)."" 

Idk, I think maybe there might be a trauma associated with it. I remember one night a few years back, my oldest brother and his wife brought over their infant son and toddler niece for my dad to babysit, butttt my dad wasn't home because he forgot that he was supposed to babysit, so I was left with a screaming baby for 20 minutes until my dad got home. And it was literally my personal hell. I tried feeding him, I tried comforting him, and so I just started dissociating into a routine of trying everything I knew how to do, after my dad finally got home I was just in shock for like a long time. It was traumatic for me and I fucking hope it wasn't traumatic for my nephew. And idk, even before then I probably got anxious around kids, but at least had some element of hope that I could overcome it, but when that happened, I think that put the nail in the coffin.

If you finished this, thanks for listening, even if you didn't finish it, that's aight too. Hope you're having as best a day or night as you can.",12Dec2020,1
205," Hello!

I am trying to find some... solid, science-based source of information regarding how to deal with a person who has Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment Style with love and respect. I will share here a short summary of my personal relationship but please take my question in more general, theoretical terms. I am not seeking a direct advice regarding my situation, I am looking more for a direction, books to read, concepts to know, something which could help me to think off about some good ideas specific to my case. And yes, I would love to consider a professional visit to a therapist but that's not an option at the moment.

So basically, I have a years long (almost a decade by now) friendship with a woman who has Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment Style. I would even say: pretty hardcore case, as she ticks literally every description of this style point to point. Anyway, I love her but we had some rough moments in our relations, basically a story of a brief but lively closeness (emotional), rush escape to avoidance, more avoidance, complete disappearance, comeback after weeks/months. Talking directly about her attitude is really difficult, she easily steer conversation from herself to myself. It takes time until she discloses some really intimate thoughts, needs right place, right time. And yes, she had some weird childhood, nothing too hardcore pathologic but definitely dismissive, and affecting her in adulthood. (and it took me years to get these info). At first I didn't understand her behaviour and depressive approach to life but I started to get some basic psychological knowledge and learnt about DAAS, which helped me to be more understanding towards her. It helped, I don't make much fuss now about her sudden avoidances, I welcome her back with love and care. Nevertheless she feels abandoned, and always deny that any of her friends love her. (despite opposite being true, besides me there are few other people who I know really care about her). I am understanding but it hurts internally. Despite her AS I really love her, like her, we are still similar in many ways and I don't think there is anyone else in her life who understands her better.

But I don't know how to really care about her. Going too far makes her super anxious, and fell into ""I am not worth of it"" narrative. Going too little makes her feel abandoned and thinking she deserves it. Meeting in real is difficult but manageable. (and yes, she agrees and then with time becomes more avoidant but we succeed to meet many times anyway). Online is better but varies, some times we could speak for entire days, other times she takes really long time to answer on even trivial questions. Phone conversations are complete no-no to her. We talked only once by phone.

And don't take me wrong, it is not about our relationship or me specifically, she has the same approach to others as well. She haven't dated anyone for real, has very few friends, and on the top of that some annoying health problems. (which add to her feeling of being worthless)

That's a very brief story. So I am now at this point where I want to... I don't know.... Help her, or at least know how to continue our relationship with healthy approach from my side. (doesn't matter at this point if the relationship will be in more friend-oriented or romantic-oriented). She doesn't want to visit a psychologist, and obviously I can't do anything with it, I respect her decision despite me thinking it's a mistake. So I want to know more, I wonder whether is there any book for people like me, who care but don't want to keep a friend or a partner inside this AS, don't want to make her feel worse/hurt, and don't want to become a wannabe pseudo-therapist to try to change her forcibly. So, subtle way of treating her with respect, understanding and love. I could just simply burst into her with love, bomb her with it but that's something what is going to have a opposite effect.

So, what's my direction? Books, articles, anything please. (as long has some ground in science).",12Dec2020,1

208,"So I am always stressed and a bit sad. 
This started about a month after school started, I was also starting a new school with a different way to do quizzes, this school uses more tests and quizzes than my old school. So you would think that I would just not study as hard for each quiz, but no. You see at the beginning my grades where amazing, I did not get a single question wrong on all my math quizzes for the first month. Bit then my grades started to go down, I think because we where moving into areas my old school did not go into. This maid me go insane and stressed about every test, but that was just what started it. I started to get scared and anxious that I would say I cheated even though I have never(I started to get scared of this when I was convicted of cheating when I did not on a Spanish quiz.) This anxious feelings made my amount of studying go up, but my grade go down.
Math went from 98% to 92%
My Spanish from 90% to 83%
(Quick thing this grade drop is mostly from stress and not getting more harder stuff because on the ungraded practices I almost always got 100% of them right.)
This also made my free time less enjoyable, because I was always stressed about a quiz coming up or a drop in grade or even a raze in grade and wanting to keep them razed. This started it, over thanksgiving break I stayed stressed for no reason this is still happening and I am always stressed for no reason, especially when I became popular and got expectations put on me by my friends and people I did not know in my school. Also my family won’t help as they want me to “banboosle” aka fake my feelings so they can feel better. The only thing that brings me happiness and makes me not stressed is Star Wars and the MCU, which is why I love Friday’s due to mando and my favorite MCU super hero, Wanda aka The scarlet witch, is getting her own show so hopefully that helps me.

211,"I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago. When I was 17 I was in the hospital because of a suicide attempt. While in hospital my mom told me I could not come home and tried to put me in a youth homeless shelter that would of kicked me out in a few months because my 18th birthday was coming up. What I needed at the time was support, but instead my mom showed me how unwanted I was.
When I was in high school my mom said to me multiple times “I can’t live with you like this” in exact words. She always said it at least a few times a week.
When I was first diagnosed with mental illness at the age of 16 I told my mother that I didn’t want anyone to know. At the time when she first learned about my mental illness in my high school guidance counsellor’s office with me she agreed not to tell anyone. Then almost immediately she told 4 of her friends. Her excuses were that one friend “had” to know because her daughter worked in mental health, another excuse was that they also dealt with mental health problems. I don’t understand how that still made it okay to tell them because that does not change the fact that it was something personal that I was going through and had already verbally expressed to her that I did not want anyone else to know. It’s like she was just ignorant and didn’t care.
There have been a couple times where I was hospitalized and she sent people to come visit me whether I knew them or not or wanted them there or not. She even did this when I was in an ICU bed and could barely move. When I was hospitalized she sent one of her friends (who she told immediately about my mental health) to visit me in the mental health ward when I had told my mom I did not want her to visit me. Another time when I was in the mental health ward she showed up to visit me herself, but had some else with her who I had never met before and my mother expected me to talk to her about my mental health, my mother did not even tell me or ask if she could bring her. After that incident I told her not to bring people I don’t know to visit me. One time after that I was in ICU after a suicide attempt and could barley move, she came to visit and again had someone with her who I had never met before and wanted me to talk about my mental health. She continuously was telling others about my mental health and was bringing them to visit me. I had already told her I did not want anyone to know about my mental heath and not to bring people I didn’t know to visit. Again it’s like she was ignorant and didn’t care.
When I was in group therapy around the age of 16 or 17 my mother once tricked me into getting into a car with someone I said I was not comfortable around for the 40 minute drive to therapy. It was a night after school when I had to go to group therapy and as my mother and I were getting ready to go my mom told me Shawn (our neighbour who she had been talking to about dating recently) would be driving I immediately told my mom that I was not comfortable with that, so she told me that he would not be coming. Right before we walked out I even double checked with my mom that he would not be coming and she said he was not coming. Then we go outside and my mom immediately locks the door and there he ready to go. I felt like I would burst in to tears, but my mother just looked and smiled like she was laughing at me. I didn’t want to make a scene or fall apart crying so I held my tears and got in the car. The whole 40 minute drive there and back I cried. I was trying my best to hide it. Our neighbour peaked back a few times without saying anything, I am unsure if he noticed or not. My mother of course didn’t notice anything as she was to busy chatting up our neighbour. When we got home I immediately went to my room and was uncontrollably crying. It felt like I had never cried harder in my life. My mom came in and made sure wasn’t harming myself (which I wasn’t and didn’t plan on doing either) then she didn’t care and later told me that everything with our neighbour would have to go back to normal with him knowing all about my personal mental health.
A few years later after I hadn’t lived with my mom for the 2 years I was gone at college I was about 20 my mom and I were in the kitchen getting veggies for our rabbits. She then aggressively grabbed the kale from me and was holding my arm in such close proximity that when I tried to throw a banana at her to get her to back off I accidentally chipped at tooth, so she called the police and had me arrested, but soon after the charges were dropped when I was found not guilty at court. After that incident I was kicked out. The police report stated that my mother “advised she wishes to have her daughter charged and removed from the home”. That proved to me that my mother just wanted to get rid of me, she literally requested that myself and my belongings be removed from the home.

okay so i  am doing therapy for the 3rd time now and the reason i was supposed to be going was because of ""appearance anxiety"" basically - i was extremely preoccupied with my appearance to the point where i wanted to kill myself , would take selfies obsessively, ask for constant reassurance, OBSESS and ruminate over past looks / outfits &amp; avoid going to school / outside sometimes and would self harm because i felt i was too ugly for anything. now prior to this this had been happening for round about a year.

however now i'm completely over that - in fact it feels like it never even happened. im not 100% fine with my appearance and i still want to die because of it but it's not on my mind completely all of the time - its basivallt to a lesser degre. 

but now i am completely preoccupied with how ""serious"" my mental state is. whether or not i should be in therapy. doubting EVERY single feeling that i have. even sadness. actively trying to make myself more depressed / doing things that i know are unhealthy for me just so i can tell my therapist / other people will notice that i am unwell. everytime i have an okay day or a good day i feel SICK with anxiety and have had several panic attacks/ crying fits over this

i have thought several times about cancelling my thwrapy because i dont feel i need it anymore

214,"Ok so this sounds dumb as I'm typing but oh well it doesn't hurt to ask. 
I was on tiktok and saw this girl making one about her dissociating. Not like a D.I.D or anything but it had mental health tags. 

Now my partner has been increasingly telling me I might want to see a doctor or something because of [ what I call ]  blanking out. Its weird but I've done it for a long time but he says he thinks its been getting worse. He says they've been longer and more frequent, and i mean he's right but I never saw it as something that was harmful. He thinks ima haha like dissappear in my own brain and not come back. I'm mean he's joking but at the same time I think there's a lil worry in that joke. 

Anyways basically my blank outs are just... random. I tried for the past month or so to figure out if its triggered by something but its not, not that I can tell anyways.
I will be talking or chilling and all of a sudden I just space out. I'm not thinking of anything , I don't see anything or hear anything either. I'm functioning and breathing and stuff. Its like the lights are on but no one is home. 

It only lasts a handful of minutes sometimes shorter. The only times I get freaked out is when I kinda like wake up and my partner is practically yelling at me or if I'm driving. 
But like don't we all do that?
Also my partner isn't yelling at me like pissed off or anything. He does it to try to bring me back, get my attention ,also cause he doesn't know what else to do. 


I mean okay maybe its been getting more often. Sometimes I think maybe I'm just being oversimulated. But there's times were ill be having a causal convo with only one person and it happens.
It never happens at work though so it's weird. 
Idk lemme know what you guys think, should I be worried or am I fine and this is completely normal. 

Thanks all.",12Dec2020,1
215,"This is kind of a weird topic, but whenever I drink, I get super depressed and suicidal. Otherwise, right now I feel like my mental health is in check. I have anxiety, but since I’ve been on medication it hasn’t bothered me too much. In the past I’ve had periods of mild depression, but overall right now I feel like I’m doing okay. 

Even so, whenever I have more than a drink or two, my entire perspective changes. I feel like my life is completely crumbling. All of my normal problems become too much to handle, and I feel like I would be better off dead. I always spend the entire time crying and wanting to die. For days after I drink, I feel depressed and awful, and I can’t stop dwelling on my issues. 

Because I always react like this, I’ve almost completely given up drinking, except for small amounts on special occasions. I’m usually fine if I really limit my alcohol. Drinking isn’t a big part of my life, so it doesn’t really bother me to cut it out. 

My question is, does anyone else experience this? Do you think it’s just a weird side effect of alcohol on me? Or that my drunk feelings are actually real, and I just try to push them out during normal life?",12Dec2020,1
216,"i suffer from bpd (borderline personality disorder) and i recently got out of rehab, im impulsive and i get extremely jealous and i seem to really like to ruin my own mental health for some reason. i keep promising myself i wouldnt overthink and hurt my feelings ever again but im just lying to myself at this point. it happened so many times, it went from happening once a week to happening multiple times a day and it really sucks. it all started when i found out my long distance partner was lying to me, he always told me he was busy working and couldnt talk to me but i recently found out him being “busy” was him playing with his friends and talking to a bunch of other girls. and he knows i have bpd and i get very jealous and insecure when he talks to other girls (yes im overprotective and he is too) and him doing that has caused me so much pain and i have some serious trust issues now. i had multiple breakdowns because of what he did and i never told him. i love him too much and i dont wanna make him feel guilty even though hes the reason why it all started. we used to talk, play and just pretty much do everything together all the time, literally. we would stay in a discord call for days without hanging up and watch movies or play all night long. now it all faded away. we still talk and everything, just not as much. ive been up for days now because of how stressed i am due to overthinking. i promised i would stop, promised not to care about it. i lied to myself and now its eating me alive. so far the only way im coping with this is alcohol, A LOT of alcohol. i really hate feeling like this and i want it to stop so bad.",12Dec2020,1

Hello, so I don’t know if I can explain my thoughts but I will try. I am 15 years old and I have never been diagnosed with anything and I never talked with anybody about my mental health, but i want to have some other opinions about my mental health :) I don’t really know where it started but one day I just started to have this pain/sadness/aggression in me...it didn’t start because of a particular reason but it hits started one day. I have obsessive compulsive thoughts since I was like 6 and they always annoyed me but it was never something that needed to be talked about with others. I have never been diagnosed with ocd or anything like that. I’m normally somebody who never talks about themselves and I don’t want to but I just wanted to try. One day I started harming myself, in the beginning it was nothing serious but it ended up getting worse...the harm was just something that helped me out and had nothing to do with the ocd but one the one of my obsessive thoughts was to make a certain amount of cuts for my obsessive thoughts. That’s something which really made it all worse. I just wanted to share some of my thoughts and maybe some people have advice for what I can do. If I said anything that does not fit in to this Reddit or which is to triggering, pls delete my text or report it. Thank you in advance:)",12Dec2020,1
219,"Hi guys. I live in Wales in the UK so responses from those living within the UK would be best!

I have been in the mental health system since the age of 13 and I am now 21. I was diagnosed with panic disorder, depression and PTSD at around 14/15. I believe there may either be a personality disorder present or something else. My symptoms are deteriorating and I am so angry with the mental health system here. I have been asking for an assessment as I have been struggling a lot and things don't seem to be getting any better. They told me that in order for me to get an assessment, I need to 'not respond to a combination of psychological treatments like medication and counselling etc'. This makes no sense to me because I have tried 5 different antidepressants and they either don't work, give me bad side effects or numb me so much that it just isn't worth taking. Along with that, I have had counselling 3 times. I am regularly self-harming, I have a breakdown at least once every 2-3 days. My intrusive thoughts become more vivid and my suicidal thoughts are getting intense. I have been referred for counselling AGAIN and they've put me on an anxiety and distress tolerance course which I am waiting to hear back from. I have been referred to my community mental health team for the third time this year, and they have rejected my referral. 3 mental health professionals have told me I need DBT but unfortunately it has been discontinued in my area due to 'high demand'. Don't think the NHS have the resources. I have contacted a private hospital to get prices and see if they can offer me an assessment of some sort. Doctors etc keep telling me ""diagnosis isn't important"" but it is to me. I need answers. It's been too long and I know something isn't right. I show symptoms of BPD and Avoidant PD. I avoid looking online but I did do some tests which show 70-80% chance I may have these disorders. I feel failed by the system. It's hard to keep fighting and have hope when even the professionals won't help. I am considering going private but I am currently out of work deemed 'limited in capability' due to deterioration in my mental health so money is a bit of a problem at the moment. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated because I am so close to just completely giving up and just suffering at this point... and who knows what that'll lead to.",12Dec2020,1

I’m coming to the final year before I have to make a decision on what I am doing with the rest of my life. I wish I had proper friends to talk about this with, or friends who at least text me to ask how I am. Or is that too much to ask? I feel like such a burden to everyone and my family.

224,"I (26F) am a registered nurse and graduated 2.5 years ago. I started off on a general medical-surgical floor to gain experience and found myself shortly thereafter promoted to charge nurse due to seniority rather than based on experience. I stayed there for 1.5 years before deciding I needed to move on due to concerns of my mental well-being, the lack of support, lack of learning opportunities, and safety concerns. I was also concerned about my lack of competency as a charge nurse in situations that required experience. 

Beginning of this year I moved to a clinic for more stable hours, more consistency, hoping for an environment where I had growth opportunities, safety was a priority, and I felt listened to. I also chose to do this for my mental health as I was dealing with compassion fatigue from my previous job due to the situations that took place there. I went from working 12-hour shifts to 8-hours shifts. From working 3 days a week to 5. But I get to go home from work for dinner. 

As I transitioned into the clinic, COVID hit and everything was turned upside down. My training ended early due to people being pulled from our clinic to help with COVID testing which left us short staffed. I entered a new work environment unable to see how it normally ran on a day to day basis. Everyone pulled together to make the stressful transitions work and for safety precautions to be put in place. 

After several months and our other coworkers returned to us from the testing site we settled into a routine. I found my niche in the clinic with patient care and education. 

However as we settled down everyone started showing their true colors. The workplace became toxic, more so that my previous position. Bullying has been occurring, including to me. Accusations, blaming-shifting, name calling. It has felt unprofessional and immature. In the short time I have been there we have lost over half the of staff who have left for other positions.

Patients are exhausted and worn out from COVID and the precautions in place. Not a day goes by where I’m not yelled out, cursed at, argued with, questioned, or ridiculed by a patient because I have asked them politely to respect the precautions. It has become exhausting and wearing me down.

I have a history with depression and anxiety about 6 years ago. I have worked hard on self-care habits. But with the environment so toxic and the patient care becoming draining I have no more energy to give. I know I need to get out before I’m burnt out. I have severe compassion fatigue that I feel myself lacking empathy and feeling more cynical and judgmental. And I am a very compassionate and empathetic person. 

I am also a HSP (highly sensitive person) which has not helped as I am drained, exhausted, and experience physical side effects to to the situation. I have begun to experience chest pain, loss of sleep, constant nausea, under-eating or overeating, weight gain, lack of motivation, etc. Self care is a huge priority and up until this point I have been so faithful to exercise, journal, get proper sleep and nutrition on a daily basis. Now I am lacking the energy and motivation. 

I know I need to get out but I don’t know where to go or what to do. I have no energy to work on my resume and apply to other place. I don’t know what I want to do in nursing. I pursued nursing because I could help others and I thought there would be a lot of growth opportunities. I don’t really have a passion for one particular field of nursing so a lot of areas don’t interest me. To be honest, I grew up telling people I would never be a nurse. I would love to find a way to combine my degree with my passion for fitness, but I don’t even know where to begin. 

This week I had a small mental breakdown at work because I was so tired from the lack of sleep and the mental exhaustion. Coffee just doesn’t cut it anymore. I canceled date night with my boyfriend this week because I don’t have the energy. And I took today off from work because I just can’t do it. I’ve already cried twice today and just want to sleep, but my body won’t let me. I’ve been up since 0330 this morning. 

I just don’t know what to do, who to turn to, or what to do next. I just don’t have energy to give to others let alone to take care of myself. I’m just fucking tired.",12Dec2020,1
225,"She's someone I love and care about very much, she's basically my sister. We speak every night after school (I am online-schooled now, we used to go to the same school) and I know she is someone who is very depressed due to her family and the terrible environment at her school. Around two days ago, she was found in one of the classroom of the ground floor in a gruesome state with blood everywhere, I only found out today that she had stabbed herself in one eye with one of the science classroom equipment I believe (this happened in the morning, and she wasn't displaying any weird behavior at all that week or the night before as I spoke with her until we fell asleep). This bit of detail I find very strange, but the principal of the school found her and he usually doesn't go around that area (and he is known for being a bit of a creep), but I don't want to make any wild accusations as when I spoke with her today she and the doctors believe that she herself did this to her, I'm just including that detail for context and your inputs. Also, the school does have a history of perverted teachers.  


She isn't someone that would do something like that EVER, unless of course she had a complete manic episode but she's never displayed such behavior in the past. I find it so strange specifically that she attempted to do that to herself via hurting her head and eye, especially the fact that she attempted such a thing at school; it is so unlike her and I was extremely shocked! She has had incidents since I have known her (since we were around 13/14, we're 17/18 now), where she had 'paranormal' incidents around her house such as hearing screaming in the middle of the night; hearing strange footsteps, feeling like something is strangling her in her sleep etc...   
For this past year, she started smoking weed a lot on the regular. I don't know if she has any family history of schizophrenia (I don't think she does as far as I know, but I know that her mother has BPD, not the same thing at all I know but I feel I should include it), and I know that marijuana does enhance the effects of schizophrenia if it is in her family history.  


Since I've known her, she has had childhood trauma due to multiple incidents that have happened to her through her life. She is someone who is depressed, but whenever she feels this way she always calls me crying and venting. She once told me, around when the first lockdown happened she was having paranormal incidents occur with her; at that time she said, ""If I kill myself, just know it wasn't me. If I was feeling suicidal, I would tell you.""  
Another thing is that, ever since she started smoking weed constantly, she would tell me she has feelings that, in her own words, ""I feel as if I'm not actually here, it's as if I'm watching someone else be me but I can't describe it.""   
I didn't take this very seriously, but upon googling this dissociative feeling she described can be associated with DID or Schizophrenia, but I'm really not sure. When I spoke to her today, she said she doesn't remember what happened at all, she thinks for sure that it was her but she doesn't remember it at all. Also, 10 minutes before she did this to herself, she texted one of her friends at school something really normal like ""Oo are my headphones too loud when I listen to music in the halls""  
LITERALLY 10 minutes before, and I find that so strange; I did google that schizophrenia symptoms can cause someone to be paranoid and hear things louder, but I feel like that message is so trivial and she has messaged me something exactly like that when she was in a good mood. 

Upon all of this, what do you all think? Is it some form of mental illness? Is it something paranormal? I'm really not sure, but I am really concerned for her. Thank God she survived, keep her in your prayers please, and finally her mother is taking her out of that Godforsaken school.",12Dec2020,1

Last time she came in, she literally said ""you're like a fat person"", and my Dad had to shout at her the last 2 times, to tell her to leave me alone.

233,"i feel so off all the time. i'm young, i'm still in high school, but i feel empty, and yet at the same time, not empty at all. it's so perpetual. i'm happy and sad at the same time. 

i have plenty of friends, but i feel like i don't really care about them. even though i know they care about me, i feel like i can't trust anyone. i can never reciprocate it, so i try to or pretend to but truthfully don't really. 
that's not to say i don't care about people. i care about strangers and i care about civil rights and am outspoken. when people are hurting, especially people i know, i try my best to help them. i want to be a doctor because i want to help people, and it's a real desire. i genuinely want to heal people and make them feel good again. not so i can have glory, but so people can be happy with their health. i'm not not-empathetic, but i just feel like i don't care about my own friends as much as/the way they care about me. it makes me feel fake. 

i just don't hold the idea of friends the same way other people do. to me, friends are not more important than family and friends are not more trustworthy than family. but even with my family i put on a mask because i want them to feel like i'm happy so that they don't feel sad. i really am happy with my family, but i'm a very simple person whose emotions from other potions of life will show through, regardless of the situation. 

with some friends, i just feel angry about everything, even little things. i just feel irrationally annoyed by things they do and i want to cut them off, but i never can because i feel guilty or because we have mutual friends. i don't know if i have anger issues. maybe i do. 

all of this and at the same time, i feel like i don't have friends. probably going back to the feeling that i can't trust anyone. it feels lonely. maybe it's because i feel like a second choice to a lot of people. i don't like having to be labeled and stuck to one person, because i've lived that way and i hated being suffocated. but without a ""friend group"" i feel like i'm not a priority to anyone. it feels petty. i want to have my cake and eat it too. 

i've never been to a therapist and i'm scared to because i'm not good at talking about my own feelings with people if i'm not joking/ talking about my perception of an event/occurrence/current circumstance. essentially i mean i can talk about feeling depressed or something more vulnerable, but i can talk about ""wanting to die"" because of my homework or about feeling angry  because of a new bill passed or feeling sad about the loss of a person or character or animal.

i'm always careful about what i say online or in conversations for god knows what reason. maybe i'm paranoid colleges will find me or something. but then i think about college and ask why i'm doing this. i'm going to go to college and do what for the rest of my life? why am i even here? i want to go to college, i want to experience life and i want to learn more about something, i want to feel everything i was promised. but i can't help but feel like none of it matters and that i'm never going to feel content. 

i feel like i miss out on high school experiences because of how focused i am or because of how weird i feel around my friends, but i also don't really want ""standard"" high school experiences. and yet at the same time i do. i'm lost. 

i want to be out of high school and honestly, out of life. i didn't really ask to exist. it's so hard and it feels so lonely.

The autistic traits have been there since childhood, but I feel that the isolation has amplified them.

For example, when I see a picture of people crying because of a shooting incident, I feel not the emotions I used to have. It has gone worse. The response is just 'propositional', there is no emotional response.

For example, when my boss asks me how I feel during a performance review, that is a really hard question.

COVID-19 numbers don't give me a reaction anymore.

I don't care whether the weekend has begun.

I feel numb all the time. I don't really enjoy reading about the things I used to.

I also suspect that emotions regulate what seems important. It seems to me that I can't find things that are meaningful anymore.

I am going to see a psychotherapist in two weeks. Are there online resources that seem a good match for the sort of problem I have?

Are there sorts of meditation that help with this?",12Dec2020,1
240,"As time goes by, I feel like I'm getting more and more impulses from multiple sources, preventing me to relax and calm down after a long day.

Everywhere you go you see advertising, Facebook is full of energetic pictures, babies, smiles, colours, happiness... YouTube is full of flashy thumbnails and text, yelling, enthousiasm... Instagram is full of people either launching propaganda, advertising, getting naked or feeling offended. Everything is about engagement and capturing your interest, making you spend your time on posts and articles, making you feel angry, happy... and I feel exhausted. Extremely exhausted about what the social norm is and what I'm spending my time on. I can't catch my breath or just feel okay.

I miss the time when I was younger, when you had to look for news if you wanted news and where you had to look for forums when you wanted to discuss something. Now everything is in your face and I can't seem to get a break. Everybody suddenly has a platform, no matter how smart, dumb, extreme or assertive he/she is.

242,"I have been having mental issues for, basically forever. And i think one thing that might be holding me back from getting better is the idea that i have to be sad to be loved? In the way of, for example:

Why would anyone compliment me if I'm not insecure? 
Why would anyone want me to be happy if I'm not sad?
Why would anyone want me to feel safe if I don't feel scared? 
Why would anyone want to take care of me if I don't need it?
Why would anyone stay with me if I'm not alone otherwise? 

I have this yearning for being loved and comforted etc and i just don't see why anyone would do that if I am happy... Which... I don't think is the right way to go about it 😅

243,"I’ve struggled with lots of mental health issues and really low self esteem. I’ve always had classic imposter syndrome and every single time something good has happened to me I’ve been convinced I was a fraud. Even when I graduated university I was convinced I didn’t deserve it. 

I’ve applied for a really good job where they take on less than 1% of applicants. I applied purely for experience because I didn’t think I’d get it. 2 interviews, 7 aptitude tests, 2 business tests, 2 technical tests, and a presentation later, I’ve just found out I have a final interview with the CEO next month. 

For the first time ever I’m beginning to think that I am good enough? A huge part of me still thinks that I’m a fraud and I’ve somehow faked my way through all these tests, and soon they’ll see the truth. But logically I can see that’s ridiculous.

244,"So a couple years back I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety. I started taking Zoloft and it did change my life. About a year and a half ago I finally stopped taking it because I no longer felt depressed. The past few months since August i’ve started having severe anxiety. It made me not want to even talk to people or know how to talk to people. I dread going out having to have social interactions with people and think about how to behave. Which makes me feel like I’m coming off weird to them, which I feel extremely awkward. I definitely feel like it’s social anxiety, which I’ve had this before. Is this a part of maybe I need to be medicated? I reached out to a professional and she prescribed me Lexapro and Clonidine. However, I’ve been off medication for a year and a half, and I have fear of going back on because it was so hard to get off of it and reclaim my life unmedicated.

245,"I’ve recently been going through a bit of a mental health crisis. With school starting again, me leaving a toxic friend group, and exams next month- I’ve been stressed, which leads to near crippling self doubt and depression for me. I told my parents last January about my mental health issues, but little has been done because of Covid and me feeling generally good during lockdown. 

Today, my parents started to get annoyed with me for my room being messy with a bunch of old water bottles that I forgot to bring down. My dad was shocked for some reason and my  mom said “it’s just laziness!”. I almost fired back “no. It’s depression and me being barely able to do normal tasks during that day, never mind remembering to bring water bottles down.”  Of course I didn’t say that. I just nodded and brought the water bottles down and was way less productive today than I thought I would be (sat in a chair for most of the day because I couldn’t find the motivation to do much until I  played with my dog).

Now it been 1 years i do absolutely nothing. Canada was in lockdown i lost my job and the governement gave people quite good money for average people. So it was great. I did not have to risk because i have immune system problem plus who want to catch this and infect you're loved one.

So yeah ive pretty much only being stuck with my GF doing nothing we did a couple trips to cool off but i felt something missing. A core to my life but now i am at my house, you can not visit people or you might het a huge fine, everyone is scared. So i pretty much see no one except my mom and GF. 

Every stored is pretty much closed in a way, no activity, no friends , no social at all plus it cold outside so i only game and watch youtube for a years now. Yup i can't anymore ive lost all motivation i feel like an empty shell. :( cheers to you all

I know some people lived worst than this. But oufff i feel really like a welfare guys but the thing there 0 to do except work or go walk at the mall. Or maybe friends but i have no one sadly now.

257,"I dont talk irl as much. Everything described was online but it applies to my irl life as well. Also if you see word insult it probably doesn't mean the worst insult ever. It can be a more general word that I use to indicate that I made someone upset about the way I told them pure fact.

I have this constant problem that started occurring to me more and more frequently and the worst part is I only realise that I am insulting people even in damn big ways only after the fact. 

It doesn't say in the rules or I didn't see it but I am pretty sure you can't give me any kind of diagnosis/advice that looks like diagnosis here. And you shouldn't. Please leave this to my doctor.

So I really need to show up to someone who can help me sort out and at least educate me on what I am. Because at this point I loose track of what is considered average human behavior and what is not. And I intentionally say average because in my definition of normal I AM normal and it is you that has some quirks. Don't take this personally. I am saying that to vent it of and to give you some remote understanding. Remote because you will never get it fully.

So one of the recent things I messed up was intended as a joke but I would have never thought it was a terrible one. I am not gonna say what it is because i will get so much judgment on that but that is the point! I would have never thought it was a bad idea.

In my selfish version of what is okay to say this seemed like an okayish thing. But it was only after I said that I got so much judgment. I didn't quite understand the core of the problem until I said too much and it was when I left.

It is so terrible not being able to assess what people would think and if I should probably not say things. And even if I do now that it will be a terrible idea i still do it. I just see it as ""Oh, this probably would be okay, I don't think it is a big deal"". And the worst part? Big deal or not people get upset.

And I don't complain. At this point I want to show my perspective and explain how it gets in the way of my normal life so think of all this as an honest confession of how i struggle and what i feel.

So because people get upset i get upset and at this point it is finally because i want to be with people. I don't want to be that thing that upsets other people. I want to talk to my friends and not think before every single message if this will make them think that I insult them. I want to be like everyone as everyone just doesn't even think to say some stuff. But I even though I know that might upset people still do it. I just dont feel anything. I only feel it after I am upset because someone is upset. Such a loop I need to somehow get out of.

Also one more thing. I sometimes say things in a way that I know I should not. But I am just trying to state a pure fact. Like ""go to #channel"" doesn't mean that I am kicking you out or whatever you think I am doing. It is just my way of saying ""Hey i think you are being in the way of us talking and there is #chanel that you can take your convo to"". But that is just too many redundant words. Why type all that when you can just say ""pls go to #channel"". Obviously that is the least if my problems.",12Dec2020,1
258,"----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My mate has given me until the second week of January to get help or she's gonna report my self harm to the safeguarding team at our school. But honestly, the idea of getting proper help has sent me into panic attacks before. Yeah, I'm normally quite good at handling it, but there was one time it was almost obvious.

Honestly, I (15F) probably do need help. But my fucked up mental health is probably gonna be another thing that's gonna go against my mum. It isn't even her fault though, its probably my own. It makes more sense when it is. I don't know how to explain it. I guess I struggle to feel things, or I just don't feel anything. Sometimes I do, but that's often a short blast of intense emotion. The rest of the time I just try and fake it for what would work in that situation. It's the same with what I say aswell, I just don't wanna say something wrong or do something wrong.  I don't care about things I'm probably meant to, like my grades. I can't help people (and I'm meant to be a young career), I can't seem to function, I'm failing, I can't get anything right lately. I'm just a shit person really. I think that's what it is. I can't seem to communicate properly, since having to do 1:1 tutoring I've been having some sort of panic attack almost weekly cause I'm that incapable of just getting over it and dealing with it like I'm meant to. I make no sense half the time anyway, how do I explain my thought process to someone who doesn't know me when I don't know how the fuck I got to that answer either. It sucks cause I cant seem to formulate my own opinion and ideas anymore, I'm scared to more than anything cause I don't wanna be wrong, I think that's why I'm failing at English . I can't sleep properly either, that probably isn't helping. Maybe I'm just a shit person, that would make a lot more sense.

Then again, I don't wanna go to a professional and tell them I'm struggling. My mum would just get the blame, she'd loose us for no reason over than me being fucked up. They've threatened and criticised her so much, they've said so much bullshit about her own abilities because of her mental health that they probably won't even give her a chance.

I don't know what to do anymore though. I tried writing about it way before it got so much worse, but my mum just read it. I can't talk about it cause I don't understand it, I can't explain it. The self care stuff is useless to me, it doesn't work cause I'm just that bad of a person. Its either get help, or just let my mate report me. Its not like she's gonna find out anymore anyway, I'm done. I'm not gonna keep the deal, I'm trying to stop self harm anyway but if I do again I'll just say I'm still clean. It's easier that way. 

Besides, I've got three years untill the only person who can get blamed for it is myself. I'd probably be fine by then though, so it doesn't really matter.",12Dec2020,1
259,"Hi everyone, I’ve been dealing with my own mental health issues since I was a teenager. Now as a 30 year old adult with two young children, I find it’s almost worse now than when I was younger. I have a great psychiatrist and therapist who’ve been very supportive of me in pinpointing what’s going on. I, on the other hand, are struggling with the realization that I may have a mood disorder such as bipolar. No one in my immediate family has ever been formally diagnosed with bipolar or any mood disorder. 

My main issues are that I can’t concentrate, I’m extremely forgetful, and my moods will fluctuate constantly from either being super happy and excited to depressed and extremely irritable. When I’m happy, I feel like I can get anything and everything done and I just genuinely feel on top of the world. I feel like I have a ton of energy and just want to go, go, go!  It’s when I come down from those “happy” feelings that I crash and become very irritable at everyone around me. This is when I tend to start fights with my husband or become extremely depressed.

Please tell me I’m not the only one who ever gets like this?! Also, do you feel this could be a bipolar issue?",12Dec2020,1

262,"okay so yesterday i got high and i was listening to my music like i always do. But this panic at the disco song came on and started scaring the shit outta me. 

The song was ""she held the world"" and ill put the lyrics in this post but as I was listening to the lyrics, trying to get into the music, I started to see pedophilic scenarios in my head? it was like a music video of this father and his daughter and he had two sides which equated to the two voices in the song. 

She Had the World Lyrics 

“She held the world upon a string
But she didn't ever hold me
Spun the stars on her fingernails
But it never made her happy
Cause she couldn't ever have me
She said she won the world at a carnival
But she could never win me
Cause she couldn't ever catch me”

this made me think of a couple at a fair carnival thing w their daughter. the mom didn't ever love the dad but she tried, it just didn't make her happy being with him. so she gave that earth balloon - world on a string - to the little girl and vanished. the little girl won the world at the carnival but she couldn't ever win her mom cause she couldn't catch her. 



“I, I know why
Because when I look in her eyes
I just see the sky
When I look in her eyes
Well I, just see the sky”

this part, he said this because the daughter is shorter than the dad and when she looks up at him he'd only be able to see the sky instead of himself, but when I explained this to my friend and she went ""or maybe her eyes are just blue?""

 “I don't love you I'm just passing the time
You could love me if I knew how to lie
But who could love me?
I am out of my mind
Throwing a line out to sea
To see if I can catch a dream”

he doesn't love her as a father should but if he learned to lie about the monster he is, she'd be able to love him the way a daughter should. But how could she love him if he's sick? how could anyone love him if he's sick? trying to create this dream of them...

“The sun was always in her eyes
 She didn't even see me
But that girl had so much love
She'd wanna kiss you all the time
Yeah, she'd wanna kiss you all the time”

again referring to her looking up at him but she doesn't see him - this time talking about the sick person on the inside, she doesn't even see the bad person he is - but it was cause she was so young and impressionable. she doesn't know any better but to see her dad as her dad. the last line self-explanatory.

 “She said she won the world at a carnival
But I'm sure I didn't ruin her
Just made her more interesting
I'm sure I didn't ruin her
Just made her more interesting”

she was hurt  for the first time at a carnival but he doesn't think it has ruined - traumatized - her just made her ""more interesting""

 “I don't love you I'm just passing the time
You could love me if I knew how to lie
But who could love me?
I am out of my mind
Throwing a line out to sea
To see if I can catch a dream”

after listening to this song for what felt like 5 years, I turned my music off because I was indescribably uncomfortable with what my head just put together. I saw it in so much detail as if it was a movie and it made me feel so uneasy. i went to my friends and was like ""uhhh i just listened to this song and now I'm scared"" and I tried to explain it but then I started to get super scary thoughts about me being a pedophile, myself. 

then one of my friends said that the thoughts I was having are probably intrusive thoughts, so i looked it up. I started thinking about why could be having these thoughts and google didn't say they came from anything specific lmao that's why I'm here. 

but my mind said it's gotta be one of the two: im just paranoid cause of this high or I'm recovering memories from a traumatic point in my life...? 

And i started remembering another time when i was high how i was scared of my brother cause i thought he touched me when i was younger. and that spiraled into me thinking that the intrusive thoughts might be from me trying to normalize the pedophilic things that happened when i was younger. 

for as long as i can remember I've been crazily uncomfortable around just about everyone but especially men? especially recently. 

i really can't contain my thoughts right now I'm trying to organize this enough to make it make sense to someone else's head. but maybe something happened to me in that time in my childhood that i have absolutely no memory of and it was so bad that my mind made me forget about it. and so subconsciously, I'm trying to normalize it with these creepy thoughts. and when i started thinking this i was like that would make sense as to why I'm so passive in 'sexual' settings. 

maybe I'm remembering things because I've been getting into spirituality and getting high but also... what if I'm just high as fuck and paranoid.",12Dec2020,1
263,"I am a 19 year old male in college. I have 3 other roommates living in the apartment with me and ones behavior has been odd for the last day. He has always been very suspicious of people but never this bad. Yesterday afternoon, one of my other roommates got picked up by his sister and called and told me he left his jacket. When I grabbed his jacket and was going downstairs to give it to him, he starts freaking out about how his phone was gone. He proceeded to come with me down the elevator demanding I give him his phone back and blankly staring at me. I dial his number and hand the jacket off to my other roommate who came back to get it and immediately begins talking about how I stole his phone. He literally thought we plotted to steal his phone and I was handing it off to him in his jacket and asked me the whole way back up the elevator why we did that to him. I told him again I didn’t have it and he ended up finding his phone on the bed in his room. Afterwards, I go to help my other remaining roommate with a final in the living room for online classes. We were googling answers and what not and then my roommate starts up with how we’re texting each other and started saying he knows I want to kill him and starts asking why we want to hurt him. We try to reassure him but to no avail. Flash forward two or three hours to that night with a group of our friends and we were all having a couple drinks watching a movie and in the middle he yells at me and my other roommate “I’m not gay!” And is convinced we think he’s gay. We ask him why and he just says “I can hear you guys talking about me” even though no one was and tells us that he can “hear everything” and knows we’re plotting on doing something to him. On the way back he starts asking me and my other friend why we’re not looking in the eye and said he can tell we’re lying about everything even though we never said anything above or anything remotely close, he became very argumentative and hostile and wouldn’t even slightly buy into the idea that he was just being paranoid.

264,"Self Beliefs. They Come from outside of just us. Release the connection of Ego, thinking we are the creator, we aren't.

  
The difference of opinion will always be there, thats literally what it is in itself, a difference of opinion. Neither or are right, neither or are wrong, unless you are racist, homophobic, transphobic........anyway. The thing about opinions is that when conversation is stirred between that, we forget to stop and think for a second that it is being shared, rather than we are being attacked verbally. This takes time, but should not hinder our opinion, how we feel and what we know is true for ourselves.

  
There will always be differences from what we believe and thats ok, because at the start and the end of each day, I would truly not just hop on along with the status quo. That won't provide any growth, realization, progress, peace, happiness, love for self and who I was/ created to be. **BE YOU. Stay True.** With difference of opinion you will be shown who is truly on your side and who never really was but made it seem like they were. This is all ok as well. family, best friends, friends, pals, acquaintances, strangers etc., are sometimes only meant for a season, for a moment of time. We learn through it all.

  
I have had many friends in my life, come, stay and go. I used to be so caught up and feel so down, that I wasted time, that, that friendship was pointless, but now I have come to learn and accept, that as long as I am always doing my best, treating people the way I want to be treated, than all I can focus on is what I learned from this moment of time, as well as releasing the need to carry baggage into the next relationship, occurrence. 

  
Stay true to you and stay true to what you believe in. There are many people waiting for you and your authenticity.

266,"Lately I've been realizing that I get overly attached to people really easily. I thought this was a normal thing but turns out its not?  One example of this is would an ex girlfriend, I used to always wanna be around her even when I know I couldn't, I had to know where she was or I would be desperate, but not in a manipulative sense, but in a ""are you ok, i miss you"" type of way.  I recently realized that attachment disorders exist.  And I've been asking myself if maybe I have one but I haven't been able to find any information of this on teenagers. I constantly seek out for new people to be able to help me with my problems and be friends with me. I'm constantly scared of people leaving me for I did dumbest things or people being mad at me for even dumber things. I also have ADHD and I'm very sensitive to rejection. I'm scared that everyone around me secretly hates me or finds me annoying. After my Ex and I broke up I found myself in an even deeper depression, but at the same time feeling absolutely empty inside. A week later I got into a  ""relationship""  What somebody else. Now I'm scared that hes constantly going to leave me even though he makes it very clear that he does not wanna leave me. I find myself being overly attached to him every day to the point when I can't do anything by myself without needing somebody else's specially his opinion on things we and end up talking for hours and hours on the phone which is a nice thing to do but the problem with that is but I find myself getting more attached everyday.  This has got into the point we're at the slightest inconvenience can happened and I will be going on a spiral, because i miss him.  I don't know if this is helpful but for extra information as a child and as a Karen teenager I am emotionally physically And mentally abused by my parents.  I never receaved enough love in my childhood  Which is why I'm constantly looking for new people to talk to in I'm desperately always trying to find a relationship or a group of friends to fit into.   I am also a horrible overthinker this has gotten to the point where every single smile look compliment or word that I receive turns into a crooked lie.  In my mind I know the things that people say are genuine but I can't help but feel like they're not. I always thought this was normal but I guess it's not and I'm really struggling to find something that I can fit into something to make me understand myself better of any one relates to this, or has any idea of what I'm going through  Please comment something I really need to start understanding myself better.

I usually cry out of sadness everyday, but today, I cried of happiness! My father finally looked at me and my life in a good way! He appreciated me, and I don’t feel like such a stuff up anymore! I did a caricature drawing and he was extremely proud, so he gave me his special art set which includes charcoal, a heck ton of paint, 3 caricature books, and a bunch of drawing things! I know this isn’t much but it means the world to me, for me to finally be appreciated, accepted.

I hope everyone is doing well in these hard times, have a wonderful day or night, stay safe!",12Dec2020,1

269,"So one of my girlfriends exploded at me the other day. I was joking around about something I realise now was quite serious for them and she became emotional and furious completely ripped into me as a response in front of our other friends, telling me its just not a good thing to do and that it needed to be said. I apologised to her and things calmed down after a while and went back to normal. When she left though I suddenly felt all the stress of the event coming back to me. No matter how hard I tried I kept thinking about it and feeling completely overwhelmed and horrible. I couldn't sleep and wanted to harm myself and was experiencing suicidal ideation a little bit. Everyone told me to move on from it and that it was said to me out of stress and I shouldn't take it to heart, and I know this is correct, but I can't help it? I still feel as though I am in emotional shock. I woke up the next morning and felt much better, but then again later in the day suddenly started feeling really awful again. I keep remembering specific lines of things she said to me and how upsetting the event was. I keep losing my appetite and not wanting to get up and go take a shower for example because it will remind me of the event more. I logically know that everyone makes mistakes and I should move on but for some reason it really shocked me to my core and I feel very literally unable to get over it or stop feeling scared because of it.  How do you recover from emotional shock like this?",12Dec2020,1
270,So I've been thinking about future a lot recently and about skills and knowledge we acquire and if it's worth it if it isn't permanent. I know it sounds like a stupid thought because nothing is really permanent the whole universe will stop one time but hear me out. So I've been working out lately and I did get into pretty decent shape to the point a lot of people started admiring my physique and complimenting on it. And it makes me feel really good but deep down I'm always anxious or somewhat scared of the fact some day I will not have time or energy to do this anymore and all those hard workout sessions are gonna go to waste? And also I wanted to start learning piano but when I get a job I might travel a lot and every time I would travel a lot of that skill would be lost and this just makes me question it. Is it worth it to chase something we might lose forever one day?,12Dec2020,1

272,"sorry, I'm posting again, I just really need some support. yesterday I got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and I still feel really sad/uncomfortable/weird/shooked about it, just typing the word is hard. I have had some very rare and few hallucinations. 2 of them were when I was having sleep paralysis so I wouldn't count them as part of my mental illness right? they were that I saw a floating doctor looking down at me, and I saw big black spiders crawling at my wall and disappearing into thin air. The other hallucination I had while being awake and 100% sober. I see furniture/objects moving like a waving motion? kinda looks like it's breathing. I sometimes see a black shadow thing moving in the corner of my eye and see nothing when I quickly look. When I see things in the distance I can sometimes think it looks like something else, like a trash bag, can look like a shadow of a man. I don't hear voices, I hear my thoughts out loud almost as if I'm speaking, but it's very quiet and soft? but isn't that normal that you can hear your own thinking? I'm scared of the moon, the stars, the sun, everything in the sky. I'm scared it will fall down on me. I'm suicidal but scared of dying. I suffer from existential crises. I can sometimes get distorted from reality and feel like nothing is real. sometimes I can't remember if things happened or it was a dream. I sometimes think that people are lying to me and are actors in my life pretending to be my boyfriend an example. So as I understood she told me I'm at the beginning of it and it could get really bad if I don't get medicated. I'm 19f and she told me it is around this age you get it normally? I'm just scared that this is the wrong diagnosis, I thought I had depression and some anxiety. I'm scared that I shouldn't have told her about the shadow of the corner of my eye cause it only happened 2 times, I feel like I fucked up the diagnose but saying that? do I really have schizophrenia, please help. I feel like I'm not worthy of even being here, when I see people with this disorder they are haunted and see scary monsters etc. I just had some very few hallucinations and just mostly suffer from feeling distortions from reality? does anybody else have it kinda like me? if anybody wants to chat I would love to, I really need to talk with someone. My family and boyfriend are supportive but I really wanna talk with someone who has experience. Have a good day.",12Dec2020,1

275,"I'm sure many of you heard the advice ""do some sport it'll help you"". Well, it will. But it's hard to force yourself to train, especially when you feel depressed. However, there is a physical activity that doesn't require much effort but provides some benefits. I'm talking about walking.

This year was tough for me (because of obvious reasons, but also personal issues). I had a depression episode at the end of the summer, and I drank heavily through most of the year. I decided to cut drinking, so I stopped this month and didn't drink anything since 30/11. I'm not dependent on booze but still, I became more irritated and anxious. Drinking a lot of beer every evening was my way to cope with boredom, anxiety, stress, and bad mood. So I started to go for long walks almost every day, something between 4 and 10 kilometers. And it really helps me to deal with bad emotions. It clears my mind, calms me, and makes my mood better. 

When I was depressed in August, it was hard for me to deal with daily duties. I didn't study, left my temporary work (I was paid well but the work was stressful and I just couldn't function). My apartment was messed up. Sometimes I tried to ""get my shit together"", and cleaned the apartment, but it happened once in a while when I had a little more energy. And sometimes I went for a walk in the evening. It was hard because I was tired all the time, but sometimes I succeeded to force myself to do it, and when I did, I felt better. At least I felt less shitty.

Walk, walk, walk. Walk in the city, walk in nature, walk with or without music. This is good for your health, both physical and mental. It won't cure your problems, but it can help you to feel better. Even a little help is help. I know some of you are just not able to get out of bed, but if you're able to, it's worth trying. Good luck and keep care of yourself.",12Dec2020,1
276,"During my early years, I was in an abusive relationship with someone most would call a friend. They would beat, hit, burn, scratch, bite, stomp, and choke me every time I was around them which was almost each day. The reason I kept going back was because I had no other ‘friends’ and so I formed a warped view of friendship. I had gone through this for nine years until I escaped this relationship. Since then, I have had people in my life who were acquaintances at best, I can’t form anything more serious than that for reasons I still do not understand. I have never been in a romantic relationship nor do I have a good bond with my parents. I have tried time and again to make friends but it has never worked out. All I would like is to isolate myself from the rest of humanity and live alone.",12Dec2020,1
277,"This is my first post and I just wanted to ask, does seeing self harm scars make your throat dry up or feel closed up?

I used to have scars and they have faded already (thats how long ive been clean) but seeing them on people makes me feel almost like throwing up and wanted to know why I have this reaction. I don't really get the urge when I see them nor do I think they're ""ugly"" but it's just this feeling I'm trying to understand and process especially because I know for some people, part of the healing is having it exposed.

278,"I have a lot of confusing feelings and actions and I don’t know what it means about me any more 

I can be very happy sometimes, a little euphoric but because of real things around me, and then I can feel very low and down and have no energy 

Anytime I get high I feel awful afterwards but I can’t stop doing it x2 a week because I’m bored 

I fantasise about a number of things, sometimes cutting my neck open at school and going to hospital and getting stitches for a self harm injury, or from passing out in public and waking up with people around me. I don’t know whether I desperately need attention, whether I have munchausens or whether I don’t feel cared for 

I used to get bad feelings of dread and every noise and feeling made me feel angry but I started SSRIs and it made it go away (thank god)

I can plan to cut myself at school the next day but the next day comes and I’m so happy, too happy to do anything 

I used to have an eating disorder, maybe. I went to the doctor and was treated for one for a year almost but I didn’t think I actually had one and the doctor was just humouring me

For context I’m 18 and my mum died when I was a kid, school doesn’t stress me out, I’m unhappy because I have no social life because of corona and I miss my friends

I wish I knew what was wrong with me or if I should go to the doctor. My brain tells me the only way to do that is to self harm badly enough to need to go to hospital for that

Sorry this is really long",12Dec2020,1
279,"I'm 32 but have the appearance of a full head of hair and everyone initially thinks I'm 24-25. However my hair is actually very thin, I just hide it very successfully because of how curly/frizzy it is. The thought of actually losing the appearance of a full head of hair, as well as of getting gray hair or wrinkles or developing an older looking face, terrifies me. I feel like my youthful look is part of my identity and that if it changes, I am no longer myself. I also think that a lot of aspects of who I am(my love for backpacker adventure style traveling, anime, video games, youthful trendy clothing styles, my interest in casual dating, etc.) I have been socialized to associate with younger people and so I feel like that who I am is not compatible with looking(or even being) older than a certain age. I feel like it is the same as how trans people, because they are socialized to believe that their behavioral tendencies are atypical of their biological gender, feel compelled to change it outwardly in order to feel ""right"". I feel like my desire to continue to look like I'm 25 even as I get into my mid-30s is basically driven by the same feeling.",12Dec2020,1
280,"I know this is incredibly long but I would appreciate if someone could read it, you dont have to. And if you do you dont need to respond either i just need someone to see it.

There has been a lot of change going on in my life lately and I'm finding it really hard to cope, first off I'd just like to say I'm 16 years old from England and have recently started college until dropping out about a month ago. Throughout the entirety of secondary/high school i had been struggling heavily with terrible mental health that was only rapidly declining, part of which I think stemmed from all the expectations placed upon me as no one in my family had actually gone to college and done well before and everyone thought I would be able to do it and I was so scared of letting everyone down that I was always so anxious to do poorly at school even though now looking back that nothing would have been bad if i performed poorly and i know my family wouldn't feel any differently about me if i did but in the moment it felt like i couldnt breathe and i was constantly suffocating because of expectations that i had drastically exaggerated in my head. Around the start of year 9 when, if i remember correctly i would have been 13-14, i had started to frequently self harm as i felt that the pain i was feeling connected me to life and allowed me to breathe and it became my coping mechanism for quite some time. Half way through year 10 I got home and found out that my friend had told my teacher it all and he of course reported it to my mum and seeing her cry the way she did when i told her and showed her everything completely broke me in every way imaginable and i felt the worst i ever had because of how sad and guilty i had made her feel, looking back i am unbelievably lucky and grateful to have had a friend like that supporting and without her i doubt i would still be here but because of her informing the teachers then them telling my mum i realised the pain it would cause my mum and thats something i never want to ever do to her, i love my mum more than anything and always will. From then on i started therapy twice a week and spoke to a counsellor at school every other wednesday, at first i thought it was helping me but i soon realised that when i talk about things and my experiences that i relive them but with tenfold the amount of pain and sadness that i felt in the moment but i knew i had to keep going so my mum could have some peace of mind in knowing that i had people there for me and until the quarantine that started in march thats what i did, therapy twice a week and counselling every other week. I knew I was only getting worse but i dont like being a burden and make others feel bad and worry so i kept going and as we approached the beginning of quarantine i was practically begging for it to happen so i had a reason not to attend the sessions and thankfully i was able to stop having to do them. Over the first few months of quarantine things felt like they were getting better and for a time they actually were but about 3 months in i started to just plummet entirely,  my girlfriend broke up with me which meant i lost the only source of happiness and comfort i had for a long time, i felt so alone and not being able to go outside and socialise really made me feel like everything was crumbling and was never going to get better, there was so many times when i just really needed a friend and not being able to have someone to hold me and comfort me for so long really did a number on me. After the quarantine had lifted I became really excited and enthusiastic about starting college so in the time between the end of quarantine and starting college i felt a little bit of happiness and being able to go and fully socialise soon and that anticipation helped keep me alive and was the something that i needed to hold on to. In September I started college and i felt like things needed to get better otherwise i dont think i would be able to last much longer and thankfully for the first month or so it was so lovely to be there and i was excelling in classes and was so happy, i didnt make any new friends but i think i preferred just being with the ones i already had and loved as trying to make new ones is something i really struggle with and get really anxious about. After that first month passed I had started to feel really disconnected from the world again and a week or so later i brokedown in my friends arms at a party and since then ive just been falling further and further again and i know that now is the time i need help so i decided im going to try my hardest to do something about it, i dropped out of college because i knew i would only be getting worse if i stayed and i got back in touch with my old therapist and since the start of november ive been speaking with them again but this time, on top of finding it really painful to share things i feel like i dont know how and dont feel comfortable with talking to professionals anymore and it makes me feel really uneasy so although ive been seeing them my main source of help and reprieve are the few good friends i have but i know they have a life of their own to get on with so i feel guilty for making them help me and not being able to focus on themselves so ive stopped telling all but one of them about things but soon i know i will end up stop telling him about it as well, not because i really want to but i sort of just automatically do it out of guilt. The last two months everything has felt incredibly slow and heavy and i really dont even know whats going on anymore, things just slip out of my memory so easily and frequently and ive never felt so alone, lost and scared and im so close to harming myself again and that scares me the most because i know it will hurt my mum even more than the last time as she will think she hasnt been able to do anything and feel like a failure, I dont know what the purpose of this is or why i decided to write it i just feel like i need to let someone know about whats going on and what has happened. Thank your for your time and care for reading this, much love. Anyone can feel free to message me about anything, im always more than happy to help",12Dec2020,1
