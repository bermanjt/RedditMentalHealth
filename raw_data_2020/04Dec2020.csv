0,"I am 15F, I have borderline personality disorder and generalized anxiety. I also struggle with sensory issues; I get overwhelmed really easily and might wave my arms or kick my legs. 

lately, in the last month or two, I have been unable to control that. sometimes I find myself cringing and gasping quietly, or even hitting the back of my neck, head or forehead; sometimes open handed and sometimes a first. usually it's not too bad, but it gets embarrassing and sometimes it really hurts. 

sometimes it happens when something stresses me out, like a loud noise or certain frequencies. other times it just kinda happens.

2,"I am basically a very happy person to begin with. I have a nice family, grew up a good life but i feel like deep inside me i am almost like the hulk. I get ridiculously angry if something triggers/bothers me. I am always that person in public who smiles or is polite. But its almost as if someone starts something with me, like saying something rude/ or doing something rude i get really heated inside to the point i want to hurt them. It's not like i will cause harm but it depends. If they obviously hit me or something i might go full on beat their ass, even if i am the one losing i would try to make it hell. I kind of lose my focus and mood and think about the thing that makes me upset most of the day. I even have pet dogs and i feel like they upset me almost everyday doing something they arent suppose to, i hurt them. Going to be honest, i quite enjoy it too. It makes me smile when i hurt them like slapping their face mildly or squeezing a spot on them. Just imagine a human? What do you guys think? A lot of people say i got anger issues but the same time im mr happy in this world. Not sure what my true inner self is...",04Dec2020,1
3,"It is currently 8:26pm as of starting this.

I write in a very scattered way, the same how I speak, so I apologize in advance. 

I feel like I'm continuing to spiral downwards as of my mental health. I've become the type to get aggravated very easy, even over little inconveniences or something that doesn't go my way.. Like a child.

I've speculated that there might be something neurologically wrong with me as well as, but I don't have the money nor the mental energy to get any diagnosis. So I just let myself fester in my own negative thoughts and declining mental state.

I get annoyed that my best friend is in a happy relationship with their boyfriend. It's not that I don't want them to be happy, that's all I ever want for them is happiness. But having to listen to them talk about him just makes me want to scream. While they talk to me about him, I have wildly intrusive thoughts and I make myself sick.

I just want them to focus on me for a bit, I want them to shut the fuck up about him and talk about something else. But not their frogs, or frogs at all. I fucking hate frogs now, just because they like them so much.

I know I'm a bad friends for thinking these things and feeling these ways. 

I feel deep dread for feeling hate and disgust about their fascination of frogs and love for their boyfriend. 

I know that these feelings are immature, I use to not feel this way, I think.

They also cry and whine to me about him and I hate it, I  hate that they get to cry about their problems to me, but the moment I need to vent to them they get uncomfortable and say I'm ""too aggressive."" I can show them aggressive if they really want. 

I smoke when I have the money to, it's been about three months since I've last smoked. Getting high was my only way of escape, but now I no longer have that escape. 

I'm a fucking freeloading unemployed dumbass that doesn't fucking deserve an ounce of kindness. At least I've convinced myself that I don't deserve kindness. I've convinced myself that I'll never get better. I need help.

My meaningless sex buddy moved too far for our casual meet ups, and I've developed a dependency on masturbation to keep that bit of serotonin/dopamine. 

I don't have the money to get therapy, and the government funded place is too far to walk. It's too inconvenient for my roommate, best friend with the boyfriend, to drive me. I feel like they don't even want to help me in the long run. 

I feel like a helpless wreck, I just want to know what's wrong with me already. 

It is now 8:52pm as of finishing this post. Thank you.",04Dec2020,1
4,"I'm 23 now, and the adult world couldn't be more difficult to handle. Im someone who dosent like to use my disorders as excuses at every turn, as I dont feel they're as intrusive as other problems I could have had. I deeply despise people like that just to keep my own head above water (as shitty as it makes me) but I'm failing at almost every turn. Im honestly not educated enough to even explain how I feel about things. Im in a donstant sense of inpending doom, at work my quietness and over energetic behavior has left many employers and co workers to believe i abuse drugs. The more I dwell on it the worse it gets, but when I am doing ""well"" and earn the ""maybe he was just nervous"" outlook from others, its ruined the next day, and I dont know why this keeps happening. 

I've been practicing CBT heavily for the past few years, it's helped with me not letting things get to me when ignorant, shitty tradesmen and other people in my field of work try to piss me off and get a rise out of me. But it runs deeper than that. My social performance is piss poor, im constantly forgetful (leaving equipment out, losing things, forgetting tasks). Pills are out of the question due to my family history of physical disease and my own history of drug addiction (6 years clean of anything serious ie stims) i dont use marijuana or drink for obvious reasons related to depression and anxiety. But I feel like its not enough.

What I'm left with is nothing but a product of my disorders that I've tried tirelessly throughout my life to either suppress or fix, im not a suicidal person but anyone who deal with depression obviously has it cross their mind every now and then, and if you claim otherwise I'd say you're full of shit . In my region, gender, and field, its almost unspokenly encouraged that if you're not someone who can act like a man, then you should get out, because they're not going to understand and help you manage, stop being a leach. 

Any chance of having a normal life, emotional relationships, friendships, the general respect of my own family, are an impossible reach as im seen as a loser to them, a failure, burden. I dont honestly know how to fix this and living as a shell of my former self is something that im fed up with doing. I just want to lie in bed and not do anything I dont want to be a problem to others. Im fucking exhausted. Ive been telling myself it'll get better for years and worked endlessly to do so, done everything my psych has told me and at this point I'm just lying to myself",04Dec2020,1

6,"Today was really rough. Man, I hope u read this all the way through, word for word... please:(

Man. What is wrong with me? I'm such a good person yet such a monster. I will be so quick to be the sweetest and most caring in the room but snap on everybody with the most hate and anger in the room. My dad just wants to help me, poor guy. But all I do is drag him down into my cycle of misery. One minute I hug him. The next minute I cuss him out and tell him to shut the f\*ck up and f\*ck you and the most horrible evil things. I'm 18 btw. I just graduated earlier this year by the grace of god. I got a job back that I quit without notice so I could go to a rehab and mental health facility. Again, by the grace of god.

And here I am, still abusing this OTC high once every week or once a week or so. I've been a daily weed smoker, mostly at night to deal with my problems for years now. Also addicted to caffeine and nicotine. Luckily I just cut out the nicotine today. I'm 4 days without smoking weed at night (cut down to very little). I'm on this antidepressant called Wellbutrin but it dosen't do sh\*t for me and nor has any antidepressant. I was on Concerta for a month last year and it changed my life for that month. But I was 17 and so my dad took me off of it because he saw it as legal meth and thought I was wanting to get high on them (they did not get me high and actually helped me be calm cool and focused and collected and feel normal and actually be able to complete all the ambitions I set out to do and not have a million thoughts going on all at once in different directions every waking hour of the day and fixed my sleep problems)

And I'm in the length proccess of getting an ADHD test done with these new psych docs now that I'm 18 and man it is just taking forever for them to call me and tell me when they will do the test and weather or not they will prescribe me with Concerta, which helped me immensely. 

Man, my mind is just fucked up. I feel so ugly with these braces. I have no car. No friends. No girlfriend. No life. I just work and come home. I keep on spending the money I'm suppose to be saving for a car. I feel like an out of control raging mess. I act like a complete devil when I go into my mental breakdowns.

Tonight I just snapped and lost it. I went from apologizing to my dad, to crying, to shouting and cussing him out and repeating those 3 things.

I'm just so bored of everything in life that nothing satisfies me. No matter how much I'm sober, no matter how much excercise I do, no matter how hard I try but horribly fail at spending just at least 2 short minutes on learning guitar or piano but always opt out for an internet addiction isntead or try to read the 5 books I checked out but don't even make it a page through. No matter how positive I try to remain and how kind I am to people and how loving i am of the earth and grateful i am for my life. No matter how connected to god I feel and my spirituality.

Nothing is able to fill this void of boredom. And eventually it gets to the point where everything just seems purposeless. I feel like i have no purpose. 

I know what to do to make my life good. I want to make music and be really talented with it, learn art, go to college, make friends, have a girlfriend, make memories, read books, write poetry and journal and write books, excercise and diet, learn how to defend myself in case i may need to for myself and family one day, give back to this earth and help people out in need, travel the world and all its' beauties, help the poor in third world countries and give them a good life, help the environment and conserve our nature and prevent pollution, inspire people, be a public speaker, learn how to dance, get better at cooking, find my dream job, find happiness.

I want to do those things.

But without proper medication, I feel like I am just a jumbled, unmotivated, bored of everything, purposeless mess.

And I take it out in extreme fits of anger and abuse my dad verbally. I feel like such an evil person. But I know I have good in me. I have that OTC drug stashed in my room. WTF am I doing. I'm ruining my life. 

Will I ever be stable? Life feels like it's always going to be reckless.

I'm so bored and sick and tired of being stuck in my small amish town. I want to get out and explore life. I feel trapped. I'm going crazy. I have to muster extreme amounts of strength from within and from god just to get through the day and be able to decently function at work and do something at least halfway productive outside of work.

And even then, I rely on heavy doses of caffeine to get me through and lots of melatonin at night that ends up giving me scary nightmares because I also just cold turkeyed weed which is known to have a side effect of really vivid dreams from the withdrawal and nightmares.

Man am I even really ADHD? Or am I just messing with my head? I swear, concerta helped me feel normal. I naturally do not feel normal and sturggle with so many isssues.

I cannot keep a structured mind or life. Everything is ALL OVER THE PLACE. Mood swings everywhere. But I know I can't be bipolar because I never feel manic or depressive. Just messy, jumbled, and have 10 different thoughts going on about the most random stuff like how much my friends dad talks or how caveman weren't able to tell time back then. Lol, I just came up with something random but seriously, this affects me so much.

When somebody is talking to me I constantly am loosing my train of thought because i start zoning out or thinking about something or else or I trry so hard to focus that I end up not understanding what they're saying.

Man, I could keep going on about this craziness and messiness that my mind and life is. I realize my sentences are way too long and unstructured but i don't care because i'm just letting my thoughts flow out because this is how i naturally think. I usually try to put on a ""normal"" act to everybody but this is the true raw me. Impulsive, bored all the time, confused, messy, unstructured, can't focus for shit, never satisfied with anything, always seeking stimulation, feeling crazy, 200 million thoughts going on in every which direction north south and west and east.

Man, I hope somebody actually read the whole entire post word for word.

I feel like nobody will understand me or be able to read all of this. Man why am I like this. Nobody truly cares enough to read this word for word. I doubt it... please don't lie to me if u didn't and say u did. Ugh, why am I so hyperfocused on that? damnit man. I am a mess. I seriously need help. 

Ugh.....

that's it i guess. even though i could keep going on. Man tonight was a bad night. But I'll be okay. Fuck I really wanna give in on day 4 and smoke weed. damnit. im so impulsive. i get so bored. drugs are like an instant cure to that boredom. i'll be fine. just like that juice wrld song. i just popped a beaann yesterday was a looonngg night. i done did the right drugs only on the wrooonngg night. i was roockkinn all whitee tryna have a fun time.

okay I'm done lmao.

14,"im a 21 yr old female, and ive been suffering from depression and anxiety for as long as i can remember. these past few months have been especially hell for me and i feel like im going crazy. why is it so hard for me to form connections with others? i get so sad when i see that my coworkers or classmates find a way to text and talk to each other outside of work or class. i always feel left out because im not able to actually form a bond with any of them. i hang out with them occasionally, and i try my best to keep in touch with them by texting them. but i never seem to get anywhere. &amp; ive never had a bf, i push away every guy that comes my way. so i know i tend to be a closed off person, i just really wish i weren’t. i wish i were funny, exciting, and cool but ive never been those things (as ive been told by multiple people throughout my life, but its true ive noticed it in myself) so i dont even know how to start. instead im socially awkward, weird, clueless, reserved, and extremely insecure. not to mention im a huge people pleaser. i have a few close friends and a family that cares for me, but i still feel so alone because i close myself off so much. i dont know why i do that. all i know is how to be nice to people and put on an act like everything is perfect. i even lie to people about somewhat serious matters to cover up how much of a loser i am (and i feel really guilty for this and its part of the reason i isolate myself from them, i plan on coming clean to my friends and family the next time i see them. i hate myself for even lying to them in the first place). &amp; im never ready to make jokes or find a way to have fun with my life. im too stiff and serious. if you ask anyone im sure they’ll tell you im a nice person. but thats all i am. its so hard for me to express myself, but thats because there’s nothing to express. all i do with my life is cry, think irrational thoughts, and daydream about being a person i wish i was. or every time i fail to make a new friend/bf i think about it for months or even years and i obsess over how much i wish i could be closer to them. im a junior in college (first gen, low income) and my grades are suffering immensely because i do this. i plan on withdrawing for the semester to work on myself by finding a better job, exercising, meditating, going to therapy, etc. but these are things ive tried doing when i was younger (including antidepressants) but nothing ever seemed to work so i gave up and im worried it wont work this time either. i dont even have a genuine interest in the major i chose. im just here because i dont know what else to do and i thought having a high paying job would allow me to do anything i wanted, which includes helping my family and the people around me. but i lost the motivation to even do that. i really don’t know how i can get out of this self-loathing mindset, it’s so hard to keep myself from thinking this way. i try my best to distract myself by going out and surrounding myself with people that i love. but it doesn’t help much since i never feel my true self, it feels like i’ll never know who i am. i feel so much guilt and shame because everyone around me thinks i dont like them or that im ungrateful/entitled for not being happy where i am or for not behaving the way i should. but in fact i just feel like i dont deserve any of it. i wish i could say im like this because of how my parents raised me and the trauma i went through. but i dont understand how my sister and i spent all our lives growing up under the same conditions (we’re a year apart) but she’s this fun, assertive, and confident person who is so sure of herself and has so much love and care to offer. i have no reason to be this way it seems like, im naturally pretty and book smart and all. but im 100% life dumb. i act as if i want to be invisible in this world, but i truly don’t. so what do i need to do to stop this? to be a normally functioning person? why am i not there? why am i such a fucked up person? i can sometimes be happy, but i always get brought down because of how shitty ive been. i feel useless. im such a wimp. im so broken. i dont understand how this happened, why did my life unravel in such a painful and complicated way? im sorry if this is a lot btw. this probably doesnt make any sense. but i heard it’s good to let everything out, especially for someone like me who has never done so.",04Dec2020,1

17,"Hello,

I'm relatively new to Munich from outside of Germany (&lt;2 years), and I've always had problems (i.e. extreme anxiety and other symptoms) that only got worse with being away from home, and then much worse with COVID.

The main problem is that I am not comfortable enough with German to do therapy in that language, and there seems to be this specific certificate -- that all the English therapists I've found don't seem to have (maybe because they're foreign?). 

If they don't have that certificate, I cannot pay for their sessions through my public insurance provider (AOK), and need to pay a pretty hefty sum (100€+ per session).

I've tried everything but all doctors I've found that are covered by AOK (and advertise therapy in English) never reply. Would be great if someone that knows more about this in Munich (or even Germany generally) could help.

Thank you",04Dec2020,1
18,I was in my kitchen with my dog and all of a sudden I heard someone whisper in my ear “You better get your ass out of my room” I was a little stressed because my dog was being abnormal but I won’t get into that. There wasn’t anybody around me that could’ve whispered it into my ear or any audio that could’ve been playing from a phone/TV. I started shaking after the voice.

19,"I (27f) am living with (27M) and our relationship is at it’s last straw. I absolutely am bipolar. I have dealt with severe symptoms since I was 24. I thought maybe I was just an angsty teenager because I felt a lack of control in my adolescence. But now I feel myself going through legitimate manic and depressive episodes since I’ve been in my mid twenties.
 I become so happy and euphoric for some time and then bam... I can end up on my bathroom floor in a puddle of tears over something minimal. I could write more impulsive behaviors but I will spare it. It’s just humiliating coming out of it. Then trying to justify my actions. It happens too frequent that I know something is wrong with me. 

I was told by doctors and therapists that I may have ADD and was prescribed adderall. I took it for a long time. But it’s done nothing but give me more energy. 
It’s time I find something to really help me. 
My boyfriend has supported my outbursts in so many caring ways. But after a year of it, he told me he doesn’t think we are right for each other. He feels hopeless because this is just who I am. I won’t change. I’ll just continue to have my episodes. 

But I don’t want to believe that. I’m so deeply hurt because there has to be hope.. with us and with myself. We love each other a lot and I want us to have a happy life together. I don’t WANT to break up. Even though it’s difficult. I just want to feel normal. 

This pandemic has caused me a roller coaster of emotions. I almost lost my mom to Covid while starting hormonal birth control. I was spiraling. But I think I damaged everything by obsessing so much about making things “better” ... 

Can people change with this? How does someone handle a person like myself? A tornado of a woman!
I’m at the point where I feel desperate for help and think I should try medications. Maybe a mood stabilizer and anti depressant?...

My family would be crushed if I ended my life, so I wouldn’t. But goddam...I want to get the fuck out of my head. Permanently. That’s the real unfortunate truth. It scares me.

24,"Hi everyone, my name is Palletjack, feel free to call me that or call me by my first initial N. Anyway, where to I even begin? I am not diagnosed with any mental health issues per-say, I am on the Autism Spectrum, and I am going to be one of the billions of people on the Internet that thinks 2020 can burn in Hell.

Anyway, when COVID hit, my parents told me to go work for a local midwestern United States grocery chain. So I thought I would humor them and pick up and almost minimum wage job as a 23 year old. To put it lightly, I feel like when I leave this company next year (I hope to be done before my 1 year anniversary) I will need to invest in psychological counseling for the first time in my life, or even before then. I have been put through the ringer with this company. They rarely care about their employees, they are willing to push us all to the breaking point, and its all about their precious bottom line. Fine, I get it, you have to care for your bottom line. But consistently throughout this pandemic, they have pushed many employees, even long-term workers, to their breaking points.

The lack of care this company has for their workers is sickening. I understand the bottom line is important, but when employees mental health are pushed to their breaking point. We cannot function well. Supposedly the entire morning crew called out tomorrow, and I am going in for the morning, early afternoon. I am happy to do it, but I am nearing my limit. We do offer some sort of therapist I think, but I hear they break the sacred rule of therapy (privacy) and disclose some stuff back to HR. Which is why I worry if I were to ever seek it out. I have always had trust issues since I was a young kid, my counselor in grade school broke my trust a lot, so I am very uncomfortable with the idea of any psychological counseling.

I worry what my parents will think if I leave the job, they’ve been pressuring me towards the ministry my whole life, as have my extended family. To the point where I think they’re trying to break me emotionally so I will join the ministry, but ironically no religious seminary will accept you if you’re being coerced into it. Late last year, there was a push by them for me to become a non-ordained hospital chaplain. I was very much against the idea, and I am so glad now in retrospect as COVID.

Just wanna hear your ideas. Tonight I am in a good place, but there are days I just need a new way to approach the job. Mind you my parents are also egging me into going full-time, and I am not ready to “sell my soul” to this company. The company is also very weird about hiring full-time people. Plus, it’d only be about a $3 pay difference full-time compared to what I make now.

Maybe I just need a new way to approach life. I need to figure out how to live life as me, and not let people control my life like a puppet.",04Dec2020,1
25,"I have been struggling big time over the last several months during the pandemic. I'm 30-years-old, living in a big city and working a professional job at a big company. My job is demanding, pays well, and my role is highly analytical. I've always loved math and getting into technical details. However since COVID began and I started working from home, I've been noticing mental decline in a lot of areas. 

Suddenly everything feels 10x harder. What would have been a more straight-forward task last year, now requires me to do mental summersaults. I find it especially anxiety-provoking to try to plan tasks. My meetings with colleagues or clients are awkward, where I feel I'm constantly exposing my lack of understanding and lack of intellect. After a certain point in the day it's almost impossible to concentrate on the task at hand, with my mind jumping from one thing to the other, preventing me from getting anything done in a reasonable amount of time. I feel like all my colleagues and clients think I’m completely inadequate, and they wouldn’t be wrong either. It takes so much longer to process information. I also find it hard to follow others’ trains of thought, and when I do understand I have a hard time responding with something meaningful or of value. It takes me a long time to really get started on a task and when I do I move very slowly. My brain feels like it’s lost in a fog and that it’s impossible to form a coherent thought or engage in productive discussions.

I often feel so struck by anxiety over thinking I'm not capable or intelligent enough to complete the task at hand that I often gravitate to biting my fingers to cope. I've been a lifelong nail biter (since the age of 5-ish) and to paint a picture of what my work day would literally look like if you were a fly on the wall: I'm seated at my desk, staring at my monitor while I anxiously bite my nails and cuticles, sometimes until my fingers bleed. The other hand remains on the keyboard, not typing. On any given day I'm likely to have a bandaid on one sometimes two fingers. It sometimes feels as if my front teeth are growing weak from gnawing on them so frequently.

This has been going on for a couple of months now and I feel like at a breaking point. I don’t know what it is I’m experiencing and I don’t know what’s caused this. I was leading a project during the summer months that caused me to feel incredibly stressed (I was working evenings and weekends and literally crying before calls with clients). I have a few unhealthy habits that might contribute to this: I smoke weed on Friday evenings, average about 5 hours of sleep per night, and don’t have the best diet — not sure to what extent they are causing me to feel this way.

Does anyone have a clue as to what is wrong with me?",04Dec2020,1
26,"Hello! I am a 20 year old female. I won’t go into too much detail about these situations but recently (about four months ago) I have been overwhelmed by thoughts and feelings about things that have happened in my life. 
My parents divorced when I was 4 and it was a very nasty divorce, and I was the subject of a nasty custody battle. My dad won custody of me and he tortured me mentally until I turned 16, when my mom won custody of me. I won’t go into detail about my dad and the things he did because I don’t know how. I feel like there’s not any way I could possibly describe it to do it justice. I feel mentally incapable of describing it. 
I definitely have always been affected by these events, but it hasn’t been until recently that I have been bothered by a constant awareness of it, like I can hear my dad’s voice, I can feel the anxiety of being chased by him, I just feel the pain weighing on my chest the way it did when I knew he’d be picking me up from school. I thought those feelings of dread were gone and I don’t know why I am just now bothered by these memories, 4 years after being released from him. Does this sound like “flashbacks?” 
I have also been experiencing constant awareness and memories of being raped three years ago. I haven’t experienced these symptoms until recently. I am just always thinking about it, constantly. I don’t dream about these traumas, just always thinking about them. 
On top of the painful memories, I feel completely dead inside. I feel brain damaged. I was a 4.0 student and am failing everything I haven’t dropped out of. I’m not actively suicidal but I do wish I was dead. I don’t know how to cope or move on from this. Thank you for reading!",04Dec2020,1
27,"Hey sorry if this post is a little weird, im new to reddit but I really need help. 
Since around last October ish (a little over a year now) I've been extremely depressed, and on and off suicidal. But lately its been the worst its ever been.
ANYWAYSS, this last summer I started to hear like voices in my head. I heard them around once a week up until the middle of September ish. They were super quick, it was like walking into a crowed room where everyone was talking at once, but then immediately walking out. I havnt heard them for a while now but idk if thats something to be concerned about yk?
And I dont know how to bring up being depressed to my mom, let alone being super suicidal, cause last time I was suicidal I was 12/13 , in 7th grade, and my dad had seen my texts to my friends that I was depressed/ suicidal. So he showed my mom them, and they screamed at me for it, telling me they ""had enough evidence to keep me in a mental hospital for the rest of my life"" 
And the last time I was suicidal, was 7th grade, and I attempted then ( I took pills at school and sat in the bathroom, but it didn't work, I woke up at the end of the day super drowsy and shi and no one ever found out) 

And this time is worse than then and im scared ill do somthing and idk if I should go in cause of covid, and I feel like my family won't take me serious if I tell them, and honestly I don't know how I would tell them, cause I don't have a good relationship with them. 

( I'm 16 and live in WA I know the laws are different for minors shit)
But is there any way to go to a hospital without your family knowing anything? Or is there anyway to go to the hospital without your family getting involved? Or somthing like that? Or something where they would be the least amount involved possible? Honestly anything helps

29,"I'm 20f, and i think im a narcissist.

I have no empathy towards anyone, no matter who they are or what role they have in my life. 

I have no guilt or shame in anything i do, even if it's something like hurting other people or playing with their emotions.  Same thing goes with grief. I've had all my grand parents die, 2 or 3 other people who were apart of my life die, and i feel nothing towards it. 

I think i was upset about their deaths, but more because of the life they lived? 
I don't care that they are dead. It doesn't make a difference to me. 

I lie about many things for no reason at all. I live a double life, that involves many fake and elaborate plots and trauma. Some of it is based off of my real trauma, but a lot of it is fake.  I don't know why exactly i lie about it. I don't think I'm doing it for attention, but then why would I do it in the first place?

I can't love either. 
Never had a crush, first love, romantic or platonic.
Never had a celebrity crush, or anything like that.
I've been in a few relationships, the longest lasting a year, and it ended about a month ago now. I felt nothing the entire time. We broke up because he moved, and that was the only issue we had. I feel nothing about the break up. Its like it never happened in the first place.
With all the people I've dated, all of it was because they could give me attention. Not one person I've dated have complained about me being toxic or saying that i was cold. 

I am an amazing actor, and i fake feelings towards them until they either ask me out or they stop giving me a vibe.
I've studied behavior for years now, not for the social cues, but for how people act towards caring other people and loving them. 


The only exception to the rule is that none of this applies to animals or plants. 
I have an EXTREME bond with plants, often giving them names and being very sad and upset when they die. 
I don't know what's wrong with me. Please do not hate on me, although it won't matter to me. I literally don't care.

32,"For those unaware a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure, also called a pseudo-seizure, is a seizure brought on by mental instead of physical stimuli, while being every bit as real and unavoidable as your typical seizure. At the end of my post are two articles going into more detail. Let me explain how it works for me.

I suffer from depression and anxiety, and I have PTSD from a mentally abusive, narcissistic father. I'm 22 and am losing my hair from the stress and from several instances of shock I've experienced these last 6 months. I recently started taking an adrenal support supplement because my body doesn't correctly regulate my adrenaline anymore. Without it I'm in a constant state of increased tension where every problem I face feels a hundred times worse than reality (even with it this can be the case, but things are typically easier to manage nonetheless). Trying to clean my room or go buy groceries often would be enough to literally bring me to my knees and trigger a pseudo-seizure, as would other sources of stress like family arguments or messing something up at my job (retail).

It's not like the classic hollywood-ized seizure, where you drop where you stand and flail dramatically, though from what I've read it's still more extreme than normal epilepsy. I have a surprising amount of mental control over the process as well. It starts with a crash or drop in my mood (I'm guessing anyone with intermittent depression will understand what I mean there), and it then eventually starts to manifest physically. My teeth will chatter and my muscles will tense. When I can't hold it off anymore it usually starts in my right arm, where my hand will clench and my arm convulse. Sometimes that's all it is, and I can keep from going further.

When I go into a full-on seizure, both arms and legs tense up, and I usually sink slowly to the ground. I don't sit in a chair or lay on the bed for obvious reasons, thankfully my room is carpeted. From there it's sometimes just a matter of all my muscles clenching, but at it's worse I will lose some control and my arms, legs, and back will twitch, convulse, and flail. It can be especially bad in my shoulders, neck and face. I have to pay careful attention to my breathing otherwise my throat clenches shut.

They usually last 15-45 minutes. They're not constant, but come and go in waves. In just a few seconds I go from full-body clench to limp, catching my breath and waiting for the next episode, usually within minutes.

I didn't start experiencing these overnight, nor from birth. It started a few years ago, and has only been what I just described for a year at most, with the intensity increasing as time goes on. At first it was more like a panic attack, where I'd lay curled on the floor freaking out about what's happening to my head. That or I thought it was only depression. Now, I'm not particularly frightened by these episodes anymore, just frustrated. When I get home from a long day at work I want to do something I enjoy and relax, not get a full-body workout on my bedroom floor in the most stressful way possible. Even when it's over my mood is usually so down I can't enjoy anything anyway and I just watch YouTube in bed.

As for what I said about mental control, I can often tell hours beforehand it's coming. I'll be at work and I'll just realize, ""yeah, it's going to be one of those days."" My arm will lock up sometimes, my teeth chatter a bit when I forget to clench my jaw, but I can keep ringing up customers with them just thinking I'm in a bad mood; I hide all of this pretty well and can keep pretty good control over it to keep that paycheck coming in. When I get home, though, all bets are off. I'm tired and have no reason to spend the energy fighting it. It's better to just have it and be done, even though it's so physically taxing.

Before I read the below articles, I didn't know this was medically recognized thing, or that it had a name. For myself it has become commonplace. I can go days without thinking of it or experiencing it, and I can go days in a row of having a seizure every night and my mood not coming back up the next morning. Sometimes I'm at peace with it, other times I hate myself and everything about my life, which I'm sure is more the depression side of things than anything else.

I'm doing a few things to alleviate the problem. The adrenal support is the most important, but also my diet has a major impact on my mental state. Fast food and processed food completely screws me over and sends me into a spiral of depression and despair, literally. Eating cleaner, taking vitamin supplements and my adrenal support go a very, very long way towards making life livable and enjoyable. I think that if I could get into the habit of exercising and getting more sun that would help too, but with how tired I get from work I don't know when that will happen.

With that short novel written, tell me: do any of you experience anything similar? Have you ever heard of this before? And if you do have it, please tell me what it's like for you, since it's not something everyone will experience in the same way. I want to know what other's are experiencing and how they cope. I hope the articles below and my own insight on how to fight it can help you as well.

34,"Hey guys. I’m really, really struggling at the minute. I don’t get out of bed unless it’s for necessities such as eating and peeing. I was prescribed meds a month ago and they haven’t worked. I have a phone call appointment (covid) on the 7th. My problem is, when I spoke to my doctor a month ago,  I was so relieved to be doing so that I simply asked for my previous medication. But I don’t think that’s what I need anymore. And I’m scared. 

I have ZERO motivation. For anything. I don’t leave the house. I have OCD rituals that I can’t stop doing. If I’m home alone I get extremely paranoid and put something against my hallway door, as if to protect myself from a non existent predator in my house. I know it’s ridiculous but I can’t stop. I can’t go into supermarkets because the lights are so bright, the noises are so loud and I can’t stand being around people when I feel like I’m about to break. I don’t sleep at night, only the afternoon, and I have nightmares regularly. I am coping somehow, I’m not completely broken. But I don’t know what the fuck to say to my doctor. I’m scared. I just want to cope. Any advice is welcome.",04Dec2020,1
35,Hi guys! I need help with this situation I am in. I have dating my Boyfriend for about ten months and five months into the relationship he literally just lost every single he had to him financially. I am honestly drained on what else to do. About a month ago he recently started showing signs of being suicidal. He has always said that he is never scared of dying since I met him. I truly believe that he is suicidal but everytime he denies it because he knows how sad I get when he says stuff like that. We are in a long distance relationship so I haven’t really met his family. He is not a family person too. He is more of a loner and doesn’t really have friends. He is the sweetest guy and extroverted person I know. I have tried to helps him in anyway I can but I think this is beyond me. I don’t know who else to reach out too about this. I have tried to convince him to go to therapy but totally doesn’t want too. The worst is I don’t live with him so this makes it scarier. I don’t know what to do???? Please I need suggestions on how to help.,04Dec2020,1

But to me it was just them calling me annoying and as I grow up (I'm 20 now) i feel like I'm just so goddamn annoying to everyone. I ask too many questions about how things work, or asking someone if I'm doing x part of the job right because Im so afraid of messing up that I have to have a second opinion. I just want to feel important and validated and confident and I just never am, and I feel like I can only get that from others. How do I stop? At this point I just want to be done trying to figure out exactly how some small detail works because I know that I just annoy the fuck out of everyone. I have too many thoughts I think in the moment alot of the time so I end up either over complicating sentences/questions or I end up just reasking the whole thing multiple times in slightly different ways. I feel like I push people away, maybe because of this and I'm just so alone. Like how is it that every time I'm with 2 other people I end up third wheeling the entire time? 
All I want is to stop bothering people and I just don't know how. I want to try and over achieve on projects and try and find new ways to make things better or more efficient but I feel like I just waste everyone's time. 
I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm about to loose it. Been thinking about just killing myself tonight because I know I'm never going to get better and Im done having to live through all the pointlesness and meaninglesness of life and just get it over. Move on. Who knows where I'll go after. Maybe nothing happens after death and you just stop existing. Sometimes I wonder if there is a heaven or a hell and sometimes I think hey I didn't live an exceptional life but I tried to be nice to everyone so maybe I'll make it. But maybe I won't and I think I'm ok with that because I know I wouldn't be the only person in hell ya know. Maybe I won't do anything and I'll just wake up tomorrow and go back to my job so I can keep annoying my co workers. Who knows.

42,"I've always felt different from everyone else. My brain takes me to some scary places and I need help but my doctor doesn't seem to take things seriously. Important stuff in bold at bottom.  

A little backstory... I grew up in a household with an alcoholic father. He was prone to verbal abuse, mostly towards my mom but I've caught some of it. As a result my mother was always pretty emotionally distant. I was never hugged as a child. I was never told I was loved. I actually don't have many memories from back then and most of them involve incidents with my drunk dad. But they never separated and still to this day my Dad binges once in a while and it isn't pretty. My mom ignores it.   

I coped by overeating and by the time I hit elementary school I was obese. I was made fun of every day. Kids stole my stuff, threw stuff at me. It continued into high school when I was the weird obese goth girl. My only escape was heavy metal, food and then eventually self-harm. I ended up dropping out of high school at 16 because my depression became so bad and my mom took me to the doctor where I was given antidepressants for the first time. I didn't want to take them and my mom got really upset with me over that.  

**I was coping okay, just kind of coasting through life by spending it online playing video games and working. I had a dog that had been with me 14 years and saw me through an abusive relationship. He passed very suddenly and traumatically last April and I lost it. I had a complete breakdown, was placed on a suicide watch and was even taken out of work for a few weeks. I really lost it. I went from 265 lbs to 200 lb in just a few months. I couldn't eat, could barely get out of bed but at the same time couldn't sleep. I haven't really been the same since then. It's gotten much worse.**  

**I'm a little afraid to put my ""symptoms"" out there but I need help. I'm honestly uncomfortable with myself.**  

* **I have mood-swings that leave me exhausted and scared. There are times where I'm so hyper that it's overwhelming. I can't stop talking, I can't sit still and my sleep gets all messed up because I can't turn my brain off and I'm just not tired so I stay up all night. And then there's the complete opposite where I literally can't function as a human and stay in bed for days. I don't eat, don't shower, just wish I didn't exist. I write suicide notes in my head and lie in the dark with the blinds closed and just sleep. It's like this emptiness and hopelessness. This deep, aching pain in my chest. I have no energy so I just sleep.**
* **I get obsessed with things. I get onto a subject and can't let it go. I will research endlessly, sometimes staying on the same subject for days. I'll exhaust myself trying to learn absolutely everything I can about whatever it is.**
* **I write lists of things (shopping list for example) but if I make the tiniest mistake I have to redo it. Sometimes I end up with 10 copies of the same list because I've changed my mind on something or I wrote something too messy and I don't like it. It has to be right or I can't leave it alone.**
* **I am very impulsive. If there's something I want, the anxiety drives me absolutely crazy until I get it. I can't wait, even if I don't have the money. I've put myself into debt (21k) by doing this. I know I don't need these things but the anxiety I get from not buying it is terrible. It's like this tight feeling in my chest. It feels like panic if I don't buy it. It's so fucked up.**

**There's more but I honestly don't know what's relevant and what isn't. Everything is so jumbled in my head and most of the time I just feel like a robot stumbling through life. I'm pretty sure everyone would be better off without me. I would be better off without me at this point. My brain is scary.**",04Dec2020,1
43," Sorry for typos, I'm on mobile and I'm trying to get these words out as fast as I can.

I feel really weird right now. I feel like there's lightning in my blood rn. I feel like the part of my brain that controls what I do is sleeping. I'm very stressed over an assignment right now. I drank some coffee. I did eat alot of sugar today but not that much more than i do usually. I took my meds, and found out my doctor accidentally wrote the wrong prescription but I realized only after I'd taken it. (I take adderall, they gave me Ritalin. I don't think there's many differences or side effects to taking the other accidentally? And it has the same warnings against caffiene as adderall but im always ok if i drink just a little coffee while im on adderall. So I'm not denying the possibility, but I honestly don't think the medication switch up is what's causing me to feel bad and weird right now.)

I feel like this occasionally even when I forget to take my (regular)meds and don't drink coffee. It's a very ""buzzy"", ""twitchy"" feeling if that makes sense. I feel very impulsive, like I could punch myself in the face at any second. I feel like I need to do something right now but no matter what I do, nothing will satisfy that 'itch' to do *something*. 

I started watching a video for my assignment, it seemed unbearably slow so put it on  2x speed. They they started talking abt some scene from a movie abt a guy who said he had the same broom for 17 years or smth. Then he goes on to say that the handle was replaced 9 times and the broom head was replaced 14 times or smth like that. 
It related to the assignment (the one im anxious about) and it gave me a little inspiration for what to write about. That made my anxiety lessen a little bit. I also thought it was pretty funny, and a clever metaphor for humans, whose cells replace every couple years or so. Because of those couple reasons, I started to tear up @ the video. I really don't understand why I did that. That's when I realized something isn't right with me right now.

I also feel like my hearts beating p fast but I took my bpm on my phone (galaxy S7 has bpm functionality, seems accurate, but I'm no doctor, so I wouldn't be able to say). My bpm was 79, so pretty average, maybe the tinyist bit high.

She says she doesn't know why or she might be hiding one but she had tried to get help. She has tried multiple medications and therapists about 10 of them. They've been psychoanalytical of her and they have give her a few options.

Those three are:
 ECT Shock therapy
A medically induced coma for almost two weeks
A extract from ketamine meant for humans to help with severe depression.

I want to get her help as soon as possible but we are in two different states. Her parents will hate me because they denied all three of those treatments. They blame her after her suicide attempts and pin her as a mark on their life, they don't comfort her, they just attack her saying that she can do it but not while she lives with them.

She can't make a promise she won't do it and I'm scared for her so much. I can't do anything for another year or two but I want to save as much as possible and get her the treatment they tried to give her.

I love her with all my heart and I can't stand all of her suffering. I just need some help to delay anything, distract her, give her sources for help. I'm in MA, and I know that is one of the best places but I need her to be here with me. Any help will help me so much.

      When I was thirteen I moved with my mom to a different state( I’m 16 now) and left my dad, only seeing him for the summer and Christmas.
      During this time from 7th grade on I started using drugs due to the fact that I wanted a good dad like everybody else, it started with drinking, then weed, then pills etc. My mom got worried and thought it would be a good idea to send me back to my dads to live with him so I can make a actual relationship with him, but he hasn’t changed anything from when I was little, always thinking I’m this dumb ass kid, calls me a “fucking mother fucker”, I can’t talk to him without him bringing up how dumb I am and how unsuccessful I will be in life( I plan on being a musician), it’s been stressing me out to the point  to where I needed something to help me not go insane.

My empathy has developed since then though, so I do truly regret what I did as a teenager. I would give everything to undo those things. I’ve gone through some minor abuse/neglect and sexual trauma and some physical &amp; mental health problems, so maybe that was my karma for being a horrible person before?? Maybe the world tried to balance out the wrong that I did?? Where I’m really torn is I want to commit suicide so badly because I can’t live with what I did. But I’m worried that I’d be an even worse person for doing that because my mom would be crushed. I deserve to suffer for what I did, but I also want to kill myself. Should I just call it even with the world since I went through trauma after/while causing harm and try to move on with my life and do better in the future?

It is so obvious when people fake it yet people believe them and actually feel bad for them when they act perfectly normal. I get some people have depression and anxiety and don't act like it but when they don't act like it they don't say every 5 seconds how they have it. Depression and anxiety are making me feel like I don't want to do anything at all and commit suicide yet people really think they are cool just because they say they have it even though it can cause thousands of deaths every year I just can't express how fucking stupid this is if you do this please stop it makes people who actually suffer feel absolutely horrible,04Dec2020,1

For most my life now I've felt worthless, pretty much like a waste of space to anyone around me. No matter what I do I think things like the following:
You're worthless just die already
You don't matter to anyone
Everyone is better off without you 
You make people depressed with your feelings

 My real dad left before I was even born and my mother always sides with my step-dad. He was mean, abusive, and hated me for not being his kid. Most my life no one has chosen me they've merely have been stuck with me. So often I don't choose me. I hate myself I hate who I am who I am going to become I hate it all and the thought of death gives me so much comfort because it feels lile finally something chooses me and then ill be happy.

The other day they asked if I wanted to hang, have some drinks and play some games in the evening before they moved home and my biggest achievement was just saying fuck it, “yes!”. I’d cancelled so many times this past year out of fear, and despite being in the biggest rut I’ve had in months, I just thought “you can’t say no”.

Before leaving, I was the most anxious I can recall feeling in forever. I get this gag reflex to anxiety and it got so bad I physically vomited whilst getting ready, yet I washed up, finished getting ready and went anyway!!!!

We had an amazing time, talked openly about anything and everything including how close I was to cancelling lol and truly deepened our friendship. I was a nervous wreck half the time I was there but there is zero regret and I’ve been on this joyous productive buzz ever since!

54,"I'm sorry if this is posted wrong, this is my first post on Reddit basically 

I am 17 and I'm currently going to therapy for adhd/depression. Just in case it could be relevant. 

I'm making this post bc I'm wondering if its normal to like... Act like different people at different times, especially fictional characters? Idk how to really explain it, but when I get super attached to a character who I can really relate to, like we share a very similar past or personality, they really just,,, stick with me. And basically its like, my brain takes turns becoming these characters. I guess it makes me feel happy about myself in a way, being all these characters that I enjoy, bc my self-esteem has never been good. I don't really like my real self. 

I started doing it years ago back in middle school, so I was probably like 11 at the time. I used to get bullied pretty badly back then. I had a huge creepypasta phase, and I remember I would act like all the different characters \[your average 11 year olds sugar-coated depiction of them, at least\]. I assume I only really grew so attached to the characters bc I was angry at the bullying I received and I wanted ""revenge"" or whatever. So the characters stories were pretty appealing to me at the time. 

I also had a phase right after that where I was convinced that I was a cat/werewolf. I would constantly walk/run on all fours, I used to get into fights and bite others, half my vocabulary at the time was exclusively animal noises... Pretty embarrassing stuff. Every other kid in the entire school basically knew me as ""dog girl"" till we moved to a different state.

I thought I got over all of that stuff and stopped doing it, but I recently realized that I haven't, I've just been picking up the personalities of characters more similar to how I actually am. So you know, I dont think I'm a cat anymore for the most part. I'm not sure if this is like a comfort thing or what, I didn't have any friends growing up n my life at home has always been shit so I guess it would make sense. And becoming someone I actually like *does* make me feel a bit better ab myself...

I know that's probably the worst thing I could be doing right now, but for the past 2 nights I thought I had found the solution to all my problems. a friend I knew from about 3 years ago got in touch needing help getting through a breakup. she didn't want her relationship to end and she still says she completely loves her ex. she said she just needed someone to listen to her, which I was willing to do. now is probably a good time to mention that I also feel unable to trust people, but I have no idea why. anyway, I stayed up with her on facetime until 5:00 A.M. two nights in a row, and in that tiny span of a about 10 hours we took turns venting to each other about anything and everything. I'm sure it was partly because of drug use at the time and every waking moment since then, but I became completely addicted to this girl. it was the most magical experience I've ever had, spilling my heart out to another broken soul. she is the only other human on this planet that I can confide in with complete honesty. but tonight she didn't want to talk. I know it's awful to be so dependent on a single person, especially since I haven't spoken to her in person in years. but I could tell from the second she started talking that we were fighting the same demons.

59,"I was born in a poor household; bad education, I was bad at most things myself, socially awkward too, but I was good at one thing and one thing alone, logic.

As you might imagine, my work field is logic, well automation, I convert actions, into logical patterns; yet I never went to college, I was too poor for that.

But logic really takes me over, it's the single defining factor.

Sleeping is very destructive for me because dreams don't make sense, I lucid, sleep paralysis, and even get post sleep hallucinations, extremely often as my brain tries to battle a world that doesn't make sense. I can seem to access parts of my brain I am not supposed to when this happens, my logical side can get extremely aggressive, leaving me baffled, destroyed.

My own sleep subconscious tries to create extremely realistic dreams to force me to sleep without doubting, doing it on purpose, but then the dreams can be so real, I might get confused on whether something happened or not, and the memories can be ridiculous, I can remember years of a life worth within a dream, where there were only 7 hours of sleep; not only false memories in content, but false in length.

It's hurtful when you remember losing someone you deared so much for so many years and you shared so much time together, and that person was just imaginary, and all the time you spent was imaginary as well.

My subconscious, which streams ideas sometimes, and I mean, twice in my life, my logic was so aggresively destructive to my mental state, that it had to interfere; I can't hardly even put in words this contact, I am scared of it; it doesn't speak, it just streamed me the purpose of dreaming, which was, ""to make you fit for life"", ensure survival, (he makes me hurt on purpose, to make me though), defining itself as a teacher, I don't know how to describe it, but rather it being unimaginably powerful, able to (and he demonstrated as I requested proof, because as scared as I was I kept defying it), rewrite my memories and completely rewire my brain, the sleep paralysis, post sleep hallucinations, were punishment and demonstration of its capabilities; as if to tell me, ""I have control over your reason, sleep and stop doubting the worlds I create"".

Knowing that such entity is there, part of my own brain, always watching, always making sure I survive; I know it's me because it described itself as me, so primal, so strange; freaks me out, but the worst is how this affects sleep quality and productivity during the day, because the entity is right, ""sleep, and stop doubting the worlds"", it is my logical actions, and my logical thinking that is interrupting the natural sleep pattern, not the subconscious entity which is doing its job (whatever it is doing with my brain while I sleep); yet it feels as if the entity was rather always cleaning up after my ""logical messes"" and ""takeover attempts"".

Primal brain is right, and wants something done about logical brain, and rewired me to shown concern, because it can, hence this wall of text; logical brain is so stubborn it still refuses to do anything; and none of this shit seems reasonable or logical so I start doubting whether it happened or not.",04Dec2020,1

firstly i feel severe amounts of emptiness. i mean i feel hollow on the inside. i feel like i’m not getting anywhere. i cant even figure who i am. i just have intense sadness most of the time. i have no particular reason to be as sad as i am constantly. i’ve always been depressed but it’s gotten worse and worse no matter how many med changes or therapy i go to. i have unstable relationships with most people. from never wanting to see them again and pushing them away then blaming them for leaving, to the next moment loving them and treating them like i 100% couldn’t be without them. i have extreme highs sometimes for a day- a week where i can get off my feet and get everything done. i won’t sleep and i’ll feel a purpose again. but just like a light switch i fall back down into a deep depression. i also experience very big bursts of anger. to the point that i get so angry it feels like i could pass out from the anger. it doesn’t take much to tip me over the edge like that. i expirence random periods of extreme paranoia , i won’t trust anyone whatsoever , i genuinely will believe someone’s out to get me. even friends and family. i have to make sure every door and window is locked. i won’t drink my drink if i leave it unattended. i won’t eat my food until someone else does or it comes straight unopened from a package. the period of paranoia last for about a week, sometimes two weeks and then will kind of go away for a little while. i will go through periods of times where i have awfully vivid nightmares and wake up in sleep paralysis. i have a horrid memory and a hard time taking information in. i have intrusive thoughts daily that i just recently found were not normal. other than those things random little things go on daily that were never normal for me.. i have a lot of twitches in my face , head, and body. i believe they’re just from anxiety because they happen more intensly when i’m around people. especially talking. i stutter a lot and can’t really take compliments nor can i truly communicate with people other than my doctors. i have not touched drugs so none of this is stemming from something like that. i can’t think of much at the moment. i’m sure i’m forgetting somethings. if someone has an idea please let me know. i’m sick of having no clue",04Dec2020,1
64,"hi everyone, i am on mobile so i apologize in advance for any formatting issues.


i (19f) have dealt with a disgusting amount of issues that began in my childhood and continued into adulthood. to the point where multiple people have said to me “i don’t know how you endure all of that, i wouldn’t be able to”. both of my parents are extremely mentally unstable, and i involved myself with such a mean, toxic group of girls in high school. i was met with mental and physical abuse from my parents as well as my “friends” starting bizarre rumors about me such as being a pregnant coke whore, none of which was true. EDIT: one of these girls was my cousin whom i grew up with and spent every day with until then. which caused even more issues between my family and my friends. the only stable relationship i have ever had is my boyfriend of 3 years, who often times is the only reason i decide to continue this life.


because of how amazing my boyfriend is, i decided to go back to therapy because i genuinely want to be my best self for him. while it has helped with some things, it’s also brought me to the consensus that no matter how much i talk about something, it’s not going to fix it. i frequently find myself questioning what i did to deserve so many people treating me so poorly, which leads me to believe that i’m the problem. this hurts because i spend a lot of my time trying to better myself and conform to whoever is around me for their sake and so that they don’t treat me like the scum of the earth like everyone else has. 


i hate to paint myself as the victim because i don’t think that i am. but i also don’t think that i deserve the cruelty that has been inflicted on me, nor do i think i should forgive every person who has taken part in that cruelty. but i do. i care so deeply about those close to me and am known as the “therapist friend” who tries to solve everyone’s shit because i truly just want what is best for them. i always question why people can’t care about me the way i do for them.


this is only a fraction of the problems i deal with everyday, but i think it is the one that affects me the most. i have tried therapy, healthy coping mechanisms, and multiple antidepressants that only make things worse for me. since these things never work, i also take part in unhealthy coping mechanisms which only adds onto the guilt. i keep it as hidden as i can, but long story short i am secretly drinking my life away at the age of 19. i would say a few drinks minimum (atleast, usually more) 4 out of 7 days a week. i hate it. i also have severe health anxiety which makes this so much worse, but no matter how much my brain tells me it’s harmful i physically cannot resist the idea of numbing these thoughts regardless of the substance.


as mentioned, i have tried everything i can possibly think of. yet here i am at the point of waking up everyday and wondering if i truly would be better off dead. i know it is an irrational thought but when every god damn day is filled with so much anxiety, loneliness and pain, it begins to become rational. i have such a dull outlook on life these days, and that has always gone against my values. i am at a battle with myself and other people everyday and ending all of it is the only way i can think of stopping that painfully numbing feeling.


i had therapy again today, i’ve talked to friends about it endlessly, nothing helps. i know it sounds stupid but i feel as though an outsiders perspective/advice could quite literally save my life.. if nothing else works then where do i go from here? if others as well as myself think i am so unworthy, is it possible that it’s true? thank you in advance..

TL;DR: i have tried everything i can to salvage my relationship with myself in order to tend to my relationships outside of that. however, nothing seems to work and i am close to giving up.",04Dec2020,1

The only way to get out is to do it and if I do, do it and fail, I won't even have the comfort of thinking that I can get out.

I had an appetite!! and I didn't get full after a few bites, just to find myself starving and sick an hour later. I also got really sick last week and was throwing up anything I ate, which was really crushing to my moral and overall health. I've just been so skinny and shaky and weak and tired lately that's it's getting to be way too overwhelming and, even though it was a little win last night, it was a big one for me. 

for the record, I do not have a diagnosed ED. as far as I'm aware, I just have a terrible appetite thanks to my diagnosed anxiety. normally, if I don't force myself to eat something, I can comfortably go all day without eating anything. or if I do get a little hungry, it's anywhere from 6-8pm.

I've been trying REALLY hard to keep it up today, and it's going okay! I havent eaten as much as I probably should today, but I've eaten more than I usually do. it felt really good to go to bed last night and not feel dizzy, and it felt good to wake up this morning and not feel like my insides were caving in. beyond anything though, it felt good to have energy and strength!

This all was caused by two things I suffered chilhood abuse when I was a child I was abused for 5 years from the the age of 4 to 9 it was really traumatic these people made me stand in a corner for hours they would hit me any time I tried to do something that I wasnt allowed to they treated me like shit worst of all they were my own family members when the abuse ended I thought to myself that it was all over little did I know I would still have a lot of scars and wounds to heal It literally took me 13 years to finally heal all of these wounds all of these scars my way of thinking was so horrible I was profoundly miserable I had so much anxiety and got so many panic attacks. 

I had to fight many battles shed thousands tears I literally had to go through middle school and highschool without having any friends because I thought that everyone was gonna judge me or hurt me I didn't who I was Inside I didn't know how to love I didn't know  how to make any friends and any time I tried I would feel weird. I felt so alone and all I wanted was just a friend. All I wanted was a hug :( 

I would get anxiety I would be self concious to an extreme level but that all changed changed on 2020. May 29, 2020 was The Day That Changed my whole life on this day  I took a dose of 250 micrograms of LSD a drug which when taken can produce psychedelic effects the effects that I got allowed me to see that this world can be dark can be rough can be scary but it can also be love be light be positivity I realized that no ones out to get me it showed me the bright side of life.

It made me realize who I am inside  it also made me love myself. I literally cried as as I realized all of this these tears weren't of sadness though they were of joy it was my mind finally releasing all the pent up feelings emotions and thought I had stuck deep inside of my mind this drug literally cleansed my soul inside and out I felt completly new I felt like I could be myself I had hope again I felt like that little kid when I was 4 when I was happy and nothing mattered  I will never forget that beautiful day ;(

 June of 2020 ended up being the best month of my life because I had a new attitude towards life. I finally knew my purpose and felt whole again. I can finally say that I was saved. I am now more prepared and ready to take on 2021 I will never forget 2020 it was one of the most mysterious hard challenging but also positive enlightened and craziest year of my life.Thank you god I know that life can be rough sometimes but there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.

70,"The last month and a half with this girl was incredible. We saw a future, and got extremely attached. She left me only three days ago. She told me it was for her own mental health and for her to be happy without depending on someone else, which is understandable. During the relationship she lied about how she was feeling and put me in positions of pain and confusion, telling me one day her mental situation was amazing and the next that she was suffering. It was all “never my fault.” she made me handmade gifts and then left two days later. She says she’s sorry and she still loves me, and promised she’d never leave. I didn’t have a reason to get up until she came into my life. And i’m back to my same cycle. I was so happy. She broke me all over again and I just don’t understand. It seems kinda stupid considering it only lasted near two months but, the attachment and the way we carried ourselves around eachother made it feel like years. We had thought about a future together and genuinely wanted to last a very long time. Then all of a sudden she leaves with no explanation but it’s nothing i did and it’s best for her to focus on herself, yet two weeks before she praised me for digging her out of the deepest mental
hole she’s ever been in. I just don’t get it. I miss her so much and she’s already said she doesn’t want to take me back. I made sure everything worked for her and put my trust issues and anxiety aside so she could live her life and do as much as she wanted. I tried so hard to keep her and she just ends it. I’m at the point where i’m contemplating ending it. I’ve been cheated on three times in the past and left by so many people i just don’t know what to do anymore.

72,"Possible TW for ED:

I (16) have always had a very 50/50 relationship with food: when I was little I ate *everything* in Big amounts, but as I grew older, my appetite had grown noticeably smaller than my family and my peers. It's not like I didn't eat-- I did, vegetables and whatnot, and it's been *enough*. Not a lot, but enough.

Recently (last 4-5 weeks), however, I've been having actual troubles eating at home, because my parents have always commented on my body and what I eat, especially my stomach &amp; legs. I don't eat most of the day, apart from dinner due to the fact that I'm forced to eat because dinner is Family Things. It makes me feel downright miserable.

Because of the lack of actual food I've been having nosebleeds-- about every other day. I'm at the point where I recognise the issue has become a bigger problem and that I need to start fixing it, but eating at home just makes me feel so guilty. Eating outside (store, restaurant, etc) doesn't really make me feel bad, but with COVID I don't really get the chance to. 

I need to get help, but my parents are most definitely not an option. Thoughts?",04Dec2020,1
73,"tw; self harm and suicidal thoughts.. i guess?

i've struggled with what is most likely to be depression (i've come to this conclusion with my mum, i took antidepressants a couple of years ago but wasn't given a diagnosis) as well as anxiety for several years. i mean since i was 10 or 11 years old so at least 3 years now. i've gotten pretty good at hiding it over these years, i'm able to mostly control my crying now when i get really bad anxiety and really really bad moments where i'm super sad and think about things like self harm and experience suicidal thoughts but i don't really know what to call these moments. anyway, when this happens i don't really show it a whole lot since i learned how to hide it. one thing i can't hide is not talking to people but i'm a quiet person anyway so it is expected. because of these as well as a bunch of other things i've been able to get through life with nobody noticing anything was wrong except for my mum. when i think about it i'm relieved because nobody feels like they have to treat me differently and they don't think badly of me but at the same time i wish people would notice something is wrong so that i could know that people care about me and want me to get help. i hate getting attention but i enjoy it at the same time and sometimes i just want people to notice that something isn't right with me but at the same time i don't want anyone to notice me. i'm not even sure what it is that i want at this point other than feeling normal again. i'm just too tired and drained of mental energy to deal with all of the things that have happened to me personally and the entire world at the same time. i just want to sleep for a long time and wake up and feel normal again. i wish it was that easy.",04Dec2020,1

76,"Hey, I'm 15, in the US, and gender disphoric. Lately, ive been feeling intensive moments of happiness, then apathy, and followed by a rather low sadness where i honeslty want to not live anymore. This flipping is exhausting as it happens with no regularity, and can be up to 5 times a day (even if its just mood swings- normal for my age- it's really got me messed up). I have not gone to a therapist/psychiatrist and i am extermely scared to. Mostly becuase I fear they will call me crazy. I also have no real access to them with covid, and (should they not put me in a mental care facility) I feel like they'd just load me up on pills. I'll level with you when i say. I'm honestly a little afraid im schizophrenic (for reasons, i'll only include if its relevant). Even if it is unlikely, it's a fear of mine. (I'm more likely depressed, as it runs in my family) I'm terrified of what may come next for me because i dont always feel like myself. I'm scared of my own hand and i keep making myslef more sad and angry espeically during times that i get numb (when i say numb, i should clarify, i feel little to no empathy). 
To add, many of my friends are worse places than me. When i talk to them while numb, i feel guilty and angry at myslef later for being apathetic to something potentially dangerous (such as my sucidial friends when i cant find it in myself to feel anything). Still a part of me says I cant leave them. At the same time, i dont want to be around them when i dont feel like my energetic and empathetic self(as i have been described since age 6). At this moment, i want to fix myslef (note that when i'm numb or happy, i have no desire to do such a thing and feel like i should willingly resist it) but I cant bear going to a doctor about it. Why? I dont want to put that tax upon anyone. I know how expensive it and pills are and i cant ask my family to pay for that, along with the mental burden of having a sick child. Now, I try to think i'm a man of logic. And i understand if I have to do some of these things, still I want there to be a soloution I missed. Do i need to get theapry/phyciatric help? Is there something else i can do when i get in an odd state? What do i tell my parents about my health? How do i interact with my friends? (Thank you in advance.)",04Dec2020,1

80,"hi everyone, so i needed a place to vent but i could also really use some advice. im sorry if this is long and sporadic but i needed to get this out. 

i am an almost 19 year old female who has ocd, anxiety, depression, and ptsd. i recently discovered that i was basically being sexually, emotionally, and mentally abused by my ex boyfriend for 2 years. 
the 2 times he gave me sexual trauma, my therapist and trusted close family members + friends have told me it was rape. 

he would sexually harass me everyday at school before we were together, and during the summer we got together, because he was so desperate for sex because the girl he was chasing for years cut him off after he pressured her to have sex with him and his friend (which he tried to say it was her fault, and manipulated my ass into thinking she was a whore), and he manipulated me into thinking he cared about me and got me to get a crush on him. i should also mention before he started to move on to trying to reel me in, i thought that thing with the girl was 100% his fault and told him straight to his face that he hurt her. i cant believe he tricked me into thinking he was her fault. it makes me sick that i was manipulated like that. 

before this i always vowed to never get a crush on him because he would harass me and say disgusting shit to me and make me uncomfortable everyday, and when i came home from school i would nap for several hours and my back hurt so much from the stress. 

i think he knew i was vulnerable especially because of my previous trauma from my father physically abusing me for years, and how i was afraid of men, and used it to his advantage.

he pressured me into losing my virginity to him 2 weeks after we first got together and that was the first time he hurt me and what did he did to hurt me, i did not give him consent to do. 

during our 2 year long relationship he would make fun of me and humiliate me in front of his friends and family, send me pictures of dead animals to see my reaction/to make me upset, lie to me about using drugs, and badger + guilt trip me into having sex. 

about a year in he badgered and guilt tripped me into having sex and around the probably 20th time of him asking me and me saying no, i gave in because i was so tired of him asking me and him treating me like shit after i said no. the whole time i was frozen, and i developed vaginismus afterward, and the stress and trauma caused my IBS to worsen (which hasnt changed to this day), gained a lot of weight, as well as a worsened self esteem and body image. 

i finally told him about a year later at the start of quarantine what he did and he said ‘SO BASICALLY I RAPED YOU!???’ all sad and crying and being the pussy i was, as well as believing it was my fault for getting into that situation, said it wasnt. and he continued to act sad and say that he hated abusers and shit even though, now that i look back on it now, that’s what he was doing to me.

i broke up with him 3 months later because i started to see through all his bullshit. so every once in a while after we broke up he would text me asking for reassurance / if he raped me or not. he hasnt done it in a while but now that i know what really happened + what was going on, i dont know what the hell to say. i want to write him a long letter telling him how he hurt me and how he needs to get help so he doesnt hurt anyone again, as well as telling him to never contact me again, but i feel like it would make him suicidal because he is extremely emotionally unstable.

im still facing the effects from all the trauma he caused me today. after and during our relationship i would have nightmares of him hurting me, and for a while i havent gotten them, until recently when i was finally able to discuss my trauma. i gained about 20 pounds from stress around the second time he raped me and also my IBS-C got so bad i had to be prescribed fucking linzess because im holding so much stress within my body that i cant shit and couldn’t shit for weeks. i want to get healthy and lose the weight and also be able to function without ibs medication but my motivation is shot and i feel like i cant do anything. and also, i still feel weird calling what he did to me rape. my therapist said i dont have to call it anything like that if i dont want to but a part of me still feels like its my fault that i let it happen to me.

people tell me that what he did to me wasnt normal. i dont know how or why i thought how he treated me was normal for so long. and now im scared that the next person that comes into my life, i wont be able to tell if theyre hurting me or not. i let him walk all over me and  inever teally gave him any problems and when i spoke up about how something he did made me uncomfortable he would always get upset and force me to say sorry and that i was just sensitive. 

i also feel disgusted that i fell for his bullshit to begin with and that someone was able to manipulate me so easily. especially someone as disgusting as him. it makes me feel defiled and worthless.

im sorry if this was long but i needed to get this out somewhere and any feedback would be appreciated. i am so lost on what to do about this. its almost 5 in the morning around the time im posting this and its kept me up all night, and has a bunch of times before.",04Dec2020,1

I (19,F) have recently been to an ER specialised in mental health. I've explained them that my depression has progressively worsen over the course of the last few weeks and that I didnt feel like I could make it through the next days.

I've also talked about the fact that my self harm was out of control and that I was having a suicide plan pretty established that consisted in defenestration (i live in the 6th floor)

They kept me one night, put me on Valium, and told me to leave.

I'm honnestly confused, and a little bit furious. I have the feeling that they didnt took me seriously, as given the fact that Im a young woman.

What does it takes to get proper help? Do I have to make a suicide attempt or be totaly psychotic to deserve help and get hospitalised?

By comparison, I feel like a leech because my job doesn't make that much money and my mental issues are more outwardly severe. Although this is about him and not me, my mental issues are having an impact on him.

I have PTSD, which comes with severe episodes of depression and anxiety at times, and even a few weird ""freakouts"". I am seeing a therapist. Coupled with Aspergers, I also don't ""read the room"" or understand the nuances of what people are trying to tell me if they are not blunt (NOT MEAN, just blunt).

My fiancé is magical because he can make me laugh when I don't want to. He knows what my childhood was and is not turned away by it (albeit he's rightfully disturbed by it), and he's even helped me save a couple animals from my family's collecting habits. By that, I mean I have two healthy orange cats without respiratory issues, without fleas, and who are affectionate. My fiancé even paid $2000 to save my older cat from some string that he ate.

I can't do any of that for him. In fact, the more I try, the more I make it worse. The wage gap between us is one thing, but when he thinks he's made me sad or that he couldn't help me, he becomes self destructive when I am not looking and says horrible things about himself. Things like he's ""worthless"", ""dumb/stupid"", ""makes people sad"", that he should sleep on the floor, he ""can't do anything right"", and so on and so forth. NONE of this is true. He's smart, creative, and in need of all the love in the world. I don't know where he heard all of this from, but I want to help him.

Im just so tired all the time and all i wanna do is sleep but it doesnt matter bcs im still tired regardless of how i slept. I can deal (?) with the hopelessness and the rest but i just cant properly function when im so fatigued and tired.ik i use the word tired and exhausted a lot mostly bcs i dont know a proper/other word to use. is there a different way to describe as to what im feeling? should i be concerned? how do i make it stop? also im 14F btw. thanks for reading :) (also please tell me if i should post this elsewhere i dont know how this works),04Dec2020,1

One of the breeders hatched 25 of the same dino from eggs with really nice colors. He said he was giving everyone one and they were all in a certain spot and the rest he was selling. When we got there the only one who he forgot about was me. It happened a lot. And more than just with dinos. And more than just with that group. That happened on a lot of games.. another was when my own grandpa forgot about me and I had to ride in the bed of a truck. Then my uncle. And I had to walk a mile and a half. At my job some times the boss buys everyone pizza. Because of Corona everyone gets their own. The past two times I've been forgotten about. Then today everyone at the job forgot about me and left me no where to park in a place that we all usually fit into. Which I got in trouble for parking somewhere else. I thought at first it was that I had the wrong kinda friends. But as life went on and I met more people and it happened in family and games and now even work. I don't know. I've tried changing my personality. I've tried being louder and quieter and being more involved and less involved. Usually I just get ignored and never told anything at all. I work off.

Nobody gives a fuck about how you got there if the result is produced."", - something that I've been telling myself for... twenty minutes or so.

The last few weeks have been a nightmare. I’ve just started college and I've had a handful of essays to write, and they’ve been driving me insane. They’re not even difficult, but I can’t focus on the text for more than 30 seconds. It’s like I’ve lost the ability to read. I've really dropped the ball on my classes and thinking about the finals makes me wish I was dead.

I hate going to bed, it’s not that I can’t sleep, just that I’d rather stare into my screen in apathy. I usually go to bed at 5 am and either wake up at 8 or 10 for online classes or sleep til 1 pm. I’ve also been losing weight unintentionally, but only about 13 lbs and I’m still at a healthy weight. I rarely feel very hungry and cooking just feels unnecessary. 

A friend texted me today and asked if I was okay. I broke down crying and it’s not the first time something like that has happened. Almost every time someone asks me if I’m okay I get very emotional, but soon after I don’t feel much, so maybe it’s just a knee jerk reaction. I’ve gone through similar periods before and a few times I’ve had people tell me I should seek help. I’ve had more people tell me it’s just the normal ups and downs of life though. 

Is this just me being terrible at self control? Everything was going so well for me and I don’t understand why I’ve just ceased to function. I got into my dream college in the city I’ve wanted to move to for years. I’m in a relationship with a wonderful guy, I’ve made great friends in the new place, and still keep contact with my friends back home and I love my new apartment. I’ve even been getting through my classes okay til now, why am I not happy?

Is this normal? Am I just being melodramatic or is this something I should talk to somebody about? A lot of people seem to be struggling with the quarantine so maybe I should be able to handle this on my own.",04Dec2020,1
100,"*Preface, sorry that this is so jumbled. My brain is just... a lot... and I'm trying to improve.*

When I was younger, I foolishly pretended none of my problems at home or at school existed and it's manifested itself into me feeling inferior, having no sense of self worth / feeling worthless, identity problems, and emotional problems. Once I realized I liked men, it was over for any chance of me recovering my mental health in my teens because of my home and school environments. My anxiety blew up, I started having panic attacks and depression, and I started comparing myself to other men so much that it just ended up making me lose my sense of self. I just cannot chill out, ever, I live my life every day feeling detached and scanning everything for a possible threat / ways to protect myself from rejection while my mind cycles through different negative or unhelpful thoughts rapidly. I'm unable to create solid long term goals / plans because my anxiety gets in the way and rapidly changes how I can cope with things. For example, I'm started going to a gym, but in a given week for my 3-4 days each day I'll feel completely different than the last in terms of how comfortable I am being in the gym and whether I feel scared of those around me. It's very tiring and scary that my mental health has fallen this deep.

I'm 20 now, I live away from home cause I wanted to escape that mess of a place, and I find myself barely scraping by, unable to afford anything (including therapy) except the bare essentials. Financially, a terrible decision but it has been great for my personal growth, as before I was completely unaware that all this was happening to me, and now I have perspective and have identified these bad patterns and understand why I behave the way I do. I REFUSE to let myself grow into a bitter adult, I know I have to improve and I've made some progress thus far. I've got myself an emotional regulation therapy workbook and I'm doing small things each day to improve my physical and mental health and trying to be more honest with myself and what **I** want. Certain things I just have absolutely no idea how I'm supposed to even get started, much less without any therapy.

How exactly do I stop doing everything for others, or frame it in a way in my mind that makes it easier? I grew up on social media / internet and this is a terrible habit I picked up along the way. It's gotten so bad that I even chose my own college major which I've now dropped, for my parents, out of fear of backlash. I am deeply broken in this regard, I never think about what I want and can barely even recognize what specifically it is I want anymore, I have some pretty severe identity issues, my self concept is extremely warped compared to even a year or two ago. I'm not sure how to find who I am.

In terms of my relationships, I can make friends pretty well but romantic and sexual relationships are a different story. I got walked on by a bunch of guys when I first started dating and it further fucked my self concept and self worth... I've found myself settling for guys that aren't for me because I got hooked to the validation. It's impossible for me to have sex, because performance anxiety, fear of my physical weakness / lack of stamina and assuming the worst make it almost impossible for me to get hard to begin with. How am I even supposed to build a normal, trusting, loving 50/50 relationship when my mind works this way? How do I chill out enough to make my mind shut up so I can empathize and get to know someone properly, or literally just feel comfortable enough to have sex, amongst other things? I feel ridiculously fragmented and broken in this regard and I wouldn't even know where to start picking up the pieces to fix this part of things.

I just feel like a clusterfuck of negativity and feel emotionally overwhelmed, when I think back to my childhood it's scary how much slower and normal I can remember feeling / behaving in any given moment compared to now. I'm glad I'm able to recognize my patterns and why they happen, and I have begun working on some of the ""easier stuff"" but man some of this stuff feels like asking me to climb Mt. Everest to overcome. I don't know where to start and I can't afford any professional help so it sucks. Do any of you guys have any ideas or advice? Were any of you like me at my age? I'd love to hear from others, or the stories of others going through other mental health ruts and how they got themselves out of it! Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it.",04Dec2020,1
101,Saw him walking around like a mad man in all directions before approaching me. What is it with people who are in bad moods that just makes them behave in this way? Told him “I didn’t know.” He said “so you don’t know” I said “go find it yourself” as he walked away. Still fuming that a complete stranger felt he could behave and impose upon me this way. Then wouldn’t even leave as I was waiting for the elevator. I actually ignored him the first time round before he asked again. What would you have done in this situation? It’s obvious by this point to obviously stay two meters from someone indoors and we were in a shopping mall too. Am still annoyed and this happened yesterday as well.,04Dec2020,1

He thinks he has created an AI, and is posting nonsense on his Twitter acc talking with himself, normally that wouldn't be such a big deal, but he writes there that his family is trying to murder him and this AI he created, is called the same as a girl he stalked a couple of years prior, when he was sentenced to the psych ward for drug induced psychosis.

104,"I've been taking lithium for years and years but I ran out of stock so for the past few weeks I wasn't taking any. I tried to get in touch with my psychiatrist to ask what to do but I know for sure I need to start taking them again. I took 900mg a day before and have 300mg tablets.

105,"So recently I got offered to attend a model course. 
Never had big expectations, but the fellow guys and girls there hyped me like I had already won a contract saying that I was doing better than everyone ect. Today was the final day and we had a meeting with the booker. Some of my circle got offered contracts on the spot. That wasn't the case for me. The booker said he was not sure, that there was something in me that stops him from offering me a job. He wants me to call him back next week so he can arrange a photoshoot trial so that he can be sure. But that was enough for me to throw me off my horse. I've dealt with low selfesteem when I was in school. Since then I've grown to like myself, thanks to people around me, hyping me up, receiving attention from the opposite sex ect. and always being asked why didn't I try a modeling career. 
I'm so happy that few of my pals got a contract but the meer fact I didn't right from the get go makes me feel down and unsure of myself. I know that I have one more chance ahead but my toxic mind picked up  that little hint of doubt and is now beating me up over it. I keep on telling myself that I'm not good enough and that I have nothing to offer in life. I realise that is not the case and that I should not give up after being rejected once but my selfesteem plummited with a million miles an hour and that's just how my brain works. I didn't wanted to prove anyone anything, I wanted to show my depression that regardless of what she says...I can be somebody in an area that I like. Now I gave her even more power to tell me otherwise. 
What should I do to get out of this zone?",04Dec2020,1

107,"
I recently moved in with a “friend of a friend” (f/23/questioning). We have some things slightly in common (she’s a sci-fi fantasy fan, I like anime) but being different from someone has never stopped me from being friendly with them in the past. I figured, hey anything is better than what my living situation was previously, so why not. We are both black, both writers, both learning a lot about ourselves this year. 

Things have gotten quite difficult for me lately, and I can no longer be the support system that my roommate needs. She is diagnosed BPD and medicated, and we have very open communication about it. She is still learning how to navigate all her emotions, and bc of BPD doesn’t always catch when I am ready/not ready for a heavy conversation. 

She has lots of negative self-thought/talk, insecure, angry because of the horrible upbringing she suffered as a child. Every story I tell, she finds a way to relate to this abuse. I often don’t know how to navigate this. I am understanding, as my mother has a very similar story, and has been diagnosed BPD for 5 years. 

So I’m used to it lol, I give as much comfort and will listen silently for hours as she talks. But I haven’t had the mental strength lately. 

The current situation is, my roommate got her feelings crushed by this guy who I believe (from what’s she’s told me) doesn’t like or respect her. He often will not respond to her, which makes her spiral. He acts as though she’s a friend, but the basis of their relationship seemed to be a system in which she would hold his mail packages for him, and he would come to grab them from her place after work. He used sexual communication to keep her enticed and create a veil of interest. He is also 30 years old. And I know we’re not supposed to judge anyone but... I have my feelings about 30+ year-old men taking under 25 yo people through mental gymnastics. 

While I normally would advise “Girl, he don’t like you” I cannot do so with my roommate. That wouldn’t be fair to her and it’s not how she sees the world. She has major abandonment issues and she feels she is connected to this man. She talks about him every day. I can see how holding onto this negative relationship is causing her pain. I try to not engage, but she is very good at flipping anything I say to bring him and their relationship up. 

Also, if I do successfully disengage from talking about the guy, she’ll pout and go in her room and be sad for several days. 

We live in a small apartment and I live in Chicago, so there are not many options for getting out and away right now. 


What are some things I can do to be a better friend for my roommate as she goes through this journey? I want to preserve our relationship, not let it crash and burn because I couldn’t be enough.",04Dec2020,1
108,"Started a new job a couple weeks ago. About a month prior to that I found out I have GHSV2. I wasn’t too upset about finding that out because I got it from my current boyfriend, who has had it unknowingly sooo nothings changed between us. Starting the job really helped me get my mind off the funk I was in about that then on my third day of work my great grandmother passed away. I have been devastated about that I feel like I didn’t get to mourn properly because I had to go out of town during the process of arranging her funeral so I didn’t get to help. Then while I was in Colorado my biological dad (who has been contacting me frantically/aggressively for months due to a drug induced psychosis) was trying to FLIRT with me under my Instagram photos??? Asking me if”it’s weird if I call my daughter hot?” When i just had a situation when I was 18 where his little brother/my uncle tried to have sex with me. I can’t make sense of why all this is happening to me all at once I truly feel broken. I start my first day back at work this morning and I just want to curl up in a ball and die.",04Dec2020,1
109,"First i´ll address the main thing that i want to confess not to soften it before, just to go the point. I've harassed girls and had one abusive sexual moment and in general abusive ideas normalized , i didn't know if it was abuse at that time but i´ll try to explain everything.


 I was always the quiet cool guy that took care of everybody in parties, didn't allow my friends to get molested or my drunk friends to molest anybody,but somehow i ended up doing it myself,went from trying to play the flirt to do dumb and disrespectful shit,even criminal shit , i almost always apologized after wards, most of the time I didn't woke up thinking it was cool,and really i don´t know if its ego,insecurities,trauma or a mix of everyone. i did all this at parties because i never even had a date,but i think i would've act like this,maybe not so persistent tho.


When i was 18 i locked one of my female friends into his bathroom, yes at crazy as it sounds,minutes after i danced wit my friends to get the creeps to go, i tried repeatedly to kiss her, then i followed her and i did that,locked her in with me, she just laughed, kissed me a little then left, when i realized it, i almost cried saying sorry to her and she understood, and everybody just laughed at the situation after.

 

Second when i was 20, i was kissing with a girl in a tent at a party and started to trying to touch her even after she had said no, and telling her to go somewhere else and trying to get to sex, I remember my mind was like convinced of getting  to do it, after that it calmed an we kept kissing and all, few days later a friend of mine who was the boyfriend  of a friend of this girl,told me i had put put her hand on my groin, and i realized i had already done that with other girls, 3 times, those times we were both horny and those times it had 'worked' plus it was done to me too, two girls had put my hands in her tits and groin too before,i guess i copied it or thought it wasn't that bad cause i liked it either way. i didn't think it was that bad because the girl told my friend she was still interested in me, i apologized recently to her saying i was way too persistent and that shouldn't have happened, told her i was worried because if i would've have a girlfriend i prolly would´ve been a jackass, and that i had suicidal behavior(not trynna make a victim of my self, thats absolutely true) and if i was thinking in commiting suicide and all that shit then my mind have been really fucked up, she told me I was super drunk, that she almost didnt even remebered it when she thought of past abuse experiencies and she took it as a drunk-party thing, told me the message i was sending her surprised her, that she gets im worried and all, she even told me to recover self esteem and go see a therapist.i thanked her for her kindness and his for listening to me. 


The weird thing is i had been kissing with a girl in the same party and same tent like 2 hours before, both alone and i didnt persist at all, if i tried something i just stopped when she said no, and then i ended abusing the other girl  bc thats abuse and i didnt know, at  that moment there was even  people there trying to sleep too, weird as shit, still cant figure how tf i did it. I had sexual intercoursekisses, touchin, with consent, with a girl in a tent full of people in my first party and we took it like a game that time so i might have thought i could repeat that again, I can't really tell what was in my mind. 


One month later i had been dancing with a girl in a other party and as we were really close i thought i could kiss her, then i slowly started to get far,taking her far from that place instead of asking her if he wanted to go other place (again thinking that shit could work) and i started telling her cmon cmon you arent even with your boyfriend (did'nt even really knew that) and i was not understanding no is no, trying to make it work, thats harassement too, 3 days later i apologized with her when a friend called me saying this girl talked to him saying i harassed her, then they set up a meeting at like 4 pm, she told me the problem was everyone was telling her ex that she had fucked and kissed everyone and she thought it was me, i told her i wasnt, though we kissed a little that shit shouldnt have happened, that i dont act that way sober( im so naive with girls i cant even say that is true) So thats the point, when i was drunk this CREEPY ass behavior showed up, 2 years after all this with 22 years of age i realized i abused someone and harassed other girls and i cant stop crying and puking when thinking about it, wont kill myself bc i know i would be a coward and only cause more pain but i think i wont get through it easily, plus i obviously deserve some bad times maybe. 


Now i´ll talk about what i can say trauma, and possible causes to act in a so unemphatic way.

My brother is a violent asshole who cant control anger, has violented  me verbally and phyisically since i can remember, i suffered child bullying from elementary till like 8th grade, when i was 8 yo in 3rd grade a classmate  broke my leg trying to make me fall, i realized after being walking with pain for a month, they made me sit with a classmate that grabbed my balls all the time, everyday for a month until i was able to tell my dad the day i did the same to him and he gladly told me not to do it and allow it again,  and i could speak like 3 hours of the shit i suffered in that school that year,thats how much violence i suffered in that age and my brother did the same to me, he cooked for me and all but i don´t think you could be that mean to your little brother  that was going thru that much, he used to wait for my dad to leave to indtimidate me saying i was a pussy for snitching and not responding ( i was 8, he was 17, he never hit me with his fist but a lot of slaps, kicks, shoves from a 6'0 215+ lbs guy) plus our mom had passed away two years old when i was 6 , i honestly always thought it wasnt that bad to have a life like that at such a young age but most people had told me they wouldn´t be even alive in my shoes, i think  i was the perfect prospect to become a sick person. Violence continued in the past schools but after 3rd grade but at least i had friends there, my brother never changed really,always intimidating thinking he could be the way we wanted with everyone, what i want to express is i kinda never responded to violence, always kept it to me, i think it is weird for a person even that young  to let a classmates beat him and even touch him without do nothing. 


My grandma helped my father raise us too, she´s absolutely insane, a religious fiend, preaching on the streets but she drowns cub cats in water not to raise him, she always caused trouble, she used to argue a lot with my brother,even told him the he had killed my mother, that it was his fault when it was from aneurysma, she did that with me and my sister watching, thats how crazy she is.


 Never had any consent education, cant blame my father, he was busy trying to raise us with the minimum and all by himself, we were so poor sometimes i had to go to eat to my other grandma´s place, i think i had lots of the  problems a kid could have, my dad is a dog, hes a social worker and he knows his shit,  hes a badass father and never did anything wrong to me, i always wanted to be like him.


This year i realized i talk alone too, i probably do since a young age, even on the streets ive said hi to the air, i think its not that bad, i imaginaged situations where i responded to violence and ive thought sometimes one of my friends is there, i think that helped me to unconsciusly bear through it but it shows some kind of mental problem i would guess becuase I talk to the air like imaging conversations with no one there  even if I am on the bus or at the streets, it is certainly weird. 


  Im a 22 virgin (had sex one time at 19 and i was drunk, my dick aint even got hard, plus i think im a premature ejaculator and alcohol didnt allow me to feel any sort of sensibility) i've kissed girls and touched girls only in parties, never had that much of a real life, a quiet guy, few friends, pretty normal guy and even a good guy witch makes this weirder, always protected my girlfriends from getting harassed by drunk guys and even stopped my drunk friends from doing that, . Problem is i ended up doing it myself, that creepy ass behavior showed up.


I had problems with porn too, i think i started watching it from 11 years old and got addict to it from like 13-22 and i realize i had been jerking to abuse and probably rape, either made up or rape without even knowing it was, porn is usually not harmful especially if is at a normal age but at 11 i think i´ts too much, ive been trying to let it but sometimes i end up in a binge, it´s like my mind is used to it, i dont think it could harm now but im trynna stay off it. Now that I'm older I remember I unconsciously battled perverted ideas maybe because of anxious and intrusive thoughts that made me realize things before. 


In my country they're cancelling everyone for this typa thing, harassement, violence, and raping stuff. So I realized it, when one girlfriend of my sister was cancelling his ex 'fuckmate' bc they used to do anal and she was hurting and telling to stop but dude just kept going. There i realized that shit behaviour is from porn, that I kinda  liked that too, sometimes i thought girls where saying no was hot or something like that, we all have kinks but honestly I couldn't tell if I could separate porn from reality because I don't know how fucked up mentally I was, like thinking no is yes, and i may wouldve done the same if i had had sex sometime beside my shitty first time, porn users know that shit is from porn, and me putting girls hands into my body could be a porn thing too, locking someone i dont know but yall get the point, i cant tell if i would´ve done that sober with a girlfriend really because i dont know, I could assure I would been able to realize I was causing discomfort and stop as I did the day  I committed abuse with that girl but who knows, I don't know if I had a disorder or what was in my min.


My abusive brother was caught watching porn a lot too, i remember when i was 11 he had some old school porn DVD's, and I think he has acted sexually abusive too because of what I heard from other rooms when he has sex or something, and Im pretty sure he acts like that because he often yells to his girl and to my sister and women could tell that violent boyfriends are sexually violent too most of the times , he  has beaten me and made me feel like shit since i can remember, and he probably ruined my life and he may have made me like this, all the egocentric, wiseass, insecure and abusive behavior ive had in my life is very close to his, he will be a dad in months so i would like to get him therapy but he doesn't change and we don't even talk , we had a drinks with a cousin and my best friend  like 2 months ago and he started following me and shoving me over vomit of my bf that I didn't clean completely without knowing, in a way he acted likely like me when I molested girls, he just wanted to step over me and don't teach me nothing, he yelled to me: when I speak you just shut up! And left, there I realized he just projects towards me and doesn't want to help me at all so I got tired of trying to take humiliations so he doesn't get kicked out. 


 I kinda would like to leave college, all this girls i molested are from my school, and i am in my 9/10 semester about to finish but i'll leave, these girls though they accepted the apologize they probably deserve not seeing me anymore, if sum like this happened to my sister i would love the guy to leave my sister in peace.


Environment lead to this shit too, i was harassed in parties too, got my mouth licked out of nowhere, like 20 times girls grabbed my ass out of nowhere, i was threatened from a girl, told me i wouldnt be in peace and she would return the ""damage"" after i told her that we had to stop talking bc i didnt want to start dating her, she was already controlling me and saying i was her bf and we just had seen each other once. And my female friends just laughed at these things and allowed it, and so i did. I feel its true i had the experience from a 14 y/o at 20 years old, i feel its true that i had severe trauma and i could be in jail if i had exploded and returned the damage to my brother or i couldve killed my self when I was 8 or something .

I even want to start studying pshychology or be a teacher so i can save kids from this type of shit. I don't care if sometime i get exposed in social media bc i think i couldve done worst things and i had to learn the wrong way, it was bound to happen, i was a danger to women without knowing, ofc it couldve been different, in a worse or better way, im kinda thankful i rejected every woman that wanted to date me and every women that rejected me too because i dont know if i would´ve been nice or abusive, i thinks there are 2 sides to it.


I probably deserve being so repetitive, depressed, sad an disgusted about it because i acted like that ( i was depressed before too) but i think i dont deserve to have my mind full of shit since an early age, always was a good guy,though life only offered me bad things, i always said i wouldn´t cheat on a girl, and i always thought about my first time being at like 15 with the girl i loved, in a lovely and innocent way,and  here i am, sometimes i think my life is over and if i help my brother´s son and wife im good, if i dont get to know girls and have sex idgaf, but lately i´ve woke up and started crying about it, i honestly want to give and feel all the love and good intentions i have but i think i´ts too late,  i don´t know what girls think or if i should tell about this to a girl i date in the future.

Everyone has told me im a good guy, that man usually dont even care about what they do, that for the life i had i shouldnt even be alive, or that i should go to therapy, stop drinking and thats it, but i think that behaviour is at least a thing to worry.

I'm looking for a therapist and i think i will be fine but hearing the whole thing and  a piece of advice would work a lot, thanks in advance.

110,"My boyfriend suffers with his mental health. He's currently taking 150mg of sertraline and is on a waiting list for a psychiatrist. For the past 3 months or so he's been getting worse and worse and now he just won't get out of bed. It's starting to really affect our relationship but more importantly it's affecting our daughter. He barely spends time with her, doesn't ever come out with us to the park or on a walk, doesn't help looking after her very much and its gotten to the point where she tells him to sleep if he gets up in the day time because she's not used to him being around in daylight hours. She's 2. 

I don't know what to say to him to get him to change. I've tried being kind, concerned, supportive, encouraging, and even been angry and given him the ultimatum to either get his sh*t together or move out. It worked for a while but now he's back to sleeping all day.

I'm getting really mad about it because I also suffer with postnatal depression and OCD so it's not like I'm having an easy ride either, and the added stress of doing everything on my own including university from at home is really having an impact on me. I just feel like he doesn't take my feelings into account. When I ask him to get out of bed he says he will then the 10th time I ask him he flips out and says stuff like I'll just pack my stuff and leave then and blames me for making his mental health worse.

113,"Hi guys,

So over the past week now I have been somewhat anxious about my intrusive thoughts. Below are examples of them but before I tell you them, I have an immense fear of developing schizophrenia or psychosis.

1. Worried about what if my family don’t love me.
2. What if people bugged my car, how would I know.
3. What if my girlfriends parent want to harm me when I come over to stay.
4. What if my food was poisoned
5. Earlier on my cat followed my mum upstairs and I automatically got the thought of “are they going upstairs to plan to hurt me” it give me unbelievable anxiety and as much as I know the thought is absolutely shocking and obscene but my ocd made me question my own thinking if it WAS real or not 🙄

I’m guessing OCD can make you doubt your rationalised thinking? Like it will be “ok but what if you actually do believe it and you don’t know it” has anyone else ever had anything like this and btw this isn’t every day this waxes and wanes throughout the year and there is times when I don’t think this but it puts me in so much panic it’s unbelievable.

Also, if it’s not a what If thought, does this mean it’s not OCD? What I mean by this is what if I had a thought differently from “what if my foods poisoned” what if the thought was “they could poison my food” but I still get the terrible anxiety from it. Hope this makes sense. So does it need to be a what If thought for it to be OCD and not schiz or can it appear in your head any old way and still be OCD ?

I've been struggling A LOT with drinking my antidepressant medication. I can't make it a habit.

Failed Attempts and not effective for me:

Pill box (Monday to Sunday) 

Medicine Phone App Reminder

Extra meds in the pocket of bags

Still a struggling.

Maybe, just maybe. With this narratives, i can make it as an inspiration to push harder to be better.

121,"Quick note: Any and all advice is welcome. &lt;3

It's taken me four days to write this post. I write things out then delete it all, thinking it's all stupid. I try to then distract myself with other subs but I really need to ask for help now. 

During the past year I've been experiencing a steady climb in my levels of self-doubt. It was slow enough for me to not acknowledge it all that much. Wrongly I believed it would just go away on its own or that I was just going through a stressful period (like everyone is at the moment) and it would soon pass after some self care. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case. In the last month I've suddenly realized just how bad my issues have become. Imagine the boiling frog analogy.

This doubt is eating me alive. It started with big things like working out what I want to do with my life, careers, and the usual social pressures. Now it's everything. I doubt what I wear to work, I doubt what I choose to do with free time, I doubt what time to go to bed, I doubt and question EVERYTHING I do with little in the way of exception. 

My Career's advisor says that achieving a goal will help ease this issue. But I've found myself doubting my ability to even set goals. Then, if I've set them, I get so anxious and worried about reaching them that I just don't reach them. At all. 

I'm scared this is verging on 'learnt helplessness' territory and it'll soon be too late to fix. Every project or idea I've tried to explore has been shot down. Not Questioned. Shot down. Years ago I would have persevered and tried to carry on. But I've worn down to not even mentioning things now. All thanks to the doubt in my head and the absolute unwavering belief that I will never be able to pursue whatever it is. No matter how small it is. 

I should mention here that I'm 25F, diagnosed with -and medicated for- ADHD (combined type) and depression. I still live with my parents who aren't very supportive, even if they make people outside the family believe they are. Currently, I'm stuck in a dead end job I hate and have been unable to find new work at all even with the help of a couple Career's advisors. 

I really need help and advice. I can feel the straw breaking the camel's back. Any advice is welcome. I need to know there's something I can do.

124,"For context I made pickled radish few days ago, the recipe required three days for the pickles to be ready. It have been three days, so I tried it today. After I tried it I went to talk to my dad he told me that I smelled like a rotten fish. I was confused at first then I told I just ate the pickles and to me it smelled sweet.

I gave him the pickles to smell them and he said that's what smells like rotten fish, I got a bit frustrated. My dad told me to let my sister give it a sniff, I reached over to give to my sister then she jerked away a bit and me being my clumsy ass self spilled a bit of the pickle juice on my sister's shirt. She start screeching to me to wipe it of and my dad just laugh and taunt my sister about her shirt is going to stink. I started to get frustrated as I walked to the kitchen to take some tissue, I screamed ""calm down will ya"" on top of my lung, I rarely raise my voice to my family(pretty sure my mom can hear it from upstairs). When I screamed everyone went quiet.

Now to my question

Why do I get frustrated over this tiny thing?

I tried to convince myself it's just a small matter but I'm still angry and it made my mood turn sour.

I was a the kitchen and I saw a knife and I thought to end it all right then. I'm in as frisky mood this week(my siblings had been really loud this week) and every little frustrate me and I try not to show it but tonight I'm on my last string of patient.

126,"I just need to vent. I don’t know why, but I find sharing my story makes me feel momentarily better in times where I don’t know what else might help, and it’s become difficult to find anyone close to me that I haven’t told already.

On 21st January this year, I was walking to work at around 7:30am. I went to take a shortcut down by a haulage company to shave a few minutes off the journey, where there was a 25-30-year-old man down this lane. It doesn’t sound like much, but it was very unusual to see anyone walking down there, let alone someone just waiting there. I walked there every day and you recognise a lot of the same faces journeying to work, and I had never seen him and his bright red puffer jacket before.

I should’ve followed my instinct and turned around. I didn’t want him to feel bad for scaring me if he was just an innocent man. He asked me if he could borrow my phone, and I had been cut off and was just listening to music, so I told him this. He asked for directions to the industrial estate, where I was walking, and I obliged. He then asked where I was walking to, and I tried to come up with an excuse to turn around and walk the other way around. He kept asking me to walk with him, so I said that it isn’t his fault but I’m apprehensive to walk around with someone I don’t know and didn’t feel comfortable with the idea. 

As I turned around to head back to the main road, I heard him shuffling in his big coat towards me. If I could hear him, it was already too late to run. He put him arm around my neck in like, a chokehold and wrestled me to the floor – this was around 10 metres from a very busy road, but unluckily for me, just far enough away that you would only see if you were looking, if that makes any sense. I fought back as much as I could, I screamed, which alerted a woman across the street walking her dogs who watched the initial assault, and then he bashed my face against the frame of the car he had dragged me too which stunned me enough put me in the back of. 

I was now very aware of the fact the more I tried to get away, the more aggressive and violent he would become. I tried to kick him away from shutting the door, but I stopped screaming for help. No one was coming, let’s be honest. Blood was pouring from my face and I felt dehydrated and weak. He won, he shut and locked the door and got in the front. I said if he stops now, there’s no repercussions. No guilt, no police, nothing. I will go about my day and he will go about his. He just laughed and started driving.

After begging him to tell me what he wanted from me, and him replying with ‘what do you think,’ he told me some bullshit story about how his cousin was raped in my area and he was seeking revenge on the person who done it. I wondered how on Earth I could’ve helped in this situation – until he told me that he couldn’t get revenge the way that he wanted to, so he would take from me what they took from her. Since then, with the information that came out in court, it has been confirmed that this was not true – the name he gave, was not a family member, nor was it someone who existed at all, at least in our area. His family also had no knowledge of anyone being assaulted, and plus, with what I know about that family now, they would be brave to do so.

He took my phone, didn’t turn my music off so I could hear my favourite band playing through it for the whole assault, and he drove me towards what seemed like the M1 motorway, which if you’re not from the UK, is basically the main road to connect the South to the North. It is certainly not somewhere you want to be stranded with no phone and no vehicle. He didn’t though, he veered violently back onto the roundabout and took me somewhere local. I cried and begged him not to kill me. I had noticed that he made no effort to hide his identity – no gloves, no mask, driving what I assumed was his car – he started it with a key at least! I was sobbing, but no longer wailing. It seemed so pointless to react, and I wanted to at least keep the violence to a minimum. I figured, if I shut my mouth and done what I was told, the best I could hope for was to be abandoned on the side of the road, rather than know my life will end and the last person I saw, spoke to, smelled, touched, heard, was going to be a rapist.

He stopped his car on the side of the road. It wasn’t secluded at all, but not a single car or person drove or walked past. I could see people walking their dogs in the field next to us as he touched my vagina. He pulled my trousers and my pants down, undone my bra and took my jumper off. I just stayed lifeless and still. He turned me around and I was facing the car window. I whispered a half-hearted plea as I felt his weight behind me, and he penetrated me. Not once, not twice, but three times. Once with his fingers, twice with his penis. He decided the car was not good enough for him to fulfil whatever needs it was. He had already asked where I live, and I had told him a pretty convincing lie, which was excellent news until he told me he was taking me to my flat. 

I thought of a plan, my kitchen was the first room you enter in the flat. Maybe I could just direct him to mine and I could find something to defend myself. I was very aware of the repercussions if I did, though. It could be used against me, or I could kill him and would have to live with that. I didn’t want to deal with it that way. He passed me a receipt to wipe the blood from my mouth with and pushed my head down on his penis while I was driving. I thought about my dog. My massive, loud mouthed, protective Rottweiler, Barney. He’s so soft and unthreatening but does have a mean bark that he likes to exercise a lot, and to the untrained visitor, may make him seem like an aggressive dog. He had given up with the idea of me pleasuring him, so asked me to touch myself. Which I did, unenthusiastically. He instructed me to sound like I’m enjoying myself. I did not make a sound.

I told him about the dog. I said, you can come in, but I will have to put my dog on the balcony. I was still crying, but was strangely calm, and I was trying to convince him that I was fine with everything that happened so he could trust me enough to carry out my plan. It was working. I said to him, why didn’t you just ask me for my number – it didn’t have to go like this. I didn’t mind, I was okay, and I was only crying because my lip hurt from being split where he hit my face. We pulled up at mine and I still had blood pouring down my face. He passed me some old water he found in his car which I pretended to drink; I didn’t trust what might be in it. He held my hand, which immediately prompted more wailing, and told me he was sorry for hurting me. I said, with the straightest face I could, that it doesn’t matter and not to apologise. 

A 3-4 minute walk from the car to my door, and then me finding my keys, at what was now around 8:30 in the morning, and not a single person walked past. I opened the door to the communal building. He followed. I walked up the three flights of stairs with my heart in my chest. He followed. I opened the door to my flat. He followed. I told him again, about the dog. ‘I’ll just be two secs’. I did not turn around. I have no idea if he had any weapons or picked up anything in the flat. My dog, the knob he is, sat there silent for the first time in his life. I opened the balcony door, straddled the banister while calling my dogs name, and tried to scale down the icy balconies to the bottom floor. I fell 45ft onto a concrete step in my neighbour’s garden, where she asked her oldest son to look after her toddler in their bedroom, and opened the door to let me crawl in. She heard the crunch of me fall before I had a chance to even knock. She called an ambulance and the response team were there in about 6 minutes.

I was strapped up and had my head in blocks and my back in a restraint. They cut my clothes off me and collected them for evidence. I had fat from my knee now outside my knee and I couldn’t stand up. I couldn’t feel anything except panic. I was blue lighted to a specialist hospital in London. A lot of what happened there is still a blur – they thought I had broken my back or my neck because of the fall. I kept screaming he’s going to kill my dog. 

After 48 hours’ worth of X-rays, it wasn’t as bad as they thought. I had a fractured wrist, a fractured elbow, 11 broken ribs, two large lacerations on my knee that would need stitches. My palms were heavily bruised, my face was too swollen to talk or eat so I was fed on a drip. My anus was torn from what he had done. I done everything I was advised by police and sexual health professionals. I followed every bit of advice, answered every question, took every tablet and had every swab.

They found him early the following morning. He was arrested. Once it came to his plea hearing, he pled not guilty – until hearing that there was CCTV footage of him kidnapping me. He changed his plea to guilty, and after a gruelling few months, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He has a child, a girlfriend, a family that loves him and are still supportive of him and stood up in court to defend his character. He had not committed any other sexual offence that the police were made aware of but had a heavy string of robberies and burglaries. He had a chronic cocaine problem and used this as his defence. While listening to his solicitor trying to defend him, I thought of how difficult it has been, and how I should be proud that I saw this through to the end, to watch 20 years of his life be taken from him. To know that child will not have his rapist father around for the foreseeable future and would probably have a better chance in life without him. 

I find it difficult to talk about how it makes me feel, as I have been dissociating more and more since the attack, and no longer feel anything. But it has been hard. I no longer have any contact with my dad, who I was living with at the time. I have had to leave that household. I fell in love too quickly, and had my heart broken when he cheated on me during the trial. My role as a manager at work has been hindered massively, and I no longer have the confidence to run a sales office. I feel like I’ve lost my backbone, a lot of what made me me. My personality seems to have got lost. Most of the time I feel like I’m watching my life on TV – like I recognise and respond to what happens around me, but the more severe the incident, the less of a reaction I give. I rarely feel anything, or I do but can never pinpoint what has caused the emotion, which considering I was diagnosed with BPD 4-5 years ago, is surprising – I have always been very aware of my triggers. Every day is hard, but I can’t explain why. I just want to sleep. I feel like I could sleep for years.

132,"So I have this strange problem (and have all of my life) where I get terrible anxiety after a situation has passed, and compulsively go over the same interaction in my head, namely: 
How it could've gone differently, 
How everyone else in the room will go on to perceive me, and 
How to rectify a slight fumble or correct my phrasing the next time I see that person. 

It tends to be pretty one-sided thinking. For example, I don't obsess over what the other person might say - only what I would say to elicit an ideal response.
It feels like any interaction that I don't feel 100% happy with when I walk away (or even sometimes when I do walk away comfortably) is a ""rough draft"" that needs constant revising until I can be sure that my message has come across in the way I intended for it to. Sometimes I do this with interactions that did go well, and it'll boost my mood for the rest of the day.

It's served me well in some situations, but the behavior feels obsessive and can be really intrusive to my life; it keeps me up at night, and feeds my insecurities about inadequecy. It happens mostly in reflection of interactions in my professional life. 

So I guess my question is does anyone else experience this obsessive behavior over their phrasing and how others perceive them? Does it have a name? Is it chronic overthinking, social anxiety, or something else? What can I do to stop myself from compulsively revising so many interactions in my head?

Hello, this is my first time on this subreddit and I’m not too sure if this is the right place to put this or not, but for the past, I’d say 2-3 years, I’ve hand plucked my eyebrows every time I’m just not feeling too great?
 I think it could be caused by stress since I’ve not been taught how to deal with it. But it’s gotten to the point where both my eyebrows don’t have that little end tail bit? To put it simply, you know when artists just do a little oval for the eyebrows? That’s literally what they look like.
I usually get the urge to pluck them when I look/think about school, homework or just anything that makes me feel unwell(?). When I start doing it I can’t stop, I have to force my hand down or play music though my earphones to distract myself, though it does always work. I don’t know what compels me to do it or why. It makes me feel horrible. It makes my stomach area feel like a spiral, just full of dread (I get that in the morning too). It’s not that it feels ‘good’ either, I hate it, but I’m still compelled to do it anyway. 
I don’t feel confident enough to talk about it to my parents, let alone anything that’s going on (they’re not bad people, I just don’t know how to speak about it to them). I know as soon as I start doing it I’ll be told to stop by my parents, my family has even tried making jokes about it to me too, but it all just makes me feel horrible and it makes that spiral feeling come back. I feel better with it at school since people have just been expecting me to do it? I don’t know, they don’t question me on it. To be honest, it makes me feel a lot better.
It was ok at the start of lockdown, when it started growing back, I found things that distracted me, but then homework started piling, more personal things started to happen, and now it’s probably at the worst it’s ever been. I personally haven’t been doing great either, I just wanna stop and create a whole different version of myself (but that’s something for a later date, plus it’s something I definitely don’t know how to word).

142,"Hey guys! As probably the title already gives a hint, in the quarantine I suffered a ""weird"" mental breakdown. 

Here's my short back story I'll need to explain first in order to continue (I tried keeping it as short as possible):

Last August I started (I'm 17 at the time of writing) learning programming, to get a job at age of 18, my bday is on 14 Feb.

At when the quarantine started, I was highly motivated and took this as an opportunity to develop these skills.

From the start of lockdown(January because I'm from Italy) till October I got so focused didn't even notice I had lost like 90% of my friends and the ones now are just my classmates.

Other than that I also saw major symptoms of Schizoide personality disorder, such as emotional coldness and being stuck in one's own head.

And I think the cure to it is having social interactions/friends to talk to. 

And here's when I noticed something ugly: I simply couldn't make friends or even find a reason to talk to People. (Before this I was decent at socializing)

So now how much hard I try the only thing I can do is just programming and nothing else. 

So putting it in brief it's like being stuck in ""state"" and just do one thing.

Has anyone else faced something similar or knows anything about it?",04Dec2020,1

152,"Hi all, this is my first time posting here but I was wondering if I could get some advice?

For months now I have been facing a number of personal and work-related stressors, and I feel I'm at breaking point. I feel the best option is to take sick leave (1 week+), but I'm afraid to take this step.

To summarise the situation:

My personal life: I've been dealing with anxiety for 5+ years, as well as misophonia for a good portion of that. Immediately before the pandemic I was attending cognitive behavioural therapy sessions under the NHS. When the pandemic hit the UK, I think I took things fairly well - although it was a stressful situation, I had a reasonably positive outlook and found solace in things being beyond my control. However, as time went on, the lack of freedom and the isolation began to take their toll on me. I'm generally quite poor at maintaining friendships, and this has been exacerbated by the pandemic, to the point that I have very few quality interactions with other people. I've also faced a lot of change during these months, moving house three times (from parents house, to girlfriend's, to parents, to my own place), and breaking up with my girlfriend of 2.5 years.

My work: I'm fortunate that I've remained employed throughout the pandemic, and even started a new job in July. The flip side is that I've been working consistently throughout it. My new job is with a startup and has had a steep learning curve. To add to this, we hit a crunch period about 2 months ago, barely 3 months into my new role. Since then every day has been as busy as the last, and I increasingly struggle to keep up. Since starting, I've taken a few days of leave - but excluding days off to cope with my break-up, and days off to move house, I'd say I've only really had 2 days of ""holiday"" since July. Wrapped around these holidays I would also work overtime to keep up with demand. The crunch continues, and I'm finding myself exponentially less productive, but more and more stressed, disengaged, and simply exhausted. My life feels like a non-stop grind - waking up, working, going to bed, etc. And yet I feel like I'm underperforming - rapidly flailing my arms in a body of water, but drowning. I have no energy to do anything and, most recently, I find it difficult for the working day to go by without me at least once standing in the shower crying.

The stress of the job is causing me to be depressed and anxious about my future career, financial situation, and overall happiness and wellbeing. It's also causing me to be resentful and to disconnect from my work and colleagues. At worst, I want to leave my job asap and even consider a different career path.

I now attend private therapy, and I've talked to my therapist about this for weeks on end now. She has suggested that I take sick leave. I have never taken sick leave for mental health before, and I feel tremendous guilt about such a thing. Previously I have taken a day or two of annual leave to attend to my mental health - and I find that, in the moment, this helps, but generally I come back feeling not much better than when I left. So I think I will need at least a week to reset myself.

But I struggle with taking this time off. It is a small team so my absence will have a notable knock-on effect, and we have a major deadline to reach before Christmas. Moreover, I see signs of burn-out in my colleagues and wouldn't want to burden them with any more stress. I also fear this will affect my reputation within the organisation.

What do you think? Should I request 1 week of leave, and what would be the best approach? Is 1 week long enough to overcome such overwhelm, or will I come back just as damaged as before?",04Dec2020,1
153,"Over the past year a problem has started to arise very slowly and subtle enough for me not to notice until now. I for some reason think people are constantly watching and judging me, even if they aren’t present. This is especially common when on my phone, I feel like my whole school, all my friends, almost everyone I know is watching. At first it was only for a single game I played where it massively effected the levels I played and eventually made be bored of the game. I had a running commentary in my head of what I was saying to everyone, like some sort of presentation and I would worry if I was doing something for too long they would get bored. But now I see it for almost every time I get on a digital device. My brother made fun on me earlier today because I put my hands up to show to my crowd that I wasn’t touching the keyboard even though I was on my own.
Idk if it links but I also have a tick disorder, while very minor ( not classed as Tourette syndrome ) i still get the odd week where I tick rather commonly. I get roughly 5 of these weeks every year.

I’ve looked up schizophrenia and i don’t think it’s that, I have never had any hallucinations. I think it may be paranoia though as I had problems in primary school with myself image as well as constant sleep problems.

The problem isn’t severe enough to effect my life much, I just don’t want it to progress. I just  don’t know what to do to make my self better.

155,"I’m in a crisis!  I’m failing my online classes. I just can’t do the work tho, I don’t know what to do.  I can’t focus, I basically have the idk knowledge? Education? Of a 7th grader because after 7th grade I switched to online school and cheated my way to the 12th grade.   

It’s been so hard, I can’t find the motivation to do anything, like at all. I can’t eat, sleep, focus, anything! My parents always say they understand what I’m going through but they don’t understand, they keep saying there’s no excuses.   

I told them I wanted to drop out, I would get a job, work on my mental health, and try to get my ged. I thought and still do think that was a pretty good plan. They yelled at me and said that’s what failures do or something along those lines and some other things I don’t really remember.   

My mom dropped out in like 8th grade and got her ged, I understand that they want better for me and that there’s only a couple of months left but I feel like working on my mental health is more important right now. I am on medication and in therapy but nothing seems to be working and I just want to kill myself even more.   

But yeah, it’s pretty much too late to make up all my missing work so I guess I’ll see what I do when the school calls my parents and I have a break down. Or I’ll break down when I finally log on today and see all the emails my teachers are sending me about notifying the school board of my lack of work. It’s all my fault in the end so oh well.

156,"I (F17 for context) have not been officially diagnosed with anything in regards to mental health, and the last thing I want to do is self diagnose. However recently I’ve been noticing that I’ve been having a lot of issues with sensory overload, panic attacks, and uncontrollable stimming; most of which seem to be associated with some form of ADHD, Autism, or Anxiety. 

For example: I can barely eat dinner with my family anymore because the sound of chewing just throws me over the edge. It’s not a little pet peeve or anything, if it gets too bad then I have to physically leave the table and go sit in my room and cry until I calm down. Thunder, people breathing, and overwhelming coversation are the main triggers that lead me into an ‘episode’ where I just feel so overwhelmed and bothered. Church is a nightmare because all I can focus on is the person next to me’s breathing and I get overwhelmed again. I can usually keep my reaction socially acceptable in public (aka not lashing out physically) but the shaking and ocassional crying is out of my control. 

I don’t have problems focusing in school or interacting socially or anything, but my therapist of a year informed me a while back that I seem to be an anxious person. I don’t think I have any of those things, but this stuff is just getting to the point where its impacting my daily life. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with sensory overload? Is it possible to have it without having ADHD/Autism/Anxiety?",04Dec2020,1

158,"Sorry, English is not my first language. I have been struggling with depression/anxiety since I was 18 years old, right after graduating high school. This 6 years have been full of depression (for different reasons) episodes that I have taken care of with 2 partial hospitalizations (2014, 2017) and 1 full hospitalization (2018) in a psych ward.

As of this moment of my life, I completed a B.A. in Public Relations and Advertising(2018) and I'm currently in my second year at Law School (2022 hopefully). I feel like this 6 years have passed by so fast and my best days are left behind. I really didn't make any friends in undergrad (just some acquaintances) because I was battling with depression episodes and Law School has been the same. No parties, no memories NOTHING. I've been working to be a productive/responsible professional. I get good grades, pay for my school and I've never been in any sort of legal/drug problem. 

At this moment of my life I'm realizing that I'm not young young anymore and hyperconscious of my mortality. I'M JUST TIRED of putting all this effort for nothing. I think I'm sure I don't like my degrees but I'm about to finish Law School so I'm not gonna dropout. I still live at home with my parents because they live close to campus and I commute (before rona). My mother is 60 and my father 78( they had me really late) and I get anxious about the fact that I'm going to be a young caregiver.

160,"I went to r/personalfinance in hopes of finding an option I hadn’t for my worsening situation but I was met with rudeness, misgendering, and a lot of finger pointing that I did not expect so I’m here now to hopefully feel better about it all.

I’ve always struggled with work, since my first job I’ve despised the shitty feeling of sitting in work’s restroom crying my eyes out but having to hide it the moment I stepped out. My current job is by far the best job I’ve had work wise since it’s no social interaction and just simple work I can listen to music or podcasts with but I still somehow find myself falling apart

It always curled back to this frustration with pay and my situation, I’m barely making it by month to month, work far out of town in a county with a higher minimum wage and just don’t know where to go from here

I have avenues forward but they are all riddled by tons of blind luck or impossible expenses. So it becomes far more tempting to simply stay at my current job and find ways to make it more tolerable. 

I’m not entirely sure what question I’m trying to have answered , i wish there were some huge option I am missing, I feel trapped and that this job is the best I’ll ever have and my brain starts down that spiral and I’m very quickly sobbing over top of my work.I already work with a therapist as often as I can afford but I still for some reason can’t handle it.

7 years spent practicing art and animation
Al for fucking nothing it seems

I want to do animation as a long term career but I currently see no escape from this minimum wage cycle. 

I hate that it feels my happiness and life fulfillment is being denied from my by shear luck.

So I guess If I had to have a question it would be where should I turn now. Depending on how capable of accommodating a schedule shift my current job is I might be looking at ANOTHER shitty minimum wage job. Should I continue this cycle and just try to focus on how to make it feel less garbage or is there a path forward I never considered that might be able to break me free from the grasps of these low pay jobs.",04Dec2020,1
161,"I’m 22, live with my parents and older brother. Not employed anywhere but do have passive income from a side hustle. I’m an artist of all sorts (like every medium, lol) &amp; I have a lot of trouble deciding what to do for the day, or even for the next few hours. 
I’m an extremely anxious person &amp; worry constantly. I’m also very indecisive &amp; an HSP (highly sensitive person), along with having ADHD. 
Planning things out is a difficult task for me, especially because if I do write out tasks/to-do list for the day, I almost always don’t follow it all the way through. I may start with one task but my ADHD makes it difficult to make myself do something I’m not intrigued by, aka not stimulating enough. But I also struggle with depression, which can also make it hard for me to even get something done, because you know, “what’s the point”.

Crying is my go-to reaction for most things that are stressful to me, it’s just how my body deals with the stress. Though thankfully it does help release the built up stress, but I think I’m stressed like all the time that at any moment I can seriously just start balling my eyes out. Like dropping a pen can make me stressed, especially when I’m trying and focusing really hard on what I’m doing, that one little thing can make me ‘explode’ with crying. During the cries it does feel shitty, like the sadness is real and is there—which often times can prolong my cries because when I hear someone cry (even myself) it makes me sad as well, and so the cycle continues. And even at times I have like no patience for my cries so as I cry I sometimes get angry at myself for crying because it’s exhausting as well as wastes a lot of time. 

Also, if I do plan a schedule for the day, I even get overwhelmed at what i have to accomplish, even if it’s just cleaning my room. It’s like if I’m given a task, I can’t complete it because I’m overwhelmed at the task, but if I don’t have a schedule I’m overwhelmed with having to decide what to occupy my time with. I feel the need to complete things everyday because I’m not attending college (a dropout) &amp; I don’t have a “real job” , and so I feel worthless if I’m not occupying my time well.

However, I ""only"" really dealt with depression and panic attacks and don't have much first hand experience of other disorders/ilnesses etc. University sadly didn't provide us useful resources, we were only taught that students with mental illnesses/learning difficulties exist and we should find ways to approach them... but never taught us how.

If you have been diagnosed with ADHD and experienced/still experience these too, please let me know. Please take time and read all the symptoms. Let me know if I should get my diagnosis done. Also from your understanding let me know if these are symptoms of only ADHD or other disorders as well.

Symptoms:-

&amp;#x200B;

1. Difficulty in finishing a task. I begin the task with      excitement but eventually, it gets boring.
2. Daydreaming for many hours. Thoughts running in my mind      all the time.
3. When I listen to a song, I imagine myself in it, playing      football, scoring goals. As a result, I don’t know the lyrics of the songs      I’ve been listening for many years.
4. Difficulty in learning something new. This makes me unable      to develop a skill or a talent. I’m below average in academics, pathetic      in sports, no extra-curricular activities.
5. Difficulty in completing a task which requires mental      effort.
6. Experience severe nostalgia ( many hours a day, many      days). I miss the time between 1998-2012 (start and end year of my school      education). It’s been 8 years since I passed out yet I still haven’t      gotten over it. I keep listening to songs, watching movies , seeing      facebook posts from that time period. I keep on visiting the lanes where I      spent playing during my childhood. I also experience nostalgia of memories      which aren’t even mine
7. Extreme sadness followed by euphoria but mostly sadness      because of nostalgia. Basically, mood swings.
8. Sometimes I don’t thing much/don’t think at all before      acting. I spend money in a rush, then regret it later on.
9. Struggle to stick to a schedule. Poor time management.
10. The only tasks where I’m able to have a full focus on      are those which are interesting ( watching a movie, reading a book about a      topic I like )
11. Difficulty in remembering details related to tasks that      require mental effort
12. Procrastinate/Avoid tasks that require mental effort. I      perform horribly in tasks that require mental effort.
13. If a set of tasks are given to be completed, I don’t      feel like doing them during the initial days. Motivation comes only during      the final days. 
14. Restlessness in legs ( when I sit on a chair during      office hours).Sometimes feel like being  in motion.
15. When I was young, I would do mock batting with a cricket      bat for hours
16. Indecisive when it comes to making important decisions.      Lack of confidence, conviction.
17. Very fidgety at times. Throw up things in the air and      try to catch them.
18. Feel the urge to calculate random statistics ( add/      subtract cricket scores, average, football stats etc). I enjoy learning      trivia.
19. If I’m studying in a slightly dirty room I get      distracted. Till the time I don’t clean it , I’m unable to study. When I      clean it, I feel the urge to clean other rooms.
20. I often wait for the perfect time to start doing      things. I keep postponing things to begin them on Monday, 1st day of the      month, 1st Jan etc.)
21. I make a schedule of things to be done. If even one of      the things in that list isn’t done or isn’t properly done, I feel like not      doing the rest of the things.
22. Make posts on social media and then delete them. I keep      liking and unliking pages as well. If my timeline on twitter doesn’t look      neat , I delete my twitter account and then make a new one , for a “fresh      start”.
23. If things aren’t symmetrical, it irritates me to even      look at them.
24. A thought occurs in my mind and I react to it verbally.      (for example, an unfinished conversation). I even talk to myself when I’m      alone.
25. Get irritated when a delay occurs. Sometimes I’m unable      to wait for my turn.
26. Get offended easily.
27. Unable to sleep alone at night
28. When talking, mind races ahead of mouth, hence I      “cancel” the sentence and start a new one
29. Difficulty in applying a concept from area to another.
30. Often blurt answers before a question is completed
31. Watch the same videos ( on many topics) again and again.
32. Unable to prioritize things. Unable to figure out how      to/where to begin a task (what should I do first)

174,"I am 16f, living in the UK. 

I've felt depressed before but have never seeked actual help or been diagnosed because my depressed feelings are so layered. Every autumn/winter I get hit with a wave of general fatigue, lack of motivation to do anything. I get incredibly stressed, pick at my acne or eczema and my immune system gets weaker.  When I recognise that I do feel depressed, it's usually a new low point in my life, and because I have never been diagnosed before, just accept that what I am feeling now is depressed, and that what i was feeling a month ago, a few months ago was not depression but being just sad. But it's been 3 years of just endless cycles. I say to myself 'I am definitely depressed right now, my life has gotten much worse from the last time i thought i was depressed'. Until the next time I feel depressed, I'll say the same thing, 'I'm definitely depressed. Atleast i had XYZ the last time I said I was depressed, now I have nothing'. It's been so long I've been questioning whether I have been depressed it's hard to distinguish my feelings of sadness between just being sad or being depressed.

When I go through a period of feeling depressed, it feels like that becomes the new normal - like I am used to feeling this way to the point where I accept that I'm not depressed. The next time I hit a new low point, I accept that I am depressed, not the constant low feeling I experience before. I genuinely have no idea how I feel, because the next time I'll hit a new low point, I'll have convinced myself that my past experiences of 'depression' were just me overreacting or just being sad.",04Dec2020,1

176,"Hi, for those of you that journal to improve yourself or improve your mental health by writing and such, do you find it more helpful to write 'I' statements or 'You' statements? For example, if someone wanted to work on improving their self-esteem, would it be better to write something like 'I am worthy of success' or 'You are worthy of success'? Or for another example, 'I am a confident person' vs 'You are a confident person'? I heard somewhere writing ‘You’ statements were more beneficial because of it sounding like someone’s telling you that thing. 

Also, I highly recommend doing this for those of you who aren’t already. Writing in this way has helped me a lot. Especially in the current situation. Not necessarily just for self-esteem, but also turning a negative into a positive.

Deep down, I know I'm not so bad. I have achieved many things in life such as getting exceptional grades even when there wasn't much support, and gene-wise, I don't have it so rough either.
But, I just can't stop pulling myself down. I compare myself to my favorite actors, hating the fact that I wasn't born with those special genes and that I got the short end of the stick in life. I obsess over my weight;, sometimes I'm too fat, sometimes I'm not curvy enough. My grades are just not enough and I feel so much more inferior than those who achieved less. I'm taking a year off of school, and I'm just scared to go back to my studies because I just know I'm going to realize I'm a goddamn idiot, or thay I might get a question wrong and beat myself up for it. No matter what I do, where I go, I find a reason to be miserable and hate myself.
I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to hating myself at this point. I'm even scared that this is part of my identity now. I'm scared that if I stop torturing myself, I will become nothing.

I only really have two true real friends/important people left, my good friend from the UK and my girlfriend (we were best friends for 10 years and started dating). I have two real people in my life, and since they have their own lives (as they should, everyone needs their own life) we can’t talk all the time. When I’m not talking with them, I feel empty and alone, like I’m vibing off of our interactions to build a personality and identity. I’m not always like this, I just feel alone.

It hurts even more when I see other people have like, lots of friends and have full social lives, going out and enjoying life. Doing that in quarantine is stupid and dangerous, but it still hurts to see people living their lives and expressing themselves, while I’m more or less alone.

185,"Looking for advice. A few months back I tried to switch my zoloft prescription over from a psychiatrist to my pcp. There is a psychiatrist shortage in my area, and I was only going every three months, just to check in and get another few months worth of meds. I decided that, since I had been on the medication for over a year at that point (and because two of my close family members are also on it, same dosage, and have been for years), that I probably could just consolidate that into my healthcare plan with my pcp. General Practitioners and family doctors regularly prescribe zoloft when necessary; this is not a new thing, and this drug is very common. Also, having a pcp prescribe means that a) I don't have to pay another 40 dollar copay, just to say, ""yes, its going fine"" and b) the psychiatrist can then take on another patient, perhaps one more in need. I closed the account with the mental health place, and called my doctor's office, saying that I wanted to move the prescription over, and have my doctor continue it. Yes, I totally understand now, that that was the wrong order of operations, and I know better now. Anyway, I called the doctor's office, a practice with several doctors, and explained the situation. The receptionist simply said to me ""Dr. \*\*\*\*\* doesn't prescribe that."" Nothing more. I asked why, and she got aggressive about it, but still would not explain. I asked to speak to my doctor, thinking that if she realized that it was just a simple low dose of a common medication, that things might be different. But she wouldn't take the call. I was upset and had no idea what to do. I was crying in the car, because I had a week's worth left (yes, poor planning, I realize now, def won't do that again), and I was dreading how I would feel if I went off the medication. Its not for everyone, but it has worked wonders for me. My partner suggested we go to the office and make her speak to me, but this was in the second week of March, 2020, when Covid was really ramping up, so I was anxious about that, and also knew that if I had to go face the people who had shut me down like that, I would end up just sobbing, and then they would take me even less seriously. So my lovely partner went in to talk to them on my behalf. A few things here: I'm a woman, partner is a man, we were not married at the time. My partner went in and advocated for me, saying I needed this medication. He won, and she relented, saying she would prescribe it, but only until I found a new doctor. He also was not given any explanation of why she had refused to prescribe these meds without even speaking to me. Its months later now. I finally found a doctor who fits my needs. Never, in any of these months, did my former doctor, or her office, contact me in any way to tell me why this simple request had been denied. I also was not referred to a different doctor, ever. When I told this story to my new doctor, she looked horrified, saying that doesn't make sense, and that its a very common drug, even going so far as to check what my former doctor's specialty was (internal medicine). I will add here that zoloft also doesn't have a high instance of abuse, because its a drug that builds up in your system, not a quick happy pill. So, what all of this comes down to is this:  It feels very much like my former doctor behaved unethically here. The medical group that the practice is a part of has a list of patient rights on its website and a few of the points talk clearly about the patient's right to clear communication about their care. I know, at least, that she didn't communicate, and I am planning to write the the medical group (UPMC), requesting she receive some sort of discipline and maybe be required to attend some sort of sensitivity training. What I am asking here is, did she break a law? It seems like no, but I figured I would check, just in case. Also, where can I find Pennsylvania mental health discrimination information? It feels like this is mental health discrimination, but I don't know if that lines up the law. Anyway, I'd appreciate any thoughts on the subject that might help me get some sort of result. I don't need her to be fired, just want to make sure she is prevented from treated other patients in this way. Thanks!",04Dec2020,1

I generally like to think of myself as a decent person that does not get jealous easily, but unfortunately I have deep-rooted insecurities regarding my own looks that I have a lot of trouble properly coping with, and it consequently seems to heck me up as a person.

I tried to react positively on the outside, but I think something manifested in my expression that showed that I was actually bothered, and my mom took notice of it.

192,"It's hard to describe the problem when you know it's wrong but you're unable to do anything about it. I need to give some background info before I get into the whole situation.I'm 24(M) who recently moved into my parent's house because after a 2 year battle, my mom passed away in July, leaving my dad completely destroyed. They were the perfect couple, started dating in their early twenties, got married 3 months after meeting each other and lived one of the most amazing lives together. Never seen my parents fight, or even have a heated argument, it was always so smooth and perfect, the definition of a happy marriage in my eyes, but my mom was in control of everything in our house, while dad was just working his blue collar job making money for the family.

At the beginning of summer my Mom was placed in home hospice care. She was unable to eat, got all of her nutrition through a tube. I had to clean her up from time to time, she was constantly throwing up what ever she was getting through the IV, it destroyed seeing the most important woman in my life  in such a condition. I tried to spend as much time as possible but my dad's job depends on my job, and I can't leave the office even with the pandemic, I was unable to work remotely and needed to be out of the house, where my mom spent so much time alone.

Before her health started deteriorating, I was in the process of starting up a small business that would involve my dad as well, I had my own place, had plans for the future, but now everything crumbled up like crackers. Moving back in has kind of killed my enthusiasm to do anything in life. I went to being a lazy slob who sits in his room, enjoys marijuana too much and just mellows out, waste of space. I tried losing weight, working out, walking, running, cooking, changing eating habits, but I can't seem to get anything to stick, I just end up with me going back to being useless and lazy.

The main reason for the post is something that I've been experiencing ever since I was on my knees next to my moms casket begging for forgiveness about how she passed away. I always thought that I could've done better, that i will find a doctor for my mom who will make her better, but her health was going down not by days but hours. She was hospitalized one time due to lack of oxygen in her blood, when she was admitted to the hospital she had to spend at least 2 days there under watch and the second day she called me mid day and cried for help, cried to get me to pick her up and take her away back home or at least come visit her, but i was unable to due to Covid restrictions. I was unable to be there with her when she begged and cried for me to be there. I think everything inside of me died that day and i wanted to disappear from this world when i had my Mother who raised me, who made sure everything about me was perfect before she started worrying about her, cry for help to pick her up, to be there with her and I couldn't do nothing about it. My parents are immigrants who do not speak English and I had to be with my mom to the every doctors appointment and translate everything that I've heard to my mom or dad. Every single time we went in, there was bad news. We went in with hopes and come back with nothing but dread. Every scan brought in more bad news, every test came back in the worst way possible. No treatments were available for the genetical mutation of what she had. There was 1% chance of survival, but doctors said it's just so people don't lose hope. Everything i've heard, i had to tell her. Tell my dad, but i had to pretend to be strong.

Now, everything that happens to me I think is a result of her passing. If I'm lazy and I get off my bed to go pickup some snacks or something, I'll trip on an extension cord and I'll think it's my mom punishing me for being lazy. If I go wash the dishes and I get my shirt wet, it's my mom punishing me for making such a big pile and not doing it earlier. I'll hit my head when stepping walking past a doorway i've walked a million times past and never hit my head - it's my mom punishing me.

Everything bad that is happening in my life is my mom punishing me for it.I have so many things bottled up and every time I feel it coming and that I'm about to let go, I suck it up and pretend nothing happened. I'm lost, I lost my mom who I'll never see again, who guided me through so many things, helped me through so many breakups, through a failed engagement, through stressful jobs, she was my teacher in school, one of the most respected teachers, she was active, always ready to help, always will put someone else problems in front of hers, never complained, she was so perfect and i failed her. And now she's punishing me.

I only have two sources of support, my significant other who is 4500 miles away, and my best friend. When my SO was 8, she lost her mother to breast cancer, so she knows what it feels like to lose someone as important, but she was in a different age group when she did so our situations as similar but different. I have not opened up to them about how I feel punished by my mom because i don't want to scare them, because i know this is not healthy, but i know thell'll support me with every cell of their bodies, but i don't want them to carry this burden.

Given the situation, just having the courage to post this up, i know the answer is yes, i know i should get help, but where and how should i start?I want to be mentally healthy and capable, not who i am today.",04Dec2020,4
193,"I am living in what seems like hell, solely perpetuated by my own inadequacy and delusion. I can be no more than my ability to act allows, effectively rendering me incapable of anything except dreading the next inevitable failure. The fact I regard my own insignificant depressing situation as a form of hell is ridiculous, showing further my inability to properly assess any actual real situation with a mindset. I personally cannot tell if my mindset is atypical. It is irrelevant either way as I'm still in this situation and still dealing with it terribly. In reality this should be done weeks ago. Yet I knew that then as well as I do now. I'm trying to work at it currently with the time I do have but I find myself unable to bear to doing it. Its almost painful. I think its due to shame of it. I don’t feel like I’ve disappointed anyone, or rather I that’s not my main issue that’s causing this horrible feeling. I find it’s a lot more to do with my own disappointment in myself. I know well what I can do, what I’m in theory capable of. It’s almost humorous how I consistently put in little to no effort in things that I am able to recognize as incredibly important for me in life. I suppose I do know exactly the problem, incredibly clearly at that. It is just that I am ashamed to admit it to myself. The truth is more and more apparent as I face issue after issue improperly and terribly. It’s not that I am unable for some medical or divine reason. I actively avoid any help that requires any amount of effort, or that would require me to do anything. I actively take advantage of any slack given to me, and I possibly think this is the reason for me to be wondering about the abnormal side of my mental. Abnormal or not I am consciously a foil to myself.

It isn’t any abstract problem it seems, just sheer laziness and the ability to take advantage of others. This is a large part of me, and one that dominates my daily life. It’s the truth, and the truth hurts a lot. So much that I will find any excuse to lie to myself so I can deny this. There is a kinder person within me, but I fear it will always be dominated by my own tendency towards avoidance and manipulation. Even now that description bothers me as it gives me an out as a tortured soul. In reality I am trapped by my own self-hatred. I hate myself for who I am really am when it comes down to it. The only exception I encounter is when I have social pressures on me, which has propelled my own education and social life so far, but now this year I have been able to slink away from others view to simply fester in my own self-pity. I would ask for help but I know well that it will do nothing. Or rather, I will do nothing after lying to everyone, including myself that I will. The one thing I will allow myself is that I am sad. Its one thing I know I am. Things alleviate it and I believe it’s the reason I spend so much time distracting myself on my phone or with others. I think this sadness is rooted in my own immense disappointment in myself and how I have lived and how I currently live. I guess it is what it is.

204,"TL,DR: I worry my ever fluctuating mental health is sabotaging my relationship as well as a possible drinking problem that’s developing. Can’t get help without risking my career but if I don’t get it soon I’ll probably kill myself to be candid. Not sure how to bring this up to my s/o. 

Let’s just be honest I drink to cope with my emotions because I don’t know how to handle them even at 20 years of age. My mental health has been a very big struggle lately because I’ve been going through a lot of big life changes non stop for about 2 years and it’s very hard and stressful. I get the feeling I have some sort of personality disorder/high functioning depression type thing going on, but I can’t seek treatment due to the nature of my career. My s/o is basically the only one I can lean on but I have a hard time leaning on them for support because of past relationships and how heavily they fucked with my head. I’ve been doing really shitty the past few days and I can feel it taking a toll on my partner but I don’t know how to address it to them. I want to be better for them because they deserve so much but I feel stuck. Do I chose my career or my mental health? To be honest I’m not sure how much longer I can take living like this because I’m frequently very close to killing myself. 
How do I choose to cope with all this? Alcohol of course which is very unhealthy I know but it’s so hard to stay away from, it provides that temporary relief you know? Honestly I know I have some sort of drinking problem, I don’t spend every moment drunk but I binge drink heavily when I do decide to get drunk. I have a feeling this is effecting my s/o because the next day things always feel weird between us, it’s like I can feel the tension through the phone. Maybe it’s the way I act when I drink or the things I say I’m not really sure. Alcohol only worsens my rapidly changing mental health and it fluctuates when I get hammered very fast. Which makes it damn near impossible to hold a conversation with my partner. It’s important that I can because unfortunately it’s a long distance relationship right now, they’re coming to visit me in a few days and I hope I haven’t sabotaged it already because I really do love them and I would hate myself if I hurt them. 
I guess the point is my mental health is fucked and I really want to get help but I feel like I can’t. I want to quit drinking and be better but it’s so hard and I can’t find the motivation to do it, kinda like the pain that it brings. 
Not sure how to address this fully with my s/o because they sort of already know but not fully. It’s silly part of me doesn’t even want to trust them which is dumb because logically I could trust them with anything but my brain says “you can’t trust them with shit they’re just going to leave you” then it makes me look like a dick.

And I'm pretty sure she's right, even though I never thought of this before. 

I just did a quick reading about this topic and it's definitely me. 

I don't date or have relationships in fear of feeling trapped or slowed down or hurting them once my feelings toward them are gone. 
I'm doubting my wish for a pet because it might make a mess on my furniture (I never cared about that before) or I won't be free to go out anymore if I suddenly had the wish to do so (for the first time in 20+ years). And what if I wanted to move in the next few years? 

I don't even like to make plans one week in advance. 

Not to mention that my last relationship was a mess and I wanted to run away from day one, despite really liking them. 


I'm not sure how to deal with this realization. I doubt I can change myself that much, but I'm also lonely. 
To know that there's even more that f's me up doesn't  exactly feel good


That's it, I just needed to vent.

210,I don’t know I have really good friends who I hang out with a lot I just don’t ever really talk about like my personal problems or anything with them because not that they don’t care I just see most of them as the type of people who don’t really want to listen to me talk about my problems and I don’t want to talk to them cause I’m afraid they gonna think like why do I have to listen to this cause they probably have their own problems they are dealing with at least that’s what I think it makes me feel lonely sometimes when I’m not with them and I don’t really have anyone else to talk to but maybe that’s my fault for not trying to say something this post is me rambling a lot cause I feel like there’s an easy solution I’m just not taking and my thoughts are kinda all over the place,04Dec2020,3

212,"Hi guys! 
I wanted to ask you if you have ever had anything like this. 
I was literally just putting ketchup on my fries and it suddenly felt weird and looked weird. Like the feeling that you get when you look into a mirror for too long and you think: that’s really me? 
It just felt weird and then I thought no, don’t feel weird it’s just a normal task and then it felt even weirder. 

Did anyone ever experience anything like this?",04Dec2020,1

216,"I’ve been working at a Cafe for a while now and then lockdown happened and it closed. I low-key hate working there. Cafes aren’t really my thing. It makes me so stressed and 90% of the time there I want to cry, not because of my coworkers but because of the general public and the stress and the fact that I can’t hold my hands still so I get laughed at when I walk a tray out soaked in coffee. 
My friend (calling him that for ease) got me the job with his mum back when I really needed the money, needed it to get to college and you know.. eat, but now I have a proper contract job and full time education so I don’t need it anymore and I don’t want to work there either but she is my friends mum how the fuck do I tell her I don’t want to work for her anymore.
I’m 18 and have a hard time saying no to adults. 
If anyone has any advice for this it would be grand.

218,"It's the end of the term at my college, and one of our professors had everyone discuss their projects for the course. Everyone seemed... so interested, like legitimately taking pleasure in it, asking questions, or even adding more stuff unto it, meanwhile, I just wanted to be done. 

I have no passion with any of my work, I never have, school for me has always been tedious, work is tedious, I just do it to get it done and go home to sleep but people around me, they seem to legitimately care about the stuff they do, my coworkers talk about their projects with such sincere joy, I can't imagine having that kind of passion. How do you guys care so much? How do you not just see this as work? 

People have suggested trying subjects I enjoy but... I just don't get it, it could be the most ""fun"" project idea and I would still rather just be done with it and never pay it a second thought... how do you all do it?",04Dec2020,3
219,"I have a friend that treats me rudely sometimes for no reason. I’m always nice, calm, and patient with her but no matter what i say she tends to respond very sarcastic and rudely, but some days she’s nice and very chatty with me. Although those are very few and far between, she’s a good friend to have when she’s being nice. I wouldn’t have a problem dropping her but she’s besties with a really good friend of mine and if i cut her off then i think she’s gonna try and distance my other friend from me. I’m also in theatre with her so i have no way of avoiding her. Does anyone know how i should handle this?

she’s been super annoyed with me lately and ended up blocking me everywhere (except for her phone for emergencies only) just to get space from me. i would make new accounts just to speak to her. 

she’s my favorite person and i have an unhealthy obsession with her. i feel physical pain when i’m unable to speak to her but for the first time in almost 6 months, i’ve gone a full 24 hours without contacting her. i can’t help but wonder if she’s proud of me.",04Dec2020,3
223,"I spent most of my time up until now either being bullied by classmates, hardly fitting in, which most of the time resulted in me simply giving up and isolating myself, or disagreeing with my dad on pretty much everything. I have very litle things that I can truly say I enjoyied or times I can reminisce on. Most of the time the people that were there on those times and occasions will say they did their best to make these moments true and that I'm just ungrateful for their work. This has put me at a state where my little happy memories have either turned into unhappy ones or have been submerged inside the sea of other unhappy memories. Because of the stupid educational system in my country, all 3rd year high school students have to attend national university entrance exams if they want a chance to actually do something in thier lives and study someplace not bad. So here we are... 5 months before these exams, quarantined until January 2021. I also have to study for those exams with this mindset of mine on a daily basis. I actually like studying and like the subjects themselves, but doing this every day with nobody to relax with, talk to and generally relate with is very lonely. And then there's quarantine. While I was unable to fit in before, it is now PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIT IN.  It feels like I've never been a kid since most of my ""nostalgic memories"" are full of but's and actually's and the most prominent memories are negative ones. I don't know what can I do while I'm still a kid but I don't want to let that tine go to waste... I really don't know where to post this. I refuse to call myself depressed since I'm not always this negative and didn't go through stuff like parrents arguing with eachother or racism.

224,"So quick rant. No one cares about mental health. I try to reach out to NHS and they refuse to improve my meds and told me they have to wear off on having an effect for my mania, psyhcosis and depression before they look at changing them.

I reach out to my friends and no one will actually talk about it. The ones I thought would, just pretend to give a shit but want to get out of the conversation asap. 

I have lost my life because of my last episode. My house, my friends, my partner, nearly my job. Idc for most of it, I'll make it back up. But I had a full split from reality, wasted my savings and full on psychosis on and off over months changes your view on yourself and the world.

I admittedly have been a dick in the past to a lot of my old friends, some of which I tried to talk to as I thought they would understand, but they've all moved on with their lives whilst I'n stuck in this cycle and it seems like I can't improve as a person. Haven't improved anything about myself since I was a kid. I'm now in my 20s. 

The same people I reach out to are the ones who will be the first to share posts about ""I would rather hear your story than attend your funeral."" I'm just realising that doesn't matter if they won't attend your funeral anyway. 

No one really gives a shit until they can put a post off an old photo of you on social media saying ""Miss you so much""",04Dec2020,1

227,"Trigger warning!// mention of suicide / self harm. 
New account for privacy reasons but i can dish out my main is needed/or makes it easier if needed. 

[15M] I have ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar. I am medicated. 

I don’t even know where to start really, so i’ll just try to explain these last few days. So basically, i have recently gone into deep depression again. I’m on my 5th attempt at suicide. I relapsed and self harmed again after 1.5 years, i really couldn’t care about what happens to me, and i mean that. Now, this isn’t me looking for help, i just need to get alot of things off my chest but i can’t. Also, i really apologise if you can’t read this well, i can’t really focus, ADHD is playing up as it’s late at night and my meds have wore off. 

What has happened in these few days has led me to almost try to attempt again last night, although it might not seem much to most, but it feels like a ton to me because of past mental and physical abuse from a narcassistic father. So my friend, he broke up with his girlfriend. Se sent me pictures of him hurting himself and i asked him what’s up. She said he is sad and he’s done with life and things. In 30 mins tops? I proceed to spill my fucking heart out to him, physically crying whilst texting him. He didn’t accept what i said, i did that 3 times. All he responded with is “yeah, but nobody even cares about me anymore”, and he finished with “don’t expect to see me at school tomorow.” This ofcourse got me scared. But, i left him to calm down and came back to him later, but same response. But that pressure and constant worry about him, and my having tried to kill myself 2 days before, didn’t mix. I got home and proceeded to self harm and almost overdose again, but ended up having a mental breakdown. I can’t take this anymore. I said to him i know how it feels and a breakup at our age, although it might feel like alot, doesn’t mean too much in reality. This might seem harsh i know but i was trying to make it positive. I told him i tried to end it a couple of days prior. He knows my mental health is beyone below at the minute. 

He is now back with his girlfriend after a ‘rough’ 3 days without, having him putting so much pressure onto me and almost trying to kill myself again, and i shouldn’t have been involved but i was trying to help. All i was trying to do was help. And it ended in me almost killing myself. 

I mess up literally everything. I can’t even hold a conversation. I am not really blaming myself too much, although i feel massive guilt. I feel like it’s my fault that he hurt himself over his own business. 

I haven’t spoken to him since the ‘event’ but i can’t do this. I’m on 5 suicide attempts, i even had to go to hospital for the second one. I know how feeling down can feel, i told him that. He didn’t even listen. I poured my heart out to him. I offered to give him a hug and even come round to his house to try to make an attempt at cheering him up and he still said no-one cares. 

My mental health since the event a few days ago, messed me up. I tried to hurt myself with my keys in math class. I got caught, got sent out off class and proceeded to have yet another mental breakdown, dropping to the floor and crying. I haven’t been sleeping good at all either, but i’m used to not sleeping good. I am losing the motivation to do anything again, including eating and drinking.

Like i mentioned, i suffered from past physical and mental abuse from my father (who luckily is out of my life). I can’t speak to anyone about anything. Ever since around 5 years ago, i haven’t told anyone about my mental health + mental illnesses before apart from him and 2 other people.

I can feel myself attempting again soon, possible via. Overdose again or jumping.

231,"I made a mistake, online schooling has overwhelmed me. I’ve tried, and I’ve not tried, and the difference seems like nothing. The worst part, no university resources are available till after exams. I’ve had questions and felt like I needed to talk to someone face to face, but everything is appointment based. I can’t get any info online for what I need, and emails are giving me vague answers. I legitimately fear for what I’m going to do in the future, if I fail now I don’t know how I would approach my parents. I don’t think I’m strong enough just to pull through. And it’s at its worst point. I’ve got so much work on my plate and I don’t know where to start. I’m trying to chip away but it piles on. And I’m not the type that doesn’t do assignments, I do them before their dates, often much before, but recently they’ve had me unable to do it. I feel like if I could learn, thrive even, if I could go to live, in person lectures and labs, but I feel more and more like I won’t get the chance to go where I want. It doesn’t help my parents were so utterly disappointed in me for saying I wanted to skip a year, it took so much for me to say it, and it was brushed off like I was crazy. I feel like I don’t have their support, or any bodies, and I have to do everything alone. Doesn’t help I haven’t seen a face in days. It’s to the point where I don’t know what life is, but it can’t be this, this feels like hell. I feel like I’ll never have the chance to be free like this again, and I’m not free. As if I’m already stuck in the cage, and I have wasted my first 17 years of life and I will be stuck like this. I don’t want to feel like this. And I can’t solve it.",04Dec2020,3
