1,"I think my brain is really messed up.
Everytime I try to enjoy a situation or want to do an important step in my life, my brain gives me the worst things I could imagine at the moment and then it starts to connect the negative thoughts with the things I like. So I am not able to feel joy anymore, only in really rare moments. Then when I will think back to the situation for example a concert the primary memory isn’t the concert itself, it is the worst negative thought I could have at that moment and it will stuck in my head for maybe weeks or months.
Or another example is when I wanted to tell my parents what I do want to study this year I was really scared of my thoughts and the things around me, cause I knew whatever happens I can’t forget it anymore and my whole career I will have that in mind, and guess what I completely failed there and now I start to think of a different job I could do just to escape from that thoughts. I mean that’s crazy and I know that but repeating things can fix it for me.  I know that I can’t live this way and I really wanna change things in my life, but even in this moment where I’m writing here on Reddit my brain pushes negative thoughts into my mind and in the moment I’m gonna post this, I have to be sure that my brain is free of them, otherwise the thoughts are connected to this post.",11Jan2020,1

5,"Hi. It's incredibly hard for me to make this post, hence not wanting it on my main account, hence the throwaway.

I think my mental health is suffering and I need advice on if I actually do need help or if this is all in my head.

I think it all started a little over a year ago. My grandfather passed away from brain, lung, and pancreatic cancer. We had about two months between finding out, and his death. That summer was hard, but I still felt like myself.

In september of that same year, my cousin passed away suddenly. It was a shock to everyone. I took two weeks off from college, returned, but my motivation was down the drain. My GPA suffered a bit, but not that much. 

Since then I've felt my motivation decline. At my summer job that I really enjoyed, I wanted to do anything but work. When College started up again it got better, but nowhere near where I used to be. Now, I just want to lay in bed all day and do nothing.

And just when I think I'm having a good day, it all comes to a halt for no reason. I feel sad without warning, I want to cry for no reason at all. 

It just all feels like it's getting worse. I'm a very prideful person, so getting help isn't exactly easy for me, but I keep thinking I may need it. 

Cost isn't a factor, we have a councelling centre on campus that's free, I just don't want to take away from someone who may need it more than me.

Anyways, any advice would be appreciated. Thanks",11Jan2020,1
6,"I have a mental/nervous breakdown almost once every hour usually because of school. It's usually when people say the smallest thing that kind of hurts my feelings causing me to spiral or it's when I have such a large workload, I look at the time and just start hyperventilating and crying and then try to force myself to work and go back to having a mental breakdown. I just don't want to exist sometimes and by sometimes like almost every single second of school. Is this my just being overwhelmed by stress or is this something else?",11Jan2020,1
7,"I get really tired of seeing posts, not so much here but a lot all over the subs /social media about people labeling someone as a narcissist. Just because someone is a shitty person, doesn't mean they are a narcissist. Just because that person is a selfish, self-centered twat, doesn't mean they are a narcissist. Just because a person hurts you, doesn't mean they are a narcissist. Stop it. 95% of the time, it's just a really crappy someone is dealing with. A person can be abusive and not be a narcissist. I guess it really upsets me because I've actually dealt with one and he destroyed my life, I've been away from him for going on nine years and the damage he wrought is still there. He is actually diagnosed as a narcissist with sociopathic tendencies. He is a monster. I'm still afraid to get a divorce because that will bring me back under his radar and he will do everything he can to screw my life up again because he simply likes to do it. It's fun for him. Plus I'm the evil witch that left him so I must pay for hurting his ego. I get it, whomever it is you're talking about is a really awful person, but please, don't throw this label around.

It doesn’t really interfere with my life it just makes nothing feel special anymore. Everything seems to be going ok for a while with nothing bad happening except for the feeling of nothingness and then out of nowhere I accidentally do something embarrassing at school such as causing my team to lose in gym because I’m not athletic, and then I worry for a while with my heart feeling like it could explode out of my chest and I feel like I’m going to throw up.

10,"So I'm in middle school right now, and have been going through depression for around 3 years now. And I know every year it gets worse. I self harm, and have suicidal thoughts. I have tried talking to my parents but since they are divorced, I can really only do so much. My mom struggles with depression, and I worry about my brother. He is older then me, but I still worry about him alot. I have talked to him about my depression, but since he is so young(he is turning 18 this year) all he can really do is listen to me and encourage me to go to the counselors at my school. I spoke to him last night, after relapsing and he told me to see a councelor before school starts. And I did intend on doing so. But I got anxious since I have never done it before, and just went to class instead. I don't know what to do, since my father doesn't understand, and I feel like I would make my mom question herslef about how good of a mother she has been. Which she has been a wonderful mother. I feel like suicide would be a nice way out, but I have three wonderful friends, and three wonderful cats, and two budgies, and a brother. I would leave behind my brother to live in this world without his little sister, which to me doesnt seem bad. But I worry I'm wrong and I would just ruin my family's lives forever. I truly am not sure what to do anymore. Please, if you have any advice, comment. I hope you people have a wonderful day.",11Jan2020,1
11,"I just feel like I'm never going to get better. my suicidal thoughts will always come back. They're here at the minute telling me different ways i should do it. But I don't want to I just want them to go away which probably means dying tbh.

I tried to kill myself on the 7th december and apart from doctors helping me get physically better and the psychiatrist visiting and sign posting things thats all i've had. Who the fuck knows when or if the NHS will offer me support because they're shit. I thought mentioning my suicide attempt in my referral would have gotten them to contact me quickly but apparently not. It's only been a couple weeks but it feels like a couple weeks too long.

I had extensions for my uni work and i barely got most of it done in time because of my brain not letting me concentrate and plaguing me with flashbacks of hospital. My essay was due on wednesday. It's now saturday I haven't even started it and I don't know how to. I didn't do any of the reading last semester because of my depression so I have no clue.

I don't know what and i don't understand where this is coming from... i will usually ignore it until something snaps. Something triggers it (music, lyrics, a line in a movie, or sometimes just a picture)  then, i will start crying and feel very very very hurt and lonely. I don't know how to describe the pain, maybe the kind that you get when your pet dies? Or someone you care for dies? It's just very very painful that you just don't want to exist. 
 I don't understand where this comes from. I'm okay one minute, then it comes and bam! But then...it does not linger too long especially if i let it out(cry).

15,"I am riding the bus right appreciating the peace I've just achieved. After several years of torment, I am free. Do you know what happiness is to me? It's listening to good music, walking peacefully to work, eating great food, having good relationships with people. Even as simple as noticing how good the weather is makes me smile.

I used to have bad behavior because I truly believed my life was a hopeless case. It wasn't hard for me to believe the bad things when they happen because they are literally all I ever experience. When I have my depressive episodes before, I flip out on almost everybody. I lock myself up, I write suicide letters, and plan to execute how I will die inside my room. It was the only place I wanted to die. It was the only place that accepted me without any pretentions. I was in a very dark place and time. 

But all those episodes before are hazy memories to me now. I know what I did, but I will never remember the feeling anymore. I am a living proof that depressed people aren't themselves when they are depressed. I don't recognize the person I was before. That wasn't me. That was my demon running my life for me.

I used to throw up when I think about my life. I cursed God and promised that when I meet him, he will hear me out and I will stab him for tormenting me. This is how angry I was back then.

Now I couldn't say these things anymore. I just can't imagine uttering these words. Who was that? 

My depression started in 2012 and it reached its peak in 2018. I really could have died but I chose not to. It was the scariest feeling knowing I could really do it. But I didn't give up and I rebuilt myself in 2019. Now we are in 2020 and I can't explain how happy I am for beating my own demons.

I WON. PLEASE DON'T EVER GIVE UP. THIS IS AN ILLNESS. THIS IS JUST LIKE A FEVER THAT WHEN IT GOES AWAY, IT'S SO MUCH DIFFERENT BEING OUT OF THE HEAT AND THE DARK. HOLD ON TO YOUR LIVES.

16,"Tl;dr...as someone who needs physical/emotional comfort and closeness when I'm depressed, stressed, overwhelmed, etc, it's hard for me to understand people who need the opposite.

I know this is long, thank you for reading. This may at first seem like a relationship issue or polyamory issue, but the crux of my question is as stated in the title. 

My situation: I'm in an open relationship with my boyfriend of 5.5 years. That's solid. My question is regarding another person I've been seeing for 10 months. Our relationship is both friendly, we spend time doing plenty outside the bedroom, and intensely physical, with some BDSM elements and exploring things outside societal norms. Please don't weigh in on my personal life and relationship choices. That's not what this is about. 

So anyway, I've been seeing this guy for 10 months. We have become good friends and have an intense physical and intellectual connection. We see each other every 3-4 weekends. After spending a wonderful weekend together, we were texting one night when I began mentioning some emotional stuff, like how it takes me some time to come down from the high of the physical intensity of our time together. I didnt expect the response I got. At all. He said he worries he can't give me the time I need/want/deserve. He said that lately he has felt increasingly overcommitted and stretched too thin. 

Now, I could go into all the things that may have incorrectly lead to him feeling like that but the important details are he is a grad student (in clinical psychology of all things) and recently began a new job as a therapist. He also just does a lot, volunteering, marathons, etc. I know how stressful grad school is, and I'm equally overcommitted even now, as the director of a nonprofit, member of several boards of directors, volunteering, and so on. But for me, when I'm overwhelmed I need that connection, both physical and emotional, but I get that some people don't. We have talked at length about our struggles with depression, anxiety, and for me, past abuse. So those things are fully in the open between us.

So at the end of our conversation I suggested that after a little time and space, we talk again about things. He said that sounds good. In the time we have known each other there was another time he kind of pulled away (though we didnt take ""time off"") and things went back to normal and his grandmother died unexpectedly and somewhat tragically, after which we went 2-3 weeks with little contact because he needed space. So I can confirm this is really how he responds to stress. I asked if it's ok if I text him at all and he said I could, but his responses may not be as timely because he is going to try to disconnect from his phone more. 

I hope that he reaches out to me, but if he doesnt, does it seem reasonable for me to text him in a couple weeks? Say, after a wedding I know he's attending or to ask how classes are going? 

Tl;dr again...For people who need space and not comfort and attention, can you explain how it helps you to NOT hear from people that care about you?",11Jan2020,1
17,"...found not ONE but TWO places where I feel loved, respected, valued, and where I belong.

The first is the Partial Hospitalization Program of course. I feel like I am valued, respected, and (this sounds weird to even myself) like I can be myself. If I am depressed and don't feel like talking, then nobody gets annoyed or angry with me. They just accept that I am a person with problems and respect the fact that I am ""the quiet one"" there (I don't talk much at all). I am surrounded by people who are all unique and have their own challenges...yet we are the same too. It is a really nice feeling to go there and just chill out all day long (I even colored a picture with these kick-ass gel pens) and just...be myself.

 The second is a place called the Recovery Bank, which is a place that is all about recovery in an old building that used to be a bank. No shit...it really was lol. I stopped in today, after debating going in there for the past 3 days because at the Prison, the people who were coming in doing classes and groups from the outside had highly recommended that once we get out that we check it out. I am SO glad I did. They are SUPER SUPER nice, they are getting some food for my family since we are still struggling a bit until I get my money going again, they listened to my tale of going to prison and for what I had gotten locked up. The lady listened and invited me to come back down tomorrow to get the food and to talk to a peer specialist! :D Plus, the one lady who did the Drug &amp; Alcohol class at the Prison is there on Wednesdays so I can see her again! That makes me super happy because this lady was THE BEST! She has so much energy and positivity that it makes you smile just being around her. I would be in such a bad mood on a Monday when I was down (that means in prison) but then when 12:30 pm arrived and I was called out to go to her class...my whole afternoon--heck, my whole DAY--automatically became better! Just from knowing she would be there in class. :) I looked forward to Mon 12:30 pm and Wed. 8:30 am (yeah-even though that hour of the day SUCKS lol) because I knew that my day would be okay after that. I also had AA in the evening that day so the rest of the WEEK was good!

&amp;#x200B;

This is a positive post for once and I will tell you something awesome that I'd done today (before I had to wait forever and eternity squared for the stupid bus to come lol) when I was at the Recovery Bank (Please do not judge me for the first part)...  


Of course, I had bought myself 2 lighters...a red and a blue one  (I KNOW I KNOW--I even asked my Probation Officer if I would get in trouble for possessing a lighter or matches, and she only said she does not recommend it, but I won't get violated because my Terms &amp; Conditions of Probation don't say a damn thing about possessing a lighter or matches) which made me feel a LOT less tense once I had them in my possession. I had gone into my pencil case where I was keeping the lighters and the lady at the Recovery Bank had seen them...and asked me if I would give them up. I had just bought them, so I shook my head. Then she asked if I would give up ONE of them...and I said OK. I gave it to her and she was SO proud of me! Hmmm. See why I am so happy with going there? That is what I was talking about--they don't talk down to you (like some therapists and even psychiatrists do) but rather, they talk to you as if you are a person with a problem or two to be worked on...of course there are one or more problems, otherwise you wouldn't be in a Recovery place. :D The lady I was talking to had a problem with drugs and alcohol so she kinda understands the addiction thing, even though I am addicted to something different from ""mainstream"" addiction, and this addiction has almost no research for it and is very not understood at all because it is exceedingly rare. She did confirm that I do have this rare disorder, though because of how my eyes lit up when I was talking about it and because I am DSM-5 perfect for it...we went through each qualification for the disorder and she was even shocked at the level I had been at (I am still at...let's face it, I had NO therapy in prison and I had gotten much worse in fact because all those urges had been repressed and now they are coming out in a HUGE way, though I have technically been behaving and haven't torched even a piece of lint...paper...NOTHING. That is a good thing, though I would be lying to you guys and myself if I said I am totally over my addiction and will NEVER do it again...  


So I had a really good day. I am smiling, my depression is very minimal, my anxiety is almost non-existent, and I actually feel good. Tired as HECK, but good. My insomnia is another problem that I hope will ease up as I catch up on sleep this weekend.

18,"Alright where do i start. 
I guess this whole thing started in high school we dated twice but it didn't work out. The problem in high school was me, I didn't know how to treat a girlfriend and i treated her like i would treat my guy friends but after that relationship. I was super hung up for her for years and i could not get over her. (I wont go into too much detail about this if you want to know more ill tell you). Fast forward 3-ish years, me and her had a very dramatic get back together I wasn't in very good standing, I was very lost and had alot of mental insecurities. The weeks leading to us getting back together were of me constantly talking about her and what not. she was was dating another man but she begun to fall in love with me again as she felt I had changed. once we got back together i realized i needed to get my life in order as i was afraid of loosing her again. so i got to work getting back into college, deciding a major, choosing a career goal, and even getting an internship. its not important what i was doing before but basically i went from nothing to entrepreneur. As our relationship went on we had a few battles over other topics but its basically been growing to where she tells me she feels like nothing to me. i have tried anything. im always clingy to her. i buy her things, i take her on walks almost every night, i take her out on amazing dates almost every week but it seems like i cant get through to her her own self worth. normally if i do this to a girl the exact opposite happens, the girl usually feels too good for me and leaves. I have realized, I talk alot about journeys I've gone on or past experiences which i realized recently. i'm trying to plan dates even vacations together. but i feel like it just makes her feel worse. What do i do i have been obsessed with this girl since junior year hs (4-5 years ago) and i feel like our relationship is slowly deteriorating because of this but we both want to be together.

about her-she is 18, about to get her associates in college, and absolutely beautiful. but the problem is her parents are Asian helicopter parents. Her mom served in the gulf war and her dad also. her mom is the biggest problem she has extreme bi-polar and cant fall asleep unless she is at home. so because of that she makes her have a bedtime. her mom is a pretty mean person and does belittle her ALOT. From my perspective she doesn't want to allow her to grow up for example wont help her get a drivers licence, do things on her own, even let her do her own laundry. her dads a nice guy hes not important. she was extremely pushed through schooling hence 18 and has associates.

about me- I'm 20 and i drifted after highschool unsure of what to do i eventually thought. I could get away by talking a working holiday to Australia for awhile after that caved in i came back and didn't know what to do next until we got back together and now i have my life so in order i have a schedule for every second of the day. i feel great my mental health is almost perfect and every insecurity i had is gone. I traveled ALOT between ages 18-20 but i'm behind in school (half way through my associates).

I don't know what to do i keep trying to tell her i'm the one that's obsessed over her but its not working. I NEED this relationship or i feel like ill go back to drifting.",11Jan2020,1

Today we were talking about if my family knew about this world but she said “does your sister know about your personalities?” This kind of disturbed me and I had to take a second to process what she said, it threw me off a bit from what I was thinking. She said that I described completely different personalities in each of them so aren’t they personalities? I know they’re personalities but I’ve never referred to them as that, they’ve always been my friend group and family you know? I kind of say they’re people, and whenever I talk about them with people I say things like they’re real but not physically here, they’re not really just a creation in my head like I didn’t think “this is what she looks like and this is her name this is how she acts” like it just kind of cake to me like “I know her name and that’s how she acts I can’t control her she’s her own person”.

Over the summer my dad and I got into an argument, and he got to the point where he thought he should call the cops and admit me to the hospital. 
Every time I cry now or try to share my feelings he calls me crazy. He threatens to send me to the hospital, and he knows I HATE it. He says he doesn’t want to deal with my insanity, and I just want to be able to reach out to him. He says he hasn’t given up on me, but I can’t tell. 
Anyways, I’m so scared to share my feelings. He began recording me when I was crying and asking for help. I was crying earlier today, as I just moved back from being gone for a couple months. The transition back into my old school and people has been so hard.

26,"I have been depressed in one way or another since my dad passed about 10 years ago when I was really young. He was one of the only people that I could truly be myself with, and is the reason i'm going into the work field I am headed into.

Since then it seems like everything has gone down hill, I had to repeat school so many times until I just dropped out. My relationship with my mom was never good but it has gotten a lot worse recently, which really sucks because I still live at home. I work full-time in retail in a deceptively terrible store.

My depression really wasn't that bad until more recently, I'm not sure what really had me slip down the rabbit hole but it has been quite a fall. Though it probably has a lot to do with the person who I met about 4 years ago. She helped me with how I was feeling, and even set me up with the person I am training with to get my ratings for the field I want to go into. She really hasn't wanted anything to do with me for months, but I had started to slip before that.

I had recently started to do self harm in the form of cutting, I have done it in places I normally get cuts from working on my truck so no one that I know of has noticed as of yet. Suicide has been getting into my head more and more, Though more like assisted suicide. I have looked into the deadliest jobs, and what insurance company's will cover what.

He told me my mom didn’t love me and was going to leave us both behind. He constantly used I guess what I would call guilt tactics to get me to do stuff, like achieve better grades, by blaming his problems onto me and my downfalls. If I didn’t do what he wanted, he wouldn’t speak to me, tell me he loved me or give any positive feedback whatsoever. It happened pretty much all the time for three years with him among other things he did. Around the same time my grandmother had come to stay with us (a woman who my mom barely knows anymore or talks to) and told ten year old me that my mom was going to kill herself, leave my dad, was doing drugs, was an alcoholic and was cheating on my dad (all of which were false).  Among other things, other family members continued to tell me my mother was leaving and was unfaithful to my father. My mom thinks it was child abuse but is she overreacting? I think I’m being too sensitive with this. She’s asked me cut off any family members who did this but is that right? I feel bad doing that. Maybe these things were true and everyone’s just hiding it from me. I really don’t know.",11Jan2020,1
29,"So this is something that's been bothering me a long time. I've only realized what it really is about 6-10 months ago. I have this feeling usually in waves, of wanting to leave.

I have to describe it a bit to really get this down to writing, which I don't know how well I'll do, since it's never easy. It's just a feeling of wanting to be somewhere else. Not like leaving the house, or walking down the street, or moving to a new country. It's just this, literally overwhelming feeling, of wanting to get away. But the place I know I want to go, it doesn't exist. It's not a real place, and I know that I want to be there. It's just the worst feeling to add to it, knowing I want more than anything to be somewhere else, where the place doesn't exist, and there's no path to take.

For starters, no. I don't hate myself. I want to be seen as I see myself, which I don't think anyone I know actually sees in me. I don't know if I'm 100% trans (FtM), but I want to be seen as male. Sometimes, with these feelings of leaving, I get the urge to actually *be* someone else. I don't hate myself, but there's things I want to change, and I want people to see me in the way I want to be seen. Even when I tell them, it doesn't feel like they really know. It's like some sort of psychological thing, where unless you've lived with it, you'll never know what I 100% mean, and it breaks my soul a little every time.

I've been writing for a long time ( maybe about 6 years ), and I've finally made a character I'm proud of. A story I've written has never crossed 40 pages and been something I'm proud of, and this one's at 150+. This relates to my ( I think ) coping mechanism of sorts.

I watch a lot of Netflix. To the point others have noticed it's becoming nearly obsessive. I'll watch it constantly. I'll find a show or movie and watch it immediately, watching as much as I can. It's not that it's taking over my life yet, but I tend to watch 6-12 hours a day, depending on what I'm doing that day. I'm in school now, and working part time, so I won't have as much time, which worries me, since I have figured out this is what both keeps me mentally grounded ( oddly enough ), and what might be making it worse.

I associate a lot with characters. People I want to be seen as. Almost all males. Some examples of people I feel I really understand ( and I usually do, like almost *oddly* and *using myself as a basis for how I feel* ) are: Magneto ( Younger version, X-men ), Gwaine ( BBC Merlin ), Daryl Dixon ( AMC Walking Dead ), and partially with Karl D'Branin ( Netflix, Nightflyers ). It isn't really important to know them, but it's who I want to be seen as, and it sometimes *physically* hurts to not be realized for who I am.

When people get these characters wrong, I fell this immediate pain and disconnect. Like I feel like I've done something wrong by not being who I am enough for them to even get close to what I feel. ( ie. For those of you who know the Lord of the Rings. I wanted to come off closer to the characters I mentioned above. Selfless, cold \[but not heartless\], strong, violent with cause, a little bit off kilter ( maybe a little sociopathic or psychopathic, maybe a little bit like Magneto at the end of First Class ), loyal, burdened, mostly just strong in a way I carried enough burdens, but **never** would I want to be pitied. So, when I talked to one of my friends, who I felt very close to, and had been friends with a long time, who I had broken down to a few times, I eventually asked who he thought I would be. I would have been okay with anyone, save one. I was looking for Frodo, Aragorn, Legolas, maybe even Sauron as a joke. He said Boromir. It was because I 'always wanted power'. It broke my heart a bit. I felt that he had seen everything wrong. Nothing really against Boromir. I like the character. But greedy, corruptible, selfish, arrogant, power-hungry, and violent without cause was literally the *exact opposite* of what I was looking for. It felt so bad that someone I had trusted and thought knew me well, knew so little. )

But really, the issue I have now, is that I'm realizing that this feeling of wanting to be somewhere else, to be someone else, to be who I want by my own hands, can't happen. I don't think there's ever a way to be who I want to be, and I know there's never a place I can find where I want to be. I create parallel versions of myself in books ( The book I've mentioned is the first time I feel a small disconnect, where I would like to be them, but don't feel I am them 100%, although as time passes, it's becoming like that anyways. ), and it doesn't end well, forcing the cycle of a little bit more extreme, a little bit more dark, a little bit more strong, a little bit more burdened. It always ends up worse, and I take that worse bit in, and make it a bit worse again.

I really just needed somewhere to put this to words. The feeling literally makes it impossible to eat, sleep, do anything but either dissociate by watching a thing and let myself be part of a different reality, with a new character to add on to the growing list of misery men and Magneto-esque characters I put myself into, and them into me. I either dissociate like that, or I write into a stupor. That feeling is getting worse.

It was at first like once a few weeks, then once a week. It's gotten to the point it happens every other day, maybe 3 days a week. It's getting harder to live with. I have no good way to cope. I don't even have a name for what I'm feeling. Even some sort of direction ( like is this depression, anxiety, anything ) would help. I don't know what to do. If you offer Therapy, tell me why. I'm not against it, but I don't know how it'll help. I don't know how to fix this, or if it can be fixed. I don't know if I'm starting to hate life because it'll never be what I want to live in. I don't think I'll ever hate myself, but I want to be someone else, somewhere else, and it's going to wreck my life if I can't figure out what to do, even if it's just dissociating using Media, or writing. If you know anything about this, anything will help.

I just want something to work with. 

Thank you for reading my rant. This was hard to put into words. I'll try and check back soon, maybe often. Idk. 

And just to let you know offhand, I don't really have anyone to talk to about this that understands ( save one I dump problems on, but try not to since he has a life and this is kind of depressing ), and I don't have a family ( other than my brother I just mentioned ) that understands at all.

30,"Hey all,

So a few years ago, I fell way too deeply in love with a girl who I thought loved me back, and maybe for awhile she did, but towards the end she became distant and suddenly broke it off, telling me she didn't feel the same. Which is totally okay! But at the time, I was super immature and it was so hard for me to deal with the sudden rejection. That was an issue on my end -- not hers -- but the point is that the pain of feeling so lied to was almost intolerable and I truly felt like discarded trash. As you can tell... I'm overly-dramatic.

Eventually, as the pain faded, I began to become overproductive, spending the next year climbing to incredible heights in my career and creative life. It felt like I was using all this bad stuff for something good, and to an extent I was. But that didn't change the fact that the real reason I was doing it was because I wanted to run from my feelings. Eventually, I was in so deep that it wasn't just a habit but a necessity to continue all the work that I had begun. Which, honestly, has been a great thing.

But relationships didn't really happen, except for one girl who I ended it with because I didn't feel the same for her (poetic, in a sense). I longed a lot, I still do. But deep down there's that subconscious part of me that tells me I'm not good enough. And it's because of what happened a few years ago and a childhood of feeling like a disappointment and living in the shadow of others. These are things I desperately want to grow beyond.

Cut to now, and incredibly there's a girl who I've known for awhile who somehow I've caught those same feelings for. All the walls I built around my heart just crumbled with her -- she is so sweet and warm and that intuitive part of me just feels good around her, and I think she likes me too. But now that those walls are down, that wound from my first ex came gushing open. And I don't want to run this time and just not process it. I want to heal so that I have a healthy chance with this girl I like so much. I have to heal if I can ever truly be a good partner for anyone, which is seriously something that I have always wanted to be.

So... How? How do I heal? How do I move through this? I cannot let this cycle repeat again. I have to grow.",11Jan2020,1

33,"I am living in a transition housing program in LA and was wondering if there was some place to report abuse and improper living conditions. 

This place is horrible....they charge $500 per month for place that does not even have heat and  they do not even give you a blanket and you're forced to keep the windows open. They do not have toil paper the amount of food they provide is tiny. They keep your medications your first few days and a unlicensed ""staff"" member hands them out sometimes hours late. All ""staff"" are clients that have been here a few months. They even had the power turned off the other day for lack of payment. There are people that drink in the house and do drugs right out side this drug rehab.  In the time I have been here the ""staff"" literally beat up two people before kicking them out and on numerous occasions threaten to bodily harm.  You're not allowed to leave your first month so I can not even got try to make a few bucks to get hygiene products.

37,"I feel as though people throw the words depression and anxiety etc around too much. a lot of people say they are 'depressed' because they had a bad day or say they have anxiety as an excuse. It takes away from the people who actually suffer from it and makes it seem like it's not a big deal. If you think you actually have anxiety or depression or anything like that please see someone about it but if it's not that serious don't throw it around. Depression is like inside torture. Having a bad day is not Depression and not wanting to go outside because you can't be bothered Isn't anxiety 

Please don't take this as me saying anxiety or depression doesn't mean anything. It's actually the opposite. I'm saying that they shouldn't be thrown around as it makes people feel like they are just like everyone else and they end up not seeking help for it. 

tl:dr if you actually think you have depression or anxiety seek help. If not don't tell people you have these conditions",11Jan2020,1
38,"I had everything I wanted, I was fit, had a girl I genuinely loved, and I threw it all away. I left school because I couldn’t stay past 3rd period having bad panic attacks with slight hallucinations, and what a doctor said sounds like “stress related IBS”. I went on to homeschooling and after a few months I was having constant mood swings and nothing made me happy anymore. I would ignore my girlfriend and only reply with “ok” “yes” “I love you too” and I could tell she wasn’t happy but she really cared for me so she stayed. I didn’t have enough energy so I broke up with her. I laid in bed and for the first time in years I cried. After a few more months nothing satisfied me anymore, only distractions could keep me entertained, like a good show or video game. After I finished one I felt so empty and sad. I left the house maybe once a month, getting fatter and fatter I couldn’t recognize myself. Went out even less out of shame and because most weight went to my chest so I have man tits. I feel ashamed to be outside, I can’t be shirtless when completely alone, I disgust myself. I hate myself with a burning passion. I’m a Christian because I’m scared of death, only reason I haven’t looked myself is because I don’t want to go to hell. I have constant nightmares. I’m just trying to keep myself entertained while I wait for death. I’ve been on my knees praying and screaming for God to end me now and take me to heaven while I cried. I have no motivation to better myself, this world is awful and I don’t want to be a part of it.

45,"I'm 22 and still live with my parent. All of my siblings have significant others. My younger sibling is moving in with her fiance. I've never even had a real relationship, and I don't think I ever will. I have a severe avoidant personality disorder, depression, anxiety. I have isolated myself for many, many reasons, but one reason is that no one cares about me. I can't even talk to my sibling anymore, but they jabber at me whenever they want to. They dump all their stresses on me and all I can do is sit there and listen. And the rare chances I get to speak, they literally *always* interrupt me. I don't have anything important enough to say for anyone to listen to me. 

People talk about their life experiences, what they've done within the day. I have nothing to talk about. Maybe I just want to talk about a dream I had. Or something I watched. But it doesn't matter at all. My problems are nothing compared to troubling life and work experiences everyone else around me has. I don't have a job, I don't get to complain about anything. I've been deathly depressed and suicidal every single day for years on end, but no, please tell me more about your problems because mine don't matter. I'm nothing. 

I just don't see any reason for me to be alive. All I've done in this life is fail over and over again. I can't even get a job to support my family or myself. I really think the best option for me is death. I never feel comfortable around others and I'm so terrified of building relationships with people. I have nothing meaningful to contribute to others. I'm just a waste. 

Because of my avoidant personality disorder, I've been stuck in my room for 4 years this summer. Being alone all the time in the same place has made me kind of go crazy in ways. It has made me question my reality a lot. I can't stay asleep and relax because I'm always tormented with the thought of how bad this hurts. I often wake up in heartache, wondering if I'm really alive. It's really scary. I can never put into words how bad this hurts. I'm such a horrible person. I should've never been here. Sometimes I just feel like I'm in a dream. And when I talk, no one can hear me. I get this floaty feeling. It's really scary. 

Therapy isn't an option for me although I really need it. But I feel like nothing is worth it because I'm not worthy of anything. I don't deserve any kindness, goodness, or love. Also, I feel like nothing is worth it because I should just be dead. But of course, I don't want to feel this way, I used to want to have a life but that is just so unrealistic for me. And I don't deserve a good life.

53,"After nearly 6 months of being in one of the weirdest phases of my life I think I am finally getting back to some level of normalcy. I just want to give hope to those that are facing something similar and think that there is no light at the end of the tunnel.

I graduated university back in 2018. My uni days were some of my best and I had a blast meeting new people and getting some amazing opportunities while at school. Upon graduating, I thought the world was my oyster and thought it would be so easy to get into the realm of my dream job and start 'real life'. I was hopeful, albeit, a little naive but hopeful that I could really do anything. After working at a pretty cool place for an internship, I landed what I thought would be a pretty decent gig. And in the beginning it really was. Until...

There were a lot of red flags that this place was not so great; no staff from the previous year, high turnover rates, no organization. But I ignored those signs, cause I needed a job and really wanted to see the best in the establishment. Slowly but surely, I became a target for my boss and began to understand why everyone had left. My boss would target me everyday for the smallest details - one time she got mad at me for thanking someone in an email. Yes it was that bad. I knew my days were numbered so I didn't really care. It wasn't until she blew up on me in the office and accused me of mocking her with my body language - I was trying not to cry. I knew in that moment that I needed to leave. And I did. 

This story really isn't about my boss being an incompetent mentor. Its really about how she slowly chipped away at my self esteem and confidence without me realizing it. The following weeks of leaving that place I noticed that I felt so unmotivated and didnt do much. I literally sat in my room and binged Netflix and just excused it as taking some time off and giving myself a break. But this cycle continued. I slowly had no motivation to do anything - walk my dog, workout, go to the store. I rarely stepped outside of the house when it was daylight. Applying to other jobs was a mess. Every time I saw a posting I was interested in, I would be reminded of my boss mocking me and in more or less words telling me I couldn't do something or I didn't understand. It was a vicious cycle. It was one of my lowest points in life. I finally understood what I meant to be depressed. That never ending feeling of wanting to do something but not being able to. I never realized that one person and one negative experience could take such a toll on me. 

Now, I recognized this behaviour. Not everyone can. It takes work and time to pull yourself out of something like this. I began picking one thing to accomplish a day and patting myself on the back for getting it done. First it was brushing my teeth and showering. Then it became brushing, my teeth, showering and making my bed. I added journaling to that as well. Then meditating for 10 minutes. I began building this momentum. By the time the new year approached, I felt really good with the routine i was establishing and the mental headspace that I was cultivating. I am working every day to do better.

Now whats the point of this post you may ask. Well, I want to point out some things that weren't  really discussed with me upon graduating and the professional world and how it relates to mental health. No one tells you about post grad depression. It sucks. Being lost. Not knowing who you are. Your identity is tied to being a student for nearly 20 years, and once you walk out of those doors with that piece of paper in your hand, you are no longer that person. You need to make your own identity from that point. And its rough figuring out what you want and who you are. Cliche, i know, but oh so true. 

The next thing would be to recognize the signs of a toxic work environment. A boss should never make you feel like shit. You should not dread to go to work. You should not hate asking questions. You should not be afraid to speak up. You should feel comfortable voicing your concerns. No amount of money is worth your health. I looked up to my boss and admired her work ethic and all that she accomplished at such a young age. While I was trying to please her, I became her punching bag.  I realized that too late. And I should have spoken up sooner and voiced how I really felt. I left that job. I am glad I did. I could look at my time there as a waste of time. But I don't. I learned a lot about people and power structures and dynamics. I think I was meant to witness that at the beginning of my career so I know what to look for later on. My bottom line with that experience is that it is never worth it. Nothing happens if there is no you. Remember that.

If you made it this far - thank you. I know this post is disjointed but I just needed to get it off my chest and maybe help someone who is feeling the professional pressure and is really taking a hit at work. Your sanity is more important. The older I get, the more I realize that.",11Jan2020,1
54,"My therapist for the past year has said some pretty demeaning things. I have tried to leave her practice multiple times, but have been met with “this is not how to handle things in your life that are uncomfortable. This is a good example of the negative behavior. You leave jobs and relationships that dont suit you.”

I thought, man, maybe she’s right. I’ll stick it out.

So I did, for a year.

She demonized my mom for drinking when I was a child (I’m aware of the damage it has caused) to the point of whenever I brought her up, brought up good moments that felt like real progress, she’d remind me that my mom is “unstable” and it could go wrong any moment. Leaving me feeling like every good moment needed to be met with the anxiety of “when will this suck again”. She gave me no tools and left little room for forgiveness.

Whenever I would get a bruise from walking into something, I was labeled as “careless” for not practicing good self care. As if being clumsy was synonymous with not loving yourself. Whenever I walk into something or trip, I’m reminded of how “careless” I must be and how that coincides with my self worth. 

What made me finally walk out was this.
I was explaining that I felt my boyfriend was being distant. I felt my needs weren’t met.
“What are your NEEDS Kiera?” She said nastily as she made quotations with her hands. “People have so many needs, and they don’t even know what they are, they just want someone to fulfill them” 

Feeling almost forced into saying something to defend myself, I replied. I said felt sometimes like the only one who was willing to voice any issue within the relationship. I felt he had almost “checked out.” 

She then (without apology) said “I’m glad I got that out of you! This is why it’s good to be direct sometimes.” 
Almost trying to turn this into a good thing..

Regardless of the context, what was said to me next was out of line.

I have come to realize my past habits of leaving uncomfortable situations is not mutually exclusive to wanting to leave her practice. I feel manipulated, and even though I can say I felt she was wrong in how she handled me, a part of me says maybe i’m being defensive. Maybe my mom really is a terrible selfish person and I can’t help but continue to helplessly try to pursue a healthy relationship with her; or at least forgive.

Maybe I do leave all things that are uncomfortable and without “valid” reason.

Maybe I am too needy, maybe I need to give myself more and expect less from others.

Maybe I am careless and self destructive. 

I don’t know.",11Jan2020,1
55,"For the past... year? 2 years maybe? I've been going through what i call a ""paralisis"", basically, it's a period in time where i am unable to do anything but MAYBE roll in bed and check my phone, i may be thirsty, hungry, sleepy but i don't eat drink or sleep or even go to the bathroom.

Those periods of time can range from a few minutes to over 3 hours, and while that happens tons of thoughts, ranging from neutral to... dangerous to myself..., are swirling through my head and also the thought of ""why can't i move or do anything even if i'm not tired or need something"".

It doesn't only happen in bed, it happened once while i was standing and multiple times while sitting down, it's not a pleasant experience, my will to do anything disapears and moving maybe an inch is the most i feel like i can do.

Also, most of the time, i start feeling horribly anxious while it's happening, to the point where i can feel my heart beat faster and maybe my breathing go more rapidly, but i don't think i'm even close to a panic attack. Other times i feel like that even when not going through my ""paralisis""

It's a process that goes in phases, that may be building up slowly or fast. The process goes like this:

-Doing whatever i'm doing like normal
-Start feeling... bad? Not sure how to describe it
-Lose interest in what i'm doing
-I realize what is happening, but already know i can't stop it
-Stop what i am doing entirely, whether i really want to or not
-Maybe put on headphones and music to keep my thoughts silenced for as long as possible (not sure if it helps, but it sure feels like it does)
-Do nothing
-Start feeling like i can move again
-Drink something

Apparently this has been happening to someone important to me, they are not into mental health as much as i am so they just dismiss it.

I can't go to a proffesional, i'm an uninsured 18 year old with no job, first trimester in university, in a country that values mental health as much as they value garbage and unhelpfull parents who, even tho i have given them every sign and once (only once have i been able to) tell them some of my problems and they did nothing (or made it worse).

Something else that bothers me about myself is the reaction to failure and rejection, whenever i feel any HINT of being ignored or rejected, even if it's not true or even close to the case, i start feeling horrible, want to cry, isolate myself, vomit and other many things, it also happens when i play card games and other competitive games and i do something dumb or slightly wrong, i feel like garbage and my mind always go to thinking everyone thinks i'm an idiot.

Sorry for being so all over the place, my mind is usually very scattered and i know it's a chore to read through",11Jan2020,1
56,"So I guess the biggest thing is that I always feel sad or I feel nothing. I feel like a bad human being. I've done pretty mean shit to those I've cared about. I've made up with a majority of these people and they tell me it's okay but I can't help but feel intensely guilty for it at moments. I also noticed that I tend to dismiss overly emotional moments (of both others and myself) as people being illogical because I tend to believe that making the objectively best decision is the best thing a person can do because I feel like it is related to my intelligence, which I believe to my only redeeming quality. This causes me to be emotionally unavailable which causes me to be a bad friend, significant other, etc. This causes me to hate myself even more, even though I know I acted objectively. I also have frequent panic attacks and frequent suicidal thoughts. 

I feel like I'm smarter than all of those around me due to my academic performance, my career, and my ability to be objective. But I also feel stupider since I look around at all these people who I think I am smarter than, but I cant feel happy like they are. I just dont wanna feel sad all the time anymore.

i have spoken to my mom briefly and she slightly dismissed it although not on purpose i don’t think. i don’t know what to do about this because i constantly just feel like i don’t have friends and feel exhausted by the end of the school day. i nap almost everyday after school because i am so exhausted even when igo to bed at 9 pm (i wake up around 6).

64,"tl;dr at end of post. i write dates in month/day/year bc im in texas, so mind that if you write dates differently. 

in mid 2013 i began to experience classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. late 2013 my grandfather, whom i was very close to, died. 

the various psychoses got worse, hallucinations, delusions, disconnection from reality. it wasn't pretty- i wasn't the goofy psychotic kid that everyone wanted in their friend group that said ""i see dead people XD"" i was the kid in the corner of the class that would cry, laugh, then cry again, then be sent to the nurse's office and writhe/scream on the cot as ""demons"" stood over me.

from early 2014 to later 2017 i was put on various meds that slowed down my metabolism and gave me minor seizures. they dulled me down, made me worse for wear, to say the least. 

then, in 2018, it stopped. i got off my meds. i started to be ""normal"" again. ""normal,"" as in no hallucinations, no delusions, etc. i was happy. im now, pretty much, a functioning adult. im 19, im healthy and strong enough to get a tattoo in a generally painful area, i can hold a job. 

12/26/19. my gender dysphoria (i am a trans male, pre-T, unable to obtain it) flares up and to this day is still at an extreme level of difficulty when it comes to dealing with it  

01/09/20. 1:15-ish pm. i'm waiting for a haircut. i see a drop fall from the ceiling of the parlor and fall into the ground, and the ground ripples as if it were water. 

01/09/20. sunset. i feel strong hands on my shoulders when there couldnt possibly be any. 

i have heard of depressive psychosis, but not the type that comes back the exact same way. the reason why i think this is... different than any other type of psychosis or illness ive seen is there are mismatches, inconsistencies. for example: meds didnt work. anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, etc etc never worked. the symptoms just... faded away on their own. that seems impossible. i also still have mild delusions on a monthly, sometimes weekly basis. it concerns me, especially since medicine doesn't work for me- it only worsens it. is this something to be concerned about, or am i overreacting and just need to reassess my situation?

tl;dr, i have an illness that seems to be a periodical psychotic depression, but acts differently and cannot be treated like psychotic depression. it seems like something to worry about, but it also seems like an overreaction on my part.",11Jan2020,1
65,"He is a kind hearted guy, 30, huge pot head, acid, mushrooms, dmt, all many many many times and a lot too. He is very smart and knowledgeable of certain religions and meditation but he can also be unstable and talks about suicide and death every once and awhile when things aren’t going well. Like some really dark stuff. I took him to Star Wars last time he was down on Xmas and he seemed happy. He has suspended license, as well as couple warrants possibly just to throw that in there. I hang out with him and talk about normal things with him but he’ll still start going off on rants about things I can’t follow. He’s interesting if you look at it with an open heart and mind but he often starts saying some wild things about religion/spirituality. He is also an excellent artist. He’s been posting an unusual amount of crazy stuff on Facebook and I’d like to know if he is dangerously mentally unstable and how I can help. Here’s an example:

“I have a hard time meeting people. 
Introducing myself as my birth name feels like introducing you to a mask. It's easier for people to relate to me as Michael but it feels fake.
Some people have a hard time pronouncing YHWH.. understandably so. Elohim is a little easier to pronounce.
Some people have alot of preexisting concepts or narratives that are sometimes challenging to navigate.
Some people have alot of expectations.
Some people try to use me.
Some people just renounce my existence or call me a fairy tale.
Some people are afraid that I exist.
Some people prefer I remain invisible.
Some people think of killing me.
Some people accuse me of trying to impose my beliefs on them, when in actuality they are trying to impose their belief onto me that I don't exist which is clearly wrong and abusive.
There's only one being in existence who shares the name of the father of creation YHWH and that is his son Yeshua, so when people speak of Jesus the Christ, they're speaking of me. 
The Tetragrammaton is the Y-H-W-H is the name. Some believe the name is to holy to speak and instead say HaShem, Adonai, or Elohim. I like El Shaddai. 
Some people pronounce it Jehovah, some people just say Jah. 
I pronounce my name YHWH Christos Elohim. It is important to me for reasons that are my own. It is important to others as well. It is mine, there is no other with that name, there is no other like me.
I remember hearing them sing my name at the powwow Hearing the drums pound as they chant my name. Tears are coming to my eyes.
Thanks for listening.”

67,"I’ve struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. I don’t remember what it’s like to wake up and actually want to be alive. I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was maybe 13  and then diagnosed with depression when I was 16. I do go to a mental health professional.

When I get into a depression episode (I don’t know what it’s called), I can go from thinking about something normal and I don’t know what it is but suddenly I’m thinking about really graphic violent things about myself and people always just tell me “oh think of something else” “go to your happy place” but the more I try to get my mind off of it the worse it gets and my mind will just obsess over it.

I’ve tried to think about and try and see how the original thought lead to the one involving me causing harm to myself. It just happens. My boyfriend gets mad because I can’t explain why I’m depressed because it’s random. 

I’m not trying to be an attention seeking dumbass but I don’t know what this is.",11Jan2020,1
68,"Maybe someone can point me in the right direction here. My friend who I’ve known for 5 years within the last 4 months has been going through we’ll call them episodes, where everything he does needs to be calculated. So numbers and colors impact his every decision. For example he mentions red/yellow/green a lot. More specially say we’re driving in a parking lot and he sees a red car we have to stop and park there because the red told him that he needed to stop. With numbers it’s really time related he needs to do everything in hour intervals/ couldn’t stay in one place longer than an hour. All of this he says is related to the secret service telling him what to do and he’s being “put to a test” along with him putting his phone in “airplane mode” to ensure he’s safe. It gets way deeper than that, but we’ll just start with those basics for now. Basically more of our friends are hearing the same stories when they are with him and he was admitted to two different mental hospitals, but has been released from both after a couple days. The first time he was arrested and taken their for evaluation as he was having “an episode” at the time,  the second his cousin and other family members had officers come get him and take him there.  Not having an educated diagnosis one may say this is closely comparable to some schizophrenic traits. Some other important info here may be that he had a stressful job and was forced to resign over attendance, despite having a doctors note for missed absence(this is his story not sure if anyone has officially confirmed this.) We believe this to be the “trigger” that started these episodes. 

So if anyone can I would just like to know a good place to start with getting him help beyond what they’ve already tried, what this could be, if anyone has had any similar experiences with someone they know, or if anyone can get me to a more specific place where I could find the right help.

I only using food delivery when my anxiety/depression are too much to handle even the most basic human interaction. I like that I can place my order and have food within the hour, without having to talk to anyone or struggle to get cleaned up. With this in mind, everytime I leave instructions for the drivers NOT to ring the bell and to just leave my food in the porch. 

Almost everytime they either ignore it, forget it, or they can't read in English well enough to understand my instructions. The only time they're successful is when I've messaged them multiple times especially right as they're pulling up.

These are not all new symptoms they have just become more defined and easier to spot.I have been sober from alcohol for 135 days at this point and as there were multiple reasons I kicked it, one of them was how frightened I would become after drinking a 6 pack of beer. I began to hear things that were extremely overwhelming, even started seeing things some nights. I carried on this way for awhile and noticed it was beginning to affect various portions of my life, so I stopped. I still had symptoms sober however much lighter. After a few weeks, I began to experiment with smoking a very small amount of marijuana a night to reduce anxiety, stress, and help me sleep. It worked for a few days. Then even at such small doses, I began to hear overwhElmont voices and even see things. My cat at one point mutated into a large rat, and a small boar. It spoke to me and told me to cut off my finger or it would hurt my family. I curled up in fear on my couch yelling at my cat for maybe an hour, and then the feelings subsided and I realized it wasn't real. So, I quit smoking marijuana. Now I hear voices occasionally sober mostly internal garbled that gets lost or I ignore and sometimes it's external and those always freak me out. Haven't had any crazy visuals sober, just basic distortions similar to what I assume someone with vertigo will see. I've been medicated for depression several yeas ago and seen shrinks, none of that ever seemed to help and I've just been coping by myself trying to get through long twelve hour work days, taking care of my kid, and keeping my wife happy.

After break up with my ex I attempted suicide and lost the little of friends I had because I emotionally abused them with suicide threats. And my ex got the most of it. I am visiting therapist and am on duloxetine. This year of school I got into alcohol and lost friends there and made myself even bigger weirdo among classmates who now know I have issues.

I have nightmares with my ex and my ex friends blaming me hating me... Even family. Also nightmares of not being adequate at my skill of piano playing and composition which I study at Academy. People frowning on me that I compose and play like shit.

I feel as if going full don't give a fuck and just messing with people. Being selfish to the full extent. And yet I care about well being of my now girlfriends mom who is a pure good natured soul having a shitty husband and loners life because to her surrounding she is boring and they ignore her out of family gatherings so I am happy to spend the weekend at my home with parents and she thanked us for finally resting from her mentally ill husband and I get that it was a fresh new routine out of her kitchen job in school and being only in her flat making food and cleaning.

When I feel like shit like now I just feel this thoughts of being fucked up. Like let it go... Release the beast in cage. I fantasise about decapitation my girlfriends head and throwing it in the bed where her mom sleeps and making it look like the father did it.

Or sending professors to go fuck themselves. Or emotionally manipulating my girlfriend to do some sick stuff for me. Or grope a stranger. Rape them... Post disturbing statuses and stuff on Facebook to scream for help.

I remember when I was little I abused our cat (just throwing small ball into her when I put her on bed then when she ran away I repeated it... But thankfully no gory torture with animals... I have a dog now and I love her very much)

I cried a lot in school and used the argument that my father, who at that time was aggressive drinker, will beat me and mother up... I woke up crying in boy scouts camp with whole camp around me concerned about what happened and I can't remember why I did so.

It feels as if I am loosing humanity. And if shit gets worse I will have nothing to loose and turn into one of those psychos on the street. Or a drunk... Or in jail.

Alcohol is ôk now.. I don't drink heavy. I started hobbies with astronomy studying celestial sky and drawing. Yet I still have these moods when it is like the ID is fighting with superego and Ego is slowly letting it slide.

This year when I got back to campus, I changed schedule. Now I'm up at 4am, I do a question or 2 on codewars, then shower, breakfast, and then either go to class or work on a personal project. 

What I realised was, I'm actually happier now. I am talking a lot more to my friends, drinking less and I even sent out a internship application earlier this week. 

What I think I'm saying is, much as we're told and educated about the signs, sometimes, they're so subtle you never realise till you are out of it, or if someone tells you. So always try to keep a journal, tacky  and played out as it sounds, it's what helped me come to the realisation I was legit out of it.",11Jan2020,1

79,"I have been severly depressed, insecure, anxious and also suffered from dp/dr for nearly 18 years. I never truly knew what stemmed such intense negative emotion for me until everything seemed to naturally fall into place.

I have a wonderful partner who allows me to be me. I have told him everything he could ever learn about me now, as a teen and as a child and he has listened and shared positive advice on how i can improve. Although it's a great help, i found most of it wouldn't stick with me nor would i actively try and improve myself.

When i was a child, for aslong as i remember, my dad would beat myself and my brother up. He would also be incredibly emotionally manipulative and abusive. Somehow for 18 years living together, he pitted my brother and i against eachother and we never spoke a word to one another. I assumed my brother was like my dad and hated me. I was scared of my father, saying the wrong thing would make him spin out of control but i will always remember being scared of him more as an adult despite the fact he couldn't beat me anymore. I feel i constantly disappointed him with everything i chose to do and believe and i would be in a vicious cycle of despising myself and feeling suicidal because if my own father can't stand me, i must be an awful waste of space.

After meeting my partner 2 years ago, my world didn't change straight away but i had never had such a positive person within my presence and i knew this could only be a good thing. For the first time, i had spouts of empowerment and contentment but when i would start to enjoy these feelings i would be reminded that my dad is bringing me down whenever i have to visit.

Around 6 months ago whilst feeling said empowerment, a huge surge of acceptance came over me. I penned a huge 5 page letter to my father. I told him exactly how he made me feel. I told him the very few memories i had as a child were when he was sat on my chest punching my face. I told him about conditions I've suffered with that stem from this abuse. I told him that I'm okay now. The only thing stopping me from happiness is that i still have him in my life.

My fathers response to this letter was simply ""you don't understand, when you're a parent youll know why you have to do the things i did"". This could've broke me but i chose to just accept he wouldn't change and in turn accept his faults and mistakes, and move on focusing on myself and how i can finally make use of this potentially beautiful life.
Its been 6 months now that he hasn't contacted me. Since then ive been in contact with my brother who weirdly suffers from the exact problems i do/have suffered from. We are close..ish now and I'm so whole knowing he is okay and living better.

For the first time in 26 years i feel happy. Content. Good about myself and all it took was to confront the negativity in my life.

Thankyou all for sharing your posts on here - they've helped me alot. I hope mine can help you too and never give up thinking one day, things can change.",11Jan2020,1
80,"I am 25 year old male from Saudi. I usually mostly do not approach people wether to start a friendship or not. In this case my friend who I am missing since 2017 because of a incident happened!




We were like brothers we go to the gym together care about each other. I share with him my struggles with mental illness which is I rarely do. He is one of the quietest people I've ever known and quiet the opposite. Before the incident which made the friendship is over I was having mood swings. 



After the gym session I went to the shower rooms at the gym and had shower unlike most of the days where I did it at home. I forgot a t-shirt. His roommate called in a way that is insulting and impolite! I went crazy driving from home to the dorms and I was exploding and yelling at him ""WHY ARE TALKING TO ME LIKE THIS! WHAT SORT OF ARAB ARE YOU""




After that we never talked to each other. Keep in mind that I didn't tell at my friend. But his roommate while there were there. 




I really miss him. I want to call him ( a normal phone call ). But I don't know what to say, tell. All I care is we be like we were before!

82,"Hi all.

I'm a 17 year old male, and I seem to have some problems. 

When I was younger, I played a lot of videogames. Whenever I lost an online match or a 1v1, I got SUPER angry and frustrated and was  in a bad mood for the rest of the day. I gradually stopped playing my favorite games because I was  afraid of losing. 

This translated into into real life. For example, whenever I get a test back with a score I'm not happy with I get angry and subconsciously put it in my folder and forget about it instead of focusing on improvement.  The best advice I was given was to  ""Just learn to lose"".

I don't want to be like this. I tried to change many times but my feelings always take over. I don't know if this is the right sub, but I desperately want to change. Any advice is appreciated.

87,"I wanna fucking know why mental health has such a bad rep. 
Your schizophrenic, you’re crazy. 
You have anxiety, your doomed. 
Your depressed, your fucked. 

Why? Maybe we’re just fucking people who see the world different. Maybe we feel deeply, see things for what they are, fear much because we’re sensitive. 

Maybe it’s beautiful. Maybe we shouldn’t be feared, avoided, or told to fucking fix ourselves. 

Maybe the answer isn’t years of untangling everything wrong with us. Maybe the answer is acceptance. Maybe accept we’re not like the rest. Accept we’re “fucked up.” Accept we make bad decisions. We fucking feel. DEEPLY. We’re fucking alive. In feeling dead I feel more fucking alive then the house wife who goes through life on auto pilot, or the man working his life away just to get through it. 

Maybe it’s not something we need to “fix.” Maybe it will take time to gain a new perspective. But maybe perfection isn’t what we should be chasing. Maybe seeing the beauty in life is seeing the ugly too.

Maybe this is fucking life. &amp; this is what it’s like to be fucking alive. 

You ever look around? Everyone in my generation (20s) is depressed or has anxiety or something. Everyone could be diagnosed with fucking something. What the fuck is society doing to us? Telling us there’s something wrong with us for feeling or not feeling? For being or not being? 

Yes mental illness is real. Yes yes yes. But stop fucking acting like it’s the end. It’s not something we need to hide. It’s called being alive. It’s being human. It’s being effected by the horrible things that happen in this world. &amp; we no longer have to be defined by it. 

We are all fucking valuable. We all have something to offer. Even if we spend 100 days unable to get out of bed. We all smile beautifully, even if it’s rare. We all have laughs that can melt hearts, even if they’re not heard often. We are life. &amp; we are fucking alive even when we don’t feel like it.",11Jan2020,1

89,"Hello guys!

It is my (F 23) first time talking about my own mental health with anyone, so I do not know where to start exactly.

A few friends of mine suffer from diagnosed mental health issues, so does my younger sister. That means I'm not completely new to the topic.

For about two years now I know I probably should get help, or at least talk to someone, but it is so hard to describe what is even going on with me. I don't know if I really need help. Even thinking of feeling bad makes me feel guilty because others have endured worse. Does that even makes sense?

My sister, she is ten years younger than me, attempted suicide December 2018, since then everything is even worse, she is doing better with each passing day (I'm so proud of her) but since then I'm even more afraid and feel guilty somehow. We were never really close though.  


I'm tired and exhausted all the time. Mentally and emotionally. Everything feels kind of dull?

I'm still able to do what needs to be done, studying (I'll graduate this year from university) and going to work. Maybe that is why it took me so long to talk to someone. You are okay, as long as you show up every day, aren't you? 

But well, that's it. Simple tasks like household are draining, don't to mention meeting friends. Meeting and interacting with other people is honestly the worst. I just don't have the energy to interact and stay focused long enough. I caught me even avoiding eye contact with people I don't know well. Don't want them to think I'm rude...

Sometimes there are phases in which I have a lot of energy and really get stuff done (usually when I have a structured timetable to do so) and feel good doing so but most of the time I'm just not and ultimately feel overwhelmed by what many tasks I have left to get done.

As most activities and feelings are draining I try to focus on things I either have to do no matter what (like going to university or work) or which keep me going but cost not a lot energy, like painting and being with my partner and our cats. But even then I just feel like I'm only giving 20 % of which I could give, at work or university for example, what really bothers me as I have so many goals I'd like to reach.  


**TL;DR: Well, I just want to know what is wrong with me. If anything is wrong with me at all... Where did you guys start to seek help? And how did you fight your fears to even start to seek help? That is the hardest part I guess.**

92,"Hello, I am wondering if these habits have anything to do with OCD or something else entirely. Some examples are ...

\- When I wave someone goodbye as they drive off in a vehicle, I MUST blow them a certain amount of kisses otherwise I feel they will be injured in a crash. (Its often 100+ when I feel satisfied)

\- Every droplet of water from the shower head must fall on me after I turn it off otherwise I feel my family will be injured/it determines how long they will be safe for.

\- Every night and throughout the day I constantly check power points, switches and locks to make sure they are off/locked. If I don't do this I can't sleep, and stay up worrying. Even if I have checked, I feel as if maybe I did't check properly and that something is still on/open. There is no certain amount of times I check things but I do it until it feels right. It is so time consuming.

\- I have little decorative lights in my room, they flash multiple colours. I feel I can't turn them off or the main light off when the decorative lights are red in colour. I feel if I do I will be injured while sleeping.

\- My hands feel infested with germs sometimes, I have to wash them with lots and lots of soap for a long time.  Sometimes my hands get dry and sore afterwards. Even when I haven't done anything to get any germs they just feel dirty at times.

I would love to get these habits sorted out at some point because they take up so much of my time.

93,"I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Dissociative Identity Disorder, an adjustment disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder (in remission). I suspect that I'm also autistic and, while I've never been formerly diagnosed, I seem to meet the criteria for an Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. I've spent a lot of time in therapy over the past 10 years, but resources are limited in my area and most practitioners have only heard of DID. My last therapist specialized in trauma disorders and had treated patients with DID before me, but I've yet to find anyone else whose understanding of DID is greater than mine. My biggest issue with this is that I can't trust my therapist to help me with DID-related issues if I also have to teach them about my disorder.

I don't have a \*lot\* going on in my life, at least not as much as I used to have, but I need someone to talk to. I work out my problems by talking about them, but my support network isn't big enough for the issues I need to discuss, which means I either over-burden my loved ones, stay quiet and let my mental health suffer. I tried journaling but I wind up uncovering memories that aren't ""mine"" and throwing myself into a flashback/anxiety attack often enough that I need a spotter if I'm gonna journal. I can't do research and work on stuff myself because I wind up triggering myself super hard and mess myself up for days, and I've tried online therapy too, but I was told my issues are too serious for the web-based platform and that I should find someone local.

On top of all of this, I'm going to lose my mom's health insurance when I turn 26 later this year and I can't afford to pay full-price for therapy. I have medicaid, but I'm worried that I won't be able to find a therapist who is experienced and trained enough to be helpful. I'm trying really, really hard to handle everything and I'm doing okay, for the most part, but I can't do it alone. I have a decent support network, but I can't rely on them for the really deep stuff.

I'm really scared. I've been trying to prepare for some big changes in my life and I don't feel ready. I'm scared that I'm going to screw everything up and accidentally hurt my loved ones. I can be so destructive without meaning to be or realizing that I am and I don't want to do that. I \*hate\* hurting the people I love and I'm not always in control of myself or my life and I'm really afraid that I'm going to keep hurting people and leave a legacy of pain wherever I go. I don't want to be this chaotic, destructive, thoughtless person. I can't keep my promises and I hate that, but I can't change it yet, either.

Anyway. If anyone has some advice on where I could get some help, that would be great. Thanks :)",11Jan2020,1

Skip to the bottom if you want coping mechanisms and advice, they aren't generic 'just exercise' types.

**My hell time:**

I have suffered from sexual, physical and verbal abuse along with bullying. I have ADD, borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety and severe dissociation (due to BPD). These issues completely ruined my academics (something that has always been my priority) and my relationships. My self harm got increasingly worse and I tried killing myself multiple times (luckily I backed out right at the last moment). I even secretly tried killing myself in my own fucking school (and was caught and that event traumatises me). I have been betrayed by the two I got attached to and actually let in. I found out that my ex emotionally cheated on me. In retrospect I think he genuinely has NPD. He emotionally abused me and made my mental health a thousand times worse. In a moment of weakness (my fault), I cheated on him. I confessed and he manipulated me and used me for fucking and emotional support after that because he wanted to 'make things work' and then insult the life out of me when he wasn't horny or sad. I can't explain the horrible ways he hurt me and lied to me (even before the cheating). I would cut myself while on call with him because he would be so inconsiderate about my emotions and just so so so condescending (in the subtlest ways possible). He gaslit me 24/7. My boyfriend before that treated me like absolute shit too and pressured me sexually and just so many things I'm too tired to list. And my past and even present consists of sexual assault etc. I have suicide notes stacked up in case I want to die. My best friend (who I sacrificed more things than you can imagine for) left me the minute she got a boyfriend because I was a burden. And just all my past trauma and mental illnesses couldn't handle all this. On top of that as an (ex) overachiever, unable to cope academically (as things got harder and I got sadder, I couldn't work at all - I couldn't work before also but i was less depressed etc. - I learnt I have ADD now) which made me even worse. My dreams got crushed and everyone left me and i was anyway in an awful state and I don't even have the guts to mention my most traumatic experiences here. i was genuinely banking on psychiatric euthanasia in Netherlands in a few years and my thighs have the deepest scars. I did so many impulsive things to try and fill my void and made my life a hundred times worse. I have had BPD and ADD and mild depression my entire life, but since 2018 it really really intensified. With college apps coming up and being an IB student so like extra pressure, I really didn't think I would make it alive. I saw 8 psychiatrists/therapists in just this past year and no matter how much I tried, nothing worked and I was convinced I was doomed. I had to leave a course I attended mid way because my mental health couldn't handle it. My dissociation got so bad it inhibited my functioning to a whole new level. I couldn't process sentences I was reading, even during my most critical exams. All the friends I made slowly left me for multiple reasons (sometimes I screwed it up because I am so bad at relationships). Aware of my addictive tendencies, I never touched alcohol in my life. This year, I was so sad that I drank and developed major alcohol dependency. Even now, when I'm low I try drinking in secret. I have tried to overdose (nothing really happened fortunately). I have severe dependency to some of my medication and it's not healthy at all. I was close to my seniors (the only place where i felt like I belonged), but they all went to universities abroad (IVIES). Assuming I'm still the 'smart girl', it is so painful to explain to them that i am going to some meh college most probably. I have let so many people down and my family is suffering so so so much because of me. People consider me to be this 'pretty, smart and great personality' but who is delusion-ed due to her mental illness. I feel undermined because of this because they think I have everything and no right to complain. While I understand that, why is everything so shitty for me? Why am I alone and barely passing? I even lost sense of my 'fun quirky whatever' personality, I couldn't talk about anything but depression and loneliness. Things were absolute hell for me. But no matter what, and despite trying to take my life multiple times, I never completely gave up, like I did about everything, but I continued my search for doctors, despite it being absolutely hopeless. i was scammed twice in fact. My family undermined and treated my illness as a joke for the longest time, same for my teachers. But again, I never completely gave up. And trust me, it really paid off.

&amp;#x200B;

**The effort and progress:**

After finally finding a psychiatrist and therapist that felt right, I continuously went to them. it was so sos os o hard, in fact i avoided going to them as much as I could. I didn't want help, I was used to being miserable. But over time, it got easier to go to them. It took a while for them to pick up on my BPD, I myself didn't know I had it, but it explained a lot. After months, they finally found the right medication for me (not completely, but mood stabilizers really changed my life). Then they found stuff to suit my dissociation etc. My therapist helped me too, it was subconscious, but it worked. After years of effort, I finally began feeling better. In fact, I am perhaps the loneliest right now and have more work load than I ever did before. I am seeing people get into all my dream universities. I am seeing everyone that betrayed me doing much better than me in life. I never thought that I could feel better with these circumstances, especially since I couldn't handle myself during easier times. It is a shock, I didn't even think I would make it alive. I feel independent and strong. Nothing worked out for me, nothing. But I am doing what I can with what I have you know? I finally have the energy to put in the effort. I don't cut myself (as much) anymore and am less dependent on substances. Genuinely, everything is hell right now, but fuck I feel good (most of the times). Yes, I still have crying spells and breakdowns, especially at night when I'm alone, but I  cope with it much better now. I don't let my mental health dictate how much work I do, in fact my work improves my mental health. Of course, I have fall backs, but everything is much better. When my razors were confiscated, I banged on my mirror to break it and cut myself. I don't do that anymore. I am able to fall in love with learning again, bit by bit. I never ever ever thought i would reach this point. Ever. I felt so jealous and irritated by success stories because they felt like bullshit and I never thought I could ever ever ever write one. But now, I feel the urge to, because now I don't have good moments that fade away and I feel like shit in thirty seconds. I actually feel better overall. I understand if this doesn't give you hope, but i promise you, it gets better. Like genuinely, it does. My life is objectively more hell than it was before, but I am still doing better. I really hope that someone feels some hope through this, anyone. 

**Preachy:**

I have learnt and grown so much, I had the shittiest preadolescence and well life. People feel confused about how I am still alive with everything I went through. I haven't even shared everything here or to them. So please understand, it can get better. I don't mean to say that I had it worst because that isn't true. But I really felt like I did and felt like there was no way out and tried to get out of this life etc etc And here i am. I just wish I could convince people who are still going through hell that it actually gets better. I understand how you feel, but keep going. I would love to tell you guys some of my coping mechanisms that might actually help.

**Advice:**

\- If you're at rock bottom, give up on everything if you can't handle it, but don't give up on finding psychiatric help or therapy. Literally, ditch studies, friends, jobs, everything, but find whatever way you can to get help. I can't say don't self harm or 'exercise' because that stuff is hard. I can't say reach out to friends or fake it till you make it or try to work no matter what it will help. I understand that stuff is impossible, even fucking waking up each morning is. But just fight for one thing. One thing. Help. And if your gut feels wrong about the help you are receiving give it just a little bit of time because sometimes you can be wrong, but after that certain amount of time bounce and KEEP LOOKING. No matter what, keep looking. If you have money restrictions or anything, use online help or helplines or find some lowkey way to get help. ANYTHING. Just find a way. There always is one. Contact me if needed. Don't waste energy on anything but getting help. Please. 

\- Identify your weird tendencies and habits. Everyone has a few random things that distract them or sort of help them. I obsessively make playlists. I feel much better when I am cleaning my room. Watching TV shows that i have seen before really help me. Sometimes, I want to clean my room but don't have the energy to and being alone with my thoughts terrifies me. So I watch television while cleaning it up to kind of stay distracted and when my room is clean i feel somewhat accomplished and my head feels clear. Another thing that works for me is putting on makeup. It takes a lot of energy for me. But when I start it really helps. Looking good makes you feel good yk. 

**To get up in the morning:**

\- So hopefully you find some random tendency. Even something you used to like. Even lighting a candle or ordering something from Amazon or listening to one song counts. Anything. Writing poems. So make chits with all these little things. Mini steps. Reading a chapter of a book or making a mug cake for yourself that takes 15 minutes. If looking good helps you but you don't have energy, keep makeup removing products right next to you and cleanse your face when you get up so you don't really wash your face and you get up and put on your makeup. 

Now all these tendencies you have, and things that you may not normally do but could maybe enjoy (for me it's making a mug cake), make chits for all of them. Put them in a box or jar and when you can't get up in the morning because life sucks, pick one out and trust me, if it is a small task you will have the energy to do it. Trust me. Use this box during depression episodes also. 

Because my self harm addiction was so bad, I knew that I would ditch these chits and instead jump to the razor. I decided to add a chit for self harm in my box so that i know I have the option and am less likely to just harm myself. Trust me, this works. And over time your brain gets conditioned to do one of these stupid distraction thingies when you are upset. It is a slow process but very very very worth it. 

**If you can't deal with your thoughts and don't have the energy to work (especially at night):**

\- AUDIOBOOKS. I often can't get myself to read or even watch TV and open my eyes, but silence and even music make me sad. I listen to audiobooks as I try to sleep so I am somewhat distracted but am also relaxing and will be able to sleep. Melatonin pills etc. may also genuinely help. 

\- When I am really sad I have this notebook, I doodle my emotions on it. Like I will draw myself at the edge of a cliff and all the things that haunt me would be written on the cliff, pushing me. It is stupid but it helps.

**FIND YOUR SAFE PLACE**

I feel safe at this specific cafe near my house and this corner in my room. I don't know why, but it just helps me.

**Remember oddly specific and very very tiny accomplishments (or big ones) and compliments you have received**

Maybe pen them down or list them somewhere. When you are in a less awful mood, you can remember random SPECIFIC compliments you have received or unexpected accomplishments you have achieved (it could be the stupidest thing). Make them as specific as you can so it is harder to discredit the good things. When you are hating yourself or feel completely demotivated or are stressed, go over these. They genuinely can help. 

**Give yourself time, and give up sometimes. It is OK. I understand. But remember to not compromise with HUGE deadlines etc. But otherwise, give up sometimes. Let yourself mourn. But again, not always.**

100,"Long time reader first time poster here. Long story short I started taking 10 mg of Paxil in July. It immediately became impossible to ejaculate, my libido was non-existent, and maintaining an erection difficult. I called my doctor and she suggested taking 5 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the evening and assured me that the side effects would go away. My libido improved slightly, erections slightly, but it still takes forever to ejaculate.

I went back to the doctor this past week and told her about what was happening and her response was ""These problems started when you started taking Paxil?"" I responded, ""Yes"". To which, her response was ""Really? Really though?"" While I'm not going to act like I've never had a hard time getting it up due to stress or anxiety from time to time, I never had difficulties ejaculating or wanting sex. Anyway I immediately went home and made an appt with a new doctor.

Before I left she said she was thinking about prescribing me Wellbutrin to deal with moderate depression and alleviate the sexual side effects and would call me to let me know. Instead I got a text from my pharmacy saying my prescription was ready to pick up.

It's 75 mg. Does anybody have any experience taking Wellbutrin to help with sexual side effects? How much do you take?",11Jan2020,1
101,"Hi everyone. I'm a complete mess so be gentle. I want to post this in r/relationship advice but I won't get what I need there.
 My boyfriend and I have a strong bond, we've been together for over a year, lived together for 6 months and things are great aside from a few fights in the past. Things have been great since we had a huge talk a few months back, until last night. 
Lately my boyfriend has been talking about other women he's been with, for whatever reason. Maybe he feels this is 'payback' for me sharing my sexual abuse stories, since they have resurfaced since going to the OBGYN.  I asked him to stop mid-conversation because I was getting uncomfortable and self conscious. And he flipped out. He started hitting himself in the head, screaming at me, even started crying. 
I told him the way he has been making me feel as if late between telling me about his past relationships in detail, and not giving me enough attention. I know that sounds needy, and I'm usually not needy, but I have been in a depression pit. I simply stated that I felt taken for granted and he flipped. He told me I was selfish, and being irrational, and then he GRABBED me by my FACE and shook me. This isn't the first time he has put his hands on me, and this is where I drew the line. I told him if he touched me again I would be gone. And this is where he started crying and just laid down.
 Now... This isn't an excuse but my boyfriend had a lot of untreated mental health. Including bipolar disorder and minor split personality disorder. Because of this, he often does things that make me heavily sorrowful snd doesn't apologize because he feels he wasn't in the wrong. 
Because of all of the nasty things he said to me, I locked myself in the bathroom and 'relapsed' self harm. I cleaned myself up and went to bed. 
Today, early in the morning he was in the shower. So as usual I wake up, come into the bathroom and hand him his toothbrush. He said he was still upset by things I said, and I was still hurt that he nearly got physical with me. He started crying... Again. I felt bad so I hopped in the shower with him and held him. He was very numb, and got out and laid down. 
To this very minute, he has not spoken to me let alone made eye contact with me. Instead, when I go into the bathroom to isolate myself he argues with me over text. He's always done this and it is infuriating to me! 
I tried to talk it out to get some weight off our shoulders but he just shrugs and shakes his head, or gets mad and makes me cry. He has a history of dragging stuff out for longer than it should be. How can I feel better about this? Do I talk to him or let him be? I can't even be in the same room because the tension is so high. 

TLTR; My boyfriend is being over dramatic because I told him how I felt about him talking about his past partners after I've been venting about my sexual abuse history. He won't talk to me in person but will argue with me over text so I can't get my point across. He never apologized for saying awful things to me, and getting physical while we fought. What do I do?",11Jan2020,1

OKAY! So here goes my first post on reddit ever. I apologize that’s it’s long but after what happened this morning I feel jumbled &amp; confused.

I work in the office of a Canadian high school. My title is Secondary Administrative Office Assistant, I work 8-4pm Monday - Friday each week. 

I worked my ass off to get here as I needed Insurance Benefits beyond basic Canadian coverage. I’m 25, I rent a garden home with my partner of almost 2 years, we have a dog, our own cars, no debt.. overall doing well.

On paper I see my Accomplishments but in reality I’m disqualifying the positive. I believe I’m a failure, a waste of space, that I’m not good enough, stupid, fat, ugly,  my partner deserves better, that my friends &amp; family deserve better, that I’m causing problems to everyone in my life so I should just give up and hermit in my basement where I can’t hurt people.

I’ve had some awful things go down in my life, but I still see it all as a crutch. That I should be better than this, that I’m not doing enough, trying hard enough, that I don’t want to be another “snowflake” as boomers would call it. 

My work environment has been terrible. I’m treated as a student by some of my coworkers and have one coworker in particular who not only has a position of power and extremely well liked, but has been isolating me with her power.

Having worked at a few schools where I felt safe, comfortable, respected, etc. I know this isn’t right.. but after doing everything in my power (EXCEPT going to HR) I feel like I should give up &amp; move schools. 

If I got HR involved I doubt I would be believed, I’d be blamed for HR Reps crawling around the school, and not to mention based on my location they would be close enough to drop in and out at random... my Principal doesn’t want that and she retires at the end of the year anyway so why would she care? 

The students at the school see me as an Authority figure to a certain degree, but it’s very obvious there is an unhealthy dynamic in the office. I’m portrayed as “useless” as this coworker will “correct” me while I’m speaking to students, staff &amp; parents alike. 

I’ve been getting help from a Psychologist fairly regularly. We have been practicing cognitive behavioural therapy since we met in September 2019. After speaking about many incidents he is assuring me that this is NOT in my head but this woman is attempting to make me question my sanity using gaslighting techniques in hopes of me quitting.

Outside of my work life I have family who I knows loves &amp; cares about me but also thinks I’m crazy. My relationship with my mother is particularly fucked up but that’s a story for another time. I have 2 amazing best friends who have been in my life since I was 4.. Although our relationships have been rocky growing up they have come to be a huge support. My partner is very understanding as well and loves me to pieces (I think). 

I have trust issues, so I’m scared to rely on them. During my happy times I know I can lean on them.. but during an episode I feel I can’t, shouldn’t, and need to deal with it myself.

Recently I have had 2 incidents I’ve never experienced before. 

The first was I had a nightmare that I don’t quite remember something about sexual assault and murder. I was running and swimming for my life.. but I woke up screaming in my sleep. My Partner had put his arm around me while I was asleep. This is something he does often as it’s normally a safe comfort for me. He does it in his sleep too. But for whatever reason I was terrified for my life and woke up screaming in fear this time. I scared him, I felt awful but I know it’s out of my control.

The second incident happened this morning.. this is what sparked this long piece of writing.

I had a nightmare full of my own personal insecurities and people I know. In the dream it was the morning after a party in some house I’d never seen. It was a total mess, covered garbage, my personal items &amp; sleeping family/friends laying around. I didn’t have my morning pills with me, I couldn’t find my phone in the mess, the lights didn’t work, my Trazodone was missing, my bong broken, my car keys missing &amp; feeling the emotional build up taking over. 

My brother and childhood best friend telling me to “calm down”. The scariest part was when I was screaming at my childhood best friend to “SHUT UP! LEAVE ME ALONE!” I was a monster.

Turns out in real life my body was a rock, unable to move. I screamed those words out loud in my sleep. The anxiety, anger, fear, &amp; irrational sadness coursing through my veins when I finally realized where I was.. safely in my bed with my partner. My partner who I didn’t know had just been yelled at by me.

Groggy, angry, and unhinging my jaw I went to bathroom. I came back and the emotions hadn’t died down. I was a mess, I couldn’t even be touched I was so jumpy. When my partner told me I screamed at him I realized what I had done. I went from this anger to guilt, shame, sadness that I hurt him. Suddenly my thoughts were changing to I’m crazy, useless, a failure and all those awful feelings I get when I snowball out of control.

I took my morning pills, and needed space. I apologized to my partner over and over but he insisted he’s okay and is here for me. He held me before I walked to another room to work through what just happened. 

I feel trapped, crazy, &amp; a sorry excuse for a girlfriend. As the meds have finally kicked in I’m now cuddling my dog and getting back on track for the day.

I needed to vent, and as some who has never posted on reddit before I’m extremely nervous from the reactions I’ll get.

Please be nice? I’m sick of feeling so broken.",11Jan2020,1

110,"TL;DR - Exactly the title

My parents brought me to see a therapist as a child/preteen (I don't remember the exact age) and it turned me away from ever seeking help. They would regularly try to ""help me"" with the homework, dismiss things I said when they were brought on sessions, and get mad at me for things I said, while actively dismissing any advice from the actual therapist as her ""trying to change me"".

I'm in my early twenties now and unlearning a lot of my own toxic behaviors, while working on coping mechanisms, strategies, as well as the support system I never really had growing up. However, I can't bring myself to seek professional help. Along with my one, subpar, session with university mental health, this previous experience has just totally turned me away from therapy.

In current day -
Both my parents are slowly coming to the conclusion that they have some issues to work out, and are independently seeking professional help. My mother recently took time off work for her anxiety and is seeing a therapist as well.

Here's where it gets dicey though: she's using everything she learns in therapy to call me out.

- My place is a mess: ""Oh, you must be so depressed and overworked. Clean it up""

- Grinding my nails: ""See, you're anxious. Stop that""

So on and so forth...

She isn't offering any solutions or anything, just noticing and pointing out what I do. I've told her I don't need them pointed out because I know why and when I do it, but it comes up every single time we spend time together. I think there was one single day over the holidays that she didn't tell me to get a therapist either.

I get this is more of a rant than anything, but am I the asshole, and just don't see it? Is there anything I can do here?",11Jan2020,1

She deserves so much better, I told her that maybe she should stop hanging out with me &amp; spend more time with them, I’m not going to try to defend me or try to bite back, it’s not worth the waste of time &amp; energy. I wish we can just all get along, instead of fighting of who spends time with who, it’s stupid &amp; childish, worst of all the person that told her this I thought we were friends. I know this is eye-rolling situation, but I’m trying to just be happy instead of depressed, I’ve been though a lot the past months, I thought I was all good, why this all of a sudden?

114," trigger warning to victims of childhood sexual abuse &amp;  suicide. This is going to be a sort of long post. 
Way back into my childhood, I became a victim of sexual abuse by someone I was supposed to trust dearly. My grandfather. It went on for 6 years, my family ran an at home daycare. News broke about this as he was doing the same to children in the daycare, one child told her mother, she then called the police, my grandfather saw the police pull up, the proceeded to go into the house, and take his life. Throughout the abuse he always told me if I told anyone, he would do it. He always said he’d rather be gone than have to deal with what the people in jail would do to him. And how if I told someone, the family would blame me for causing his death. Shortly after his passing, is when my mother asked me if it was true. Which I then told her, because at that point as a child I felt as though I couldn’t hurt anyone if he was already gone. My fathers side of the family (it was my paternal grandfather) then talked on the local news about it. Stating he was a kind man, would never do such a thing, etc. to this day, I am 21. That side of the family believes i was lying to get attention. Even though I wasn’t even the one to come forward in the beginning because of the manipulation. Even my father suspected I was doing it for the attention. It effected my mother the most, she had already struggled with depression and suicidal tendencies. The rest of the years growing up... I went to therapy rarely. Didn’t get the help I needed, watched my mother beaten, verbally abused, and cheated on by my step father. She tried to commit suicide more times than I could count, she overdosed twice on prescription pain killers. Held a knife to her throat while my step father held her down, and told my sibling and I to come watch in hopes my mom would calm down. 
She then was committed to the hospital 3 times. She had seen 4 different psychiatrists and was finally diagnosed with obvious depression, PTSD (from MY situation), BPD, Bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety, the list goes on. I hold a bit of hate in my heart for never being evaluated. 
Flash forward to a month ago. My life was good, I was managing my mental health with no prescriptions (I’ve never been to a psychiatrist). One day, I was at my wits end. I came home, and my step father immediately copped an attitude with me. To which I left the room and took my 2 yearold with me. I continued mumbling under my breath, and bitched. He went into my moms room, started slamming doors, and my mom busted in my room asking me why I was being such a bitch. One thing led to another, I pushed my step father away from me because he was screaming in my face, and was terrifying my daughter. He then proceeded to grab me, and throw me into the wall. I hit my daughter on the way down. Once I realized i had hit my child, I had tunnel vision. I went full force, I was punching him, he grabbed me again, slammed me as hard as he could on the tile floor in the hallway, I’m 140 pounds, and my tailbone shattered a square tile. He held me down, and choked me until I couldn’t breathe. My mother sat there and didn’t say a word the entire time. I ended up scratching at his eyes in order for him to get off of me. I got up, disoriented, and told him he was lucky my fiancé wasn’t there (he’s a truck driver) and I told him he’s lucky I didn’t call the police. To which he did, the police showed up, I was calm at that point. I ended up getting arrested, me, because the police deemed me being the aggressor. I’m now being ordered by the court to get a mental health evaluation. CPS, got involved. They have closed it, realizing I’m not a piece of shit mother. 
I struggle with BPD tendencies, obvious depression, and anxiety. I’m nervous about this evaluation. I really am. Can I bring up the fact that this is the shit I’ve been through? Plus mention my mothers diagnosed disorders? Can I tell them I believe I have BPD? What happens in a mental health eval? 
I’m so sorry for the long post. I’ve never written it all out. This isn’t even half of what I’ve been through and I’m literally in tears as I write this.
Thank you, everyone for adding and/or giving me advice/input.",11Jan2020,1

My life used to revolve around watching movies and TV. I love film. I would consider myself a film buff. Now that I'm finally feeling better I'd like to catch up on all the wonderful media I've missed out on, but I can't. It is extraordinarily difficult to watch anything I've never seen before, and most of the time I find it difficult to try and watch something in the first place.

120,"I'm in such a dark place mentally right now and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't even know where to start or how I should type this so sorry if this is all over the place. 

I just feel like I've fucked myself up permanently due to my stupidity/low intelligence. All I've done for the past seven years is waste precious time playing video games and ignoring the rest of the world around me. I ended up dropping out of school because of this. I have no social skills, no talents, no skills, relationships, nothing all due to my incompetence. 

· Failed 7th grade because of my gaming addiction. I never studied/did homework. I went to court for truancy because I skipped school so many days.

· Ended up dropping out 9th grade with no good reason other than to play video games all day. One of my biggest regrets.

· Never bothered trying to get my GED because I thought I was too dumb and didn't want to embarass myself

· Despite dropping out never tried getting a job out of fear. Never been employed. 

· Completely isolated myself from friends and family for years because of self-hatred, shame, anxiety, and guilt.

I feel like if I had figured out earlier in life that I wasn't intelligent I could have compensated for it by building up other strengths, skills, etc. I feel like I could have actually done something with my life if I had known sooner.

I'm 19 years old and I feel like I'm fucked up beyond repair. I wasted the best years of my life doing absolutely nothing. All this time I should've spent creating amazing memories, friendships, and experiencing the world and learning who I was and wanted to do with my life was all wasted. And all I'm left with is regret. It's almost like I've been on auto-pilot the past 9 years and I'm trying extremely hard to wake up. But waking up means acknowledging and accepting that I've wasted all this time. I try to move on but it's so fucking hard. I feel stuck like there is no way out of this chaos. And it's all my fault.",11Jan2020,1
121,"I can’t leave the house because I’m terrified of people. I’m alone and I can’t stand it but won’t change it because I can’t function around people and value myself so little that I feel I’d be of no value to anyone.

I haven’t worked for nearly 2 years now since I left a good job and told everyone I know that it was because I was moving to another city. In reality I quit because I couldn’t take another day of standing in the bathroom having panic attack after panic attack. Panic attacks triggered by the most mundane things, helping a new starter, taking a delivery etc. 

I’ve lost so many years of my life to social anxiety and now I don’t feel human. Missing out on so many things and being so far behind ‘normal’ people in all aspects of life has left me with no self confidence so I lay in bed and cry. Trying to get help leaves me with no answers but new questions and often a prescription for sertraline. If I’m required to leave the house and can’t find an excuse to escape it I’ll spend every second sweating and panicking, worrying that everyone around me is looking at me and judging any movement, sound or action I make even though I know deep down that they’re not. 

Not talking to anyone means everything stays in my head and it’s becoming too much. This all started around 6 years ago and the last 3 have been the worst. The knock-on effects have left me depressed and recently I began hearing voices, talking to myself, increasing suicidal thoughts. I genuinely hate myself and have done for a long time but I want to be happy and just live in some level of normality. 

Making this post is tough because I feel wrong for spilling this anonymously online but all I’ve tried has failed and I don’t know who I can trust for help. Experiences with doctors have been confusing, almost feels like they don’t believe me or don’t understand and think a prescription will fix this. So I’m asking here: what can I do? What small steps can I take to get better?",11Jan2020,1
122,"I felt okay for a while, off of the meds. I had hope, goals and focus. When I realized that it’ll be impossible for me to escape my mothers grasp and develop autonomy, I decided to take my antidepressant as it is easier to remain compliant this way. I want to break shit, scream my fucking lungs out, bleed all over her fucking beloved bullshit piece of shit environment she calls a home but that’ll just push me further back into her grip. From the outside, she is wonderful, perfect and popular. Hell, I can even convince myself that when I’m extremely medicated. I was never given a chance to make my own choices and grow as a human being. I’ve been on all the meds, ECT, the works. I now just have a fried brain and am dependant on others. There is no way out, suicide is not an option as I am too closely watched and penned in for it to work.

123,"Hello everyone, the last two years have been the absolute worst years of my life. My overall mental has declined. What does this sound like to you? 

•One major panic attack in 2017 triggered this decline in my mental health. I had a very bad drug experience smoking weed and had to be admitted to the hospital because I thought I was dying. 

•Constant fear that what I smoked was laced. Fear that the weed did permanent brain damage to me. 

•My overall mood is up and down. I tend to become very angry at my mother and father and last out at them.

•Complete lack of motivation. I am an artist and now I rarely feel like working on any projects. At my job I feel like making through each shift is a challenge. 

•Was consumes for months (if not a full year) that I am schizophrenic. My doctor told me that I was not...but I couldn’t rationalize this in my brain. 

•Constant scary existential thoughts about the nature of being a human. Almost as if I am scared to exist. 

•Feeling frequently disconnected from my life as if I am going through the motions 

• Constantly questioning my sexuality. Grew up in a very conservative house hold. I think I am gay but believe I will never be able to fully accept this aspect of my life. 

•Needing constant validation from others. I am convinced that I am ugly and overweight. When I look in the mirror I just think how disgusting I am. 

•Fear of being  narcissistic and or psychotic. Although everyone around me says that I am not...I can’t believe this. 

•Sometimes when I go out into public I feel like everyone is judging me and thinking that I am ugly, weird, and for some reason poor. 

•Think that most people hate me and do not enjoy my company

126,"The last few months have been nothing but hell. I'm stuck someplace where literally every thing is my fault, I'm pretty sure my fiance hates me, I work a shit job, I can't do anything without being questioned or told off. Any ideas I come up with are ridiculed and made fun of. I'm not sure how much more I can take.

Back story: a few months back, November I think, my fiance and I lost our apartment due to a meth head saying bullshit that never happened, and we moved in with her parents. I'm grateful that they allowed us to do that, especially considering my fiance is pregnant. But her mother truly despises me, and for good reason, so I don't blame her for that. I've tried to be respectful and do has I am asked here, but it really doesn't matter due to the hate they have for me. I'd rather not get into it, but I should. Six years ago, when my fiance and I lived together in the city, I had severe anger control issues. Like bad. To the point of abusive towards her. So I get the hate, and do deserve it. But it's gone too far. Since we've been here my fiance and I's relationship is beyond strained. Alot of it is hormones, but there's quite a bit that is her mom getting in her head to go against me. At this point I'm not even sure she loves me anymore...that alone makes me suicidal. I'm already diagnosed has bipolar, but who the hell knows? I've been misdiagnosed before a few times.

I'm not sure how to continue pushing through this hell. I've bitched and ranted about this situation before, but of course people just basically called me whiny and that I'm just ungrateful. You try living in a house where everyone fucking hates you. Try it and then tell me you want to continue living. Try and always be wrong, even when your right. Try and breathe and just be content when no matter what, your the blame. You try it. And then when you try to talk, be cut off and told that your issues aren't valid and your just being a baby. Try not to eat a bullet after two straight months of being completely broken down. 

I have nothing for support in the city I live in. I moved here to be with my family, but now my family doesn't want me. I can't stop thinking about just ending it all. Maybe they would be better off without me. I know I need help. And I know if I don't get it, I won't be able to avoid the one horrible option that keeps coming. I have appointments next week with my psychiatrist and my therapist. But I don't even think at this point that will help. I keep feeling like nothing will. 

I'm unhealthy. My brain is fried. I'm depressed and spiraling deeper into the depths. And not one person gives a damn about it. If I died, they'd all be happier. Everyone would. Because I'm awful. I'm a fucking monster. And monsters don't need to be saved. They can't be. Apparently we can't change. And everybody just knows what's best. And fuck it seems viable. Everybody knows everything. Except for the monster.

127,"The only reason I started lying was because I refuse to gossip or talk about other people, not interested in tv or music, I don’t bother with things people my age like since I grew up like an adult so it all just seems so dumb. I don’t even like keeping up with the wether.

People always are attracted to me at first but whenever they ask me stuff a normal 14yo would know like something with a celebrity or a tv show, I have to answer with “I don’t like tv” or “who?”

I’m not boring. I’m 14 and have enough experience to be a grandparent. 

I started telling my memories of things I’ve done but I could tell none of them believed me. I’ve always felt like no body would listen to me so I’d have to change the story so it would relate to a 14yo.

  I feel like the more I try to change myself so others would like me the more distant they become. I feel fake and unwanted. Like I should just stop talking and let people just look at me since my looks are all I have to contribute.

130,"20 F. Today I went in to take my road test through my driving school. It was easy the test however due to my anxiety I made some mistakes that caused me to fail. The person grading me also had given me an attitude.

First he wrote that I was driving with my emergency brake on (also called an e-brake). 
When I went to begin my test, the e-brake would not move, I believe this was so because the dmv officer’s foot was on the brake making it hard to pull it down. The dmv officer then pulled it down and afterwards I put it back up, then down to demonstrate I can do it. 

Second he wrote that I didn’t stop at a stop sign. As I was approaching the stop sign, I stopped and then I looked both ways, slowly making my way up and moved, I also had my signal on and went in the direction the DMV officer told me to go to.

There was people from two driving schools today, 4 people including me with my school and 5 people with the other school. Everyone but 3 people failed the test. I live in the corrupt State of Massachusetts, and its known that the Massachusetts DMV will purposely fail people in order for them to make more money. 

I couldn’t get my license before due to not having good luck with driving schools before and going to college. I also had really bad driving anxiety which I have overcame for the most part. I cried when I failed and at least the people there in the waiting room understood.  I really feel let down and I could use some encouragement.",11Jan2020,1

132,"So, I'm trying to make things work with my ex gf. She said she left me because I was toxic. Well I was. I really was.

I do this thing where I get so wrapped up in my own problems and anxiety that I don't think about other people. I don't think about how they might be feeling. I don't consider the timing of it. I just dump all my feelings onto these people, typically my significant other, and then I feel better temporarily until the next episode happens. 

I basically use them as an emotional punching bag, and it sucks. I'm tired of being this way, and they're tired of dealing with it. It's why all of them have left me.

Well, I want to try to get better, and to make this work with her. But I'm slipping. Old habits die hard. I'm already doing it, taking my frustration of this situation out on her cause she opened up the channels of communication, and well she pointed it out to me.

133,"I live in the United states and i’m a senior in high school. I pretty much have everything I could ever want. I have a gf, some friends, and i’ve got into a couple colleges, but i still don’t know why i feel so alone and worthless.

Recently, this feeling has gotten a lot worse and I don’t know who I should talk to about it. Lately, it’s felt like i’m an annoyance to most of my friends as I am always disregarded or flamed for stating anything in a conversation. Some of my friends are somewhat nice when we are in the friend group, but when i’m alone with them, they treat me like i’m a stranger. My gf has also been talking to me less and it might be because she is busy. But recently, whenever i would text her, she will leave me on delivered for hours on end and I will see her activity in a group chat that I have with some other friends. I feel selfish for feeling like this since i might be asking for too much from her. I also feel this because a lot of people have it much worse than me, so it feels like I’m just weak if i can’t handle problems as small as these. 

I thought about talking to my parents, but they seem a bit too busy with my other siblings. My sister recently had a benign breast tumor taken out as well as some problems with school , so most of my parents focus has been on her. My parents are also very focused on my brother as he is struggling with focusing on his classes. This once again makes me feel selfish for worrying about my problems as they seem a lot more minuscule than theirs. My parents are already under so much stress whether it is with each other, or my siblings, so I rlly don’t want to worry them more. 

I thought about going to my gf for help, but I also feel like she is very busy and I hate to be the type of person to take away from someone’s time. I also don’t want to be a high maintenance boyfriend who tells her all of her problems, because I feel like that would stress her out.

It feels like I have no one to turn to now and I have no idea where to go from here. I hate to talk about things like this with anyone because I don’t want people to think that this is a cry for attention. I just want to fit in and be normal like everyone else. 

This past week, it has gotten so hard to cope with my feelings while also trying to stay positive at school so that i don’t need to have people worrying about me, but it kills me inside that I don’t feel like I could ever tell anyone this.

If someone could maybe give me some advice on what I can do from here, it would mean a lot.

I have a friend who recently reached out to me. We haven't spoken in 6 years until today. I woke up to a string of messages out of nowhere claiming he was responsible for all these successful movies. He claims he gave the screenplays away for free to the studios and directors who made them. Huge movies like avengers endgame and ghost Rider. Really worrisome because he seemed serious, like he genuinely believed he was responsible for making these movies. I didn't know what to say so I just asked him how he'd been and avoided all his claims.

However, I only sometimes think that. It’s pretty much always when I’m tired and night or early morning and almost never during the day, even when I’m with him. Whenever I get tired it’s just like my brain completely flips in its opinions and actions. I’m certain I don’t like him, but I’ve always wondered if I just say I don’t like him because nothing could happen since he’s completely straight, but in the evening that mental barrier just kinda breaks cause I’m tired or it’s just me playing the same torturous trick on myself every day for over a year?

First of all, I am 17 and a junior in high school. By like all standards my life is going tremendous: my family is upper-middle class, I'm in a loving family situation, I (easily) have a 4.0 GPA at an honors high school and got 1580+ SAT recently, my social life is pretty dec., I just finished a pretty decent relationship that made me happy but I'm happy I'm done with, and I am super passionate about my extra-curriculars, etc. etc.. I think I look like a really happy, carefree dude to other people. Not trying to humblebrag or some shit, but just trying to get the point across I have nothing rational to be upset about.

Anyways, I am still active in life, and that's kinda my outlet. Whenever I'm doing anything (legit fucking anything) I'm super happy, playing sports, doing homework or even in class etc I'm fine. Sometimes I'll just fucking crash for like 7 hours and not be able to do anything after school, but usually I'm pretty good.

But anyways, when I'm not \*doing\* anything actively (which is pretty rare for me; I'm a busy guy) I'm super super depressed. I really really hate life and frankly want it to be over immediately. I really want to just fucking sleep for 50 years. This is a pretty constant feeling, I haven't had a day without hating life in my downtime for over a year. Blasting music into my head is pretty much the only thing that keeps me sane.

Pretty periodic, deep depression and failing everything or I had lucky as fuck and was happy no matter what until some fucking detail thrown me down again. Sometimes dep. wasn't so bad sometimes it was worse than normally, from time to time I was stabile for longer time or numb for a while. In beginnig of summer it gets much better, I was more happy than depressed for the first time after almost 2 years. But after some time I begin to feel empty and numb. Not like the depressed numb more like the feel: something's wrong here, something's missing. For past 4 months I haven't been really happy or sad. Only thing that's intense now is anxiety that is like when there's something  I am anxious about I just don't do that and go somewhere where I will be alone. The depression rate is rising, but is still bearable. For past 2-3 months I have problems with sleeping, I watch tv till early morning or I am waking up x times a night. Also my memory is useless lately I read something and it's like 1st person look, watching through eyes of someone who reads, hearing the words, but couldn't save them to memory.

148,"Hey reddit,

This is partly a personal question but also a general attempt to find resources / literature on this topic.

I have been treated for anxiety for a number of years, primarily through therapy. This has been helpful for me. However there's been one aspect of my symptomatology that I feel either my clinicians have never been able to address directly, or that I have never been able to articulate clearly.

I experience times when I seem to be 'dissociated'. This is not all the time, but in certain in social environments, both with friends and with new people,  I'm called 'spacey', 'distracted', 'absorbed.' When I'm feeling anxious, I've had people say they were addressing me or trying to ask me something and I just ignored them. In reality, I honestly didn't register what they were saying. Just yesterday I was with a man on a date and I was feeling extremely nervous. At one point he apparently caught me staring intently and remarked that it seemed like ""one half of me is here \[at his place\], another was somewhere else.""

I'm inclined to interpret this as a sort of traumatic response--as the presence of something like PTSD. This is because I also often experience hyperarousal. While I'm dissociating, my thoughts are often racing, and I feel tense and worried.

As some background, I've had troubled encounters with men where it didn't occur to me to draw boundaries about behaviors that in retrospect were obviously dangerous or abusive. When I was younger I (passively) consented to things with men that I barely knew that now seem ridiculous when I look back. I'm still reactive around sexual encounters and sometimes have no idea how to evaluate whether something feels pleasurable or fraught to me. I don't feel full physically absent, but **I feel disconnected from my body**. I feel unable to act in a rational way when in comes to decisions about my physical self because there's so little clear connection between who I am as a body for others and who I am as a personality/intellect.

The problem is that there is no inciting incident I could look to to call myself traumatized. I am a young adult and this stuff has been happening to me for four or five years now. I didn't have a particularly adverse childhood. I don't recall any early sexual or emotional abuse. By all accounts my family was loving and supportive, on average.

I think my dissociation is limiting the success of my anxiety treatment. I can't simply use techniques to change my anxious thinking when I'm constantly getting disconnected from my body and my mental self doesn't necessarily link up in a cogent way with my body.

**Can anybody suggest resources to try to deal with this issue: Dissociative symptoms suggestive of post-traumatic stress but absent any obvious inciting traumatic incident?** ***Most PTSD books/resources I've consulted operate on the assumption that a patient has a specific experience that is causing them distress***, and I can't say I have this. However my difficulty with staying present suggests something that needs to be treated. How do I become more present in the world and connect my mental life to my physical presence in the world?

149,"I realise I the title sounds like I'm some spoiled teen, but hear me out

This really started ever since I was a toddler.

Everytime I slightly disobeyed my mother, she would absolutely lose her mind. She would throw plates, smash anything she could find ( She's smashed a waffle maker, an entire fridge, she once smashed through my and my sister's room door etc.). While her hysterical reactions decreased over time, this really continued up until I moved out. While I am now a grown man and realise that kids can be blindingly stupid and obnoxious, I still believe that her actions were completely unreasonable.

The big problem is that now I also get moments of absolute hysteria. It can be triggerred by the littlest of things ( Example: If my gloves don't fit properly ). My parents used to tell me that these overreactions came from me being spoiled, but that is ridiculous since we always had very strict rules. I strongly believe that my mother is fully responsible for my illness. 

Is there a name for this illness? Is there any cure? 
Any info will help, thank you in advance.",11Jan2020,1

I can't make myself watch movies, read a book, go for a walk, I don't have the desire to function. I'm scared that I am getting depressed again, or if I am simply just fatigue.

155,"I met this girl (24) at school about 6 weeks ago. She is very intelligent and organized, with a 3.85 GPA. She's also quite an artist who sings and draws really well, at a professional level even. She speaks 4 languages without an accent and is learning a 5th atm. On top of that, she likes traveling (been to 20+ countries), photography (takes amazing photos), anime, video games, etc. We began dating and shortly entered a relationship. 

Before we officially entered a relationship, she told me that she had a traumatic past. Her parents did not care for her and were always busy. They left her to her grandparents when she was a kid. Her last birthday with her dad was actually the first time they celebrated together. She and her dad had just started living together again last year. According to her, her mother has very high expectations of her, while always accusing her for things she has no control over, such as being ugly (which she is not, she’s gorgeous), not having perfectly straight, long legs etc. Her mother keeps telling her not to cause trouble for other people, so she speaks for outsiders instead of defending her own daughter. The last time they spent a good time together was when she came over to Canada (her mother works abroad) and they watched Stranger Things on Netflix together. They bonded well according to her, and I can tell that it meant a great deal to her.

She had 4 ex’s before me, but all of them were the “avoidant type”, so they didn’t commit and dumped her after some time. The longest relationship lasted about 1.5 years and her ex was abusive. He threatened her with a knife. As a result, she went suicidal. She showed me the scars on her leg she inflicted herself. The others all had their problems, and they were all stingy and wouldn’t buy her an occasional drink. I don’t blame them though since they were probably students too and had no money at the time. Feeling she was mistreated, I voluntarily paid for everything while we were together even when she asked to split the bills. I even gifted her a Kate Spade purse. She said it was the most expensive thing anyone has ever bought for her. 

We took a trip during the holidays. On the first day, she said her throat was swollen up and felt miserable. We thought it could be an allergic reaction. I bought some OTC med from a pharmacy, and then rushed her to the hospital. The staff determined it was not an emergency so she was not a top-priority patient. They were also short of staff at Christmas. We waited for hours and eventually decided to take off as the symptoms lessened. At the hospital, I learned that she was taking Sertraline or Zoloft. She said she would get cramps, panic attacks, etc if she doesn’t take it. It made me realize her mental condition may be more severe than I initially thought since she’d need medication to stay normal. She also regularly visits a psychiatrist. On our last day back while I was driving, she suddenly burst into tears while telling me her past. There I had my first shock. I had dated some girls but had never seen anything like this. Spontaneously, I tried to comfort her, but I seemed to make it worse. It went on for about an hour and I didn’t know what to make of it.

Since then, we see each other almost every day. Most of the time, she’s fine, but on some days, she would suddenly have a meltdown as telling me things. I’d say it happens about once every 2-3 days on average. Other than that, she seems completely normal, just an overall excellent and talented student, not strange at all. 

Yesterday, we had a date at a restaurant. In the end, out of a sudden, she had another attack – first time in public. She looked down on the table miserably. Her eyes got teary and her cheeks turned red. I tried calming her down. She texted me that talking makes her anxious, so don’t talk to her for a while. I was really confused and frustrated. I did nothing wrong at all, and all I had been doing was trying to make her feel happy. I had great sympathy for her because unlike her, I was very well raised and I had a very healthy relationship. In about 20 minutes, she returned to normal. We went to see a movie. She leaned on me and held my hand but I did not return the favor as I was still recovering. In fact, I was thinking about it the whole time. As we walked out, we remained silent for two minutes. I tried to break the silence by “how did you like the movie?” I didn’t hear anything back. I turned my head and looked at her face. I saw fear, sorrow, anxiety, the kind of expression one would only see in an anime. A thousand things came into my mind at once. In the past, my loving, caring ex would check on me to see if I was okay. She was also highly intelligent (masters from the best University in Canada), organized, and probably superior to me in just about every way. Should any conflict happen between us, she would be the one to step up and resolve. She was strong and I guess at some level subconsciously I depended on her. This time, I realized it’s quite different. I looked at her eyes and paused briefly. I didn’t know what to say and don’t remember exactly what I said (I panicked too), but I tried to make her think everything was okay with an awkward smile. It was probably the way I said it, or the nervousness, she thought I was being sarcastic, and I was angry. She thought I was about to hurt her or beat her up. My heart was broken. I always have a soft spot for the weak, or cute animals, disabled people or women, etc. I have never been violent with a girl before. I’ve never even argued with a girl before. If there was a conflict I did not want to confront, I would just walk away from it, not a good solution, but never violence. The way my girlfriend looked at me in fear really crushed me inside. I still ensured her she was safe with me and I would never hurt her. 

She told me she had anxiety, OCD, and I just had to accept it. I know nothing about mental health as I don’t have any family members with these problems, but I think of it as a normal illness such as a cold or fever that can happen to anyone, and it’s perfectly normal. If I treat her well, maybe she will eventually climb out of her shadow. However, she’s against the idea of someone changing her, but I do want to make her completely normal again. I’m not just messing around, but I like to think I’m dating a potential life partner. I want to help and be the one she can depend on. She said she was normal in primary school. She changed sometime during high school. 

Can people help me understand her conditions and what I can do to help? So far, everything I’ve done just seems to make her feel worse. I have never invested this much energy and effort in a relationship (my ex was strong). Please keep in mind that the above is my own perspective and try to be objective as I can’t understand her side.",11Jan2020,1

158,"So I saw my Psychiatrist a couple of days ago, and something he said it still kind of going through my mind.  I see him about every four months, but my last appointment was cancelled (think it was when I had a separate health issue going on, and another specialist appointment got scheduled for the same day as his appointment, so I had to pick which to go to and which to cancel) so I hadn't seen him since last May.  

I am on Disability (primary reason is physical issues, secondary is mental health), so I kind of just see him for med renewal and because sometimes Disability needs an update from him.  Basically I see him because I have to (I've had other Docs, there isn't any other choices that wouldn't take several months to get in to, I don't expect much out of it, so it is what it is; I wouldn't say it's the greatest Doc-Pt relationship).  

Usually he wants to get updated about my physical issues, which I understand, but the majority of my time gets used up (only have about 20 minutes with him, he's always late and behind schedule), leaving barely any time to cover psych issues.  So this time I made sure I got things directed to mental health right away, as I have been experiencing an increase in some symptoms, and wanted to talk about what has been going on (I usually only kind of cover the basics, don't really get in deep to a lot of my stuff).  I commented that I think it is time to go to the next dose of my main med, which he agreed.  The whole time I was talking, he kept yawning (a lot).  To the point I obviously noticed, as I get he's a busy guy, and maybe gets the afternoon drowsies, but come on dude, really.  Anyway, I tell him all the stuff that's been going on with me, get it all out, I've finished sharing, it's his turn to comment.  ""Well hang in there and stay alive"". Are you kidding me?!  That's your wise advice, hang in there and stay alive, lol.  Anyway, I don't know what I was expecting, I know there isn't any thing magical he can say that is really going to help me, but it just seemed so, I don't know, callous or something (not even sure of what to call it).  This has been going through my mind since the appointment, and I thought maybe just sharing it here will  help get it out of my brain and not make it a big deal or anything.  So, thanks for listening.",11Jan2020,1

162,"My mum seems to 'collect' people. She wants everybody under one roof. Her house is a 3 bedroom home, and for many years myself, and nine others (5 children) have lived together, with 7 dogs, for 4 years. 

My mum just seems to want to keep people as though they are toys. She doesn't like people having independence because she cannot control them. She has conditioned my siblings into doing nothing with their lives by doing literally everything for them that they have no independence. They don't function like adults because she hasn't ever allowed them to. They just sit in their rooms all day (this has resulted in why my sister and her kids had to move back home). My mum has also done the same to her partner. He is just sat in his bedroom all day every day, she doesn't like it when he goes around his brother's house and she doesn't want him to work. It's like she would have no control over his life if he does. Not one of us have friends and none of us have jobs either, except mum who works full time. She hates when the house isn't full. She will feed everyone up when her friend come round, stuff them full of cakes and crap to keep them coming back. But when they are here they just stare at their phones. They don't converse.

Sure there's a very strong argument that I should just ""move out"", but I can't right now. I don't want to sound like I'm making excuses but I'm in a very difficult place in my life; my child was stillborn several years ago and it's destroyed me, I am grieving and i am filled with social anxiety and depression. I am so scared to go outside. I cant work as i have epilepsy, i have tried to get work but no one wants to hire me with it. I have made the best of what I can, I cant work so I have put myself through university have had a bit more freedom, as a result, I've put myself through university, Im currently doing a Masters degree. Doing this I made it clear it was due to wanting to have that independence. To break free. I want to have a life. But whilst I'm also living in a house with 10 others, Im also dealing with: the stress of my university workload, grieving for my child, struggling with anxiety, depression, ADHD and Epilepsy, coming out of a physically and mentally abusive relationship, grieving for the loss of my close friend who passed away, as well as trying so hard to break free of this conditioning from living in this house 

If feels like I'm on the edge and about to have a nervous breakdown. I plead for my mother to help me but she doesn't listen, tells me she doesn't care. It honestly is like talking to a robot.  All it is is just a bunch of things (that are easily solvable provided she helps me; keeping the children and dogs quite a bit more whilst I do my research and essay writing). But she doesn't care, ive tried everything and she continues to not care or help. She just constantly ignores my pleas. It's like she wants me to have a breakdown. If i have a breakdown, then that independence I strived for would go, and she could keep me locked in my room all day like how the rest of my family are; where can control me. 

She's my mum, but i feel like im starting to hate her. 

I have felt this way for many years now. 

When my ex was pregnant, they both went on a Quijaboard and it told my ex that she shouldn't have the baby; my mother did this. Before my Dad move out when I was a child, if he got mad, in order for her to calm him down, she would slip Dizaepam into his food; she often jokes about a story where she hid one in ice cream and the pill rose to the top. My dad is never around, havent seen him in years, but when he lived here she did the same to him; he wasn't allowed to work, he stayed home all the time. The second they broke up he got a job and has worked every day since (20 years)When she dated my siblings father she gave him an entire bottle of Night Nurse; he was asleep for several days. She uses medication to control peoples minds. She encouraged her boyfriend to go on medication and now he is just a vegetable in his room. She doesn't care what it takes, as long as people are dependant on her so she can control them.

I dont know what to do anymore. I have no one to talk to. No one who can help me. Everyone i live with is completely nuts and im the only normal person here. I am completely alone. She has conditioned us all to not know how to function as adults.  None of us knows how to do anything. I'm trying so hard to break free from this; it may sound as simple as ""go get a job"" but its not that easy.",11Jan2020,1
163,"I’ve struggled with depression for most of my life, and it’s been significantly worsening this year. A few months ago I started having constant nightmares out of nowhere. Sometimes I have 3-4 a night, jumping awake from each one and having to keep going back to sleep. Sometimes it happens every other night and sometimes I get a break from them for a few nights. There are no recurring images or themes so I don’t know why this is happening. I’m assuming it’s related to how low I’m feeling overall.

165,"A lot has happened in my life recently, both good and bad.

But I'm trying to cope and heal from an assault, along with dealing with my own depression and anxiety. I know it will take time, but sometimes it gets really hard. I have utilized my university counseling services but all the counselors did was refer a recovery book to me and focus on my childhood (relationship with my father, mom's death, all that stuff that I've already been to counseling for). My insurance does not cover therapy or any form of medication that helps with depression or anxiety. So I'm on my own for coping. 

I am a fairly fit person, I do weight training every day, I am at a good place spiritually, I eat moderately well (as well as a college kid can), and focus on my well being. So self-care isn't a problem. I do not have a giant support system, just my partner who is more than willing to help me through it.

I'm just not too sure where to start. If anyone has any advice or has gone through, I am open to anything. 

Thank you for your time  &lt;3",11Jan2020,1
