0,"Hey reddit, I've got a problem

This has been happening much more and more extreme than or used to be, so I decided to ask for some help. Anyway, this is what's happening


I'm usually kinda chill about stuff, but every once in a while after something really really bad happens to me, or someone has just been a little too much of a dick to me, I snap, one time my older brother hit me while we were in a car with a group of my friends because I did something he didn't like, I tried to brush it off and keep going(I was just talking with the other people in the car) then he did an asshole move and did it again. So I snapped, well almost snapped, I got pissed but I had friends around so I waited, when we got back, I told him I was pissed and then punched him. He fought back, I did it again(to clarify, he was skinny and tall, I was meaty, not a ton of muscle, but enough muscle to move the fat at a high enough speed to give some good bangers) I, being considerably less mad, decided to instead of continuing, hide behind one of the two cars in out driveway, he took up a position in front of the house saying ""if you think you can get inside without getting hurt then you're a dumbass"" but I waited him out and he went inside and told out parents.

That was story one, but there's more and the snaps happen in different ways


Another way this happens is when I feel really overwhelmed, and that happens way too much, but since I'm usually chill about a lot of stuff and try to stop people from fighting my mom calls me harmony boy, and even after asking her to stop many times she still calls me that, and whenever she does, my rage switch starts hovering between calm and flip the fucking table mad. I try to stay calm, but it's hard. I even tried using a punching bag as a way of getting rid of stress and anger, I also basically tried to use it as a signal to my family for when I wasn't in a good state, like ""aww there's my little harmony boy"" *I go up to my room and start demolishing a punching bag* and they still don't get it, hey op do this, do that, hey op while you're doing that, why don't you do this too even though it's across the house. And recently, I've been getting stressed and worked up a lot more, what can I do? Is there anything I can try? Is there something I can buy that can help with it?(I've already tried fidget toys and a punching bag and wall)",03Sep2020,1
1,I believe I’m a mild schizophrenic (believe because “self diagnosing”) however I constantly run into worry. CONSTANT worry...from small things like wording things right to big things like family and friends. I feel like the worry is gonna absorb me. I’m okay with worrying about family and friends BUT constant worry is killing me and I’m feeling mentally exhausted and I feel stuck. I don’t know what to do or how to fix this issue. Any help is appreciated :),03Sep2020,1
2,I have depression I know that for a fact. And I don’t do a lot to help it and I know I should but I’ve been doing this one thing for years and just want to know if anyone else does this.                       I can catch myself having conversations with myself but not myself. I find myself having conversations with people but it’s more like I’m writing a script in my head. I feel like this mostly started whilst I was on the bus for school (I’m no longer in school) so now it can happen when I am cleaning the dishes or anything tbh,03Sep2020,1

I wish I could help them out and just be there for them a bit more and as I'm a student I have more time than the doctors/nurses. I just rotate with the doctors in the am but I'm kinda hanging around the rest of the day. I'm wondering what else I could do that could brighten your day a bit more or make you feel more cared for?

7,"[I have seen this meme](https://i.imgur.com/5BbSmP8.jpg) along with [copies of ""creepy"" responses (which I agree they are)](https://i.imgur.com/xWZMRAg.png) to this meme posted.

Basically, it was saying if an anime character is like 16 or something gross, and you pretend like they're older (say 25), it's still gross and wrong.

[Here's the whole thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/ij0y7x/does_the_anime_community_need_a_wakeup_call/) of people explaining why. And my responses got reposted here.

*I knew the canon ages of some characters*, but *I didn't really care about the canon* itself. All I saw was some anime boob and thought it was nbd because grown women and anime girls look the same. I just ignored the canon ages apathetically despite knowing them.

Obviously, I don't want to do this anymore. Am I or was I a creep? Is it too late now? What do I do?

I'm freaking the fuck out. I'm afraid of being a creep. I thought it was so obvious age didn't matter if you made up your own/didn't care about the canon or story for an adult looking character. I always only thought of characters as being 20 something because I like adults.

What the hell am I supposed to do? I don't want to be a creep and suddenly overnight I'm learning people believe I'm a creeper. I never wanted this.",03Sep2020,1

I’ve been diagnosed with depression and ADHD for a number of years now and I’ve felt that it’s important to both open up a conversation about a problem and invite others to speak about their experiences.
Being enrolled in university with these issues in an area that cares very little about my diagnosis to begin with, I believe the school systems are incredibly hypocritical and downright terrible at supporting an issue they claim to care very much about. Now the university did provide some resources, like a doctor on campus and a counsellor or therapist to speak to about once a month. Unfortunately the doctors were incredibly dismissive, deciding not to change my needed medication when necessary and instead doubling my current medication to the level that I nearly overdosed on it. When I was suicidal and attempting to end my life they sent me an email that basically amounted to “don’t do it, we have resources, visit a campus provided therapist in a couple months.” At the same time there was a presentation the university hosted about how proud they were of their fantastic mental health program despite nearly every individual I’d spoken to saying it had not helped them in the slightest. Every institution I’ve visited or been a part of has had the same story virtually repeated, where they want to appear friendly to mental health but are disinterested in actually attempting to deal with it. A student I knew with severe autism had tried to get the proper documentation to allow the class to consider his needs. The processing time on this however, lasted several months and by the time he could get the papers to BEGIN the process of getting accommodations for himself the semester had already passed and he had gone the whole way with no real support through the entire process and incredibly defeated from all the hurdles he’d had to go through for what amounted to nothing. Now maybe other individuals have had more positive experiences with this kind of thing, but what I’ve seen of mental health programs in the higher school system is absolutely abysmal and I’m outraged every time they host a presentation to congratulate themselves on what I consider to be one of their biggest failures. I’d love to hear anyone else’s story, negative or positive on mental health treatment in these systems.


TLDR: universities and schools love to brag about good mental health programs without actually investing into them and making them useful.",03Sep2020,1

11,"So I’ve worked at my place of work for 7 years. It’s a well known supermarket chain in the U.K. I’ve had uni in-between and even moved away for a brief period and transferred my job both times. So they’d been good to me in that respect. For the last 3 years I’ve worked doing online shopping so an early morning shift of 6am until roughly 12-1pm. They’ve been very stressed over lockdown and I understand it’s a busy time, but the management are just becoming unbearable and they’re trying to make me and others stay extra everyday and even lying about our contracts to try and trick us into staying. My mental health and anxiety have been on and off for the past year or so and this is just making it even worse, there’s nothing I would love more than to just quit and never have to go back.. but the thought of being jobless for the first time since I was 18 terrifies me.. especially when I have stuff like my car and phone etc to pay for each month. I have a bit of money saved up but not enough to live off forever and during these uncertain times I don’t know when it’s likely I’ll even get another job. 

What should I do? Taking some time out of work to focus on my fitness and overall health mentally and physically would be amazing, but it is reckless?

18,"July 4, 2020- I had almost everything I needed. I had a job that I loved and a plan for my life. My living arrangements were okay, but I was in my hometown that I knew well enough. I didn't have any friends or dating prospects really. My coworkers were kinda my friends, but a social group was really missing from my life. But I still felt optimistic because I was working my plan. 

Then my cousin offered me an opportunity to work for him and he'd help me out with my career and getting to graduate school. I accepted because the job I loved back home was temporary (but I still had months to find a new one), and I thought it'd be easier to find a new job with my cousin's help while working for him. 

July 20, 2020- I move across country for this new adventure with my cousin.

August 28, 2020-My life is in shambles. My cousin totally betrayed me and became a narcissistic asshole that I'd never imagined. My job with him is over. Our cousin relationship is over. My old job doesn't have a position for me anymore. I'm still on the other side of the country, but with a different relative.

No job, unfamiliar place, away from the few friends I was starting to make when I moved. I don't know how to rebuild my life. I regret ever accepting my cousin's offer.

They have messed with me in the past about being gay (I’m not gay but that’s their thing because I have not dated for a few years now) or getting anxious about severe thunderstorms (which it happened to be doing).

Apparently, my sister made a post on Facebook about throwing a food item at me and tried to get like a certain amount of comments/likes to throw it at me. I didn’t find out until after I yelled at my family and kept repeating “what are you about to say!?” 

I’m not usually angry like this but them laughing and looking at me and like ignoring me when I tried to talk to them made me feel a flight or fight sensation. I threatened to start hitting myself. Immediately after, they start mocking me saying “retards hit themselves” and making jokes about it. 

Hours later, my sister is calling me a bitch for getting upset. Yeah, honestly, I’m thinking they’re just shitty people.",03Sep2020,1

I’m 22 and I had to move back home temporarily in April because college closed it’s campuses down due to the pandemic. I am working on moving out hopefully by the end of the year with my boyfriend (but we will see, we have financial struggles so it may not happen until sometime next year). I am currently taking classes online since the college I go to is still closed. I also work at home for a call center.  My mom is an essential worker and works 5-6 days a week. She comes home in a bad mood and exhausted everyday. She works 12 hour shifts and sometimes more if they need her per day. 

My little sister is 19. I also have a 25 year old brother who is also back at home due to other reasons but he is working and contributing to the house, as well as myself. 

My sister has anxiety and depression and stopped going to therapy and refuses to take medication that was prescribed to her (she never took it, not even once). According to my mom she’s been unemployed since the end of December. How she makes money is product reviews (test items are sent to the house and she reviews them). 

She has a car available for her to drive at all times (it’s my moms old car), but hates driving. She has drove herself 20 minutes to work and back before on busy roads, so she does know how to drive. She just hates it and will make up every excuse in the book not too. 

She is currently not going to college and has no plans too. We live about a 5 minute drive from the grocery store (possibly a 20 minute walk) and she refuses to go get food for herself. She would rather sit around the house and whine and complain non stop that she’s hungry and there’s nothing to eat and slam the fridge and cabinets and bother everyone else than go get food for herself. My brother and I refuse to go get her anything. Nobody goes out of their way to get us anything. We have to get it ourselves. She’s an adult. She won’t go to the store by herself because she’s scared she will run into one of her school bullies that works there. She also will leave the house if someone goes with her somewhere, just not by herself. I think quarantine has given her social anxiety. Especially since she sits in this house all the time and literally has zero friends. 

She sent my mom a grocery list via text and my mom stopped at the store and picked her up food on the way back home from work today. I think that’s ridiculous, she is here all day, knows how to drive, she can go get it herself. She’s an adult. 

She started bitching to my mom about how she forgot to get certain items and how my mom got the wrong items. It pissed me off because like go yourself then. Ungrateful

I told my sister “you should be ashamed of yourself, you are 19 years old, you have a car and know how to drive, you shouldn’t be relying on anybody but yourself to go get you food, mom works all the damn time and is barely ever here, I’m sure the last thing she wants to do is go grocery shopping for someone who is fully capable of going by themselves”. Then she said “I have anxiety and you know this” and I said “you act like you are the only person in the world with problems, you have an excuse for everything, anxiety or not, if you want food go get it yourself, who cares if you see someone you know, walk past them, why does their opinion matter, you are there to get food”.  She said “well I don’t like driving and I’m not walking” and I said “if I was mom I’d let you starve until you decided to put on your big girl pants and go get food for yourself, *brothers name* and I do it, so can you” then she said “that’s because you guys are older than me and don’t have anxiety”. I said “I’m only two years older than you, are you gonna do this for the rest of your life, your gonna have to grow up sometime” she said “mom doesn’t seem to mind it”. My mom has said to her many times to go get food for herself and she doesn’t have time to get her food. The only reason she got her food today is because everyday for the last week, she had relentlessly annoyed my mom over text about how hungry she is. My mom is sick of it. My brother made a comment saying “I’m surprised mom doesn’t have to wipe your ass, since it seems like you can’t do anything to help yourself and would rather sit around and cry about it”.",03Sep2020,1
25,"Before I begin I want to say this post is going to have a lot of transphobia in it. If you are trans please don’t read it. The last thing I want to do is push my problems into someone else and make them feel bad.
















I’ve been questioning my gender for about 18 years. I was born male, but think I might be female. 

I browse trans subs a lot to help get more information, but last night I’ve read something that hit me hard and I haven’t been the same ever since. It made me realize and confront a lot of things I already knew. 

If I do transition I’ll never be a cis woman.

There are experiences I’ll never be able to have because of how I was born.

I have probably benefited from male privilege at some point in my life, which gives me an unfair advantage compared to cis women.

Essentially no matter what I do I’ll never be a “real woman.” This also led me thinking of how I would perceived by society if I do transition.

If I don’t pass completely I’ll never be thought of as a woman.

When people do treat me as a woman it will most likely be out of pity.

Women will never view me as one of them since there are so many experiences I missed out on and since I have socialized as a male/benefited from male privilege.

At best I could hope to be considered an “honorary woman.” Someone who shares many of the same experiences as cis women, but is still a step below a cis woman.

Even if I am super lucky and pass completely, deep down I’ll still know I’m a male.

I’m not sure what made me think of all of this but as I said before it’s been affecting me. This isn’t the first time I’ve been sad about my gender, but it’s definitely the worst. I also feel bad since I know other people are going through much worse then I am rn.

I cry myself to sleep just about every night and I want to tell someone. 

So so so badly but I hate being a burden. Last time I vented was a few months ago to my stepmom who proceeded to post EVERYTHING I told her that i wasn’t ready to tell anyone else on FACEBOOK where a bunch of strangers could see it. 

She’s one of the reasons why I’ve started to develop trust issues. One of the reasons why I’m always ‘smiling’. I want to tell my birth mom everything I didn’t tell my step mom because I’m closer to my birth mom. I’ve tried to ask my friends to vent but it’s always ‘Sorry I’m busy right now’ and then they proceed to do things like play roblox or Minecraft- it hurts me to think that to them, a game is more important then my mental health.

43,"About 2 weeks ago I went camping with my family and had an amazing weekend, when we came home I slept in the camper for a few nights barely 20 feet from our front door. For some reason I started to feel really scared an anxious for absolutely no reason. I had to keep reminding myself that I was safe and that nothing was wrong, and nothing WAS wrong. I had absolutely no reason to be that anxious and I ended up closing the curtain to the back part of the camper listening to music through my headphones and crying all whilst trying to calm myself.

I've been having stomachaches for the past few months. Inconsistent in nature and placement. Not associated with any food. Tested negative for celiac. Had a weirdly elevated B12, despite not eating any meat, but my doctor didn't think it was a big deal. 

Besides that, I have a bunch of other weird symptoms: eye aches, heat intolerance (like, avoid going outside, no exercise at all. It's bad), exhaustion (though that's nothing new), muscle aches. 

I have an appointment with a gynecologist coming up, and an appointment with a gastroenterologist after that, unless the gyno appointment yields anything. Plus another appointment with my PC doctor, to have TSH and T3 And T4 tests done. 

It just. It CAN'T be anxiety. Because if it is, I'm fucked. No anti-anxiety med has worked for me. My mind is stretched so thin. I don't have the energy to change my diet and exercise habits.

Like I've been through periods of other people's lives where *they're* the one going through the traumatizing event, or they'll tell me about struggles and such, and I feel like I've somehow absorbed that in a way. 

I've always considered myself highly empathetic, and through that I think it's why I always offer to be there in times of crises or struggle and listen to try and help. I am majoring in Psychology as well. So I've heard a lot of stories. But I've been thinking lately and wondering if I'm somehow also traumatized from that. 

To be clear, their experiences are clearly traumatic in a long-lasting, ""I need to see a therapist and seek help"" in a way, and it's not one single person that's caused this.

It's somewhat affected my actions and behaviors and ways of thinking to a point that I would say is a bit of a trauma response. Not just ""oh this happened to so and so, so I'm using their story to be cautious"", but feeling intense anxiety, worry, and sometimes even an extremely panicked response that leaves me feeling the same way I would to something I've personally experienced.

53,"Hi,
There's been this question that has been on my mind since a while.

Regularly this days and since over three months, I am going through dark depressed episodes where my brains keeps on spiraling with self harming thoughts. Those episodes can be so hurtful that I'll start complaining about even feeling physical pain in all of my body.

But when it's over, I almost forget its existence and feel as if it never happened.

As if I'm fine and just overreacted, that it was all in my head and never actually existed.

Of course I still remember bits of it, enough to describe it, but I feel like I'm immediately forgetting it and moving on from it. Except that it keeps on re-happening, so I'm starting to understand that I'm not truly moving on from it, and that thinking like that only prevent me from truly understanding what's happening with me. 

Does the brain try to erase mental pain? Is it a sort of defense mechanism? I feel like this feeling is part of a phenomena that I must not be the only one experiencing and would like to understand it better.",03Sep2020,1

I have no idea what my reasoning behind this was, I just remember I felt like I had to do it or I couldn’t sleep. For years after that I did that every single night and slowly it started becoming a day time thing too. any time i had a bad thought or heard something bad i’d have to repeat stuff like “i’m so sorry for all the people suffering on earth and i’m so thankful for everything i have” over and over but it was always somewhat controllable. For the past like 6 months? it has become totally out of control. I will start repeating phrases like that in my head over and over and i will literally not be able to think about anything else for hours. I’m a little scared that these thoughts got worse because of wellbutrin since I started taking it around a month before this whole thing got worse. Has anybody ever had any experiences like this?

I just feel like everyone dismisses me and talks to me with little respect.  I was raised in a family that doesn’t speak up when they’re upset so I don’t have the guts to say how I feel, and bit by bit the frustration is starting to stack up in my head.  Me being annoyed by everything cost me a group of friends once, and this is around the time of year when I started to get really depressed last year, so I’m afraid of it happening again.

I’ve been having a lot of anxiety, depression, and some suicidal thoughts, I’ve even attempted a form of self harm but I didn’t actually do any damage. I had a few weeks where I could barely do anything but feel exhausted and low. 

Flash forward to now, I’m back at uni with my friends so I’m doing a lot better, but my anxiety is still getting the best of me. Doubting everything I say, getting anxious over nothing, bad thoughts, etc. I’ve had a couple nights where I’ve spiraled and felt sad, yesterday I even tried to self harm. For some reason I’ve just been angry at everything, and I’ve been so quick to get angry at the smallest things. I’ll go from a bad low to a good high quick sometimes and it’s weird, sometimes I don’t even feel real. I’m worried I’m going to mess up my relationship because of this too, since I’m being a lot. I love my boyfriend and he’s doing his best to help me, but I don’t want it to become too much for him and it’s become something else I worry about. 

I’m just not sure what to do. I know I have anxiety but have never been to therapy or been diagnosed before, but this year has been the first time it really has gotten bad, so I’m not sure how to cope/what to do.

I’ve lurked on this reddit for a few and have read through a lot of posts so I kinda felt inspired to make my own.

Background:
I (20f) recently moved back to dorms this semester and my roommate from that I have lived with the past 2 years decided to do fully online to avoid getting ""the rona"". Thus, I now sleep in a room alone, and dont have any real friends on campus. Its been a week or so and im starting to feel lonely. Due to the health crisis, most of my classes are online, and I have found myself with more free time. The less busy I am the more I feel my (undiagnosed yet) paranoia, which goes from everything from bridges (weird phobia idk) to shadows to  PTSD like loud noises or whenever I am alone at night and there is someone nearby who I get anxious of. And to top is all off my family (me included) are all prone to depression.

Should I get an ESA? I have been in therapy for years, stoped a few years ago, but it never really helped much, and im not too great at making friends who I could talk to.


TLDR: I have (mild but undiagnosed) paranoia, anxiety, ptsd, prone to depression, and am all alone on campus. Should I get an ESA, and how do I go about it? (I live in CT, USA if that helps).",03Sep2020,1
69,"Hello everyone. Hope all is well. So I have noticed over the last year, I have been having these ""tantrums"" over things big and small. Like before I always thought I was just being immature but now I'm starting to feel concerned.

For instance, I just started graduate school and I barely passed my first few assignments with the feedback leaving me to start doubting myself. Then this evening I had class and I started feeling so anxious and before I knew it class ended with my participation grade being really low. And the thing was I started to feel that anxious feeling about halfway in class and I just ended holding it in for an hour. 

In more personal instances; Been trying to watch my weight and so my mom joined me on my journey, well, tried. She told me to be tough on her. One night I told her she needs to make sure not to stress eat since she just kept eating junk food all day (false alarm at her work for COVID but she still had to stay home for two weeks). Out of nowhere, she tells me I'm just like her ex-husband, who constantly made comments on her weight and just had put her down constantly. I ended up just walking to my room and had to total freakout for about 30 minutes feeling angry and just not good enough.

They all happen in this pattern: my chest starts to hurt, then my breathing turns quick and heavy, me clenching onto my head with emotions of anger and sadness where I'm just rocking myself to try and calm down. The urge to break things or just find a way to release my anger is common. Here and there I do end up breaking something of mine as well.

On average they last about 10-15 minutes but about three weeks ago I had another complete freakout where I just cried for 20 minutes straight. My throat was in pain for a few days after.

I was always told I have an anger issue and I feel these ""freakouts "" might have stemmed from that because even when I get angry I can feel some sort of anxiety pop up too. 

My sister knows what is going on and told me I should talk to a doctor. I want to but in the back of my head, I keep hearing a voice that is saying ""Stop being childish. Nothing is wrong with you."" Since I've been told that all my life. I know the steps I should take I'm just scared.",03Sep2020,1

Tonight and this morning, I talked about things and I feel like I did what I could've done before (which is good but I want the actual solving of  conflicts to be better.)  

I wasn't watering myself and I saw things that were uncharacteristic to my normal self and got worried. Like, jealousy (green-eyed monster), suicidal thoughts, impulsiveness, some panic attacks and just internal anger and issues. I feel ashamed but I always hopeful because it wasn't always *this* bad, meaning there is improvement to be made. I take responsibility for the things I've done in those moments. Yesterday was scary and I was on a roller-coaster of emotions but being stable and balanced is best. 

* I didn't get a chance to talk to my mother about counseling yesterday but I ***will*** today.
* Also, completing a CBT worksheet today and just caring for me. I still wanna live and I have things to look forward to. 

Some excepts I found on mental health:

&gt; To be in a state of good mental health means that you’re in the right frame of mind to be successful in every aspect of your life. It doesn’t mean that everything is perfect or no conflicts are present; it’s quite the opposite, really. Good mental health means that when issues arise, you can deal with them in a constructive way. Recognizing problems and actively working to overcome them instead of succumbing to stress is also an element of positive mental health.

My brother, for the past four years, believes that the government is actively spying on him and making his life miserable. Whenever he has conversations about this and suddenly hears distant sirens, he'll start writing his words down on a paper for me to read in fear that the government is tapping into his home while he speaks. 

I only believed this to be an odd quirk about him until last night. My dad tested positive for covid-19 and has been dealing with some severe symptoms. I called my brother to inform him and he went ballistic. He screamed at my mom over the phone, who also tested positive for covid two weeks ago, stating, ""I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU. THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO KILL US BECAUSE WE'RE BLACK. HOW CAN YOU GUYS STILL NOT BE SURE."" He apparently smashed his phone after my mom tried to end the conversation.

He came and argued that we were all too stupid to understand how these coincidences keep happening. I'm 21, while he's a college graduate in his 40s, so he constantly belittles my knowledge whenever we debate, even though his arguments don't come with any concrete evidence.

85,"All of my life I have felt things so deep. I was a quiet girl growing up. My dad used to target me take things out on me. I was quiet and shy. My mom was emotionally unavailable. I also have 2 brothers. I have memory issues. I’ve felt stuck and weird. Never really had friends or could keep them especially after the divorce when we switched schools. I remember doing things to fit in and sabotaging myself to fit in. Like not trying out for band for fear of what people would think of me. I never felt drawn to anything and was never pushed by my parents. I started playing guitar in high school because my mom randomly took lessons. I fell in love with it. I never was really good. That’s where I wish someone would have instilled me to practice and work for it. I internalize everything I do as not good enough and quit. I met my ex around 17 and we were together for 11 years. That was my focus family. I felt so Alive. We broke up 3 years ago and now I feel like the scared, lost and confused little girl at 32. I’ve had issues keeping jobs. Never really had a career other than in restaurant management when I was with my self made family. Now I’m just lost and stuck. I’ve always wanted to be a musician but I just don’t have the talent. I feel worthless. I know this is first world problems but, it gets old.",03Sep2020,1

89,"Has anyone else ever, like, dragged yourself down so much to the point that suicide were attempted and shit, and when you finally got cornered and forced to admit everything, when you finally started to get help, all of the sudden your life feels so hollow? Like as if you missed those days, those feelings when you feel panicked and stressed from constantly thinking about dying all the time, those pain you've suffered so much. You felt like a part of you were lost the moment you started getting better. Like, fully aware that this is not a healthy thought, that you shouldn't drag yourself back down, but it's just so tempting. And then after a while you started to get into bad habits again, lying to everyone that you feel better now and stuff, in hopes that you'll get hurt and broken again? You hate it, you hate it so goddamn much, and yet you're still drawn to it. It's as if living is not worth it without that feeling of wanting to slit open your throat everytime you wake up in the morning. You hate it, so goddamn much, but you want it. You crave it.

I have this weird funny feeling deep inside my stomach. My heart’s mostly racing and my limbs always shaking. There are certain words and sentences that appear in my mind. Something like “i am never living in the present”, always dwelling about what may or may not happen”. 
I feel sick in every way possible, with no strength to even be with my own thoughts. I use music to escape or fill the void but now I’ve come past the point where music isn’t making much sense, just some words that sound nice. 
I’ve been feeling contrasting moods for some time. Where i sit to do my work and end up googling a random thought, which then keeps jumping to different interests quickly. I am aware that most of it is anxiety, depression and an attention disorder but I’m not convinced.
How can i want something so much and when i do get it, i don’t want it? 
Lacan comes to mind when i act like this.
There are days where i am fully rational and suddenly something happens and my muscles tense up and i start spiralling.
I don’t know what i am doing, where i am going.

Some people would tell me to stop using Reddit or simply telling me that this place is not for me if my emotion can't deal with being downvoted. I've been dealing with depression since I was little, and my emotion has always been unstable. 

I have strong emotions and sometimes I couldn't control it. People always say that I'm strong, but in reality, I use that to hide my weakness in order to protect myself from being emotionally vulnerable. That means I'm still very, very weak. Every downvote is like a piece of panic attacks, and then a tiny depression kick in. This usually a short-term effect, but it happens every single time I use Reddit and see a downvote.

99,"So I am a pretty decent student, my normal ranks have always been 1st or 2nd. But after my trials my ranks fell for Chemistry (4th) and Biology (7th). As i don't hide anything regarding school from my parents i told my mum my sudden shift. She immediately told me not to tell my dad. 

Her constant reminder telling me I dropped ranks killed me internally, because she kept reminding me I did shit (which she also stated). She ended up saying ""I lost all hope for you"" that broke me. Within my family my mum was the only one who had hope for me to get into a specific university whereas my dad ultimately declared I am a shit student. I don't maybe it is their way of motivating me but there is always that fear of doing shit and disappointing them.

I think worst of all it gets to me when they bring in money and how they expect me to immediately do well because a shit tonne of money is being spent for me and that I am being sent to one of the best tutoring. I think having Asian parents also brings that mentality that if I get a shit ATAR i will get nowhere in life but also if i get a shit ATAR they would not be able to tell their other friends. Sometimes it becomes a competition. An i am trying my best but after my mum reacted like that I absolutely feel shit. 

I am trying to make both my parents proud but I feel like I am not doing a very good job. It honestly is making me reevaluate everything.

In the last few years I’ve done 500+ hours volunteering in various places as well as college, university and a bit of paid work. Parents refused to let me do paid work while in education. Always been told companies would go crazy for someone with my experience and qualifications but no one even in my field wants me. Can’t even get basic minimal wage jobs like cleaning or retail...

I’m looking daily for anything I can apply for but every time I am turned down with no comments. Honestly I can’t understand it but every time I get denied it’s like a reminder of how useless I fucking am. Even with everything no one wants to associate themselves with me because I’m so damn useless....even those that are meant to help you get a job have started being nasty thinking I’m just lazy and not doing anything.

106,"It's hard to explain, but I want to make sense of it. Back a couple years ago, there was this kid in my class who to say the least, terrorised the class. I'm talking about chair throwing, stabbing with nails, desk throwing. At the time I was scared shitless as was my class. 

Anyway, when I'm showering (idk why it's weird), my mind kinda drifts back to then, and sometimes I vision him doing more crazy shit, like weaponry and shit. I kinda visualise (Like act out, just using hand motions) me shooting him or fighting him or whatnot - like as a self defence. On other, rarer situations, I imagine myself as a cop or Swat or something.

Obviously I know that this is unrealistic and won't happen, but I'm worried that there's something behind it - like a meaning, perhaps trauma, or that I'm worried I'm insane.

I'm a college student and I'm in a psychology course because it was the only course in my town that appealed to me (the good universities and other courses are in another city which is about 3-4 hours away from my town, and it's expensive as hell) I want out, but I can't afford it. I just want some support to get through the course. I am currently in my third year, so I'm almost done.

My problem stems from the issue that I can't seem to memorize or remember lectures and lessons. I've heard countless times and read online that depression can affect your memory. I want to be clear that I've never been diagnosed with depression, and I am not self-diagnosing. However, I do feel depressed a lot. Especially when things go downhill. I can't afford to see a mental health professional about my issues. I just want to know if I experience this ""memory issue"" because I'm not really into the course and psychology itself?

I’m strong, I bottle things up but I can handle death. At least I think I can. Maybe I haven’t realized I won’t see that aunt anymore. But she was one of the closer ones I had. And she passed the other day. And my mom is devastated. And it makes sense, but I’m trying my hardest to make her smile and try changing the subject to help her. Me and my brother are trying to focus on her. And I think it’s hurting her more because my cousin passed around the same time, along with that she never got to see her granddaughter.

She grew up with them, typical 0.5 generation American Hispanics, big family, going back and forth between America and Mexico. I can’t handle the thought of losing my brother or a parent.

To me, she was a really good help, taught me many things. In a way helping me break out of some things in life and made me into a better young adult.

Anyways I am 35 years of age and since I was a teen my mind has fought me. Constant suicidal idealation multiple attempts and another recent thought that turned into a plan. You can read the sorry below at the donation link. Anyways it started in December 2003, and I had threatened to wreck my car of a local bridge to my therapist. This scared her and I was immediately taken to the hospital. I spend a week at OSU during Christmas break. I can't remember what the main root was, I imagine it was because of the multiple abused i endured. I hope that doesn't come off like a whiney little bitch move but I was young and was never taught coping skills. Anyways fast forward to 2006 when I put a gun to my head and called to tell my gf goodbye... rookie mistake number 2. The cops were immediately dispatched, but it was actually my roommate that stop me. I knew I couldn't blow my brains out in front of him. As soon as he walked down there was a banging on my door he answered the cops immediately ran in and tased me. I was taken back to OSU where I stayed another week. I was diagnosed with manic depression. Fast forward to 2009 when this time the voices in my head were telling me it is time to make my peace. This time I stabbed myself with a pocket knife. I did my research and wanted to make it quick so I stabbed myself where my spleen should be. I didn't want my sister to find me so I called 911. Now I live in a small town so I figured I would bleed out before the cops got there. Well jokes on me my spleen ended up being on the other side. I was told there are 3% of Americans that have this I failed again. Then in my lowest of low times I take you to 2015 my girlfriend left me, I was fired from my job, and just wasn't right. Suicide was the only option this time. I took all my meds which was zoloft and another med I can't remember what. I took a few days short of a 90 supply and got in my car and drove to a far away parking lot in Columbus. I texted my family bye and waited to die..... nothing happened for what felt like hours. Thinking I failed again I went to the nearest hospital. I ended up just throwing up the pills which felt like I was burning inside as they came up. Life sucked but I went back to the pysch hospital a different one this time. I was downgraded to severe depression disorder this time. This time i decided to stick with my treatment and do all I can to get better. I have tried every pill under the sun and I had been doing pretty good until last year I relapsed and this last month I went in. I am back to being diagnosed bipolar 2. I am on a new pill cocktail, which I hope helps bc i feel there will not be a next time. The story below is what happened to get me to the hospital this time around which is a decent story. I just need to know will the suicidal idealation, mania, and depression ever stop? I feel so broken. Well thanks for reading

135,"Life begins at the end of our comfort zone, and this post is going to be uncomfortable for me. 

Over the past few years, I have really challenged myself to truly understand my depression. There have been so many less than perfect moments through my journey. Moments of vulnerability, moments of clarity, moments which were noisy, confusing and overwhelming as I desperately tried to claw my way through depression towards better days. As I continued to confront my own truth there were many who judged me, but not did understand what I was going through. It was at that moment that I decided that I must do everything in my power to make the unseen, seen. I set out to walk with vulnerability through a period in my life that was out of control. 

What did I learn?

1) Popular psychology is wrong... 

Rejection is not our greatest fear, our greatest fear is that we are invisible. Part of learning to live with and walk through depression is an exercise in making the invisible, visible. 

2) People do not change, circumstances do. 

You are the same person you were when you were a child, filled with joy, potential and love. Sometimes the circumstances in our lives greatly impact our ability to seek happiness, and leave us in a place where things that are already overwhelming, became even more overwhelming. We have to do everything in our power to change the channel when we are face-to-face with circumstances that are unfavourable. 

3) We cannot live against our own truths. 

The truth is when we wake up in the morning and look in the mirrior, the reflection we all see drives us crazy. I think what haunts us the most is that vision in our head of how everything is supposed to be, and when we look in the metaphorical mirror and things are not that way it compounds and prevents us from being happy. It took me a long time to learn how to stop living against my own truth: that we are broken, deeply broken people and often times the remedies we use for loneliness and heartbreak are to surround ourselves with lonelier more heart broken people. 

For a long time I spent too much time laying in bed feeling sorry for myself, waiting for some magical thing to fall from the sky and make everything okay. Many of the personal relationships I had began to suffer. The responsibilities and commitments I made to myself and others were not being followed through on. I truly was on a crash course going no where. I really did eel helpless and numb.  

Once I was able to challenge myself vulnerably I was able to feel happiness. My battle with depression is far from over, but I have turned a corner and I am at peace. I found calm amidst the chaos. This does not mean that the darkness no longer exists. It means that the darkness no longer controls my life. This is quite literally the pursuit of nirvana. It took me a long time to realize that I had two choices: I could be a victim, or I could over come. I am choosing to overcome. Thankfully I don't want a life anymore, I want to live my life.

Battling depression is no longer about finding the strength to get out of bed in the morning. I want to get out of bed. I am excited to get out bed. Because in front o me there are amazing experiences that I get to see from a new set of eyes. 

To that person who told me I was better than this and I could not let depression win... you were right... you were always right. 

And to those two fantastic people who drunkenly stumbled into a alive music club and changed my life forever. Thank you for letting me be me. We have celebrated the ups and downs. We have conquered so much together.

To anyone who may be reading this, please know that you can find your way through depression too. I am here to help, and offer any advice I can.

Now, though, with COVID-19 and the lockdown, I've been stuck at home for 6 months. I've been spending so much time with my dogs that I can't imagine having to go back to my university in a few months, maybe even a year, which would mean leaving them for months on end and only getting to visit during holidays (summer, Christmas, and Easter). These days I've been thinking a lot about bringing them to my apartment in the big city, but my parents most likely won't allow me to do so.

***Back Story (Skip to Main Issue If TL;DR)***

So i was born in South Africa and moved to australia when i was 8 years old where i struggled fitting in and was bullied weekly by the same person for 7 years, i never told anyone as i thought this is just how people treat me and never thought much about my mental health or anything. When i reached high school my parents enrolled me into homeschooling and did this up until year 10. When i reached year 8 i started getting down now and then from being lonely and not having friends other than my brother and parents i guess you could say. When i was in year 9 my mental health declined very badly and became suicidal half way through year 9, i ended up writing a note to my brother, mom and dad thanking them for everything they have done for me and apologising for being a failure and not able to be liked and things like that, i thanked my brother for all the times building and destroying legos, i thanked my mom for teaching me how to cook and always being up for a hug and always loving me, and i thanked my dad for teaching me everything i knew and loved about computers and always being up for a game of catch or a joke and always loving me. i basically dated it and gave myself like a week left to live before i was gonna take my life a couple days before i planned to take my life i bought and downloaded Arma 3 and got heavily into video games from there and found i can avoid my problems and ignore life through games. I made 3 friends back then i still talk to and am close with and who have helped me through heaps over the past years. My life from there gradually increased i guess but was still lonely and depressed at times. Year 10 was probably the happiest year of my life at the time, towards the end of year 10 my dad got a new job and we moved to the city where i ended up being enrolled into year 11 for 2020. At the time i thought my mental state was all good but didnt realise i basically just been pushing any problems into a box and locking it up, on new years night i came to a realisation my mental state is shit, i was alone in my bedroom watching a move in my bed with a can of coke while watching all these snapchat stories of past friends partying and having a good time and completely forgetting about me, never thought to invite me knowing i don't have any other friends. I broke down worse than i have ever broke down before as it hit like Jan 1st 2020, i cried and cried and fell asleep.  woke up and felt like shit, a week goes by and i realise you know what i'm going to a new school, my first ever high school and i will meet at least 1 person i get along with. On the first day i introduced myself to my mate we will call him Bailey, Bailey was nice and i had every class with him throughout the week so i decided to sit with him the whole of the first day, walking around and sitting by myself at break because i was too nervous to meet his friends. The next day comes along and i asked him where does he generally hang out, and he said he tends to hang out with 3 main groups, year 10's, 11's or 12's and asked me which group id prefer to choose and meet. Me always being able to along with people older than me rather then same age or younger i chose the year 12's. They were so welcoming and accepted me with open arms and to this day i am still friends with them and they are practically my second family. I ended up meeting the person i love dearly and enjoy spending time with and gets me more than anyone else ever has. Also my first ever girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

***Main Issue***

Throughout 2020 so far i have been having these drastic mood swings at the start they were usually once a week where i would go from being joyful and energetic to extremely sad and suicidal. A couple weeks before May this started happening maybe once a day for the next month and i ended up smoking weed everyday to help me which it did, it just made me happier when i was down and took care of all the shit i have been through in the past. It has been happening for the last couple of months everyday where at least once a day i have this drastic change of mood, from energetic, optimistic, joyful and just all in all happy to suicidal, down and not seeing a point in life, knowing i have people who love me and care for my well being yet i still felt this way, knowing i have friends now that i talked to about this and have been telling me to get help or talk to my parents but been to scared to.  I talked to my mom about it and she brushed it off as just mood swings (I did leave out the suicidal part) and said all teenagers go through this and i'm fine there is nothing wrong. So i spoke to one of my friends who has Bi-polar disorder and he said everything i am experiencing is the same that he experiences, so i did some digging and started realising that i have been experiencing most the shit for Bi-polar disorder for a while now. Yesterday i thought was my worst day yet because i had those drastic mood changes about 8 times in school, i talked to my other friend on the way home about it all and he said he knows a lot of bipolar people and they experience what i experience as well. when i got home i broke down, 10 minutes later full of joy and happiness, 30 minutes later broke down and suicidal again, 10 minutes later, u guess it full of joy and happiness, this happened from 5pm till about 11.30pm constantly, i tried talking to my parents in the car omw to a restaurant about it (Leaving out the suicidal part because i'm too scared to admit that) and my mom just said u dont have anything wrong with you u just have really bad mood swings so i believed them slightly still think its something else, bipolar or not i knew it wasn't just ordinary mood swings cause i have had those before but they weren't like this bad. Now the Icing on the cake which made me decide to make a post to get opinions and/or help, I was standing in the kitchen and thought i heard my cat purring at my feet like he usually does when i'm cooking, i looked down and he wasn't there yet i still hear him purring at my feet i looked around thinking the noise was just traveling weird, checked my room and he is sleeping quietly on my bed, keep in mind my room is on the other side of the brick house with a semi closed door just big enough for him to get through. Another incident i was just talking to my girlfriend on her bed about everything she hugged me and we just layed down for a bit,i ended up getting up saying her parents and younger brother just got home, she looked as if i was insane and i said i just heard them come in the door i can hear her younger brother talking, she said they aren't back there is no one talking, i said yea there is i can hear your mom laughing with ur brother, then when she asked me if i was alright i snapped back into reality i guess and it felt as if i went through a wormhole and came back and just wasn't on earth for a second, i was confused and scared, now decently worried layed down and just calmed down. Cut forward to dinner with her family, i'm sitting there at the table laughing and making jokes with her family and laughing, i could feel as if my mood was gonna drop and become suicidal again but just ignored it, then my visual interpretation of things got messed up. I felt as if a dark cloud came out of where and the room felt darker, colder, everyone looked so depressed and look as if they had fake smiles on their face, at this point im freaking out internally wanting to die as what was happening was scaring me so much and hurting me seeing everyone 'depressed'. I asked my girlfriend if she noticed it and she said they haven't smiled and laughed that much for real for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

So yea sorry for the long post but just want to try and get peoples opinions on what to do, i am talking to the school chaplain on monday to try and get some help but still know something isn't right, im not gonna go and self diagnose myself with bipolar all im trying to say is im experiencing something and the only link i have found is that, so i have come here to post my story and try get opinions and help.

144,"so theres this sub that I(17) went on a few months ago called r/kindvoice , and i thought the it had a really sweet message. you can post either as a helper or a person in need of a kind voice, and talk to others about problems. i decided to post as a helper, and offer my ears to anyone in need of some advice. one specific account reached out to me and stated that everyone hated him, he was severely depressed, and suspects he has aspergers. over the last few months, I’ve been talking with this person daily and trying to help him figure out how to make people stop “hating him”. the problem is that every time i would offer advice, he immediately shuts it down and gets upset that nothing helps. 

for example (if this is too long feel free to skip this part): he gets upset about his loneliness and believes that everyone hates him. i told him to try complimenting someone at his work, or to just strike up a small-talk conversation with a person at his school. he then immediately shuts the thought down and says that it doesn’t help because people will just ignore him. another example is his parents. he hates his parents and they hate him back, because of their past actions. he resents them for his childhood and they have a horrible relationship. i told him it might be a good idea to sit down with his parents and have a conversation about what can be done to fix their relationship, but he refuses. i then told him that if he wants to mend their relationship, try simply asking them how their day at work is when they get home today. he refused and said it wouldn’t help. 

at this point i’m completely lost. he tells me he will kill himself if things don’t get better, but he doesn’t make the effort to make them better. he tells me i’m the only person who cares, and i feel so stuck because i can’t get out of this situation. i know how hard depression can be on a person, and his aspergers seems to really affect his mentality on mental health. i really need advice on how to handle things. i’ve talked to my therapist, who believes i’m being manipulated into staying with this person, and i should leave the situation immediately. the problem is i really don’t want to. i feel such pity for this person, and i don’t know how to help if he continues to shut down everything i say. i’ve given him about 50 solutions to his various problems (try a dating app, work out, find a hobby, meditate, journal, find a support group, seek therapy, compliment someone, volunteer, etc.) but he turns down all of them. he tells me he wants to kill himself constantly and it’s really messing with my mental health. i don’t know where else to turn. any and all advice is welcome, please.

I recently had seizures and other major health issues so I’m at my parents’ instead of my apartment (I’m 24). I can’t drive for six months because of the seizures, and I’ve been in and out of doctors appointments the past month. 

My parents were always a little conservative. I don’t even mind that. I wouldn’t call myself super left wing. And I hope I don’t sound stupid. My dad is a genuine narcissist (which doesn’t have to do with politics at all) so I feel super trapped anyway. But suddenly, the past few months, they’ve become super weird politically. As in, beyond just supporting Trump.

I’ve heard

My brother “black lives splatter!” *gun noises* parents laugh.

“If I were being harassed by a criminal I’d shoot them too”

“All these fucking Black people...”

I'm in my teens now and I'm visiting a psychiatrist, I've been visiting her for a few months now, but she's recently been on a vacation so I haven't seen her much overall. She's still on her vacation so I've decided to turn to the wonderful people of Reddit for help in the meantime. 

I don't know what my official diagnosis is, my parents haven't told me that, but on one of my papers I've seen the term ""acute psychotic disorder"" which sounds kind of scary. She once told me that what I'm experiencing is most likely OCD, but most symptoms have since disappeared or are being very well controlled by sertraline. When it comes to medication, I'm supposed to take 2 50mg sertraline pills a day, 1 0.25mg alprazolam pill if I need it that does next to nothing for even minor anxiety and even less so for panic attacks which is what I'm supposed to take it for, and one, 50mg, I believe, risperidone pill.

Now for my question. For a long time I've had severe bounds of anxiety for absolutely no apparent reason. It's been getting worse recently. I'm having a hard time explaining my symptoms. Those bounds of anxiety almost always last more than an hour. Sometimes I can distract myself with something else like TV or youtube, sometimes even with that good-for-nothing alprazolam pill, but sometimes I just can't do anything accept lay in bed and squirm uncomfortably. The best I can describe those occurrences is as extremely uncomfortable and followed by an unbearable feeling of dread. I feel like something bad's going to happen but for the life of me I can't tell what. I don't even know if this feeling would classify as anxiety, but that's the only thing I can begin to name it. I feel like I've just downed a whole pot of coffee. I feel like crawling out of my own skin. Perhaps the last comparison comes closest to what it feels like.

I'm not necessarily looking for advice, though I wouldn't mind some help. I'm more looking for people that get me, if there is any. I'd just like to know that I'm not alone in what I'm feeling. If you've got anything close to the feeling I so poorly described, please, I'd love to hear from you. Good luck and much love to everyone whatever you're struggling with. And thank you for sorting by new and coming by this post, and thank you so, so much in advance for responding.

P.S. Sorry for the possible grammar/spelling mistakes, I've done my best, but I'm not a native English speaker so there's 'bout to be something wrong.",03Sep2020,1
157,"I’ve been suffering with depression, which led to introspection, which led to disturbing intrusive thoughts, depersonalization, rumination, overthinking, existentialism, anxiety, panic attacks, apathy, and emotional numbness to the point were I feel either nothing or anxiety, also I don’t feel empathetic or passionate anymore. I feel like I can’t relate to other people or their problems anymore. I feel like my daydreams are gone. Obsessive googling and even journaling has only made it worse, since I’m just writing the same stuff over and over again. My sense of humor feels gone (I feel like I’m faking it when I do feel like I laugh at stuff on instinct or even when I feel sad about my condition). I’ve looked at pictures of baby animals and felt nothing. I’ve seen those ASPCA ads and felt nothing. I’m trying to read my old comics but I can’t feel the emotions I’m used to feeling. I feel like I keep focusing on any violence or death, questioning what was I okay with an what wasn’t I okay with. I’ve [posted numerous times on this subreddit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-t56bZ3B-qWeA4_xIbDBlmfWytFdh1gD2aOSdqUK-xA/edit) before whenever I feel like I’m having anxiety, panic, or other issues. 

My therapist has said to just take it day by day, but it’s getting very difficult and I feel like I’m at my limit. I don’t know if I’m getting worse or if I’m in the same place. I feel like I’m telling my therapist the same stuff every day. I also just started a Prozac regimen yesterday, so hopefully that does something for me. 

I just want to know how to practice mindfulness so I can find my passions and joys again.

162,"Hey guys!

How is everyone today?

As I said yesterday, everyday this month, I will be posting advice, support, help or anything to do with suicide prevention all on this sub. 

**Prevention Of Suicide**

There are early signs that shows when someone is struggling physically or mentally. Suicide prevention starts by recognising the first warning signs and then taking them to account. If you believe that a family member or a friend is going down a tough road, there are many ways out there to help save a life. Most people with suicide thoughts will show warning signs weeks or days leading up to the action. The best way to prevent someone from taking their own life is to react to the warnings signs and respond if you do spot them. Some **MAJOR** signs can be the following: talking about suicide, talking about harming themselves, writing down worrying thoughts, talking or showing interests in guns, drugs and alcohol. One of the best ways of preventing these sort of actions from happening is to show that you care and love this particular person. You can begin by pointing out the alternatives, show the person that they can change the way they think and lastly, get a therapist, doctor or a psychologist involved. 

When it comes to suicidal thoughts, there are other ways of actions a person can do to show them. A more subtle, but equally dangerous way is showing signs of hopelessness and not caring anymore, pretty much giving out any sort of hope. Many studies have shown that showing signs of hopelessness is a very strong predictor of suicide. A person who is showing signs of hopelessness will start talking about feelings that are usually unbearable, feelings that are always bringing them down, feelings that make them unhappy. That they predict a very dark and bleak future and the express that there is nothing that they’re looking forward to or excited about. 

Dramatic mood swings is also another sign. If you see someone go from being incredibly happy to being verge of tears, you already know that there is a problem occurring. A person with suicidal thoughts will start to lose interests in the things they once loved, losing interests in day to day activities and show a big change in eating and sleeping. 

These are some signs that someone is going through suicidal thoughts. If you see someone experiencing one of these thoughts of actions, assure them that everything is going to be OK and that you’re there for them. Or, if YOU are experiencing them yourself, call a suicidal preventing hotline in your area/country. For the UK, The Samaritans are available 24/7, 7 days a week on 116 123.

171,"My sister is 7 years younger than me. She went to college 7.5 hours from her family. She's always been in small schools (high school graduating class was 35 students; her college's entire undergraduate is less than 900 students). This, coupled with covid-preventative measures, limit the number of activities going on at the campus for her to meet others. She can also be very introverted.  
So now she's mentally and physically self isolating. She speaks when spoken to (unless it's her boyfriend). She's not participating in anything going on. She's trying to drive home every weekend. She's throwing a huge pity party for herself, and she's getting stuck in her own head. It's just this never ending shit show in her own head. She refuses any and all suggestions of things to do. She refuses to go to the on campus counselor. She's just stuck in this negative cycle, and while I can't be the one to break her out of that cycle (that has to be her), I'd like to try and help her if I can.

172,"My friend, (20 M), is in desperate need of a 4-6 week inpatient program to help him with his depression. It is getting so bad. I’m constantly worried that he will harm himself. He is in love with me (20 F) but I do not have the same feelings for him and I am in a serious relationship . He is fixated upon me and can not cope with the fact that I will never be in love with him. It is becoming very hard to let him vent to me because he says things that are delusional and I feel like when I listen to his problems, I’m just enabling his manipulative nature and he starts getting the idea that I’m interested in him.

But I can’t stand the thought of ignoring him and then finding out that he’s killed him self. But there is really nothing I can do. I’ve begged him to find a new therapist. But I think his struggles are so intense that he needs inpatient therapy. In Louisiana, where we live, the mental health facilities (especially inpatient) are a joke. His dad is very wealthy and I think they would be more than happy to pay for a luxury inpatient program. Does anybody have any recommendations or positive experiences with any inpatient programs in the US? It doesn’t matter where. I just want him to get better. This is becoming a task that is far beyond me, and I feel as if he has given up. Please help me help him. I really do care about him, and I’ve accepted the fact that I have lost the ability to be friends with him. But above all else, I want him to be okay so badly.

178,"First I’d like to say that I am not in a mental health crisis. I am diagnosed with a fair few of mental illness by several different psychiatrists I have seen through the years.

I need to make a friend that I can really connect with. I’m 30, female, and I don’t know how to explain myself other than that I’m awkward and sometimes bizarre.

I’m not looking for someone who does not believe or advocate for mental health or anyone who advocates for trying natural homeopathic remedies. I am going to stick with western medicine. 

My family is very difficult to deal with as they all want different things for me and they all expect different behavior from me and due to me trying to please other people for arguments sake, I cannot please everyone and I always end up getting hurt.

Things you should know if you decide to be my friend:

1. I can and will offer extremely helpful advice the majority of the time.

2. I don’t always get back to people I’m just meeting. This doesn’t mean I don’t want to talk. My family demands a lot of my time as does my potential full-time job.

3. I am willing to go very deep into hypothetical conversations and I wear people out. I’m “too much”. 

4. I always have a new problem. According to my friends and family there is always something new going on with me and unless I talk to you at least once a week, more like once a day though, you will always hear the worst part of what my problems consist of. 

5. I can be demanding and hypocritical because I do not always take my own advice even if I know it’s the better choice. 

6. I can be indecisive. 

7. I’m going through some sexuality questioning stuff (idc that I’m 30) and I need someone I can feel comfortable talking with about that. 

8. I want to be a part of your life even if it’s long distance. You can call me or message me whenever you like,  and I’m up for late night talks or overseas friends who live in different time zones. 

9. I don’t want to only be friends with disabled or only friends with “regular” people. I want a mix of both. Everyone brings something to the table. 

10. I want to be encouraged and challenged by our friendship. I also want to do the same for you.

179,"Hey r/mentalhealth, I’m (36m) having an issue with a girl (31f) I briefly dated.

She seemed very clingy from the beginning and I ended our dating after about 2 weeks. However I was open to reminding friends and we spent some time together after.

Despite me making it very clear to her that we were not going to get into a relationship, she still was upset that I wasn’t showing her enough attention. Then, when at a dinner with some of my friends, she for the shock value, blurted out some private about our intimacy. That was not ok. When confronted she told me she’s on the autism spectrum and she says stupid stuff because of that.

More recently, she keeps on sending me angry texts telling me how she hates my friends, like she’s just looking for attention. Then two nights ago she showed up at my friend’s house unannounced and badmouthed me to my poor friend. Then yesterday she seemed normal and apologized. But then last night it was back to these awful texts.

Can anyone shine some light on what mental issue(s) she may be dealing with and how I can best deal with her? I want a peaceful resolution, but I don’t want to encourage vindictiveness from her.

I’m really confused. I know I’m a shy girl who likes helping other people, but sometimes I feel so lost.

I feel like I need to put a label on myself. I like watching videos on how to make food and I like traditional values and being very feminine and kept to myself and a bit of a geek. But, when I think about that those descriptors sounds like I could label myself as someone who’s traditional.

Does that even make me happy? I really love philosophy, anime, video games, and cosplaying and when I think about these descriptors I feel that it falls under an edgy egirl. Or, I really love nature and self expression, especially in art, I don’t really like dressing in that type of way but when I think about it those things fall under a more hippie and free girl.

Just over 3 years ago, I got in a massive fight with housemates (reason for the fight is irrelevant, it was honestly just fucking stupid and unnecessary 19 year old drama), who used to be my best friends. One of them in particular said verbally abusive things to me, mocked me, called me a baby, and undermined my mental health issues (at the time I was severely depressed, cutting, and suicidal), basically calling me a pussy and saying my problems don’t matter. She even went as far as to laugh at me in my face as I was bawling my eyes out on the floor. The way she acted was completely fucked up and I don’t even understand how somebody could say such things to someone who was supposed to be one of their closest friends. Obviously, after this instance, I cut ties with her and have never spoken to her since. 

However, I can’t help myself but to look at her instagram every once in a while. Long story short, I moved on with my life and my depression ended up worsening, until I finally cracked and got diagnosed with bipolar. I had to drop out of school for a bit which put me really behind for my undergraduate degree, I’ve had a plethora of failed and toxic relationships (both romantic and platonic), and I’ve lost a lot of confidence in the process. I haven’t really done anything special like travelling or working on my career. 

She, on the other hand, seems to have gotten more confident, I hate to admit it but she looks a lot prettier than she used to. She seems to be in a healthy relationship, travels a lot, and is extremely successful with her degree and internships. She’s graduated, and got accepted to a top medical school with very low acceptance rates. 

I hate that I can’t stop comparing myself to this vile person. I hate that I still hate her. I hate that I feel terrible about myself in comparison to her. I hate that I care so much. I hate that sometimes I feel slightly fulfilled, and then I can’t help myself but look at her social media... and then suddenly, I feel like a failure. 

I don’t know how I can get over the anger. Every time I look at her IG, I feel like dying and I get jealous. It’s been over three years, and I still feel so pissed. I just thought that she’s a terrible person, so terrible things would happen to her. But it seems like her life is going amazing. How do I stop obsessing over this person from my past? I literally have nothing to do with her and it pains me that she’s doing so well and has such a good life in comparison to me.

192,"Greetings everyone :)

&amp;#x200B;

I feel incredibly guilty by even considering the possibility of having PTSD, but I've struggled a lot in the last few years, without really understanding why. When Google brought up PTSD, I didn't even click the links; doing so, suggesting that I might have that disorder from an experience that would have been, for someone else, rough but not traumatising (more details in the next paragraphs), would have been plainly disrespectful towards war veterans or sexual assault survivors, to cite a few.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, I spent those years believing that I was just a mess. And I still do, to be honest; but a few days ago, someone mentioned PTSD to me, as a possible explanation for (some of) my struggles. I am going to talk about it to my psychiatrist in a week when I see her, but until then, I thought it would be interesting to learn from other sources (and, to be honest, I don't think I would be able to go a whole week in such a level of uncertainty).

&amp;#x200B;

First, I think I should mention the experience. Note that I'm fully aware that the situation is far less violent or traumatising than what PTSD sufferers usually go through - and, once again, I feel guilty just mentioning it. But I've always been severely hypersensitive, terrified of being alone and done everything I could to avoid that, and have always needed some degree of certainty about my future (at least for the following 4-5 years), and, as you will see, all of these were strongly threatened back then.

I'll try to give you the tl;dr since this post is already getting long. After the end of high school, I went to another city where I knew no one in order to continue my studies, which were very selective and competitive. I didn't want to be in a competitive environment, but it was the ""usual studies"" for people with a similar profile, so I went there. After two or three years of intensive studies, students took very hard exams that lasted 3 or 4 weeks total, and whose results determined what school they got into. And, to do what I wanted to do (research), there was only one school that was ""fit"". Problem is, it was one of the hardest to get, so I asked my first year teacher to help me prepare for it. He said something like ""Aaaah, I'm not sure you can do it, we'll have to wait and see"".

At the start of the second year, I asked my teachers again, who basically told me that there was no chance - which, of course, destroyed me. I tried to pick myself up, thinking that I'd show them that I could. I started the year with excellent results, so I went to them and asked them again. What they told me was that I had absolutely no chance, that I should give up, and other very hurtful things. Around the same time, my first long-term girlfriend left me, and I lost my then-best friend. All teachers, and other students, started criticizing me behind my back, saying that I was too pretentious to accept my limits, that I thought I was better than everyone else, etc., which hurt me deeply. Once again, I was broken.

I basically had no strength left, at all. I barely listened in class, didn't do any homework, etc. I managed to work one afternoon every week, but that was it. At the end of the year, the exams came, and, long story short, I didn't get the school I wanted, but was very close to it - which was a great result for someone coming from this ""preparation school"". So I asked my teachers if I could do a third year to try again (which was a common practice), and they refused. Once again, I was broken. 

A friend convinced me to send my resume to other ""preparation schools"", hoping that some of them won't be as stubborn as the one I was in. Almost all of them refused, but one accepted - it was even further away (on the other side of the country), and very well rated, so it would be veeery hard for me to even follow along there, but I had to try. So I went. That year was incredibly stressful and tough, but I got along with the teachers and students well, so it wasn't as bad as the one before it.

After 3 more weeks of very intense exams, I ended up getting the school I wanted - which was great, but I was left with this looming sense of anxiety, pain and solitude that I have had since.

These three years played on all of my worst pressure points. My hypersensitivity - people criticizing me, explicitly or behind my back, my girlfriend leaving me, losing friends. My fear of loneliness - I went from living with my parents to being alone in another city... I guess my gf leaving me also counts in that category. My fear of unplanned future - as long as I hadn't taken the exams, I couldn't know what I would do, where I would be, in the following years, or the rest of my life. Also, I'm terrible at handling stress as a whole, and all the obligations I had, the stress of the upcoming exams (that teachers constantly reminded us of), and the terror of actually going through those 3 weeks, literally froze me in place at times.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I think I should go over the symptoms I'm experiencing. I was about to say that I feel like I'm constantly reliving those years, but it's rather that I never stopped living it. That means constant dreams about it (I can't say whether it's \*every\* night or not, since I don't remember my dreams every night, but I can say it's very frequent, at least every other night). And, when I'm not dreaming about the experience, my dreams involve the exact same kind of stress, pain, and loneliness involved in it. I feel like nobody I meet ""knows"", that no matter how hard I try, I can never connect with people because of it. I don't think I'm suffering from insomnia (possibly because my chronic depression makes me constantly tired? I'm not sure). I don't think I have ever been able to properly focus since then, including in my following studies. I have a lot more symptoms, but the others might be connected with some other mental illnesses, so I would rather end here, with the symptoms I think are most likely linked to... whatever this is.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm deeply sorry if anyone with PTSD feels offended by my post... Like I mentioned, I feel awful just writing it (I have been procrastinating it for days now). But I'm kind of lost, and I could use any lead you guys might have.

193,"I hate myself. I hate myself so much that it ruins everything I try to do. I feel like I can't move forward because I'm so convinced that I'm a piece of shit who deserves nothing. Do you know what I mean? And this type of thinking is so ingrained in me that I can't escape it. It just feels like it's in my nature. I've accepted that I'm just one of those people who isn't cut out for life. And how am I supposed to argue with that? The evidence is so overwhelmingly stacked against me. I have not progressed as a human being one millimeter since I was in middle school. And now, I'm lying in my bed, and I just wish I didn't exist. I wish I didn't have to do or say or think or feel anything. And there's a part of me, there's this tiny little part of my that doesn't want to feel this way.

195,"I've been with my boyfriend for almost a year now. He knows about my mental health issues, which obviously COVID has not been helping with. My boyfriend, meanwhile, has decided to take this as an opportunity to start working out and taking his health more seriously, and he really, REALLY wants me to do it too. He wants me to track calories, exercise regularly, and in general take better care of myself. And like, that's great. I appreciate how much he cares. But when that pressure is there, all it does is make me feel worse when I fail.

I have tried to explain to him that I cannot find the motivation to do this with him. That I support him on his journey, and that I am trying to want to join him, but that I just can't right now. He says, ""is my concern for you not enough?"" And I just can't find a way to explain to him that it isn't without him feeling dejected. I just don't care about myself enough to put energy into my health.

I want to want to be healthy. I want to want to be happy. But he wants me to move so fast, and I literally just got back into therapy a month ago. That was a huge, difficult step, and I don’t think he understands that these ""few little changes"" for him are big changes for me.

197,"2020 has definitely been the worst year of my life and I am not coping well at all. I have had to deal with a lot of issues on my own and now I just feel like giving up and disappearing off the face of the earth because I am convinced nothing is going to get any better and I don't have the energy to fight anymore. 

\- There is a chance that I have PTSD because of an incident that happened in January but I still haven't been diagnosed. I barely go out of the house, I always jump out of my own skin at any unexpected noise, I always on high alert even when I'm at home.

\- My grandfather passed away earlier this year (I hadn't seen him since I was very young), none of my father's side of the family even bothered to tell me so I had to make the difficult decision to cut them out of my life. My mother told me none of them ever bothered with me throughout my whole life which is true because none of them have ever been interested in me going to visit them.

\- I don't have any friends at all. Sounds generic I know but I am certain I really don't. I have always felt like I never had any real friends, that I didn't fit in anywhere, that I have never been apart of anybody's social circle. I was always the last to know about everything, left out of social gatherings and whenever I'd have something to say, I would get ignored. Back when I found out my grandfather died, nobody in my friendship group said a thing so I decided to leave them to it. Lockdown has even confirmed that I have no friends. I barely received any messages from anybody asking me if I'm ok or how I'm coping. I only received messages from about four people but they were people that I wasn't particularly close with and the conversations just felt like they weren't going to last very long. I deleted all of my social media (Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram) because all I was doing was scrolling through all three and the only notifications I would get were people going live and adding to their stories, I didn't even bother to tell anybody because nobody would give a shit.

\- My mental health is all over the place. I also suffer from depression and anxiety. Almost every day, I am depressed. Today was my second breakdown in a row. Every day is always the same: I wake up, be a depressed all day with no energy to do anything whatsoever, go upstairs, stay in my room and so on. I am meant to be getting help and support from an organisation called Healthy Minds but I am not happy with them at all, I don't think they are helping at all and I have been on-and-off with them at least three times now. I feel like I am going around in circles with everything and nothing is changing. I am always irritated and I'm starting to have urges to smash everything in sight. I am frightened that one day that I will go mad and it will be too late. I know that I have changed as a person and I hate it. I just don't know what to do anymore.  I have had thoughts of ending my life and going missing so many times this year. All I ever wanted in life was to be happy and have a good life but you can't always get what you want...",03Sep2020,1
198,"Its not being able to have a happy moment and immediately questioning the feeling and just complete loss of identity confusion about how i'm actually feeling constantly so hyper aware that i cant separate my actual reality with the false one. Loss of desire or any attraction making life seem much more like a chore than an experience that I should be loving. Having a feeling like a cant tell the difference between what i hold most dear and my biggest fear. Having everything that I held so high up come tumbling down. It seems like the best part of the day is waking up and that 10 seconds of not having the constant intrusive thoughts until i realise what happened and it starts all over once again. The depressive moods states that make the world seem so grey or the high anxiety constantly keeping you from enjoying whats happening in front of you feeling that you don't deserve this because you are a horrible monster. It just feels like that the once happy guy and becoming a good person living a fulfilled life just didn't seem as exciting anymore. Feeling loved felt unwarranted because I didn't feel like i deserved it anymore. I don't deserve friends i am the worst person on this planet. Its the doubt that I actually I don't have OCD and that iv'e always been in denial about it my whole life without knowing it that everything iv'e ever done is one big lie and i'm hiding it behind a mental illness just to be in more denial. It just feels like Ive forgoten how to love and how to fall in love and my worst nightmare is coming to life.

Would I go back and Change it? Absolutely not It has made me a much stronger person and I love myself a bit more i'm more intelligent about things i thought i could never learn Iv'e found people who have the same struggles I do and having that little bit of hope that I can become a bigger person by the end of it. I'm  more empathetic and compassionate then ever before become even closer to my friends and having such a good support network and knowing that one day this shall haunt me no more it does not define me anymore I can see through your lies no matter how convincing you may seem you shall not overcome me anymore I am more than my past and the past will always behind me. I am not what my OCD says I am no matter how loud it gets I know its all lies now you have no power over my happiness anymore you cant control me anymore I wont listen to what you tell me.

I have been getting better slowly and have had very good progress made to helping me heal and get on with life but I just felt i needed to type this out because i wanted to express my emotions more as it makes me feel better.

200,"So basically some years back I was at the school vaccinations. After a few hours of panic attacks the nurses gave up on trying and I got chewed out on the way home from school by my mom. The next year the same thing happened. About a year later I went to see a therapist and they helped a bit but there was something my parents had to do which they wouldn't.

So anyway these days whenever anyone talks about vaccinations and stuff I get emotional. The context depends on how emotional I get, but it's mostly stuff about consequences of not getting vaccinated or directly talking about getting vaccinated. At least I'm a bit better than a few years ago, when just thinking about it could leave me in tears for hours. There was even this one time when I was looking at my fountain pen and thought how it looks slightly like a needle, then the thoughts came rolling in.

However, i realized I’ve distracted myself so much that I’ve forgotten certain things that used to hurt me so I continuously try to seek that out too; like literally having to stop and think oh that hurt me let me think about it because I forgot it hurt me. I’m not sure if this is what moving on is or if it’s a distraction. Maybe one reason I hold onto things is because I feel that if I let it go, it would be like the past didn’t exist and it was all for nothing. I feel there’s a lot unresolved but I’ve distracted myself for so long that I don’t know how to handle anything. 

I’m scared about this apathy of sorts. I don’t care for anything anymore that much apart from random breakdowns where I do care and feel sad. For instance , I haven’t really understood the concept of a pandemic virus going on because I’ve been in my own bubble of depressed distraction. It feels like I’m going crazy sometimes.

I met a guy last year at a former job.   It was instant chemistry.  I just wanted to hang out with him all the time--  I thought his personality was so infectious and charming.   

Although I ignored the red flags for the most part.  That is where I will take accountability for being an utter idiot.   When a week past, he asked for my number.   He asked me on a date to a renn faire.   I was so happy even though he was rushing so much.   He was even picking out the wedding colors and what /he/ would want, and that was maybe within the first few days of dating...   I do remember being sick though shortly after we started dating and how I developed my first cold sore on my lip (he admitted later he knew he gets them and was sorry for not telling me.)

Two months later, he convinces me to find an apartment with him.  We both sign a lease together.   Yes, this is where my stupidity multiplies by 100.   

Shortly after moving in, and even I introducing him to my family (who also can be toxic), the BF then shifted, changed.   His personality was no longer so inviting or infectious.   He was suddenly getting stressed that I wasn't working immediately after moving in.  Even though I spent years bring on disability income, I applied to at least 9 jobs before finally getting one in retail.  

It was so hard to adjust to working for me again.   And that honeymoon phase died after only 3 months.   I should of known this relationship wasn't going to last.  

Overtime, he began to blame me constantly for things.  And then I started watching him lying, constantly, and even though I would catch him, he would never admit to it or acknowledge it.   The lies never stopped.   

I almost jumped off the apartment balcony because of a lie he was telling to my face, ""You are not paying rent "".  He said it over and over, even though I /was/.   He messed do much with my head.  Still does.  

The trust was breaking.  He wanted to be the one to talk and I couldn't interject or give feedback without him saying, ""No, I am not done"" or ""No, no, we are not talking about that"" or something to that effect.  

My brother then committed suicide in August.   I never knew how hard this grief would hot me.   My BF always went on about grieving for his father or other people and friends in his life he lost, but when I was in grief..   While he was initially supportive and holding me...  One day I take a nap and wake up to find his mother talked him out of not going with me to the funeral.   

I was so angry.  Tbh, my anger got a lot worse as our relationship even progressed.   Even before my brother died.   My BF had always held that against me.   Tbh, we both had brought up things in the past that had hurt each other, but I felt like that became more important to him to do than to try to help me through my anger.   

I go to the funeral on my own.   My BF had 2 guy friends over the night before of my brother's funeral and I became do upset when it got to be past 11pm at night and the guys night wasn't ending.   He couldn't even take 10 minutes to talk to me.   I had to beg him to call.     He did.   He later revealed he apparently let his friend listen in on our phone conversation.  

The thing is, the BF's ego became more profound, or maybe it started to be harder to ignore.   

The night our relationship essentially ended was about a week ago.   I caught him texting someone at nearly midnight.  My anxiety and insecurity got to me, yes...  And I asked who he was texting.  He said it was work.  I later found out by looking at his texts that it was a female mutual friend of ours.  I didn't really read it, but at the time it seemed like nothing to warrant lying about.   But then I stand by the door to the bathroom as he was showering...  He didn't see me there.  And he just mutters under his breath, ""I'll just have her locked in a psychiatric ward."" 

I broke.  I said, ""I can hear you "".  I ran off to a park, in the dark, at 1:30am.   I sat on a swing and was trying to text a friend who was still up.   I didn't want to go back.  

I didn't.  I went to a Crisis Center that morning.  I have called them a number of times since.  I have spoken with 3 crisis hotline volunteers.  All within a week.   

Yesterday, I found out that my BF was waiting for me to pay my portion of rent and then he wants me released from the lease.   I never went through this before and dealt with a bad anxiety attack.   

Honestly, the anxiety attacks haven't stopped.   I am feeling light headed and my chest hurts.   I don't really eat anymore.  I have no appetite most of the time.  

I don't want to go to work tomorrow, but I do have to keep working.   I need money to get out of this psychologically abusive situation.   I even had cut my family out of my life the other day, I just don't want to hear from them.   They just continue to let me down and hurt me too.

I do feel calmer and maybe a bit more present, but now my mind is... blank. Like my intrusive thoughts are gone, but my emotions and connection also don’t feel right. I can feel emotions inwards, but not about things. I feel like my passion for science is still gone. Instead of the happy daydreams I usually get, my mind is now empty. It feels like the only thoughts I can conjure are intrusive ones. I don’t want this, I never wanted this. I want my emotions and passions back. I want to feel that chaotic energy with the world. I want to get engrossed in a good story, but I forgot how to. I forgot how to be passionate. I haven’t felt this disconnected from my passion for science in my life. I don’t feel like I can feel anger at people who deserve it, I don’t feel like I can connect with others still. I just feel like I’m... calm. Calm but empty. I wish I did these meditations BEFORE I started questioning myself and which things were somehow related to my intrusive thoughts. I want to feel emotional. But I feel... nothingness. I don’t feel bad, but I don’t feel good either. I feel like I emptied my mind, but now I’m dissociated with an empty mind. Everything feels like it happened so long ago, like it’s all a distant memory. Like it was never real. I want to feel with the same intensity that I did before. I want love, happiness, sadness, anger, passion, excitement, empathy, even fear. I feel like I’m gone. Gone and calm about it. Or maybe I am panicking again. I’m afraid I’ve given up everything. I can’t feel my passions or my joys. I can’t relate to my comics, I cant relate to real people. I can’t even relate to animals anymore. 

...as I was writing this, the anxiety came back. But it didn’t feel as strong. I feel like I’m sad about being stuck in my own head. I feel afraid of intrusive thoughts latched onto my passions. I just want to be the guy I was 2 months ago. The guy from June. I was 21 for about a month and felt like I was grounded in reality. I had passions, dreams, hopes, aspirations, I had anger and sorrow and joy. I could appreciate stories and deeply analyze them. I analyzed all sorts of things. I was often so deep into some crazy wonderful thoughts, that I wouldn’t notice the intrusive stuff. Now I feel nothing. I let an intrusive thought take hold of me and ruin EVERYTHING. I feel like seeking therapy is all I have now. I’m probably condemned to this life of unfeeling now. This life where I can’t think or feel. I’m numb... sure I can think ABOUT things, but it’s... different. I don’t know if I like this. It’s so much quieter than my usual hectic mind. But I appreciated my hectic mind. Often lost in thought, always full of some sort of emotion. Even my anxiety wasn’t really a problem. Worrying about real life stuff: my grades, my family, my friends, animals, my future, my health. I have this cold buzzy feeling on the back of my head. I want to just feel normal. Not numb, not apathetic, not emotionless, not like I’m some sort of sociopath, I want to be ME. My passion for science, games, my friends, my art. I don’t feel any of it. I fee like I let too much go. I feel like I’ll NEVER be myself again.",03Sep2020,1

I know he doesn’t mean anything by it, and he doesn’t understand what it’s doing but it hurts a bit to know that I explained it and it’s still coming up. 

On another note, he used to say “you’re a healthy person” or “this room is what a healthy teen’s room looks like” and now anytime I feel depressed or panic-y in anyway, I feel like I must be faking it. And maybe that’s a whole other issue and it’s not gaslighting but I think about those phrases constantly. 

I don’t know. Thanks for reading I guess, maybe you’ve felt this as well?",03Sep2020,1

my parents are divorced, i live with my dad but he comes home like once 2-3 months and he stays for like  2 weeks and i became so lonely bc i live in the countryside and i dont have kids my age and all my friends are in the nearest town that i cant go when i want bc we dont have busses exept the one for highschool... so i started feeling lonelier and lonelier not only bc of friends but i also didnt have any parent around me and only my grandma and shes always making me feel like i have to do great things like get good grades bc she has to tell people how well she rased me, she just want to impress  people and she always says to me that if she werent there to push me to learn i would never be able to get good grades (she didnt even go to highschool and i am in highschool) and that makes me to not study. so im getting bad greades and live in a country with no future so i need good grades so i can leave. and i actually tried to leave, to go to my mom that always told me that im distanced from reality and that i dont live a normal life and i didnt belive her cuz i was 8. but she was right cuz when i told my dad i wanna move with her he didnt let me and told me if i move i should stop loving him bc he waste his time rasing me only for me to go to my mom. that destroyed me so bad. he was so ready to give up on me only because i chosen to put myself first cuz i felt so lonely. so basically every good memory with him from the past became bad bc for him it could turn so easily into a waste of time. he told me i can leave... but that was just a lie bc he didnt and i was so sure that i was going to leave that i couldn't imagine myself here anymore and i could feel like i was already leaving... but that didnt happened and its so hard for me to process all of this and i also feel like all the ""love"" my dads side gave me was fake so ""i love you"" became just a lie, when someone tells me they love me i cant belive it anymore, and currently im in a related and the person im dating says to me ""i love you"" multiple times a day and i get mad cuz i dont trust it and i would tell them that but i dont wanna hurt them. i also feel like life has lost meaning, and that i just keep failing i cant get myself to actually get things done and i feel so guilty for it cuz i know imma regret it. all these thing just eat me alive. it somewhat feels like i can feel only anger and i end up saying things i regret.
i sometimes wish i didnt see that my life is better only when im with my mom, i wish i kept ignoring her and now im stuck here feeling lost and not seeing meaning in anything cuz i feel hopeless here and unloved and loney. i just wished to live with both of my parents like most my friends do, and i feel so mad at myself for being so jealous of them.",03Sep2020,1
225,"I've always accepted my anxiety with secondary depression. But I suppose, thanks to the amount of time we have at home to ruminate on things, I'm realizing that my mental health problems are a lot more severe than I thought they were. I've struggled with anxiety my whole life, but its frustrating looking back and realizing that most obstacles I've experienced have been because of my anxiety and the issues it lends.

I'm realizing now that it wasn't normal to be paralyzed with fear, crying myself to sleep in high school because of my fear that I would choose the wrong degree in university and subsequently fail, find no job, and become homeless. Or that not everyone gets so easily overwhelmed that they just want to sleep, with typical life things like driving or having to apply for a job or finishing an assignment. Or how I can't be on instagram because my anxiety races so high. 

My medication works, and I feel so much better than when I'm not on it, but man, is it upsetting that even with medication I still need to deal with my anxiety and attempt to function like a neurotypical human being. I still get tired easily, I still have problems with focus and concentration, I still get caught in spiralling thoughts really easily. All this and more on top of the usual struggles any person goes through. I go to therapy and am so much better but...feels like at the end of the day I am still so much more behind compared to other people my age.

And, I'm doing the best I have been doing in a long time - I've gone back to school for a degree in something I love, and am creating really useful connections in the industry I will be entering, my relationship with my partner is continuously improving and becoming even more wonderful, my friends are wonderful. But its so frustrating knowing that all of this could have been even better if I just DIDN'T have my anxiety. I'm smart, I have great ideas, I work hard, I am well-liked by those around me. BUT MY MENTAL HEALTH!!!! It's like I'm living life always going 2 steps forward, 1 step back, and yeah I guess I am moving forward, but at a really, really slow pace compared to my same aged peers. Things wouldn't have happened so late for me, and things would take so much of a shorter time like other folks if I didn't have these mental health problems. Everyone else is getting promoted, buying houses/condos, moving out of their parents. Me? I'm in school for another undergraduate degree I guess? Still living at home. Had mental breakdowns at my first professional job even though I was doing well at it.

I don't know what I'm looking for or why I'm ranting. Just upset that I'm sick enough that my life is severely impacted in so many ways? Or upset of where I'm at in life compared to others. I don't know.",03Sep2020,1

227,"Hello everyone! 

You may wondering why I asking for this now, so let me put my question in context: 

I'm a 24 (male) years old university student. I was really socially awkward until the end of highschool. I had no friends or relationship. Then at the university I started to develop my social skills. I got some amazing friends, and I started my first serious attempt to get s girlfriend back in February - so just before the whole Coronavirus pandemic thing. I was mislead and I got rejected in march. Therefore I had a very bad mood during the lockdown, I just lost in my bad thoughts and I couldn't care with my mental health. The summer was better because the lockdown was partially lifted and I could met with my friends. 

So, my problem is that I start my last year at the university shortly. Therefore I will separated from my friends (or at least I can't see them very often) and the Coronavirus just started to hit again so we are expecting for an another lockdown. I'm studying abroad, so this time if this happens I will separated from my family too. 
I'm feeling quite OK actually, but I fear I'll be quite lonely in the next few months. So I was wondering if someone could advice some techniques to bare the loneliness better this time. 

Thanks for your help! :D

228,"Hi all, 

I would like to start this letter by saying I am relieved to realize I am not the only one struggling with any form of mental health issues and I hope by writing this letter I can not only get years of discomfort of my chest but also hear you guys out on your struggles and how you cope with them. I would also like to add that English is not my native language and I thereby apologize for any confusion.

I was always the loudest in the room, the person that felt everyone I bonded with should not go home without a smile on their face. I wanted to make everyone happy and if I succeeded in doing so I would have a sense of happiness myself. 

As I’ve never really written anything down and have no idea how to structure a letter, I’ll just go down the timeline of some of the things I have a feeling have an impact on my way of thinking today. 

&amp;#x200B;

2008-2012 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to get bullied from the age of 8 to the age of 12, not severely as I could call some of those bullies my friends from time to time. It was a weird period in my life, every month or so someone else got bullied for some odd reason. 

I luckily had a loving older brother who was always there for me and took care of me whenever I was in need for help. We were best friends and did everything together. although he could be an ass from time to time, I truly loved the dude and considered him as one of my best friends and vice versa. (keep him in mind as he plays a big role in my loss of mental stability later on)

At the time it was an unpleasant experience, but I don’t really think it added that much weight on the “struggles” I carry today.

I just wanted to throw this period in here as I’m not sure how mental health develops over time and if I could still carry any form of “trauma” from those days even though I’m pretty sure it hasn’t impacted my life today all that much. I moved to a different school as I got older and was in a good place with good people around me. 

&amp;#x200B;

2015-2016 

At the age of 15 I moved to Cambridge for a year and I honestly had the best time of my life. I had met some of the best people that I will forever hold close to my hearth although I most likely won’t meet them again. When I look back at it now, this was definitely the year where my mental health was at its best.

&amp;#x200B;

2017

I finish my year in Cambridge and get back home. Although I had seen my family a few times during my stay in Cambridge it was nice to be able to spend a lot of time with them and my friends again. Unfortunately, my version of spending time with my family differed from what reality gave me. I realized my loving brother wasn’t really who he was anymore. His love and care turned into hate and bigotry, he reminded me of my bullies. I got to learn he made a new set of friends and I quickly noticed that these friends were a very bad influence on him. They were bad people, criminals. Not only did they literally steal they also stole a valuable bond both me and my brother had been working on for years. I was angry and frustrated but still focused. I had things in control.

He’s negativity quickly progressed into something much bigger. It felt like I was living with a stranger in my own home. Before I go on, I’d like to make It very clear that my parents did everything in their power not to let him take the wrong path in life. They are literal gem’s and I will always love them with every single tiny piece of love there is left to give. 

This year consisted of my brother breaking stuff in our home when things wouldn’t go his way, my parents trying their hardest to not let their kid fall in his own pit he’s dug and quite frankly me in the middle of everything not wanting to speak up as I didn’t want to make matters worse. My antidote during that time was going out of the house and drinking till I forgot what happened. I was not by any means an alcoholic, but I did know it was an easy way of forgetting the misery that was playing out at home. I had lost my best friend and didn’t want to admit to it.

&amp;#x200B;

2018 

I feel like this is the year everything went south. My brother went from being angry when things didn’t go his way to being angry all the time. He became a bully and always had a need to show that I wasn’t going to amount to shit and that I live under his rules. Not mine, not my parents, HIS.

He started finding interest in Muay Thai. For those unfamiliar, Muay Thai is a combat sport that combines the use of your fist, knees, elbows and shins. He wanted to join a club, but my parents would just not allow him to do so both out of fear of him getting hurt and fear of him hurting other’s as... you know, him being him and all. 

I took it upon myself to convince my parents to let him do it as out of the little knowledge I had about combat sports at the time I did know the importance of combat sports is teaching discipline and I had a good feeling it would results to him learning about how to control and form his aggression into a passion. I thought it would be a good way for him to spew out any aggression he had during his training in his club and he’d come home with only love to offer and this was definitely the case in the beginning.

However, it quickly shifted to the punching bag at the club not being enough. I was his new punching bag. He came home frustrated about someone or something I have no clue about, and he would start beating me If I tried to spark a conversation or would offer him help. It was bad. I was hurt and refused to tell anyone. My parents were the only ones who knew and that was only when my wounds were visible. Like bloodshot eyes when he choked me unconscious in front of a friend as I tried defending myself from him harming me. Something new he learned I guessed. Or the few times I had to walk around with bumps on my head from either a fist or shoe or whatever throwable object. 

I didn’t have things in control anymore. I got to learn my first signs of mental health disorders. Paranoid, depression I was barely sleeping. I was angry, inside my house I was a victim and outside I became the very thing I wished not to ever become. I became somewhat of a bully myself. I wasn’t friendly anymore, you have feelings? I don’t fucking care, you have no right to have them as mine have been taken away. I have no control, and neither should you. I was a bigot and started treating people the very way my brother treated me. I didn’t beat people but instigated fights and had to figure out how to get rid of this anger somehow. I’m ashamed of the person I became. I was empty, numb. 

&amp;#x200B;

2019 

It’s the year 2019 and things haven’t been all that better. 

I start distancing myself from people even more. It used to be just “ah fuck that person, I don’t need them anyway” to “it’s me against the world.” I was quick to drop people who did something minor that didn’t sit with me too well and only got to realize now that most of it was out of their control. I still had friends but not the good ones for the most part. I’ve also learned that finding peace in loneliness makes me comfortable and it is pains me to even write it down. It’s scary and I want to change this.

I started drinking heavily. I’m 18 at this time and for a period of 6 months I was drinking daily every night until my liver couldn’t hold anymore. At the time I was convinced it wasn’t a problem and just me being at the legal age to finally buy my own alcohol and being able to be somewhere else instead of home. I stopped drinking and only drink from time to time now.

I try to look happy but I’m not. For the first time suicide pops in my head. Why am I here? Why is it that every time I try something that I could benefit from it fails but every time I do something that shouldn’t be done, I succeed in doing so. How can I be good to people without being good to myself? 

Those two gems I was talking about. Yeah, they saved my life. Without my parents I wouldn’t be here. Their unconditioned love outweighed the hate I received from not only my brother but myself. I love these people, they are the two angles life wanted me to have.

&amp;#x200B;

2020 

It’s 2020, I’m turning 20 this year, holy shit. I need to start thinking about my life. How will I be making money? If I have a family, I want them to be good. 

For the first time I value my life, my choices and how I go about things. I’m friendly again and greet people with a smile. I try to make everyone as comfortable as I can. 

I almost completely don’t touch alcohol anymore, but I did start smoking weed at night. Kind of like my own therapy session, I could ask myself things I’m worried about without this filter that telling me not to care or telling me “you’re not wrong, they are”. Weed made me solve problems I had logically and calmed me down quite a lot. I don’t smoke during the day as I like being productive and I really only like smoking it when I’m alone so I can think about my choices in life. 

My brother and I haven’t fought this year, which is (crazy to say) an achievement. Were better to each other but I will never be like it was. We talk here and there but we’ve definitely lost sight of friendship and value to one another. I miss it but I can’t force him to miss it too.

For the most part I am in a really good mindset now. I’ve developed a “fuck it” mentality and try not to care what people think. However I have noticed that I have gained a lot of anxiety. When I walk the streets in my city, I have a feeling that people are staring, and that people are judging me. Paranoia? No clue where that could come from. I’m not good with groups anymore and I’ve developed a slight stutter. I’m not that good with words and somehow lost the knowledge of starting meaningful conversation although I have a lot to talk about. I think I have slight form of OCD as I do recognize symptoms of it and apparently It puts thoughts in your head that aren’t true, could this be it? 

As of now after a few months of feeling really good, this week I fell into a pit again. I don’t even know why but I woke up feeling off and it’s been like this the whole week. I was convinced that I “beat” depression, but I’m scared it has come for a visit again. 

I have never been checked for depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. as somehow knowing the truth scares me. Right now, I can still convince myself that these are things I THINK I have, and I’m scared once I read it on paper that I’ll feel abnormal and I’ll have an excuse not to go out and meet people etc.

How have some of you coped with knowing about your depression? Can you learn to have control over it? Is there actually a cure? I’m afraid of taking pills as I’ve heard a lot of people say it makes it even worse when you’re off. Should I visit someone who could help me out and if so who? I’d like to be able to do it on my own without anyone knowing. 

Well, that’s a glimpse of my life, I’m not even sure If anyone will read this but it feels good to get it out there. And if you are reading this, this is a 2000+ word letter, you’re crazy but I thank you! &lt;3

To the person that said to start writing as a form of therapy, I thank you also. Really, I’m at the end of my letter and It does feel like a huge weight has left my body. Even though it’s not a good letter I’m glad it’s out there. I hope this isn’t temporarily.

Been promoted to manager even though i am still meant to just be an apprentice
Got a long term girlfriend
Got my own place with my girlfriend

238,"Hi... I have english for my second language, so there will be a lots of mistakes, so close your eyes before reading it. I don't really wanna use my name so we should just call me Jessie. I think it's nice name. 

Everything started when I was little girl. Me and my cousin were the same age (I was few mounths older, but that's secret) but she was always the serious one and she was bigger... Not her body, but her presence. She was the queen and i was her pet. In the beggining I didn't really see it, I was always so optimistic and happy, I saw just the best in others. I didn't understand what was manipulating and dissemblance... I saw just the good things. Maybe I was ignoring everything bad, because my mother was devil, she took away my older ssister from me. Not directly, but my sister left us when I was very young and my mother was always mean to me because of it. I was happy for my sister, she was living with my dad and me with my mother. 
Everything changed when me and my cousin got a new phones with messenger. We were like 12 maybe. She was all of this time so depressed... I was there for her all the time. She was mean to me, but I was thinking ""that's alright, she's broken, she has the right for doing this"" And it was always like this until we were 17. Up to that moment I had most of friends from her friend groups. I didn't have anyone who was just my friend. But I was happy... Not much but the friends part was the best. I was suicidal before in the time when I was 13. I was always thinking about killing myself and I was broken. (I even tried many times, but it never happened) But I still was optimistic about others.. I was too naive. At that time I had real problems with my mother. I was forbidden to see my sister for christmas, which was the only day she was allowed to go to our house. I had big crisis and I found out that I don't like only men. It was pretty hard and my familly was angainst me. But I found one friend which was only mine. Not my cousins. But not for long she got that friend into her hands. She was still more my friend than hers, but was super big fan of my cousins work on social medias. Everyone was using me to get closer tu my cousin. But I thought it was normal and was helping them.
Now we're going back to time when I was 17... My cousin was talking to me like if I was garbbage... She was my queen and I was her slave. But at age of 16 I started going out with one girl and she told me what she thinks my cousin is doing to me. She said that my cousin was manipulating me and using me. For months I was telling her ""no she's not like that. She's just broken."" I was right she was really broken, but I didn't write her much, because I was with my gf and I didn't chat with any of my friends, I was madly in love. (and I still am) but when my cousin told me for 4 time to kill myself, I started thinking and wrote her at the night if she could be just i little bit nicer to me. But she couldn't. She was so furious... We are going to same school, so it's the worst, because I was always on good terms with everyone, but now I'm not. 
I made a lots of mistakes and apologised for them... She didn't... Our familly want's us to be friends again, but I can't... She was thinking that I'll always return to her, but I can't. Now I'm tired. I sleep 3 hours a night every day and I'm always doing homeworks.
I hate myself, my friends are one after one turning their back at me and I can't take it. I feel their hate, because they like my cousin more. I still have my gf and she's very supporting, but I don't want to disappoint her... I love her, but I'm broken... I'm not as optimistic as before... I just want to run away with her and never see anyone again. I just want to die... If she wasn't here for me, I would be dead and I should be dead... I did many things wrong and now I'm posting my feelings online, because I can't do anything anymore. Maybe it seams like a little thing for you, but my whole world was constructed on my cousin... Now my world is on the ground and is building itself on my gf. From young age I didn't have anyone except my cousin... Now I feel really broken... I was good child, now I'm just teen in her body set on autopilot and is only living if I'm near my gf.

243,"I work with a lot of active duty and ex-military folk and a growing long overdue area of study in mental health care is MST or Military Sexual Trauma, usually defined by sexual violence experienced during military service. Sexual harassment, assaults, or threats of either by military personnel have been a problem for quite some time and more often than not was either covered up or minimized due to things like corrupted internal investigations and politics and whatnot. Now that awareness of this problem is starting to pick up I was wondering if something similar existed within law enforcement. 

Studies I've seen (so far) only reference police misconduct against the general population and although those studies are informative they haven't been helpful in answering my question. Is sexual violence by officers against other officers even a thing? If yes is there justice for the survivors or has it been similar response to the military? Sexual violence against the general population by officers is significant enough to make it difficult to for to believe that it's not a problem within the LEO community itself but I am prepared to be wrong.

244,"So my (19) older brother (22) was diagnosed with depression two years ago and after that he had so many scary breakdowns(I won't go into detail because it will be so long) and ever since I am constantly scared that he will have another breakdown. So whenever I think he is a little off I can't control myself from checking on him to see if he is ok or not. Also he blames my father for his depression because my father always did everything for him and my brother thinks that he controls everything and therefore he has low self esteem. And again whenever my father talks to him I am scared and anxious that he says something that triggers my brother and he has another breakdown. 
So I always make sure he is not sad and tell my parents don't say that or do that because it annoys him and recently i found his twitter and i check there to see if he had said something about being sad and stuff like that (I really hate doing this but i just can't stop)
So the question is how can I stop being so protective over him and just let him live his life because this is just ruining my mental health and  l already have anxiety and this is just making it worse.",03Sep2020,1
245,"I live in Melbourne Australia 
And under the currant legislation that’s being passed I cannot leave my house
I’m not aloud for more than 1 hour a day unless it’s too work or do grocery shopping 
We’re locked in our house from 8pm to 5am 
We face heavy fines 
We face massive sentences for breaking such a draconian law and it’s slowly but surely eroding my mental health I can’t work I can’t see friends I can’t even see my own family 
This is slowly but surely destroying me inside and I’m not sure how much longer I can survive? 
Work home work home work then home home home our business are sufferings our mental health is suffering and the lack of funding there of our economy is suffering driving our businesses against the wall degrading our way of live and in record numbers men and teenage kids are committing suicide due to depression from this our way of life has being robbed from us our dignity stripped our hopes and dreams stomped and left in a gutter may god speed get us out of this mess i for one have no idea how much longer I can take it",03Sep2020,1
246,"I recently watched and read about the death of Daniel Prude in police custody.

From what I gathered, and please correct me if I'm wrong, the man was mentally ill, having an episode and high on pcp at the time.

The next part is a brief detailing of how he died, so if you don't feel like reading it please skip ahead. 

&gt;!The man was naked in the street, handcuffed with a spit mask on his head. His head was held face down on the pavement until he suffocated and was removed from life support a few days later.!&lt;

From the video I saw, he appeared to be fairly cooperative and not really struggling with officers. Which is more than reasonable for a man in the middle of a psychotic episode. 

I'm mentally ill and have psychotic episodes when I'm unmedicated, and something like his episode isn't too far from possibility for me.

Why did this man have to die, it makes me tear up thinking about life struggles and that's how it can end. Just have an episode on the wrong day and instead of receiving help a person gets killed.",03Sep2020,1
247,"To make a long story short:
How do I get rid of your parents inside my head?

I am completely not in contact with my parents for years now. A lot of shit happened in my childhood. Talking about it with a therapist makes me feel like a very bad person because I was always told not to talk about what happened at home. I'm terrified that they will walk in during a Therapy session what is ridiculous because we are not on speaking terms for years and they don't know where I am (I think) I hate the total fear I feel all the time. 
It feels like the worst decision ever  to talk about things that happened when I was a kid.
Everything that happened is my own fault anyway so I should stop talking about it And act normal",03Sep2020,1

250,"Just found this sub after posting a couple times on offmychest in the past.

 I am constantly anxious, to the point of being sick, and worried about everything. It mostly is triggered by work, I try to do everything right and often second guess myself, then worry the rest of the day. Like today, had a very good day, then I got asked if I checked something that was my responsibility to check, then I worry like crazy and cant sleep all night because I'm not 100% certain anymore. Im just so worried about doing something wrong.

 Its all the time. It has put a strain on my life and marriage. I will get myself into such a state and I am just not sure who I should be telling and of its even an issue.

 I know enough that this is not normal. And that if people just tell me to ""calm down"" or ""dont worry"" they are about as helpful as using petrol to douse a fire.

 I dont know why I have put the flair as need support. I believe from what I have looked up this is panic disorder. But with my job and family I have no idea who to tell and how to convince them im not just pulling this out of my arse. So I suppose I need someone to tell me if this is healthy or if I have some form of mental health issue that I should flag up.",03Sep2020,1

252,"     This is heavy on my head a lot so I just want the opinions of other people. Lately, my boyfriend won’t stay off his fucking phone. I don’t mind just getting on your phone to do something real quick or whatever but I will want to talk to him after he works on his car or works a night shift and i haven’t seen him since the night before but he will just be watching some shit on youtube or instagram. Like yesterday was his off day and he went and hung with friends and said he would be home soon since I wasn’t able to go with him and I was fine with it but I didn’t get a text til after I was asleep at like 11 and he got home after 12. (Which is another thing that bothers me. He seems to always be on his phone but when he’s out I have to pray for a text.) 

     Don’t get me wrong I am NOT that crazy girlfriend that expects you to text her 24/7 while you’re out because I know you wanna take time to hang out, but it’s just nice to have him check in and know when he’s coming home so I’m not just waiting around? Especially when he told me he would? 

    Then today, he worked on his car all morning and when he was done he came upstairs and started watching youtube. I asked what he was watching and he said it was something about a mortician or whatever and I was like 😐 dead bodies are more inretesting than me. 

     I just hate being mad or upset when I don’t know if it’s for a good reason or not. I love him a lot but I just don’t know if Im missing something because if it’s something on my part, i wanna get better. I will admit that I get a little sad when I don’t get attention sometimes and he knows that but I don’t know how to talk about it without seeming needy? Or maybe there is something I can do to come across as more interesting? Be honest please",03Sep2020,1

257,"As a once in a hundred year pandemic hits the world I am honestly feeling indignation for the world including my own community. I delight in the idea of the rich losing their money. They were haughty and trusted in their wealth, and now they cannot spend their retirement and twighlight years enjoying the excess of riches they accumulated by the unjust system they benefited from. I also am filled with wrath due to this ambitious spirit that fills the world, ambition for money and status. Now I also believe the lord of goodness feels the same way, and this is why I pose the question, is covid 19 a curse or a blessing? The answer in my opinion is both, and I will explain why. Many people have said that the god of the OT does not correlate with the God of the New Testament. How can a God of indignation and justice also be of goodness and forgiveness. How can a God of goodness allow plagues and famines? What good could come from a pandemic resulting in a future economic collapse? Let's think spiritual, losing all your riches, or losing the ability to spend your riches, naturally makes us look introspectivly at ourselves, our values and produces humility, a virtue you may not have otherwise sought. Also as a people we are seeing changes in our collective consciousness, we are asking questions, having conversations and thinking about different things. God is concerned about the second death, the spiritual death that takes place after the physical death for the unsaved. So it is out of mercy the god of goodness brings these plagues and crises. So that we have a spiritual blessing. I believe we are lucky as a generation to see such things, many generations have passed without a sign. We may not think this valuable because we don't believe in a god, or another kingdom in heaven, but that doesn't change the reality.",03Sep2020,1

I cant even describe the guilt and shame of this. I have my dream job, dream university course, everything and this is just ruining my life.

I am just scared of having to be a funcioning adult. I just dont want to have to think anymore.
