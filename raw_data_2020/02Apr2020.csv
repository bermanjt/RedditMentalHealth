0,Not sure if this is the right place to post this. I don't normally go to the internet for help with stuff like this but I feel if I tell anyone what is going on they'll think I'm a psychopath. I've been having thoughts about murdering someone. I can't use sharp objects when others are around I fear I might harm them. These thoughts are unwanted but are becoming regular. I constantly ask my friends if I'm a good person. I think I'm not one. What should I do? How do I bring this up with my counselor. All of this started after I started taking a new med. I've stopped taking it. Was that a good idea should? Should I start taking it again? Even after I've stopped the thoughts are still here.,02Apr2020,1
1,"I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but i can’t post in the Covid-19 Support group. I’m losing my mind 

I was feeling sick four days ago, had chest pain and couldn’t breathe easily when laying down. 

I went yesterday with my dad and grandma since she was feeling sick too (was coughing, having body pain) 

So i wasn’t coughing so i went inside and got a check up and was told it was sinus infection like allergies. 

My grandma got tested and it took a long time. Fast forward to today, She tested positive. 

She didn’t have a fever and didn’t feel too bad but she still got it. 

I was stuck in a car with her for 4 hours just waiting for the test to be done for some reason. 

My dad doesn’t listen and still goes out and visits her before all this. 

We have to self quarantine now. 


I’m so fuckjng scared. 

I’m overweight, and probably have a chronic illness for several things. My mom is 50 and doesn’t go the doctor. My dad doesn’t take things seriously, he doesn’t wash his clothes nor does he take responsibility for going out all the time to her house. My older sister has had bronchitis when she was younger and gets sick often. My younger sister is healthy but fuck she’s young, she has to live her life. 

My aunt and uncle are old man. They have knee problems and my aunt has cancer. I have been visiting them.... If i gave it to them and it killed them...

holy fuck holy fuck i’m having a mental breakdown. 

WE CANT EVEN GET TESTED IM SO FUCKED 

IS MY FAMILY GOING TO DIE?

AM I GOING TO DIE? 

I haven’t proven myself yet. I haven’t made my family proud yet. I have to live my life. My family should be there. MY FAMILY SHOULD BE HERE WITH ME.

2,"I am going through a mental health crisis and found myself here. I’m scared of myself. I’m not interested in cutting or something medically dangerous. I just realized I want to punish myself by hitting myself or sleeping on the floor or something like that. I mistakenly believe I will find relief in physical pain. Worst part is... I think I want to do it for the attention it might get me. I just want to be washed over with misery. These feelings are so unlike me and I’m so scared. I need guidance.
This is a call for help.",02Apr2020,1
3,"It’s hard to describe, but I’ve had this problem for a while and it has gotten progressively worse over time. 

Basically, it feels like my brain is never “on”. If I need to think about something, like REALLY think about something, I have to actively decide to think about it.

For example...

Situations where I don’t need to “think” (the answers are pretty obvious and don’t involve reflection or real decisions) - Am I hungry? What should I watch on TV? Should I do laundry?

In contrast, my therapist asked me how I was feeling these days, and I said “pretty neutral”. They asked what made it “neutral”, and although I told them it was because I felt neither good nor bad, I realized that I said “neutral” because it’s a non-answer and I haven’t really evaluated how I feel about my life. So I asked myself, how DO I feel about my life right now? And it felt like I was skimming the surface of a lake with a net and not really catching anything, because the question really needed me to THINK about my life and my feelings about it. But I couldn’t just THINK about it. It feels like there’s a little button in my brain that I just have to hit in order to activate it, but I can’t, or don’t want to. 

That’s just one example. The same thing happens when a friend asks how I liked the movie we just watched. It takes me so much effort to decide if I really like it or not that I usually just say, “it was good!” because I’d have to boot up my brain to generate a single critical thought. It’s not like a fear of having an opinion on something. It’s like my brain literally doesn’t have the energy to even form a complex thought.

Sometimes it’s hard for me to concentrate while I’m reading, like I read each word but the meaning doesn’t fully reach my brain. I used to be very, very advanced as a kid and I had excellent reading comprehension, so this is a relatively new thing.

My brain just feels sort of empty. It’s easier not to press the “THINK” button, easier to not really think about things too deeply. 

I also have some memory issues, like I’ll send a text and immediately forget what I sent. Sometimes I can’t even recall the gist of the message, or who I sent it to. But then I’ll look at the text and be like, “oh, yeah, I remember now.” 

When my coworkers ask what I did over the weekend, I draw a blank. I usually say “nothing” to avoid the embarrassment of having to switch my brain on a try to recall anything I did.

I guess it’s nonessential information, so my brain doesn’t try to store it. I have trouble remembering everything I did the day before, or what I had for lunch sometimes. It’s just “little” stuff like that, I can remember events, or conversations that I actively tell myself I should remember. But the little day to day stuff drifts away because it’s not as important and the days tend to blur together. I keep a journal and a planner to document what I do each day, otherwise it all blends.

Does anyone else experience stuff like this? I’m going to talk to my therapist about it, but I don’t know if I can describe it well enough to make sense. It just feels like my brain is... gone.",02Apr2020,1
4," 

Well I guess the title says it. I know that everyone is going through something or the other during this time period, it's pretty awful.

This is going to be a bit of a read.

Lately, I've felt beyond depressed and down. I am already diagnosed bipolar but I've been struggling with noticing my triggers and identifying patterns so I can yank myself out of an episode. I have tried to reach out to multiple people in my life, blatantly sharing that I am depressed and it is getting worse.

I'm posting here because I have an (almost) five year old daughter and to be honest this is the hardest fucking thing I've ever done in my life. I got pregnant at 17, experienced my abusive ex crying and begging for a child while my grandmother (raised me) verbally abused me to get me to abort. I actually set up an appointment to do so, but on the morning of the appointment my stepdad took me to the hospital instead to just see the fetus and decide there. I was 8 weeks or so, heard the heartbeat and broke down crying. I couldn't do it, so I told my family. They kicked me out, I move in with my ex, graduated high school then left to another state. While I was pregnant, I lived in a home with a lot of other teens and no adults, no water, only electricity. They sold drugs, I sat in a room all day hungry while my ex went out to cheat.

My ex abused me physically, mentally, financially, and any way possible here. Multiple black eyes, even one my mother saw when she visited me when I went into early labor at 28 weeks and did nothing. Basically, I dated my childs father until she was 3. He sexually abused me, I used to have embarrassing mental breaks sometimes and hit myself while he tried to come onto me so he would be so shocked that he would stop. Now I fear that all of this has mentally deteriorated me. I should also note that I had an abortion in 2016 (my daughter was born in 2015). I learned after the first time.

Now I live alone in a basement apartment with my daughter, she is properly loved and cared for. Our needs are met. She is happy. I am not. I am going through another breakup. I hopped in a relationship soon after I left my childs father as I mentally checked out way before our breakup. This most recent ex and I dated a year and a half before he decided he no longer wanted to date someone with a child. I feel like I've just experienced true love and a first true heartbreak. It's less about him and moreso about my looming loneliness. He also was my sanity. I get no adult interaction. I am alone. My family can't stand my daughter and I, they won't move in with us to help me. I do it all 100% alone. Financially and physically. I get no breaks. I'm 22 now, almost 23, and I just want to kill myself. I don't want to do this anymore. I am selfish. I want my youth, I can't support her, I fear I just passed on another generation of poverty and poor mental health. I can't do this.

My stepdad was the only one willing to hrlp but he works 80-90 hour weeks and now I can't even move in since it;s a tiny house and there would be 7 people.

I don't know what to do anymore. I hate this. I can't go to therapy as I can't afford it, and with the pandemic I lost my job so I have no money for it. Just spent the last of my money on this month's rent.

Please give me advice. I know this is all terribly selfish but I'm at my wits end.",02Apr2020,1
5,"I have been struggling with mental health problems for several years, like depression, severe anxiety, and PTSD. I see a therapist and a psychiatrist and have been on 7 different meds to try to help me. I just kept getting worse. I've been hospitalized 3 times and have attempted suicide twice. I'm 16.  
my parents decided to try to get me into more intensive therapy and were recommended DBT (dialectical behavior therapy, basically for patients with borderline, bipolar, and impulsive and things like self-harm) I had an interview sort of thing with one of the specialists and she diagnosed me with BPD. she didn't explain much about what that is.

8,"1. If you suffer from anxiety or depression (I have anxiety) - what meaningful things would be nice to hear from a friend? Something that isn't cliche, and really would show support. (I remember someone once told me that the definition of brave wasn't the same for everyone, and that whatever things I have done that I felt I needed to be brave for are the things I should be proud of. I have pinned that up by my desk and it truly has made a difference to my perspective of what being brave means.)

2. I want the cards to be for everyone. Gender neutral. I am in no way gender bias. But I have noticed many kindness cards and mental health gift dressings/cards are very much in line with trends for a female audience. While I know that men and women can like the same things, I know some of my male friends wouldn't find those styles suited to them. What might be some imagery or visual elements that could reach a broader audience?

Any help greatly appreciated. This project is personal to me, but my feelings are not the same as everyone else's feelings so the input would mean a lot.",02Apr2020,1
9,"Talking to my therapist each week is useless. I've been seeing her for about 6 weeks now. I have opened up about almost everything to her. However, every conversation is like talking with a stranger. It's so monotone, and no matter how I'm feeling she always asks and says the same thing. 

I mentioned on day one that I feel I have an eating disorder. No mention of it since, even with me bringing up using food as a coping mechanism at least three weeks in a row now. She keeps bringing up the same coping mechanisms that I've told her will not work for me because my anger and emotions are too strong when I'm upset to just ""journal"" or some shit. 

I also understand that therapists see many clients at once so it may be confusing at times but what annoys me is she will give me ""homework"" like finding positive coping skills, and then not follow up about it when she said she will. 

On top of these things, she also rushes our appointments. At least half of our appointments so far have been a half hour or less. She'll say things like ""since you're not feeling well, we can end early today."" Huh?! If I drove here and I've already been here 20 minutes, I don't see a need to end early, especially since I didn't comment on how much pain I was in. 

My problems just seem too much for her to handle and I'm wanting to switch therapists again. This is exhausting and why I took a break from therapy for so long.",02Apr2020,1
10,"(19M) This is my first time posting here and I could use some advice on whether I need help or not because throughout the last 5 years or so, I've been struggling to be happy and motivated to do anything beneficial for myself. I've always put the needs of other people first before mine and I still do to a certain extent but recently this year, I just hit a brick wall and fell into a pit of sadness and that made me disappear off any social media, which in a way is a relief but at the same time, I feel like I'm pushing away some of my closest friends and therefore, I'm putting myself first which I hate.

I got told so many times that I need to be happy with myself before I can make others happy, that I should stop not caring about myself but the problem is that whenever I do anything for myself, even as buying clothing that is cheap, I instantly feel terrible because I know there are people out there that don't have the privilege to do something like that, people who have their life way worse than I do. I never try to complain, I try to not appear sad for others and the one thing I kept hidden for so long is my constant saddness within me for years. I would never talk to anyone about it because I feel like a burden otherwise, and because of that, I'm scared of getting proper help because I could end up needing way more help and attention than I expected.

Right now I'm on a gap year helping out my mother before going to Uni in September and I just want to make sure I do everything right for my family cos I don't want to come off as a disappointment either, which I'm scared of as well. I never really fit in with my age group either when I was in school, I was silent most of the time, I hated socializing and partying, I would sometimes just cry at random points of each week because I always have negative thoughts about myself and the future, and I end up pushing everyone away because I feel like I don't fit in with anyone.

This was a random sort of post but I just want to see if there is anyone on here that I can talk to, someone that I can actually relate to and feel comfortable to express my true feelings, I'm just about done faking my happiness so that I don't bother anyone.",02Apr2020,1

Other than fearing death, i also fear that ive gone crazy and wont be able to function as a normal human being again.

Most of the comments are probably gonna be either ""lol edgy teen"" or ""get professional help"" but neither of those help.

12,"I think I'm emotionally blunted. I had a bad reaction to zoloft (made me *way* more suicidal instead of less) but they didn't take me off it, saying it would go away. Once it wore off, I got left with an incapability to really feel anything. It's like all my feelings are behind some kind of barrier, but I still get the thoughts from them, (e.g I have suicidal thoughts, but there isn't any emotion going along with it so I get very confused as to why, 'feel' depressed and have bad thoughts but I don't really *feel* anything, etc).

14,"I just randomly began to think about the possibility that I have bipolar disorder. That is what I was initially diagnosed with and my therapist acted like it was a no-brainer. My psychiatrist did not agree, though. I do fit all the criteria for mixed episodes or rapid cycling, and many people in my family are diagnosed with BD (but they’re the stereotype – all criminals with addictions, battery charges because of their temper) and I’m not quite that bad. I could always at least manage it enough to not get into legal issues. Though I have laid hands on my partner and I absolutely hated myself for it, but I did it over and over out of impulsivity. I’m not suggesting that those with BD have to be violent, I’m just stating that it can present like that and for much of my family it does.
Anyway,
I tried probably 6 antipsychotics and mood stabilizers and they all made me far worse. Latuda in particular made me very suicidal and also caused akathisia. All of the antipsychotics did, actually, but Latuda was the worst. 
I got very fed up with this process and asked my psychiatrist if I could try an antidepressant, and because she knows I’m familiar with mania, she trusted that I’d let her know if it happened. Again, she was veering more toward major depressive disorder, while the therapist kept insisting it was bipolar. 
She prescribed Wellbutrin. I am not kidding when I say that within the first week I felt better than I had my entire life. Mood swings were gone, energy level was up, I no longer lashed out at my loved ones (or anyone), my once crippling anxiety became non-existent, and I haven’t had one dissociative episode since being on it (it’s been almost a year) and I used to have them constantly. 
After getting my mood issues figured out, I was still left with a major issue: I could not seem to, for the life of me, do well in school. I now had the drive and energy I had lacked before (minus the periods of what was either hypomania or hyperfocusing) but it was like I would read the same paragraph as everyone else and not get the same story from it at all. I felt like I was always missing information. So my psychiatrist tested me for ADD. According to the tests, I really do not meet the criteria. She gave me adderall anyway, “just to see what would happen.” Well, it worked. I went from failing to straight A’s with very minimal effort, suggesting that it really was my brain misinterpreting things rather than me not devoting enough time to studying. I want to add that I’ve never gotten a high from adderall, before someone calls me out for just being a speed freak since I don’t know if I have ADD.
So this is the dilemma I always come back to:
Is it actually bipolar? I meet the criteria, and prior to Wellbutrin I was textbook bipolar 2. And then I don’t have any typical symptoms of ADD other than my comprehension issue. Though that doesn’t even really count before ADD/ADHD is more of a focus related issue. I have always been organized, I do not forget appointments, I do not get distracted in the middle of something and realize hours later I never finished what I was doing, etc. I’ve seen people with true ADD and oh my godddddd do they cause me anxiety. So disorganized. 
But Wellbutrin and Adderall, two medications that could very likely cause mania in a person with bipolar disorder, work perfectly for me.

Now that I’m home due to Coronavirus, my parents have been commenting on how I’m getting “too skinny” and I don’t know what to do. Some days I eat enough/more than I should, mostly due to boredom, but other days I’ll eat up to a small meal because I just don’t think about food and I don’t have any sort of appetite. I often will try and eat for the first time in over 12 hours and I physically cannot swallow any food because of how low my appetite is, and I’ve noticed this is more common when I’m eating around family or friends. I’ve lost almost 60 pounds in the past 6-7 months and if I keep continuing this trend then I’ll be at 100lbs which I know is unhealthy for me as I was 140lbs average for the past 5 years.

19,"(Long post, basically a rant. TL;Dr at the bottom)

I (18F) have known most of my friends since my sophomore year of high school, three girls and three boys. One of these boys is a childhood friend the other is an ex turned friend.

 At the beginning of my junior year, I started going to therapy for depression, anxiety, trust issues, and high irritability. I had high functioning depression so I managed to get through the day but only by being in a constant state of dissociation. My friend group was very understanding and ended up being an amazing support group for me. In turn, I became a big support for them. I have a caretaker personality so most of the time I was the shoulder for them lean on, the sensible/rational friend with the best advice and would tell them how it is. I hated feeling like I was burdening my friends by telling them about my struggles with my mental illness. Even then I forced myself to be overcome my trust issues and be very open about this with them and let them know what’s going on with me. I always told them that I am taking steps to improve the situation on my own but some days are hard and I just need someone to tell me to keep my head up and pull me back on my feet. They were able to talk me out of ending my life and help me push forward in life. To say the least, they are the reason I am still alive.

Obviously, teenage drama happens and I ended up being the glue connecting most of my friends up until the summer before college. We were all going to different universities so I wasn't surprised when we all drifted apart. One of my girl-friends went her own way but would still send me a text every so often to check-in. I had a falling out with one of my guy friends and even though we sorted it out and are on speaking terms now, the friendship is not the same. My friendship with my ex became one-sided and I cut him off after many attempts to fix a friendship that he was no longer interested in (we do occasionally talk but it is a toxic friendship). Only two of my girl-friends, my childhood friend and a new girl-friend I made in college are the people I actively talk to and feel like I can confide in. I am still struggling to find my place in my university but I know people around campus, am on a sports team, and I have a social life.

With so many changes the past year and a half my mental health worsened. I inexplicably had a dramatic change in attitude at the start of the year and started isolating myself and burning bridges. I had less than a handful of people I talked to and only one of them lived in the same city as me. I wouldn’t speak most days, I would just put my headphones in to block out the world. I felt so lonely but I couldn't find the energy to socialize. I decided to go back to therapy, this time to be re-screened and for help with body dysmorphia /eating disorder. With the COVID-19 outbreak, so many changes happened so quickly and I have been struggling to juggle my mental/physical health, academics, and helping support my family financially. As someone who is used to having high functioning depression suddenly being unable to get out of bed, feeling like crying all day and starving myself as punishment and having suicidal thoughts is just too much. The past few weeks I have lost trust in even my closes friends and have become very secretive about things that I used to be very open about. I want to talk and interact with my friends but every time I do I become distant or irritable and I blow up and lash out without being provoked.

Even though I have become an observer to most of these people's lives, they mean so much to me and I know they care about me too. I don’t want to lose any more important people in my life and I know I need to do something to fix this but I don’t know what I can do. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL; Dr: Since the beginning of 2020 my mental health has dramatically worsened and lead to self-isolating behavior. This has made trusting my closes friends difficult, even though they haven’t done anything wrong. I don’t know what I should do to change the situation.**",02Apr2020,1

She followed and I threw my knife on my bed, she grabbed and we started screaming at each other. She said my only copping is to run away which is true because it’s better than talking. I started to ignore her so she sat down even tho I told her to get out 50 times and said if she doesn’t I’ll leave she said she’d call the cops cause we’re under quarantine. Then I told her that I’d rather die than talk and it’s easier. Then she said it seems like I’m bipolar and she should’ve called my dad I said ya you should have, my dad lives across the country and she wanted to call him a few months ago to come get me because of another fight, then she left cause “she doesn’t know how to talk to me”

24,"Hi, thank you so much for reading. Growing up I went through a lot of shit, I’m sure some people had it worse but I feel like I went through it. 

For example growing up my dad would get on top of me and choke me for ligit just living. Years latter I find that it’s not the choking that leaves the mental scares but the screaming of my mother for him to get off me. Now when I hear someone screaming even if I know it’s a joke or a movie it like triggers me and makes me think of it and actually makes me like made idk it’s hard to explain.  

I also went through a lot of other stuff but I don’t really wanna go to in depth for the sake of the readers. What kinda therapy do you think could help with this. I really wanna get over the past in my life and I feel like this is a good step.",02Apr2020,1
25,"I’m [31m] feeling completely isolated in my ex’s country. 2 months following the breakup I don’t think about my ex which I think is strange. Instead I appear to have shifted all my anxieties towards a crush I developed 6 months ago. 

School has ramped up so much and my mental capacity is failing me. I’m usually a top student but I can’t stay focused. My main teacher [28f] is my crush and she has a boyfriend. She’s so nice to me and I’ve honestly felt that there were sparks developing between us, however inappropriate that is. Being isolated, I feel that I may have recently encroached slightly on her personal boundaries by suggesting we get a coffee sometime. Her immediate coldness and rejection towards me has shattered me like a ton of bricks. 

I get plenty of exercise each day between study sessions, but that my study and crush are so deeply entwined makes it hard to detach. I just wish I could reverse time and never had said anything to her, or have someone to open up to about all of this, but I’m ashamed.

29,"I have lost all my will and motivation to actually live my life. although I don't intend to kill myself. I just can't find joy in anything. I know I should escape my comfort zone, but I can't see the point. 

to give some background I'm 21, recovering alcoholic (speaks for itself). seems like for the past 4 years the only thing I did was fuck up my life. I didn't expect to be alive this long. a bit cliché, dad was never home. I was always considered the weird kid, always had friends tho, but they never stuck with me. Since childhood, I was body shammed by most of my family (their kind of humor) so I was always conscious about my weight and I ended up really shy. so during my elementary days I never was popular, always was socially awkward. that changed a bit during high school, not sure if I was popular but I was known. I met a lot of people that are close to me around 17. For example my best friend, she is actually my roommate now too. shortly after I met a person I'm on and off with to this day ( more I look back at it the more toxic it gets) it was around the time I started fucking up too, coming home drunk almost every weekend, once I came home with third-degree burns, one time with fucked up collar bone. went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed with OCD and depression, was on and off medication during that time. 

got on the first college I was accepted to which was Design, dropped out after the first semester. wasn't my thing, I was unstable and there wasn't two consecutive days I was sober for at least a year. Was playing it cool but after one party I tried to kill myself (very clumsy and stupidly) in front of my best friend, that was the last straw for her, she stopped talking to me for a year or so. I don't think she trusts me still, but I can't blame her. 

after that, I worked for my father for half a year. we weren't on our best terms but we got along. he seems to be walking on eggshells around me still... it was hard construction work, you work for two weeks, 12 hours a day and then you have a week off. I spent most of my money on clothes and the rest on booze. I hated the work, wasn't slacking off by any chance tho, I didn't have nobody to talk to there (all of my fathers' employees were old, conservative alcoholics), I was away from everything and everyone I thought important. so I decided to apply to another university just to get away from there.

So now I'm studying psychology and I moved away from my parents, got myself a cat. We have a deal, I focus fully on my study, they pay the bills for the first year.  Sounded like a sweet deal, but now I'm not really feeling it. I got thru the first semester, I'm not really sure I want to continue. Academic grounds doesn't seem to fit me. I feel guilty about taking money from my parents, and overall I'm just feeling like a fuckup. I know I want to work on myself, I know I wanna stay sober, but I don't have the slightest clue about what I want. Nothing brings me joy, so instead of living I just exist. trying not to hurt anyone. I can't bring myself to do anything because what's the point.

I've been all talk for a long time, but I don't know what to do now. I can't function like this. going from breakdown to breakdown... occasionally have a giant wave of motivation and good mood for a day and then back to breakdowns... I constantly feel complete loneliness, sometimes it just doesn't bother me. every night I'm going to sleep hoping I'll wake up with a different mindset somehow

Everyone seems to listen to me but nobody seems to hear me lately. My friends are angry at me cause I'm not doing anything. I know I need to work, I know I desperately need to meet new people, but I don't know what I WANT to do.

Finally got more sleep last night after only getting 3-4 hours a night since the weekend, and finally started to feel more normal/awake. But now, I’m sad. I’m anxious, depressed, and sad. At the end of my Zoom class this evening, I had to talk to a professor about taking next semester off because my college is trying to get students to register for classes before telling us, very likely, that everything will be online through the fall; I only have 2 semesters of undergrad left and am in part a theatre student, and I just can’t do that. I figured it out, and some of its details, yesterday, and have been doing so for a little more than a week logistically, but the conversation brought me down. Now, I need to make my goodbye videos for this project my class and the class below me is doing for the seniors who have to graduate online.

34,"The family I live with has a very awful dynamic where my mother gets whatever she wants or else she throws tantrums or yells at the top of her lungs. This means that she has the power to control every other member of the family and gets to project her trauma onto the rest of us instead of working on it like a healthy person would. None of us want to hurt her back or deny her of this behaviour because we’re peaceful people.

This has affected every aspect of my life; my motivation to work, my happiness, my stress, my anxiety, my personal goals (have been lowered significantly over time because I’m finding it harder to achieve in such a hopeless and hostile environment), my social life, etc.

However, I *did* have a solution; avoid my family when I can. I used to attend the library as frequently as possible and complete as much of my homework there are as I can. Away from the apathetic and harsh family and the home which I associate with so much stress, the library was a magnificent place to study and relax. It was a little stressful having to get as much study done there as possible so I didn’t have to do it at home, but I had all day and reminded myself that I tried my hardest at the end of each day.

And then - you probably guessed it - coronavirus happened and I’m stuck at home; I’m back to square one all over again. I have to live in a house with a mother whom I have to wrestle and struggle against for basic personal boundaries such as organising my own schedule.

Sometimes I can calmly form compelling arguments disguised as me actually caring about what she thinks (after 3 years of this particular bullshit pattern she’s gotten into, I really don’t give a shit anymore and I will run away as soon as I can get a house) and other times I can’t say anything to soothe her anger and attain the autonomy I deserve.

In either case, she always has a sizeable amount of control over what I do and I’ve 100% lost the motivation to do any work at all. How do I maintain hope and work ethic in an awful home environment (which I’m now stuck in)?",02Apr2020,1

I have a really bad sexual history, and a history of mental health issues. I tried to kill myself in middle school and a few times early on in high school. I had been seeing a therapist since freshman year, but I'm a dumbass so I never told her anything about my sexual history, I just talked to her a lot about my family problems. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety this year - my first year of college.

My first boyfriend (when I was 14-15) was abusive - he would squeeze my pressure points when I made him upset, threaten to kill himself if I didn't text him, cuss at me and get insanely jealous and controlling, etc. A week into our relationship, he talked me into giving him a blowjob, I wasn't ready and hesitant, but I also didn't say no. After we broke up, when I was 15, he asked me to come over to try his new VR headset (I was dumb for coming over and expecting nothing to happen, I guess) and he then talked me into having sex with him. I kept saying ""I don't know"" and he said, ""I need a yes or no."" So I said yes, but I didn't want to. I bled for three days after that. I talked to a friend about it, and apparently my ex had bought condoms and told everyone he had a ""plan"" for winter break. I fucking guess I was the plan lmfao. It makes me really sad because I  didn't want to lose my virginity like that, and I genuinely hate him as a person. I was sexually active a lot earlier than I was ready, even though at the time I thought I was ready. It also fucks me up that everything I ever did with him was consensual even though I rarely wanted it.

Me losing my virginity to the worst person I ever met kind of gave me a ""nothing really matters"" perspective on sex. Granted, most of my sexual partners (sometimes they were boyfriends) were nice to me. There were issues within those relationships themselves but they never psychologically fucked me up the way my first ex did. Then, I started having sex with one of my friends. We had stopped for a while, it was a few night stands rather than a friends w benefits thing. One night, we were both drunk at my best friend's and he asked me if we could fuck. I wasn't feeling it and I told him no (I was actually kind of proud of being able to say no!) but I sat next to him and we watched whatever was on the TV. Then, out of nowhere, he stuck his hand down my pants and started trying to touch me. I pulled his hand out and walked away. The feeling of somewhere so private just being seized just feels so wrong and disgusting and the shock I felt in that moment made my heart jump. I got over it that night, mostly because my closest friends were there and he was completely wasted and non-functional.

After starting college, I've definitely stopped having sex as much. It causes me so much anxiety to do it with anyone I'm not previously emotionally close to/comfortable with now. It doesn't matter all that much to me that I'm not fucking as much, but I still think a lot about those instances I had with the guys in high school. My roommates and I play Buzzed, and there's one card that I hate: ""Whoever has the best losing their virginity story drinks"". Every single time virginity is brought up I'm forced to think of him. Again, I've never talked to my therapist about any of this, but I feel like there may be some type of sexual trauma I'm not checking.

**What happened:** 

I'll call her Aly. She had a competition at my college the Saturday spring break started, so she came down and I stayed an extra two days, the performance was small and short, but we were both more excited to party together. I wish so fucking bad I didn't stay. We're both 18 and were pretty much the youngest people anywhere we went that night. We pre-gamed with her friends at an apartment. I drank a substantial amount, and I barely remember the walk to the actual party. The only other person I knew in our group was her dance team friend that I've met once, (we'll call her Brianna). 

Parties give me anxiety when I'm not drunk, and I know she wanted to have fun that night so I didn't want to be a buzzkill. Towards the end of the party, I smoked a joint outside. I was still thoroughly fucked, but she told me that one of the girls at the party put us on a list to get into a club afterwards. I was around maybe 3AM by then? We went to the club. I only knew Aly and Brianna, and it was a lot of older adults rather than college students because most of them had gone home. I was passing out on the dance floor, and she'd just slap my face slightly and tell me to wake up. Aly started grinding on this guy for what seemed like forever. At this point, she was not acknowledging me at all, so I danced w Brianna. She was really good at occupying me, but I was still passing out. I remember feeling so helpless, because we were so far from my dorm and everyone was preoccupied.

I was dancing with a guy in a red shirt. I realized I didn't want to be dancing with any guys, so I kind of left and stuck close w the group that put us on the list. Brianna would pull me in every once in a while. This guy came up to me and started whispering into my ear, something like, ""I know your friend is going to pull you away but listen to me,"" and he was grabbing me everywhere. I had to wrench myself out of his grip. It was fucking terrifying. I asked Brianna if she could take me home, she asked me if I could go by myself. I was in tears and still really disoriented and I think Brianna took me to Aly. She snapped at her and told her she can't go home w the guy she was STILL dancing with. I was within a few feet of her with no people in between us and she didn't notice what happened with the guy at all. She started complaining, saying ""Why not?"". Without knowing what had happened to me, she was going to leave me at the club by myself for this random man she just met. I think I blew up and yelled at her and ran off. She caught me outside of the club and kept asking me what was wrong while she called the Uber. We got home and I don't think I stopped sobbing until I fell asleep.

It was so hard to talk to her that following day. When we got home from college, I couldn't bring myself to text her all day. I finally did at night, telling her everything that happened and why it hurt. She genuinely apologized, and I know she feels bad, but I just can't forgive her for it.

During the apology, she said a few things that just made things worse. She told me she wasn't that drunk, and it was just her fault. It was her being honest and owning up to her mistake, but that made me feel even shittier. She wasn't even drunk and she couldn't afford to keep an eye out for me? She also said that she hopes I would still go to parties with her, but she understood if I didn't want to. I didn't even want to think about partying again. I told her we can, if it's with a group of girls I choose. However, the more I think about it, the more I feel like being with her in that setting again would greatly upset me. I can't stop playing back the images of her dancing with the guy and remembering the feeling of me passing out and feeling like nobody cared. 

It's been a few weeks since. We text about every day things all the time. Recently all she ever texts me about is guys, what they're saying, how much she wants to fuck them, etc. Today I tried to vent to her about a friend trying to talk me into breaking quarantine, she ignored it and sent me a screenshot of a guy's texts to her. It just makes me feel like I'm always going to come second to guys to her. And when I needed her so desperately to care about me more, she didn't. And now I've been thinking more about my prior experiences. Everything just hurts a lot. I'm not in a good place right now.",02Apr2020,1
39,"TW// Anorexia/starvation

Hi everyone, I don’t know if this is the right subreddit to be posting this but I thought it would be a good place to start?

For a bit of background, I started starving myself at 14. I had body dysmorphia and would literally fall apart if I ate anything. I just felt ugly and a disappointment to myself because I would get hungry and eat. It took me years before I could step on a weighing scale confidently and not fall apart. I don’t know if you could call it anorexia. I wasn’t properly diagnosed. My parents never took me to see a therapist. They just kinda tried to deal with it as best they could but honestly all they would do is panic and freak out at me for not eating. I also didn’t get very very skinny— like, I was but not skin and bone. It was like this until about 18/19. I’m 23 now. I don’t think it’s fair to call myself anorexic without being properly diagnosed so I just say that I starved myself. I don’t wanna be disrespectful to actual people going through this. 
 

I wanted to know if there are any long term effects with starving yourself during those prime teenage years? I know it sounds stupid but I’m convinced it’s stunted my growth and I’m shorter then I’m meant to be, fucked up my metabolism and messed up the way I digest food. I’ve never brought it up with a doctor but would like too. I just wanted to know if people have gone through the same thing and that I’m not crazy?

I also never went to therapy to recover? I ended up getting really sick one day and would vomit anything they put in my mouth. Until I was vomiting bile and it was like that for a week and a few days. I was never sent to hospital. Slowly after that, I started to eat more and more.

41,"So, 40 year-old male, USA. I think I've reached a breaking point that probably requires in-patient care. Can anyone direct me toward the cheapest services available in the US? I'm beyond broke with no real assets or resources. I have Medicare or whatever the super-poor-person insurance is called.

Backstory, just to get off my chest and in case it's relevant. I've had pretty severe anxiety for as long as I can remember.  It got a little better after HS (pretty bad time for me), and I lived and worked pretty normally for most of my 20's, other than avoiding almost all human contact, whenever possible.

The anxiety began getting worse in my later 20's, and by very early 30's it had turned into severe anxiety, panic attacks, deep depression, and agoraphobia where I wouldn't leave my room (and later my own place) for days and sometimes weeks at a time. I started self-medicating with a large amount of pot and booze. That worked for a while until it didn't.

A roommate at the time convinced me to see a doctor (quite a few, actually). I tried every SSRI I've ever heard of, nothing worked. Finally Klonopin helped with the panic attacks, and eventually that, along with Prozac and Gabapentin, and still the weed and booze let me rejoin the world on a small scale.

I tried talk therapy along with seeing a psychiatrist, and more doctors. Talk therapy didn't work for me, unsurprisingly with my avoidant personality. I never felt like any of the doctors took me seriously because I don't self-harm and have never attempted suicide, although I was diagnosed with severe anxiety with panic disorder, severe depression, agoraphobia, and an ""unknown"" personality disorder. 

That brings us to now. I'm the kind of drunk that drinks every day, heavily (two periods of sobriety for less than 2 weeks each in the past 8-9 years), often to the point of blackout. I'm feeling the effects of that on my body pretty seriously at this point. The depression is worse than it's ever been; I don't want to be here, I hate myself and my life, and I don't blame anyone but me for it.

I've been isolated for so long, I don't have anyone to reach out to, and out-patient treatment doesn't work for me because I just lie about my drinking and I can't fully describe how I feel. I also don't really trust doctors at this point, and I'm more scared of being poked with needles or getting locked up than I am of dying.

I know I need pretty serious help at this point, I just don't know how to get it with no resources, even if I could overcome the fear of doing so. Any directions would be greatly appreciated, just please no sympathy, it just makes me feel more pathetic. Thank you for reading if anyone took the time, and again, sorry for the long post.",02Apr2020,1

I can't talk to my younger sisters as although the one closest to me is quite mature. I feel as their older brother I need to be more protective and not show them how damaged I'm feeling, I need to be stronger.

49,"Background:

During my senior year of high school i struggled with depression and anxiety that caused me to form a habit of twisting my hair till it fell out. I was medicated which helped the problems, however going off to college was sort of a solution. I stopped the depression and anxiety medication because i simply did not need it anymore and my anxious habits went away.

And even though I want all that, I also just think about how I really wouldn’t mind if I died. I’m staying in quarantine, but I also don’t mind going out if necessary because I’m not afraid of the virus killing me. Just confused and needed to get this off my chest.",02Apr2020,1

Is there something wrong with my sis?
I have a older sister who is one year older than me. Throughout my life, I experienced bullying from her and made me miserable, she's the reason why I have low self-esteem and got insecure of myself, she called me disgusting and 'ew' whenever I'm there and made fun of my removed mole everyday. I had a mole when I was a kid on my cheek and for some reason my sister has this weird obsession with moles and bullied me to the point to request my parents to have it removed but it still kept on going. She called me ugly several times and even changed my password in Facebook that I couldn't access it anymore.

My parents knew about this and they tried scolding her in every way they can but she got worse and even hitting my head with a charger and other violent stuff. I don't know what it is up with her and she even accused me of something I didn't even do. She would laugh out loud for no reason and would mock my actions.

I learned that it is okay to have a simple teasing between siblings and stuff like but what she did to me was already too much and in need of help.

Whenever we have a social gathering within a family and I am asked about my achievements, she would embarrass me and talk me down and how that I'm a 'weirdo' in front of every one. It made me feel uncomfortable and ashamed.

One time I had enough, I was asleep and she kept teasing me about my moles and how ugly I looked. I snapped and broke down in front of her. I cried and I angrily scolded her for what she did to me all those years and I even confronted her what the hell is her problem with me, I reached to the point of violence where I kicked her multiple times. All she replied was how embarrassing I am and that I'm going crazy, she even called me overreacting and said that I hit our baby cousins instead of her (who are also there watching) and she would tell everyone that I hit them, she laughed at me afterwards. I tried fighting back after all those years and even confronted her about it, she never said sorry and laughed at me.

Several days past the incident, she grew worse and kept teasing to me how horrible I was and my moles and shit like that, I tried avoiding her a d kept on going like that for weeks, my parents and relatives knew about it and told me to never mind her. It was hell, I noticed that there could be something wrong with her. Is there something wrong with my sister? If there is what's the mental illness does she have?",02Apr2020,1
52,"Everyone’s situation is different and trust me it’s not lost on me that a mandatory quarantine is hell for lots of people for lots of reasons. But my circumstances make this quarantine honestly heaven sent for me. 

Please don’t take this as me saying I’m happy about the circumstances. Because I’m not. I feel immense fear of losing loved ones to this, and I feel fear for the economy, and I feel for the tons of people this is hurting in any way. 

I am 21, I have a full time job that I’m grateful for but hate beyond words. I have ptsd and I’m in intensive therapy for it. It’s hard to manage that, being a rather low functioning depressive. I also am incredibly grateful to be living with my father who doesn’t make me pay rent. I pay for my food, phone, car and medical expenses but he offers to help still. I am privileged to have this. To be short, I’m not exactly worried about my financial situation - though I’m sure I’ll be eating my words, because god knows how the economy will be even after this blows over. 

But the point is I’m beyond happy to not have to go to work. I’ve been doing really well mentally. It’s given me time to clean my space and even work on cleaning the attic which comes with more emotional baggage than I’ll explain right now. I have been getting enough sleep. My body needs 10 hours and that’s obviously time consuming and so I rarely get that much. I’ve been doing my makeup which sounds silly but it makes me happy, I feel more put together and it’s a creative outlet for me. I also take better care of my skin when I wear makeup. I’ve been taking better care of my teeth (I have braces so it’s a process.) I’ve also been making my bed which also seems silly but again makes me feel better. I know a lot of people feel isolated but honestly I didn’t see anyone other than my bf to begin with and that hasn’t changed. I’m not bored at all. It makes me sad to see so many people are bored. I am elated to take a breath and lay in bed in the morning without guilt. Right now people are still getting outside, and I’ve been taking walks when the weather permits and honestly that’s the main thing I care about. Time outside my house makes me feel better, it doesn’t have to be a store or a restaurant. It’s usually better for me to just be outside in nature anyways. 

To know so many are suffering is awful, but I can’t say I want to go back to work. I wish more people could see the benefit in having more time to oneself. I wish 40 hour work weeks weren’t a thing. I wish we cared more about ourselves than our jobs because all our employers care about is making money anyway. 

Like I said I feel sad so many are bored or hurting just by staying home. (Excluding the people with toxic environments) I wish people would see they’re so bored because they dedicate 1/4 of their time in a week to their unfulfilling job. (Seems like a small amount of time but there’s things like transportation time and sleep and eating.) Do the little things you’ve wanted to do but never had time for. 

I know this isn’t possible for everyone. I don’t mean to sound privileged though I know I do. I just want to make it abundantly clear that I’m saying this only to those that it’s realistic and possible for which I’m sure is a small amount. But I know there are people out there. 

My point of this was just to vent about the positives I’ve experienced, but also recognizing the cost and feeling guilt for it. 

Hope that makes sense.",02Apr2020,1
53,"TL;DR: Stuck at Home with People I hate, desperately wanting to see people, knowing that it'd probably kill me.

**An Introduction**

Hi I'm 19 years old, I'd had a history of anxiety, depression, and a lot of problems related to self-image.

I'm currently living in Toronto ON, which is currently being hit decently (by Canadian standards) by COVID-19. With nearly 426 new cases every day and way more than have been unreported. As a Diabetic who had a surgery involving steel-bars being put into my chest back in June. It's unlikely that I would survive COVID-19, so I've been isolating myself for nearly 3 weeks now... With a house full of people that I hate who are self-isolating because I'm a liability.

**My Family**

My Mom is alright, we get along well, but she often goes through a lot of my things which makes me super uncomfortable. Besides that tho, she has a go-getter attitude who always needs to be doing something.

My Step-Dad is relentlessly cold to me, always shutting me down for no apparent reason, and generally just is more distant from everyone.

Then there is my Step-Sibling, who honest to god is the worst person I've ever met. They seem to take anything that's good and completely ruin it for me by belittling it or making me feel like shit because of it. I don't really feel like getting into it here, but the amount of bullying I've gotten from them in the past has been relentless in both physical and mental departments. Someone as they've gotten older, they've only gotten more juvenile, and despite being 23 they're a highschool dropout with no job, no aspiration in life, who deals drugs, has made deals in the middle of the day during the pandemic, acts like a 13-year-old, has no voice-volume control, and is generally a smug asshole.

I also have a younger step-sibling, but they've since moved out and are a different basket case.

**My Relationships / Personal Life**

I don't feel the need to state them further, but currently, I'm in a relationship with people with 2 people one of them being a boi, and the other being Fem/Emby, with both of them being aware of that fact. How I got into this situation was actually pretty weird and accidental, but I love them with all of my heart and would do anything for the 2 of them.

I also have a nonessential job that I love, and Co-Workers who I got along super well with. I'm also still being paid despite not working

**My Question**

I moved back home from College 2 days ago, and while I spent 11 days at home a month ago, now I'm officially living back in this space and already I feel like I'm losing my mind. My older sibling is unbearable and generally a massive asshole, I'm stuck at home with this over-powering person, and I don't really know what to do. I feel like if this virus doesn't kill me, then my lack of will-power as a human being surely might.  

I miss my partners, my friends, my job, the people I interacted with, the sense of importance I got from doing work and being apart of a team. But now that this entire pandemic has happened and I'm stuck in a house with people I make, working on projects that look like complete garbage for school. Even though I am a 10-minute drive away from my Boyfriend who is also self-isolating, and feel like I could REALLY, REALLY use a hug. I know that for the sake of my health and the health of other people I can't really go out and do that. I video-chat with him and text my other partner every night. But that feeling just isn't the same as going and being with these people in person. 

How on earth do I manage to stay positive while being stuck in a living situation with people I dislike immensely?",02Apr2020,1

I'm keeping my friend alive

We have only been talking around two weeks but very consistently. It was clear we completely clicked on a lot of opinions and ideas. Though it's still interesting to talk. He began to open up maybe a few days in but very gently.

Last night he told me he asked me what was up I told him what I was doing. I asked what is he up to and he said he's writing his suicide note. I'm really scared he's going to kill himself. He has told me I'm the only one in his life. I feel this immense pressure all of a sudden. I'm still trying to recover from depression, a suicide attempt, an ED and PTSD and grieving my mother of which he knows some about and this is undoing all the work I've put into getting better. I don't think I'm ready to literally carry someone's life in my hands. I know that is selfish but our for this past week I've been getting worse and I'm slowly slipping it's scary but I feel awful how selfish that is.

He says I'm the best thing to ever happen to him. He only does things other than go to work and entertainment because I asked him to (like talk to his parents or shower etc) I'm keeping him alive. He says I'm the only reason he hasn't killed himself. I'm the only reason he's still here I'm so scared I can't just let him die but I'm getting more ill and loosing weight he keeps monologuing these thoughts that I've had for years and it's bringing everything back. I can't let myself get any worse.

59,"I’ve been feeling so shitty lately about my friendships to the point where it has been hindering my mental health. I am currently 24 years old and I have had the same group of girl friends since high school. We all ended up staying in the same city right after we graduated so we stayed really close. One friend ended up moving to the east coast for school (were all from the west coast) but when she came back, nothing changed. Another friend enlisted into the military, and every time she’s back home, everything stays the same. 

Then when I move away for college (mind you I was only 3 hours away), it seems as though they had all forgotten me or maybe just stopped caring. Moving away to college made my depression/anxiety ten times worse so maybe I just changed. But it seemed as though they stopped hitting me up, stopped reaching out... I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I got into a relationship, but I always made sure to make time for them. I never wanted to be that person who falls off the face of the earth as soon as she got into a relationship. 

After moving back home last year, we all would meet up occasionally but then it all stopped suddenly. We all stopped talking to each other, or so I thought. I tried to not be on social media as much but for awhile I though we were all just growing up and getting busy with jobs and lives... but it seemed as though they all had just moved on without me. They began to constantly post photos of just them going out on the weekends or taking short trips together. I never got a call or text.

I tried not to take it personally but it’s so hard too when these are the people I though we’re going to be in my life forever. Mind you I’m not in my teens, I’m about to turn 25 and I feel so childish having these feelings but it honestly feels worse than a breakup. I feel heartbroken. Like my presence never mattered to them. 

It’s been even harder now with social distancing.. they are constantly posting screen shots of their zoom meetings and I’m just in my apartment feeling fucking sorry for myself.

So I'll start off with saying that I began smoking weed when I was 13 years old (22F now) and used it basically everyday up until I was 19. I was diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety shortly before I started smoking weed. I started taking Prozac but hated the idea of taking medication so I stopped before I could feel an effect. Later on I was prescribed Clonazepam, but never took it because of fear of becoming addicted to it. Not long after I tried weed for the first time I started experimenting with other drugs (mushrooms, ecstasy, cocaine) but never really had a problem with any of those. But still was obviously horrible on my developing, already sensitive brain. I had a few other traumatic experiences that may have lead me to feeling how I do right now (mostly involving sexual experiences/relationships.)

No one takes it seriously. I’ve tried talking to my friends about it and my girlfriend. They either just think i’m trying to be “edgy” or “dark”, or just write it off as a phase. I’ve had these thoughts for as long as I can even imagine. They’re so real to me. The irresistible desire to claim someone’s life or my own.

I often contemplate what would bring me to kill someone. I usually think of things like, if I got a disease and only had a certain amount of time left to live or even my life being so unbearable I would kill someone before killing myself. 

Sometimes I’ll see someone in the perfect position and my body begins to feel indescribably strange and a sequence of how I’d kill them flashes in my mind on the spot before I come to my senses. I’ll see a man having a smoke late at night and all of a sudden it feels as if I’m about to lunge at him with a rusty piece of metal.

74,"!!SCROLL TO BOTTOM FOR POST - FIRST 5 PARAGRAPHS ARE CONTEXT!!

Hi everyone, I hope you are all doing well during this time of uncertainty. I will try to make this as short as possible while still giving all details so if what I am saying seems generalized that is why.

Since I am now back home 24/7 due to ongoing world circumstances after being away for 6 months due to college, I have had a lot more time at home with mom and dad. Like... a lot. Even more than before I went away.

During this time I have noticed that my mother's mental has been declining. She has had issues with her mental wellbeing long before I was born, so for her to have issues is not abnormal, although I have a feeling that this is just different.

For a little bit of context she was diagnosed with bipolar about a decade ago and has had issues with alchohol abuse, with a number of other things before that, according to my dad, although I didn't want to find out more information.

During the summer of 2018 she was abusing alchohol BAD. Up to the point where she became suicidal and had to go to rehab. During this time she was also taking some sort of medication, which with combined with alchohol made it so that she would pass out and start seizing. ON 3 SEPERATE OCCASIONS, I would come home from school (at the time I was a senior in HS) and I would find her sitting by the kitchen table, seizing, not responding to what I was saying, and having to call an ambulance.

Ever since that time her mental health has been on a decline, and it seems to have gotten worse recently.

She is constantly rambling and she will randomly say stuff that makes perfect sense to her but doesn't to myself or my dad. For example, she will start talking to me but will already be mid sentence, and what she says is something completely random and incoherent sometimes.

She is also very irritable, for example, recently she has been falling asleep while standing up, so to say she will just stand at the kitchen counter nodding off, and she will do this for as long as someone talks to her, and when my dad or I express concern, she gets very defensive and angry.

Just within the last few hours, she asked if she could use my computer to file tax returns, at 12 in the morning mind you. She is sitting there for about 2 hours, while 80% of the time she is either staring at the screen or going about her usual rambling, she seems incapable of having a strong enough thought structure to do work. Sometime between 2 and 3am I asked her when she would be done, and she got defensive again. Screaming and yelling at me, saying how she hates living in this house and that I dont even do anything lately so there is no reason I should want sleep.

75,"I’m quarantined with my narcissist ex who psychologically tortures me everyday and has for the last month. I’m moving in less than a month but idk how much more I can take of being reminded how unlovable and fucking worthless I am everyday. My ex moved on instantly, didn’t care after she dumped me, and wasn’t phased by it. I have to look at her being happy and content every day while she fucks with me psychologically. I loved this woman more than anything too, she lead me to believe that we had a future together and called me her person and said we would get married and then just broke up with me out of nowhere, gave no reason, and then jumped back into a toxic relationship with her ex.

Meanwhile, I get to go to work. But my boss spends the day undervaluing me as well. They fuck with my schedule and tell me to accept it or I don’t work there anymore, then gaslight me and say that I wanted this schedule change to begin with (I don’t and never did, it puts me at home with my ex who is fucking with me).

I can’t see my friends or escape my house aside from work because of social distancing. I have a therapist that I see weekly via video chat and I take medication. I do everything I can to be okay but I just can’t shake the feeling of being so fucking worthless and unlovable. My ex faked our entire relationship (or so it seems by the way she treats me) and I can’t trust anyone anymore.

For the first time in years, dying seems like my only option. I don’t have a plan or anything, I just feel so fucking hopeless.",02Apr2020,1

77,"for about a year now I've progressively gotten more and more depressed, it started last feburary when a person I trusted and believed to be a friend turned their back on me after I went to them for comfort after my cousin who was living with my family committed suicide. I took a week off school and during that week I tried messaging them at least once a day and they just ignored all my message, once I returned to school and saw them they greeted me by telling that they had a fun weekend spending time with a friend of ours that I didn't know much at the time and I asked why they didn't respond to me and they responded to me telling me that I was an annoying and a needy bitch. They continued to ignore me whenever we agreed to talk or work on homework together and then get people to lie to me when I wanted to talk to them or someone that we knew, around summer I just stopped talking to everyone I knew, and during the summer I didn't talk to anyone I knew I just slept and played games with online friends. When the school year started again I was in a class with a person who was friends with the person who treated me like garbage and told me that they were running a discord server with everyone that we spent lunch with at school and I asked them to invite me to the server to which they said they would after school, so after school I got home and took a nap to which I woke to messages from the server owner telling me that I'm not allowed in for things I did to the person who treats me like shit and another person telling me that everyone was talking shit about me, and that really hurt me since some of he people I've known for years, people I cared for just deciding to go against me based on the lies of a person who is just actual human trash, come october I just stopped attending class and haven't really been out since then I've been in my room about 90% of the days since october. Now I'm just feeling completely empty, everyone I talk to online feels artificial and I feel all of them are starting to be annoyed by me, I feel completely alone and I just want it all to stop I hate it.

Propaganda, propaganda, propaganda, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.   Parties constantly instigated feud and more horrible war in this world.  Taking out their own bigotry and hatred and loathing on others instead of pacifying themselves.  Folk, I do not stoke suicide.  That's just the level of demoralization this world is coming to.  You must survive, because these fiends do, these villains and tycoons that run this world in Oligarchy.  

We've reached the state of economic and financial disruption, people should grasp the level of bullshit in this world.  The Lower and Middle class just got shut down.  The propaganda, bullshit and deceit is more evident, as the pandemics are used to compensate.  The Government may try and compensate, but the rich stay rich, the poor stay poor.  You think we have all the same opportunities and rights in this world, you do not.  

Democracy and our Constitutional Rights in the US become more hypocritical as the PR provides.  The States and City States want to go back to running their towns their way.

The bullshit in this world out aggravating.  Not as bad as it was in the past, over the last century we've reached some milestones in human atrocities and liberty.  Private policy, spooks, GMen, really don't come after you these days, very often.  I'm unaware if I'm on the radar, I've tried to work with the authorities in the past regarding my experiences.

I am supposed to rise to the occasion, be a big dick.  I am not trying to demoralize people with Bible thumping, nor am I stoking Demons.  I was trying to be diplomatic in forming my views, got to dusting of the bibles, bullshit.  Organized religion and Dogma's are archaic, I have modern views, politics and law.  The Nobility and Aristocracy had been awry for ages throughout the coups, Vikings, Crusades.  I've mentioned my own Clan and the atrocities they had endured in the past.  The Great Pilgrimage to the New World, legions of people being banished, rufegee's, coups.  

People have to fend for themselves, I've mention the conflicting ideologies, dogma, bullshit.  Some of these parties rely on subterfuge, lies and deceit, it disgusts me.  It's their way and sense of survival in complete cowardice, but they will survive.  I'm not arrogant or one to heark on bravado, I like to know what I'm talking about.    

Not everyone considers communion with each other a necessary thing.  Politics and social reforms, ethnic cleansing, would carry on in subterfuge.  I do not believe in such heinous abuse of peoples competence.  The propaganda and paranoia stoking is enough right now, I am not a sorcerer that can tell you what's going on around the world.  Kingdoms and Politics and diplomacy and chivalry would continue.

Around 2 months ago I started experiencing this, basically my external occipital protuberance (ball on back of head) felt tender to touch it has never been right for a while (I fell and smashed it on concrete at a young age) anyway due to my OCD I’ve been constantly touching it for 63 days straight now and last night something happened. I was touching it usual and it’s if one side clicked like it always does but this time it was like 3 clicks. It didn’t feel like bone anymore it felt like a crushed monster munch. After that I’ve felt horrific and been physically vomiting. Now I don’t know if that’s just down to my anxiety or not as I do believe this is going to kill me, like I’m scared it’s bone cancer or something.

82,"DISCLAIMER: I am not looking for medical advice, I have some amazing professionals that I work with but they're not scheduling right now due to COVID-19. Therefore, I'm wondering if you guys here can point me in the direction of materials/studies that are relevant to me so I can bring it up with my psychiatrist and therapist once they start scheduling again! I've only been working with them for 2\~ish months and so there's always the possibility of another diagnosis. 

18M

I guess I'm not entirely sure where to start with this since all my regular professional support groups (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, etc) aren't working because of COVID-19. Their offices aren't open for appointments and so I figured it wouldn't hurt to see what's happening on r/mentalhealth.

I'll start by saying that I'm a senior (Gr. 12) in high school. My junior year (Gr. 11) was all that I could ask for. I had a 3.7 GPA and I was on a roll. I was certain about going to university and all that good stuff. Fast forward to the fall of 2019 and I'm starting my senior year of high school. I was off a bit of a bumpy start but I very quickly stabilized and got into the groove of things. Towards the middle/end of October, I noticed that I didn't feel motivated anymore and lost my 'drive.' Like the drive that you need to get up in the morning, get to school, eat, do work, etc. I was also sleeping significantly more than usual. Now, backtracking to the summer of 2019, I went to my general practitioner to see if he could help me with all these odd feelings that I had and became hyper-aware of thanks to reading up on what OCD and GAD are. I told him about it and we sort of narrowed it all down to OCD, and then I was put on Prozac for it. Now, This was also when I had been upped to the highest dose of Prozac I'd ever been on. Which was 70 mg. This led me to do research at home into what these symptoms mean and I sort of narrowed it down to me having ADHD. I sort of found it a bit of an odd self-diagnosis because I didn't really consider myself as having ADHD. I didn't have trouble sitting still or any of the other stereotypical characteristics that a person with ADHD would have — and to be honest, I'm still not quite sure if I have it, even after seeing the professionals and being put on a prescription for ADHD. It's been about 2 or 3 months now since starting on the prescriptions for ADHD, and I still don't feel particularly different. My psychiatrist also told me that it would be fine to stop taking the Prozac altogether to see if my symptoms change, and so far, nothing. I still feel unmotivated, despite going on week 5 or 6 of not taking the Prozac. 

So then, my question is, does any other diagnosis fit my situation? I'm thinking perhaps depression has something to do with it, but I'm not entirely certain since depression and ADHD/ADD aren't things that happen suddenly. I did well in school the previous year and didn't really suffer too much from attention/impulsiveness. Any pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated! All of you guys here are amazing people and it truly feels so comforting knowing that there are other people going through it as well!",02Apr2020,1

86,"Background:
My brother Luke Skywalker was diagnosed with both sever depression and anxiety 6 months ago. I witnessed him even try to take his own life. He has gone to therapy and been given medicine and is in a lot better place than he was back then. However, he recently told me that he does not take the medicine that the doctors prescribed him. He tells me that he was directed to take it “as needed” but I know that is not the case. 

Today I woke up to a text at 4am from my youngest brother, Lebron James, saying he heard (in his words) a “terror scream” come From Luke Skywalker’s room. Lebron ran to Luke’s room and was yelling “what happened, what’s wrong?” And Luke said “nothing, give me a sec” and proceeded to take a little bit before opening the bedroom door for Lebron. Lebron and Luke both went to the family room to watch tv after that and Lebron asked Luke “what happened?” Luke’s answer was that he “thought a spider was crawling into his mouth.” And that he thought that because he was “hallucinating it.”

I’m a bit skeptical of the story but I don’t know. Regardless I just worry about Luke Skywalker. I don’t think hallucinating is normal if true, but I also don’t know what happened. Any advice? I don’t even know what I’m looking for but writing/typing this up about it makes me feel better, sorry.",02Apr2020,1

94,"Hi, I am a 21/F who has been struggling with my mental health for around 4 years now. I got in touch with the University mental health team who then referred me to a 'Talking Therapies'. From there, I was referred to the Psychosis team and thus diagnosed with 'First Episode Psychosis'. This isn't an epsiode, it's been ongoing for nearly 4 years now - I've constantly been hounded by people in my head, it's only when they started showing me things is when I wanted to get help.

I was with a Care-Coordinator for several weeks, she was absolutely useless. I don't want to go into detail, it isn't relevant but she just didn't care. None of the hours we spent together were focused on me, rather other people's experiences of voices - which I told her don't work and she argued with me regarding this, ""evidence shows blah, blah, blah""... So I changed to a different Care-Coordinator. Who seems to care about my condition the same as the first, basically she doesn't. She told me she'd ring me twice a week, 3 weeks ago, nothing still! Everytime I ring, I'm told to leave a message and she'll get back to me... Nope!

My question is, are they all the same? I seem to be forgotten about at every turn? It's driving me further down the dark path and I contemplate suicide most everyday. I know that there is a pandemic, but why tell me something to then not do it... That's what bothers me the most. They're working from home FFS!!",02Apr2020,1

I should clean my room.
I should shower.
I should brush my teeth.

What ends up happening is that I have no interest in doing these things if they are not necessary.

Like it's not that I don't do that all the time just sometimes when I should do it I choose to not do it for  days and sometimes even weeks.

When I do it I feel amazing I have this great feeling of accomplishment and it's really just a good feeling but then I don't do it... For days... Weeks and then I'm upset with myself for not doing it and instead of changing it by myself I just sit on my computer and play my games again and I don't even enjoy playing then because I'm mad at myself for not doing what I should do...

1) i cant stand the emotion itself, 2) its stopping me from feeling anything else, im too positive to feel happy from anything else cause my mind thinks im happy already but im too positive to let me cover this emotion with bad emotions, i assume this is because of my numbed emotions but, 3) this isnt the type of emotion that just goes away easily, nothing works, venting, openly expressing how much i want to kill myself, triggering my trypophobia with the worst things i know about, none of that works

Anyway to the point a few days ago I had a few people complain about me with listening and making mistakes so I google it and got ADHD popping up so I was like nah not me I don’t have ADHD what ever let’s look and almost everything related to my day to day activity constantly misplacing things can’t concentrate especially with noise I can hear the voices of people but their words sound like gibberish until I block out other noises and distractions. I’m impulsive I buy things without thinking of the bad things that could come from it like debt which I have a lot of I’ve been working on removing some of it but then I just keep buying things on credit and then end up with more. Buy now regret later seems to be my motto. I go on tangents in conversations very easily well to my they’re related but to everyone else it’s very loosely related. Pretty much always need to be fidgeting like with pens tapping moving me legs just playing with things. I can’t finish jobs it’s impossible I try to make music but I just hit a brick wall constantly and can’t carry on no matter how hard I want to try. I skip from hobby to hobby luckily I can keep a job down but that’s because my boss is really nice and won’t fire me without me punching someone so this job is safe I’ve made a few bad mistakes but luckily they’re in the past now I make little errors but they don’t get picked up on most of the time.

Thats a small list there’s more but my memory is really bad I can remember lyrics to almost all my favourite songs but I can’t remember things said to me 3 seconds ago like names names are the worst I can never remember them I try so hard to remember but I can’t. 

Anyway so I’m scared to get diagnosed.. my only option is to go private because of the corona virus I found a cheap.. ish place £350 for the diagnosis 150 for the medication trial. I’ve taken so many only tests to make sure I have it and it always comes back yes go get diagnose but I just don’t want to waste money if I don’t have it. I know I do have it but I just don’t have 350 to lose I could go through the nhs but they told me t come back in 3 months as of the virus and even then that waiting list is like 6 to 12 months long or something I can’t wait that long. I’m losing hope and starting to feel like just accepting that this is my life and not bother to get diagnosed but then again I need to make one song for my grandma she’s closed to the end I know it and I don’t want her to die without hearing my music she’s always said I can sing and would make a good musician and I want to make her proud and if she dies before I can I won’t forgive myself and if I do have ADHD and all this could’ve been prevented I’ll be so angry I’d probably be susicidal I’m 21 I should be capable of doing all this shit but everyone treats me like an idiot",02Apr2020,1
102,"Ok so I've been taking wellbutrin for about 2 years
I used to take mehhh maybe 3 other meds (2 for anxiety, one other antidepressant) but I took myself off those 😂😂😂 i took myself off the anxiety ones because they were take-as-needed and I decided I should probably begin to start dealing with any anxiety myself without medicating and just becoming super fucking tired (bc they make u tired) &amp; anxious at the same time.
I took myself off the lexapro because it simply didnt work. The wellbutrin was the miracle worker. It did everything! And it was great!
So yeah the reason I began on wellbutrin is because the previous 284893 (jk it was like 2 or 3 maybe) meds didnt work. I had a very bad episode 2 years ago which led to overdosing on expired trazedone. I was super suicidal, but did great the next day after the OD, and then i was put on meds (honestly i may have been put on wellbutrin at the hospital i was in a few weeks before but i think it was after the attempt) again obviously. And yep, wellbutrin seemed to help! Honestly after the overdose i found an insane anount of inner peace. It's like the pills killed some chemicals in my brain. Not likely but i like to think about it that way. Ever since, my mind has been so blank but so peaceful.
Either way I'm still motherfucking depressed. I'm just not suicidal. I think there was a trigger to my suicidal episodes though so maybe I didn't need medicine. Maybe I just got over what was bothering me. 
But yeah..still depressed! I mean I'm a pro at it now so it isn't as bothersome. When you've been through this stuff for many years, it's like meh whatever - unless you go thru suicidalness...that shit is no joke. I have no real sympathy for people but I feel SO fucking bad for suicidal people. Like I actually get sad. Whack

For context: The relationship we have is casual and pretty new. Fun, largely sexual, not lots of emotional talk, and vague and undefined. we’ve gone to movies and dinner, and he’s taken me to gatherings with his friends and started to incorporate me into that. But it’s also very much based on sex and he doesn’t say a lot so he’s kind of hard to read. He has always been kind to me though and tries to make sure I’m having a good time. He’s very laid back and naturally confident, but in a subtle and slightly aloof way, rather than a cocky aggressive way. While I’m clearly the passive, inexperienced and insecure one. I often get really nervous and insecure around him, not because of anything he says but just the fact that he’s 33 and I’m 23 and he has way more life experience and just general knowledge about random things. Even though I am technically more educated, and people who know me think I’m smart, I always wind up sounding and feeling stupid. It is sometimes hard for me to keep up in conversations about sports and politics and drugs and TV and popular culture and I end up feeling and sounding dumb, boring and quiet. At least that’s how I see it.

Anyway, last night I went to his home and stayed the night (and morning). He did tell me he was pretty tired, but when I offered to reschedule he said no, that he was going to be up until probably 2am. We were both sober and had great sex almost right away. He even went down on me, for a really long time, which I didn’t ask for and which he has only done one other time and seemed to be trying extra hard to please me, especially The  watched a lot of TV and talked. I kept asking if he was tired because of what he had texted me, but couldn’t get a clear answer and he seemed to me like he wanted to talk. Also, I was bad, and had abused my meds by taking one extra 10mg adderall pretty late, which I had told him about beforehand. I thought he’d be happy I’d be energized for sex and in a good mood, but that’s when he texted about feeling tired and told me not to take another one.

 Anyway it got late, later than he told me he’d be up, and the convo seemed be to flowing and I thought he was enjoying it (in my mind at least). Eventually though I got the hint that he was tired and so we went to bed. 

Well in the morning, I stayed and watched tv for an hour of so and more casual talking but eventually I got the hint to leave. He took me home and when he got out of the car he told me to text him. Well I text him random shit about my dog and he is pretty nice and asking questions and stuff. But I was way overconfident about how the night had gone and later that night did what I thought he meant by “text me”: I asked him if he wanted to do it again, which I know is way too soon to see a fwb, but I thought he had wanted me to ask him for some reason.

Anyway, he didn’t reply for like fifteen minutes and then he said he couldn’t because he “needed to catch up on sleep.” And then adds “yeah and lay off the adderall, lol, watching tv is not the time to be sped up and talkative. It’s the time to be stoned and out of it.” And the thing is he DID say he was tired but I just expected him to tell me when he wanted to go to sleep, or if he wanted me to chill out, and I honesty didn’t realize I was being annoying and that he was tired. But I guess I was kind of talkative and a little rambling I’m sure. And he HAD been mountain biking earlier that day. I just kept asking if he was tired and he said no...

Back to the text message exchange. Well I’m mortified to realize that and I become crazy and desperate. I start groveling and pathetically apologizing and saying that I’m mad myself for blowing my chance. And he replies that I’m overthinking and there is no use dragging up the past. 

Then I tell him that I hope he will give me another chance, to which he replies that he will, as long as I don’t take/abuse extra adderall on weekdays which I immediately agree to. 

But by this point I felt tremendously embarrassed, insecure and confused about where I stand so I ask him the question I’ve been avoiding, and vowed never to ask: “if you want this to be a purely physical thing, that is cool for me. I just want to know. I’m not looking for anything super long term or serious but I’d like to be friends, if you are up for it.” to which he replies: 
“I like doing things going places with you and having fun, and also the sex, but we don’t have to see each other all the time”

Idk I guess we are on the same page then, but I just keep thinking about last night over and over and now that I look back I see all the little cues that I misread, or didn’t pick up on at all. He was responding and seemed engaged to me. I only kept talking and asking him questions because I genuinely thought he was into it. And I think I vented a little about my mom. And rambled at one point about my best friend. I wish he would have just told me he was tired or not up for talking, or wanted to watch the late night TV. 

I’m very embarrassed and hurt even though he didn’t do anything really wrong. 

I think it’s just that I was trying so hard to be the cool, collected, chill non clingy non crazy girl, and not act desperate and weird, and the thing is, I thought I was doing a good job. In fact I thought I was almost too aloof! And I got confused because he let me stay over, and I started to let my guard down just a little bit, I’m apparently annoying and boring and too talkative. And once my mom said the same thing. And my ex once said he liked “sleepy me” best. And the thing is I was suppressing myself so much that night, even though I was talking, I can be way worse and more crazy weird talkative, emotional and hyper. 

And now I’m worried that I have spent my life annoying almost everyone whilst I think I’m fine. In fact while thinking I’m cute, and bubbly, and interesting and charming and inquisitive. 

I’m having a full blown breakdown over the tiniest thing and I KNOW this is obviously not an ideal or special relationship that is even worth fighting for but for some reason I care. I don’t understand how women can date casually and not end up feeling like shit.",02Apr2020,1

My ex-girlfriend suffers from depression, anxiety, PTSD, and OCD (plus potentially some others) and recently went into a manic episode last month. 

My most immediate thought is bipolar, however, I have never seen a manic episode within her for the last three years and there appears to be no constant seasonal cycle or yearly cycle.

113,"""An unflinching look at the mental illness health crisis that is ravaging the United States in a documentary made by a practicing psychiatrist who has encountered mental illness in his private life""

WHAT IT’S ABOUT: During Kennedy’s term as president, the American mental health institutions, notorious for harsh conditions, were dismantled, to be replaced by a holistic, community-based approach, and their patients let to roam free. Then, starting with Raegan, came decades of neoliberal rule, which restricted funding to mental health programs further, and saw the mentally ill kicked further to the curb. Today, severe mental health issues can be a death sentence, especially if the person in question doesn’t have the vast means to afford comprehensive healthcare. Those with caring families and those left to their own devices alike are under constant threat because medical help is rarely available. Unlike the physically manifested illnesses, their diseases remain less understood and considered shameful. “Bedlam” is narrated by Dr. Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, a psychiatrist who has experienced policy failures regarding mental health in his own family. Through his own story, as well as three other examples—a homeless and disabled middle-aged man with a manic disorder, a young woman with bipolar disorder who had to drop out of college and a man with schizophrenia who has just been released from prison—Dr. Rosenberg explores the absolute catastrophe of the country’s mental healthcare and makes an urgent plea for change.

119,"So let me tell you something about me.. As a child when i was around 6 - 11 years old i couldn't manage to talk while i was in school, was sitting on the school desk the whole day and was really shy, barelly had any friends and loved playing on my pc and listening to music. I was raised in a neighbourhood where there weren't many kids to play with and if there were, they were much older or much younger, so me and my sister were playing together most of the time (i had two to three friends that i was very comfortable with). So while i was in school many older kids were bullying me because at the time i was 10-11 years old and was short and a little obese, so from then i believed that if i act tough, kids would stop bullying me and as a result i became really easily frustrated about anything. After a year or two i realised that the angrier i looked adding to my shortness i was looking kinda cute and not as somebody that people would fear. At that time i couldn't explain how but i got a lot taller and lost all of my obesity and people started telling me that i was too skinny, still some a little older kids bullied me a bit, but when i became 14 years old everybody started treating me different and many people told me that i changed completely.. however i changed physically but in my mind i was still easily frustrated,  but i can't explain i tried to put that inside me because i felt like i looked like a complete asshole so i started numbing my feelings, that was when i was 14 and now im 15 years old i tend to still numb myself a bit,  but for the most i can feel and show emotions, i just feel like i'm numbing them from time to time, like i can't manage to chill out and i think that my childhood has something to do with this, but i don't know.. Any opinions? Also i feel totaly free around my classmates now, still a bit awkward and shy but when compared to the time i was really young, now i trully feel confident in my looks, height and weight.",02Apr2020,1

122,"Hi guys, I (19f) was molested by my babysitter when I was around the age of 4. Well, technically it was my babysitter's teenage brother, but he would help watch us when she had to go get groceries or something. I'm not going to go into many details, but I don't remember everything super clearly. I remember two specific memories pretty clearly, but then other times all I remember is him reaching into my pants and then it goes blank. I don't remember if it ever went beyond touching, but I don't think I want to know. I also don't know if I was the only one, but I remember him singling me out a lot. Like, when nap time would roll around he'd ask me to stay up and help him play video games  (I obviously wasn't actually playing) because I was his favorite. Things like that. 

For years I didn't really grasp what had happened. I remember he was handsome and he always let me do what I want, eat what I want. It wasn't until I started going through puberty and the topics of sex, consent, sexual assault, etc became a topic of conversation. I was around 12 when it hit me. I'd pretty much forgotten about him and I don't remember what triggered the memory but I remember just laying in my bed and crying. I didn't tell anyone because I was embarrassed but I started acting out. I became a huge asshole for a couple of years and one time when I was around 13/14 my mom &amp; I got into a bad fight because I'd wanted to hangout with this older guy and she basically told me she didn't want him to hurt me and I said that wouldn't happen and she said, ""you've never experience assault. You don't understand why I'm doing this. I'm protecting you."" I got really angry for a couple reasons. One, this poor guy hadn't done anything wrong so I felt bad that my mom was assuming he was a creep without meeting him, but also I HAD experienced assault. And it was by someone I, and my parents, had trusted. I remember wanting to tell her so bad what had happened, but I was afraid she wouldn't believe me. 

My parents, as much as I love them, were very manipulative &amp; emotionally abusive growing up. They'd find ways to make me feel ashamed, even if I'd done nothing wrong, and so I kept my mouth shut. I physically couldn't bring myself to say anything, and so I went to my room and that was the first time I'd self harmed. I didn't self harm consistently, only when I thought about when I was 4, or when I was frustrated because I couldn't just say it. So, in the past 15 years I've only told a couple of people. A couple of my friends, but usually I'd just brush over it and I wouldn't tell the full story. Mostly I'd just say stuff like, ""yeah, he was a creep."" 

I struggle with intimacy &amp; relationships a lot. I know that my experience &amp; how I've tried dealing with the trauma are part of it, but even though I logically know I need to calm down I still have physical &amp; emotional reactions to things that aren't a big deal. It exhausts me and I just wish I could bring myself to seek help, but something holds me back. I don't trust my family enough and I'm afraid of telling any guy I'm seeing, and I don't want to put that burden on my friends. I know the logical thing would be to seek professional help but every time I try any of the online/free things I panic and just turn it off. I just can't afford to see someone in person &amp; I don't want my family to find out, which they would because of insurance.

 My mom doesn't agree with me going to therapy because despite my doctor suggesting I see a therapist due to depression &amp; anxiety &amp; my chronic pain, my mom still thinks nothing is wrong with me. And the sad thing is part of me agrees with her. I doubt myself a lot, and I tell myself I'm overreacting, and I think about how the experience with my babysitter was SO long ago, and I need to just move on. But I can't. More things are starting to trigger my memory and then I'll just think about him for a hot minute. It's driving me crazy and I feel so alone. I don't talk to anyone about anything. I've dealt with everything by myself. Being molested, having an eating disorder, I even deal with my chronic pain alone 99% of the time. I thought I was able to cope just fine but as time goes on it gets worse and I get into my head and spiral into a deep depression, then I'll get out of it and feel great and like nothing is wrong and I can do anything and I get super motivated, but then I spiral again. It's a cycle and I'm tired of it.

 I've tried googling resources &amp; all, but like I said, something always holds me back. I just wish I had support, and I know I would if I told my sister and my friends, but I'd feel weird. I don't like feeling vulnerable and as the person who always listens, protects, gives advice, I don't want to be one people worry about. I know this is a long read, and I apologize, but I just  needed to talk. Even if no one is listening.",02Apr2020,1

But nothing has changed, it became real when some stuff happened.  And I am... a very unique person.  Love and understanding. Well, was. Maybe.   I would say my ability to love and understand is in no way compromised, but I am a shell of what I was.

132,"I dated my ex for about a year. We broke up about 3 weeks ago, and we haven't been handling it very well (I own up to my mistakes in this situation as well).

He was a really good boyfriend, I was head over heels for him, he treated me really well and is overall a wonderful person. A few months into our relationship, it came to light that he had depression. It wasn't so bad that I was concerned, but bad enough that I told him that he had to see a doctor and get on antidepressants.

When his depression kicked in, he was a completely diffent person. He had horrible mood swings, the smallest things could be the end of the world to him. When he was mad or sad, he said really hurtful things to me. I always respected his moment of being sad, but when he went back to being ""himself"", I made it very clear that I did not tolerate being treated that way, and that if he didn't seek help, I couldn't take that relationship any further.

Seeing the man who treated me like a princess suddenly treat me like a stranger, shutting me out and lashing out at me for things I didn't have anything to do with really got to me, and I couldn't stand that, it hurt me a lot.

But I was stupid, and I put up with that for a good 3-2 months.

About three weeks ago, I finally had enough of it when he snapped at me when I told him I couldn't see him because I had to study for college (I'm in med school, shit is real).

So, I broke up with him. I just couldn't take it anymore.

After that, the threats came. Threats of him hurting himself and doing something stupid.

I got legitimately terrified, I didn't sleep for a week. I was so scared he was going to hurt himself, I'd blame myself for the rest of my life. So, I made it very clear that we are not together anymore, but I still keep in contact with him.

I usually turn the game to silent and put on podcast to make it stop but recently it started popping up while I make music and I can't just turn on a podcast while trying to make a song.

139,"This is rather a recent phenomenon. I've most of my life been in control emotionally and fairly stoic to an ample extent. Until a few days ago I would be able to effortlessly brush off any heated argument and laugh at any insult. But lately, any interaction or confrontation that gives rise to negative emotions (verbal quarrels, snide comments, being roasted etc) seem to leave me drained. It's strange really, after an argument with someone not only do I get sad but I also feel like there's not one reason in the world I should continue on with my tasks of the day. You may say I lack a ""why"" but I assure that's not it. Even if I see definite reasons to accomplish my tasks I've lost all drive and energy to do so. ** It's like I'm wrapped inside a dense barrier of fatigue and sloth, with sadness and intense anxiety vibrating beneath the surface** . Not even fun things like gaming or sex interests me, all I do is lay on my bed and breathe away the hours (I'd probably even find a way to slack off from that if I could because at times even that feels like a chore).

140,"First day here, hope this is the right place. 

So what's happening, my wife had a nervous breakdown in January, her second. She suffered a psychotic break, schizophrenia, horrendous anxiety, the works. We got her the right meds, and the help she needed but we have a long road ahead. The entire process took about 2 months of essentially 24 hour care, every moment keeping an eye on her to help her get back on her feet and then adjusting to giving her more space as she was more and more capable. 
It was the worst month of our lives but in different ways. I will never really know how it felt for her but she also doesn't really know how sick she was. Allot of what happened she doesn't remember. 

In my own life, I have been doing night classes for a diploma in computer science and have pushed myself very hard and got great results. It was a great sign of my own recovery from depression and social anexity after attending therapy for about a year. I will return  to therapy after covid and fully expect that to be what really helps me, but in the meantime I throw myself atthe Oracle of internet wisdom. 


I had to defer 2 of my 3 modules since my wife was so  unwell. But one course was maintained  and I'm finding it very, very hard to get back to work on it. I also lost my job due to covid and am under lockdown, so I have all the time in the world. But all I seem to want to do is vegetate at home, play games, stay up late and close the world off.

It was barely two semesters, but it was the worst I've ever been. I've had periods where I felt a little sad and out of sorts, but going to uni was a different level. Going to campus, roaming through campus to get to classes, then to sit in those classes were almost always fear inducing experiences. Me, a weird awkward person, was thrown into a world where cool people were hanging around at every corner, so for me it felt like I had target on my back without legitimate reason. If my stress level wasn't turned up to the top it was at least always there under the surface.

I think several factors led me to slowly spiral downward and every day I felt like I wanted to die. But now I'm wondering if I should have just pushed through. I know I wasn't disciplined enough, so was it wrong for me to just give up? Now, I'm not as miserable as I was back then, but I have nothing to show for myself.

And [this guys thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7713d5/extreme_urge_to_hurt_girlfriends_dog/), but to a lesser extent. 

Preface:

I have no mental issues to really speak of. I am a very isolated individual. I have a small circle of friends and have no desire to ever really be social. I spend most of my time on the internet, studying, lifting weights, and working.  I also have a dog of my own who I love and would never, ever harm. I've had several dogs before him all of which I've loved just as much. He's one of my best friends, easily.

The issue:

Throughout my life I have dated several women with small dogs. I won't go into details of them all, only the one I have now. But, know that the situation was similar for them in the past.

My girlfriend has a small raggedy old chihuahua dog. It's an old dog and has back issues, but its still fairly healthy. It acts very pompous and spoiled. It will snap at you if you don't give it food. It will snap at you if you pet it the wrong way. Well, at first the dog didn't mind me too much. But now I am filled with rage when I am around the thing. The fact it's so fucking ugly and acts like a spoiled brat... I started doing things to it, slowly. I'd pull the carpet out from under it so it'd hit the floor. I'd smack its head. Well, it started to yelp when it did that and I didn't want them hearing so I've started to ram my hand down its throat while I continued to fuck with it.

I'll spare you the details. But I fucking love every second of it. I don't know why. I feel like a freakin schizo writing this. But I have an image gallery of it on my phone that I stare at sometimes for an hour straight, just seething with rage and imagining all the torturous things I can do to it. It feels really really good. I've thought about pulling out its teeth and other things. 

I don't get intrusive thoughts or thoughts of violence aside from this one thing: the girlfriend's shitty small dog. 

**Do not comment ""you need to get help""** because I probably won't. Obviously I'm not alone, I found two threads exactly like my situation. The only thing that can prevent this is if somehow a connection can be made from my own insecurities to the thoughts of abuse I get. But I've tried. The whole ""do you see yourself as the dog"" thing. Nah. I don't know what it is at all. But that's why I'm making this thread. 

Please don't get mad at me. I don't want to stop, but I also *want to want to* stop.",02Apr2020,1

149,"I guess this isn't really all that terrible, but it has been leaving me feeling really bad about myself in every single way these past few days.  
I was always struggling with self esteem, though I kept it under control for the past few months. I guess using social networks, waking up at 1 pm and not going anywhere (well obviously) for these past few weeks gradually deteriorated my overall mental health.  
It seems to me that everyone is way more connected to each other, while I'm still alone. I feel really unimportant and I dismiss every accomplishment I've made in the past. Whatever I do, it's never enough for me. I feel like I could always do better, but I never actually do. I can't see my improvement in whatever I do, it's really demotivating and depressing. Besides feeling like a failure, I started developing issues with my looks, weight, and especially height. I'm just hoping I can feel better about myself. I feel like a stranger in my own skin.

I have tried killing myself through various methods, but I either lacked the courage or skill necessary to successfully pull off the attempt, or the method used simply wasn't that effective at causing my demise.

This year is a bit special, though. I wasn't able to plan ahead and buy a bit of rope, I don't have the prescription to purchase the necessary bottle of pills, and I simply have no way to get my hands on a gun—by far the best of the three.

I am left with simply a razor—not the most effective, and certainly one of the most painful ways to go. But I have no alternative.

It won't be the cleanest way to go, maybe. And I'll have time to regret the stupidity of trying to off myself once again. But, what choice do I have?

I probably won't do it, *again* (a few shallow cuts wouldn't hurt, though) but it's been a tradition for over a decade now, and I'm loath to not partake of it this year.

152,"We've been together for 10 months, and about three months ago, circumstances put us in a temporary long distance relationship in super stressful environments. He suffers from depression, self confidence issues and severe anxiety. Since we started the long distance portion, I've started to feel that we are not meant for each other, and it has gotten to the point where when we talk each day it is all just super negative stuff from him about how he hates where he's at, he hates everyone around him and how nothing about his life is good right now.

I have had my own issues with mental health in the past and one of the ways I coped with it was by forcing myself to be positive and optimistic about as much as I can, and hearing such negative things every day from him kind of takes me back to that depressive state I used to be in. I love him very much, but I am convinced that we are not meant to be together as a couple and feel like we need to step away from being together romantically. But he has told me many times as side comments when we've talked, things like there's no point in going on if we aren't together, if you ever broke up with me I'd probably kill myself, I wouldn't want to live anymore if we weren't together, or that if I ever broke up with him that he'd never date or love again and would just be a ho* instead.

I feel like it's super manipulative of him to say that and I don't know how serious he is, but I'm also very worried if he is at all serious about it. He's in a super stressful work environment right now (military) and that adds to his mental health issues and I don't want to be the cause of him having a breakdown or worse, breaking up with him during a time where he's going through a stressful time.

I guess I'm hoping some of you might have some advice or recommendations on what I should do? Am I being selfish in wanting to put my happiness and mental health ahead of his? Should I wait to break up with him until he's out of the stressful work environment, or would that just be leading him on?

162,"So there is this acquaintance, calling him John, whom I've recently met and we been speaking now and then and just getting to know each other.

I will endeavour to keep this back story as brief as possible. John is very much into cycling and mountain biking as a professional, almost to an obsessive degree in my opinion. Please note that this is merely my perception of him. He comes off as rather arrogant, but not to the point of being an a**hole. He also tends to project an insane amount of confidence in himself.  Unfortunately though he has become toxic and I don't know how to process the situation. 

Here are some examples of things he's said: He was saying at one point how he is so straight that he makes pole dancing poles look bent. Another one where I asked him what are his plans during our lockdown, he replied saying how he is going to work out doing all manner of push ups and work on his abs that by the time the lockdown is over, he is going to have abs strong enough to grate cheese. He made other comparisons but I can't quite remember what else he said. Also, I inadvertently came across a post he made on Instagram where he is doing the typical Superman pose next to his fancy bicycle dressed in his cycle gear.

This next part might seem very awkward but I feel it's necessary to mention. Another aspect of this whole situation is how can someone who claims to be so straight, he makes poles look bent, be so comfortable and willing to squeeze himself into skin tight outfits and even pose for such a photo which is potentially so revealing.  I just can't seem to understand that, perhaps there is something I'm missing? 

Apologies in advance if I offend anyone, it is not my intention to.

It’s almost like an addiction. Almost every thought I have is about food or the calories in it or binging and then making myself vomit till veins pop in my face. When it happens it’s an endless cycle. Eating,purging, eating then purging. And it doesn’t stop for at least an hour. I can’t help myself from doing it. And I feel so horrible about eating that the anxiety of not throwing up is way worse than actually vomiting. Seeing numbers drop on the scale makes me so happy that I don’t even want to stop. I’m so embarrassed. I just wish I had a normal relationship with food. I can’t eat without overthinking it anymore and it consumes my thoughts. I have little to no motivation for anything. All I want to do is sleep or just stay in bed. I cry a lot. Too much. My boyfriend is worried. I made him cry for the first time in years bc I was seriously thinking about ending my life. Seeing the way it affected him made me realize that I need to get better and live a better life not only for me but for him. He’s my everything nowadays. I can’t see a future without him and it’s so scary. My ex boyfriend was also my life. And I also couldn’t see a future without him. It feels like it’s almost a matter of time till we break up or something and I’m terrified that is the case. Because I have no purpose without him. I don’t see any reason to live without him bc all of my goals and future is with him. I want to get married and have a family. I realize that I’m a very family oriented person. Maybe that stems from me having a really rough family situation my whole life but it seems like the things that make me happy is my relationship and the future of things. I want to love myself and feel comfortable and confident for once in my life. I cry about taking a picture. I can’t even look at myself most of the time without breaking down.

It's difficult to manage but here's a little technique which is sure to help put things in perspective for those of us struggling, I call it the Cinderella Effect. Good luck and be well.

.

\-The Cinderella Effect-

Pick a day, one whole day that you will give this scenario a try. The evening before I want you both to pretend that you are going to live your last day on earth, together. You’ll die at midnight the next day... like Cinderella having to leave the ball. I know... I know, it's morbid right? Just hear me out. For the entire day I'd like you to treat yourself, your partner, and your children or other loved ones as if it was your last day on earth.

.

Throughout the day, ask yourself if it's worth being angry over a disagreement? Is it worth being upset? Is it worth being impatient, frustrated, stressed, anxious, resentful, guilty, regretful or annoyed? Is this how you want to spend your last day?

.

Every moment you experience a negative emotion is one last moment and opportunity for you both to experience beautiful ones such as gratitude, compassion, patience, humility, joy, appreciation, empathy, sympathy, grace and love.

.

So each time you feel that negative emotion bubble up… remind yourself, “This is the last day I have left to live… I am not going to allow this negative emotion to steal away any moments from this final and important day,” take a deep breath and flush out the negative emotion, “I am going to reside in patience... I am going to anchor myself into gratitude and be extremely present for all the gifts and all the beauty that I have in my life... and I am going to celebrate each moment of each day with every breath I take... and I am going to focus my senses; my  sight, hearing, taste, touch, and feeling on experiencing all of the blessings and all of the beauty which surround me in every moment of every day. I am going to clear my mind and remain mindful of presence, of awareness, of my true reality. I am grateful. I am humbled. I am loved. I am love.”

.

Make an agreement to try this out for one day and observe how much it changes how you treat one another throughout that entire day. Then after I want you to ask yourself something… “Have I been promised more than one day of life on this earth? Am I wasting what could be my very last day on earth being upset? What’s to prevent me from dying at midnight? Am I wasting time on unimportant bullshit? Could this be the very last day of life I have to live? Could this be the last opportunity I have to live… to breathe… to celebrate my gratitude for all of the blessings which have been granted to me and my loved ones? Can I make a permanent change… can I begin living each day as if it were my last? Can I live one final day filled with love and not fear? Do I have time to make this change? Can I start now?”",02Apr2020,1
169,"This might be a bit long and convoluted so feel free to ignore it, and I'm also on mobile, so formatting. 

I (30F) have a history of self harming and suicide attempts. My fiancé (30M) and I live together in the flat he owns with our 2 cats and 1 dog. He's still allowed to work at the moment, he's a student but classes are cancelled so he's working with his dad who is a landscape gardener, I got laid off a couple of weeks ago. I'm also supposed to be on holiday with my BFF at the moment, and we were just starting our wedding plans. Because of the coronavirus, everything got cancelled, and my mental health has never been worse.

My fiancé and I have been together for nearly 2.5 years, engaged since October 2019 and living together since April 2018. In the last few months, I've been getting more and more resentful toward him for little things and for consistently doing things he said he would stop/work on not doing. At the moment, I feel like he's expecting me to do all the cooking and cleaning because I'm not working, even though I never really expected the same of him on days when he was off from college. 

I have a rocky relationship with my dad and step-mum, although it has massively improved in the last 18 months, a very strained relationship with my mother, and no relationship with my sister (she is the main reason the relationship with my mother is so bad). I moved to live with my fiancé, his family are the only people I know round here, but because everything is on lockdown, the only time I can go out at the moment is if I'm taking the dog out.

I have a small group of friends but everyone has their own mental health issues and stuff going on, so I've not reached out to any of them about how I've been feeling.

My fiancé has been off with a stomach bug the last few days and I'm pretty sure if he hadn't been, I would have overdosed by now. I'm on a host of different medicines, for depression, anxiety, and a long term medical condition, plus I get prescription strength painkillers for back issues. I recently got all of my prescriptions refilled and it's very tempting to take everything at once.

I feel more lost than I think I ever have done, everything was falling into place a couple of months ago and now it has collapsed spectacularly, and I just don't want to do it anymore. I want to go to sleep and not wake up. I'd even settle for catching the virus and not getting medical treatment for it at this point, but that would never happen, because let's face it, this is me we're talking about.",02Apr2020,1
170,"Ever since COVID-19 has started to change our daily lives, it’s drastically affected my mental health. I found a way to cope with my depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. through my hobbies, daily rituals and a structured schedule. My world’s been shaken upside down and I know a lot of other people are struggling, and have it worse. I’m thankful I still have a job, thankful I’m still physically healthy, but every waking day feels like I’m dying without the sweet release of death. And I dread waking up having to go through it over and over again. I’m having a difficult time finding meaning, a purpose, something to keep me going. I normally reach out to the suicide hotline once every few months when things get incredibly difficult to handle. Just this past week, I’ve reached out 4 times. I’m struggling and I honestly don’t know what to do...",02Apr2020,1
171,"Now that we are in quarantine, a member of my band suggested to make a video showing all of us playing a piece from home.  
I agreed, because I am an idiot who can't say no to anything. The worst part is they picked the song that's hardest for me and I agreed to do it anyway because I thought I could make it.

It's not technically hard. I'm a keyboard player and this song consists in a lot of sections overlapped.
So I'd first have to figure out what kind of sounds they are, then figure out how to split them in the keyboard.

But it's too complicated and it makes me not want to do it. Hell, it makes me not want to be in a band. I am classicaly trained and play in a band mainly for the people, gigs, a little money and fun.

I have stressed myself a lot this last week for this stupid crappy video that won't even make us money. I have anger management issues. Sometimes I'll hit my wardrobe and myself.

One band member told me that I don't necessarily have to do it, but I don't know if he was just being nice. Plus, everyone already sent their part. They probably got the hint that I am not going to do it but I'm not sure. I just told them I'm busy.
I don't know what to do. I am more inclined not to do it because it's causing me so much mental damage, at the same time I might feel like a loser because everyone already sent their part. But as I said, I am more inclined to not do it, and if they complain I might instantly leave the band, that's the type of guy I am.

This thing has made me suffer more than it should have. In fact, at times it made me consider leaving the band for allowing myself to allow them to let myself make me feel this way. Makes sense? No? 

I'd just like to tell them ""hey listen, I know I told you I'd do this thing, but as things are right now, I'd rather eat shit than do it. Also, because I'm feeling like a loser, I'm considering leaving the band too, that way you don't have to deal with a loser.""",02Apr2020,1
172,"Hi, I won't say my name cause I value my privacy.

I'm 17 years old right now and I have been diagnosed with ADHD and ADD at a very young age. I always had problems concentrating, I never had amazinh grades but I wasn't dumb. I loved computers and everything around it and I was very sporty aswell, I would hang out with my friends playing soccer and stuff all day.

Growing up I always had problems with my concentration, I couldn't keep my eyes or ears focused for even a minute, even if I really wanted to. Because I had so much trouble concentrating, my grades were awful. I thought I looked stupid, so I became the cool kid. Make alot friends, never pay attention and only come to school to make some fun. Not to learn.

Of course, this didn't work very well... Long story short, I got kicked out of multiple high schools and to this day, I haven't started at a new one.

Because I was ""the cool kid"" I hung out with the other ""cool kids"", tho these kids came from very different backgrounds. They already had older brothers who were criminals or had grown up in thougher neighborhoods. I didn't. Even tho I'm pretty tall and can come up for myself. I was some times a little scared. So what did I do? I became one of them.

I would start f*cking around on the streets, just messing with people, throwing stuff, yelling, screaming, intimidating ect. Gradually I became older and started seeing the need of money in my life. I started planning with my friends to rob people and I became more interested in guns and violence. 

One day I broke into someone's house with 2 friends and I got caught. This changed my life forever. I never had any problems with the police before and I got restricted from being and talking with those friends.

Because I couldn't be with my ""bad"" friends anymore, I would go back to my old friends. Tho I soon realised, I had become very different than them and we just didn't match up anymore. 

I was feeling quite depressed sometimes but I was making new friends... They were totally different, they all had fun in a nice way, just messing around but without being violent or bad behaving in any kind of way. That did do somethings that you'd probaly considering very bad tho. Drugs. Many, many drugs.

To keep this as short as possible (just realised how long I've been typing -_-), I started smoking weed. Gradually starting using XTC. Then 2CB, Ketamine, LSD. You know the drill...

I was only focused on doing drugs, every single day. I woke up, I'd think ""what am I going to do today?"". Drugs, I'm not addicted to a specific drug I can assure you. But I'm definitely addicted to escaping reality with the use of drugs.

Even tho I was always looking for a way to escape reality, it recently became inevitable. I was feeling like I was on LSD while I hadn't used it for months. I felt extreme anxiety on random occations, hard time thinking and stuff. I noticed it, sure. But I didn't know what to think of it. I had always have mental issues (not like this tho) so I thought it was kinda normal or something.

But I now realise it is not, I came across a YouTube video about the early signs of schizophrenia, and I was to my surprise shocked that I could relate to every single topic...

Lets evaluate what I experience:
Room turning (like I'm upside down)
Increases or decreases of light indoors
Color shifting (mostly like a yellow tint snapchat filter)
Weird thoughts (can't explain :( )
Depression
I don't want to go outside
Scared of shadows
Random movements in normal objects like doors and chairs.
Constant anxiousness.
Weird voice like sounds (unlocatable)

I experience more than I just listed I just can't seem to get my mind clear enough to write them down.

I'm really lost right now, like actually right now while I write this. I've forgotten my subject about 4 times now while I'm writing this. So I'll stop before I make myself crazy.

I've never posted before, so I'm no expert or anything on reddit.

But please give me some advice or help me. Any kind of help is appreciated.

Regards N.",02Apr2020,1
173,"*I am sorry in advance for the long text. The main subject is in the 3rd paragraph.*

Hello. I just made this account because I am honestly desperate to find some help to a problem that has persisted for half of my life.

I am a 22 years old guy. I live in Brazil and my life was pretty turbulent since I was very young. Only when I was 12 we finally discovered I had Asperger Syndrome which was the core cause of most issues such as anxiety, internal overwhelming by outside pressure and turbulent social relations with others, as well as a terrible educational development and complete absence of discipline and schedule. Since then I managed through a lot of hard work and help of 2 professionals to relearn much of what I didn’t as well as become very self aware both in how everything works around me and myself in order to seek methods to improve the shortcomings of some limitations I have. Such as executive disfunction and extreme anxiety as said previously.


Despite all this a problem that was starting to lurk since I was younger and solidified when I was 12 and onwards was the inconsistent sleep schedule and eventually complete absence of it reaching now an extreme state in which it is completely inverted. Me and my mom are not in a good financial situation for the past few years and I’m trying to earn money through my craft as well as keep with my studies at college but this sleep disorder is ruining everything for me (being that there are already enough problems I have to deal with). I got to the point that I sleep around 6~7am when the sun has already rose here and wake up around 5~6pm when the sun has already set.


I would like to know anything I can about this disorder and what I can do about it. I am honestly desperate and although it goes against it, I am willingly to try to fight it heads on.",02Apr2020,1
174,"If one more person tells me that all I need to do to cure my mental illness is:

-Exercise

- eat healthy

-do yoga

-go on a walk

-go in a forest

-pray

-accept whatever god(s) into my heart and soul

-do some weird alternative medicine practices 

-stop  taking my perscribed meds 
Etc...

I'm going to lose my shit. If any one of these helps you that's amazing and good for you. Yes, some of these things are better than others and are quite healthy. I also know that taking care of your body is important for your physical and mental health. However,people treat some of these like a miracle cure. I'm already trying to do some of these things, but my depression makes it incredibly difficult to even get out of bed. I try to exercise and eat healthy, but most if the time I just feel even more worn out. Most of the time, when I hear people saying this, it ends up sounding quite dismissive towards those suffering from mental illness. As if just doing 'x thing' will cure you.",02Apr2020,1
175,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year now and I couldnt be happier with her. In fact Im planning on popping the question in a few month's time. But she suffers from bouts of severe depression, anxiety, and more recently she's mentioned hearing voices in her head. Im terrified she might be suffering from schizophrenia, but more so that she might follow through on the suicidal thoughts that have plagued her since she was 14 or so. I know there is help she can get, even now with COVID raging through the world. How can I try to convince her that she should seek professional help? She has a will to live, I know that much from how long she's coped with her own mind and the way she talks and acts in her low moments. But how can I phrase my words to try and convince her to seek the help she needs?",02Apr2020,1
176,"I myself am a sufferer of mental health issues, though I feel as though I cope as best I can. I remind myself of how lucky I am, whilst also not dismissing how I feel. I take necessary days off to in the long term aid my mental health. I have routines and resources to look forward to , I also have outlets to vent to in times of despair. I’ve dealt with depression long enough to over come it for the most part whilst still suffering . My brother attempted suicide when I was 12, and from that point onwards it was the beginning of my mental health issues. Though going through that, I know suicide is an option I will never consider, whilst even feeling suicidal. The lasting damage is too painful on those you love and I’ve learned how precious life is through this. In conclusion, I’ve come to terms with my depression being apart of me, and I’ve tried my best to adapt.
I’m glad I’m growing up in a period of time where mental health for the most part is normalised, if not I don’t think I would cope as-well as I do. Though my boyfriend on the other hand, struggles to see the light, and struggles to get through the day with his underlying depressive thoughts. These depressive thoughts have become darker. He doesn’t put the pressure of suicide on our relationship, though he has made it clear he has suicidal thoughts, and finds it hard to see past these thoughts. With everything going on right now and for him to not have his usual resources of happiness that help him through the day, he is getting worse. Also me not being there in person to comfort him is hurting him a lot. I feel myself getting overwhelmed by everything also but I’m still coping and believe this is temporary and it will all be okay. If I didn’t think this way I also would be cracking up alike him. But he can’t seem to take on this ‘it will be okay’ mindset, which is important right now. But it would be ignorant of me to get annoyed that he doesn’t think this way, because that’s an element of depression which he has, negative thoughts and feelings of despair.
I have voiced that I think he needs professional help, as have his friends( he got the courage to openly discuss his mental health to his friends, and have they also in return). He’s aware it isn’t fair to put this stress over us by opening up about how he feels(regarding his suicidal thoughts), though he can’t come to terms with getting to the point of talking to his parents. That would be the first step in getting towards professional help.
I can’t help put feel overwhelmed when the topic comes up. I don’t know how to react. I’m not a professional. My advice to him is to realise how he currently feels is only temporary, and that I myself go through bouts of depression. I get out of them. I’m okay for a while. I fall back. He has never experienced depression up until 2 years ago. I have experienced depression for the past 6 years. Hence, my reasoning for my development of coping mechanisms. He can’t come to terms with why he isn’t like his old self, why he isn’t happy all the time. We all have our breaking point I believe, when childhood happiness just fades. Though he often thinks back to when he didn’t feel this way. But I don’t know how to help that. 
With my experiences , and relatability to how he feels in ways, still doesn’t help. I never turn things on myself ,I simply resonate. I’m aware of how annoying it is when your upset and someone ignorantly makes it about them. I give advice as to how I deal . How I think he should approach things that will help him. But I can’t help him. I don’t know how to help him. But all I want to do, is to help and be there. I believe he is only going to get worse as this goes on, and I don’t know where else to go for advice. I myself will probably only worsen to, I feel we all will. But how do we keep sane in the midst of a pandemic? How can I help him keep sane and halt his worsening thoughts? I’m trying my best and advice is really what I need right now.",02Apr2020,1
177,"I already have a lot of home issues, so adding the whole no school thing has been hard.

January your birthday is finally coming up, its your 18th birthday, it was supposed to be so special, and your mom is in the hospital because your family went to a family party, and someone got her sick so you have to spend your birthday in the hospital thinking you were going to lose your mom yet again. everything turns out okay. you constantly get belittled by family members for things you didn't even do wrong and have been dealing with for 12 years now, and therapy doesnt quite seem to be helping at the moment because you can't figure out how to help yourself.

After I got my master's in about one year and a half ago, I have been living kind off-grid for ever since. Raving and backpacking across my country, I took a lot of drugs, lived different lifestyles,  took up roles I never thought I would like selling drugs,  selling banana bread for a living for a while, farming, I went through being a beggar and a homeless for a while.  I went through a lot, however I decided to turn things around after I had a wake-up call in a rave during the last new year's eve, I packed up my stuff and returned home to my parent's house. 

However, the thought of returning home gave me a lot of motivation and came with lots of expectations. Now after three months almost, I feel like a complete failure, and I have a lot of self-loathing and remorse. It gets to the verge of suicidal ideas at times. I managed to quit weed, alcohol, hard drugs and a lot of destructive habits I have had over the years. I keep looking for jobs and opportunities, but I keep comparing myself to others the whole time, and I feel really bad and insecure about myself, sometimes I don't apply to stuff just because I think  I would never get accepted or if I got accepted I would utterly fail at it, I feel like an imposter.

with my new found mental health i’ve been more receptive to the things people say to me and last night my boyfriend told me he doesn’t love me the way he used to because i treated him so badly for so long and he was scared to tell me because of how i would react. i took a step back and realized he’s right. all i can think about now is that sometimes i’ll do something to make him feel sorry for me so he stops being mad. i would tell him my actions are a response the way he treats me and would refuse to believe his actions were in response to mine. 

i’m so ashamed in myself because i know first hand how hard it is to deal with manipulative, emotionally abusive people, and how detrimental it can be to your mental health, and now i’m that person?? the person making others feel how horribly i felt for years???

Live your life knowing that this is a possibility.  Don't let fear, embarrassment, low self esteem, or pressure from others keep you from living the life you want to live.  I know this sounds like b/s self-help crap, but it's not.  It's real, hard, brutal life and I'm living it.  If nuclear war breaks out and you have minutes to live (doesn't seem like too far-fetched of a scenario in the times we live in), will you be happy with the people you are with?  I'd like nothing more than to be with a wife/gf/possibly kids in that moment, but I'm here with my parents.  There were times in my life when I had the opportunity to change that.

People have hours of conversations while I have trouble keeping up a conversation for a minute.

189," Since I was in my teens I have suffered a lot and until now fantasizing has helped but at 22 It is getting hard to control.

I have a paraphilia that is highly illegal yet everyday holding the urges gets too hard and honestly I'm a good person, I realy do not want to cause any harm.

I want to be castrated, I really don't want to suffer this anymore, it is very disturbing to battle your brain every waking moment to not think of those images and urges. If you are going to insult me please just save it, I need real advice",02Apr2020,1
190,How do I deal with them? They're horrible and ruin everything and tell me to do horrible things to people or hurt myself or even just impulsively break something. I've tried journaling but it makes them worse because once written down it's way too easy to start planning to act on them. Idk any coping suggestions are welcome,02Apr2020,1
191,"As I said I was in a toxic relationship, it was a brilliant relationship until any sign of conflict came up. I made mistakes, and hurt her, which I take responsibility for, but I tried to work out conflict I caused. However since she wasn’t openly horrible to me, but would ghost me, ignore me, tell me horrible things like I make her sick and she feels bad about me, I never had any serious discussions with her because she would always ghost me or go away when she was upset. One time she didn’t talk to me for a week and when she did talk to me was extremely cold and distant, and I felt like i wasn’t getting anywhere. I felt unbelievably low, and now she dumped me, she’s trying to use revenge tactics on me, even though I wanted us to work out and put so much effort into the relationship. I feel like my feelings are being spun against me, she called me the victim because other people said they think she didn’t deal with something maturely and gaslit my feelings. She said she tried to work through things when she didn’t try at all and avoided any conversation like that. I know she has serious commitment issues and she’s very avoidant but I just can’t move on because of the guilt I feel. She moved straight on from the relationship and was talking to, messaging other guys, kissing other guys, was on tinder and even tweeted before I muted her social media that she was on and off with a guy before and after seeing me and said she’d been on dates and only stopped being serious because she went to university but they both had feelings for each other which makes me feel used and abused. Despite all these signs because she was never nasty to me I feel as if it’s all my fault. It has ruined my self esteem and mental health, I’m trying to rebuild it all now, I’ve started therapy and trying to work on myself but I feel not good enough and like I’m all to blame for everything. Can you give me some advice please? Thanks",02Apr2020,1
192,"I don't even know what it would feel like to be myself fully. I don't like who I am right now, but I don't think I hate who I am either. I am working on becoming someone I would admire, but the more I work on that the further I feel from both myself and the person I want to be. I feel a little lost.

I have a handful of mental disorders that have been diagnosed in the last 10-13 years, but I want so badly for my mind to be strong enough to pull me out of them. At times I am very strong, but other times I give into the comforts that hold me in a perpetual state of self pity.

I don't know what I want to achieve by posting this. Just nice to put it out there I guess.",02Apr2020,1
193,"Ok, so some details, for context. 

I'm live in the UK, male, 34, married, two kids. I own my own house and work on the regional Police murder investigation team.

I have been on medication for depression and anxiety since 2014. I am currently on Citalopram (40mg daily) and Mirtazapine (15mg daily). I am currently working and haven't taken time, due to my mental health, since 2017.

I don't even know why I'm posting this, but I haven't really got a clue what to do. I hate myself, I actively despise myself, I think about killing myself on a daily basis, although I don't think I could ever do that to my family. 

Things have got progressively worse over the last 5-6 years. I overthink everything, I can't stop going over and over things in my head and then I get angry with my wife and kids when they interrupt these thoughts. In the last two years I've developed a physical reaction to these thoughts where my head will jerk in a no motion and I will swear, almost involuntarily. My mood.swings are to one extreme to the next, no middle ground and it's exhausting. 

I've had Cognitive Behavioural Therapy but to be honest, the whole experience felt like a bit of a conveyor belt. At times it made me feel worse, like I was the problem and that I had to make excuses for the people that did things that bothered me, but who do I get to blame when I am an asshole? It's got worse since last November when my GP, the only person who I ever felt actually understood me, emigrated. I find it very hard to trust medical professionals and after a run of bad experiences since, j have now moved to a new GP practice but of course, current events mean there is no way I'm getting an appointment. 

I think I know the cause of some of my issues, perfectionism being one that I think I can trace back to my mother and my upbringing, but I don't even feel able to help myself. I over eat, have put on nearly 3 stone in the last 12 months, I barely exercise, I hate my job because of the way many I work with make me feel and the way I am treated by the institution. 

I think the overeating is part of some sort of self destruction thing, just like picking fights with those in authority is another. I feel trapped by my job financially but also because I can't even read a job advert without it making me feel angry. All the bullshit, ""we're looking for people who want to go above and beyond"" fuck you!

I'm worried I am damaging my kids, maybe like I think my mother damaged me. I don't know.

It may be obvious to some of you that this started with some structure and has quickly turned into a garbled mess, and that is kind of me down to a tea. Start off with the best of intentions and then just go off on one. I just haven't got a clue what to do and how I can get motivated to help myself and get out of this viscous circle.

I'm going to leave it there and just post this. Maybe I can come back to this at a more reasonable hour and try and word it better.",02Apr2020,1
194,"Hi. i dont know how to word this, but i'm noticing a manifestation of things ive dealt with internally that seem to have gotten worse as ive gotten older. im 19 and have felt these since i was maybe 6:

\- lack of motivation. my outlook on life is pretty pessimistic and i used to think i'm lazy but i think its just lack of motivation. i cant focus on schoolwork, such as reading , taking notes, or writing papers. i have trouble connecting concepts together in my classes

\-trouble focusing - i have HORRIBLE time focusing for any extended period of time. it affects my schooling, i do have good grades (i am going into my junior year of college) but i have extreme difficulty doing work. i often have to Chegg answers or ask friends for help because i feel like i cant get my brain to think for itself. i find myself repeating things a lot. i have to plan everything i do out. i often look very far ahead in life like 5 years ahead and try to plan everything out ahead of time to avoid stress in the future

\- emotional issues - i had a shitty life and i dont want to get into it but as a result i have abandonment issues, anxiety, i have trouble sleeping and often wake up early, i have nightmares, and i have a lot of emotions i have to sort through like anger, sadness, and worry

change of interests/personality - i feel like i have a million interests and nothing is consistent. i lose focus easily . i feel like theres distinct sides to me that come out depending on the environment im in and who im with

triggers - i have triggers relating to traumatic things in my life and the way ive dealt with and continue to deal with things is through distraction and isolation. so any reminder of things that bother me lead me to basically have an emotional episode, usually with anger or crying and lack of functioning

\- other - compared to other people, i feel like i get over things very quickly, such as heartbreak. i cut off people a lot.  just cut off half of my family. ultimately i want to live life by my self i dont want to get married or have kids. not that i think something is wrong with that, but my thinking is that i am destined to be alone . i want to live a simple lifestyle with no stress because thats all ive dealt with my whole life.

i feel like this was very rambly but thats the best i could do to explain what im dealing with i dont know where to go for help or if i even need help but i just feel like im not okay..",02Apr2020,1
