I read a post the other day on unpopular opinion about how you shouldn't avoid being in pictures because that deprives your loved ones of having memories with you. That post seemed pretty selfish to me because I've always hated being in pictures, particularly when I have no control over the pictures. Why should someone else's desire for a picture override my free will and mental health?

Growing up, my mom would always shove a camera in my face every chance she got despite my protests and it always made me feel like I don't have free will. And that a pretty picture where I'm forcing a smile and hating every moment is more important than a genuine happy memory. Plus if I refused, she would guilt trip me SO HARD. In recent years I finally got her to understand the gravity of those actions and now she asks before taking pics of me. 

Yesterday I went to a friend's house for lunch and it turned into a family function where I was the only non family member. That's already awkward and stressful enough but then my friend's mom starting taking pictures. I didn't want to be rude but I tried to make it clear that I did not want to be in the picture. My friend is the same way as me. He flipped off the camera. But his mom persisted until we both looked at the camera. It just feels like such a violation. I saw the pics just now and it sent me spiraling into an ugly-crying so hard I can't breathe, blaming myself, screaming into my pillow, breakdown. It really sucks because prior to this incident, I had actually been feeling good for a solid 2-3 consecutive days. And now that's all fucked. 

I can't stop thinking about all the times in my life that my free will/lack of consent has been blatantly ignored. It's like I'm not even a person cause apparently I'm not allowed to have any bodily autonomy. Anyway I don't want to ramble on any longer. Thanks in advance for any support or advice I may receive.",04Aug2020,1

3,"I (14F) have been calling many mental health hotlines and trying to find free therapists online, but none of them are helping. They don’t provide any reliable help other than giving me the phone numbers of local mental health services (which aren’t rated very high). Especially now, during the coronavirus, it’s risky to visit a therapist, so I can’t get any in-person help.

Sometimes I am just watching something on TV there would be a little scene and I would feel like crying. I don't know what triggers it. Saying goodbyes to anyone have become really hard for me. 
Few days back my mum was just going to visit my grandma for a week and I just started crying when she was about to leave. I didn't use to be like that. I used to get happy when she used to go( like I would be getting some freedom).
I even get teary when I get some attention. I can't even handle a little bit confrontation. (Even if I am right)
Is it that my emotional intelligence had decreased?

6,"How does this global pandemic and consequent social isolation affect our mental health? Professor Ian Gold and other researchers at the Neurophilosophy lab are conducting a study on mental health and beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are interested in how different beliefs and attitudes towards COVID19 (including the degree of trust in the government and believing so-called conspiracy theories) impact mental health and cognition. The study will take approximately 25 minutes, and will be conducted online and will be offered in English. You will be asked to answer a series of questions about your experiences, feelings, and beliefs, especially with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related social isolation. By participating, you help researchers better understand the scope of people's beliefs, attitudes and opinions throughout this crisis, and how they may relate to mental health.

7,"(ps i hope format is ok i’m on mobile)

i’ve been like this for a long time and i feel almost incapable of making a decision or achieving happiness and contentment because of it. i am not impulsive at all: i did think these things through before doing them and knew what to expect so i was fine with it. it’s just that when it finally is mine i don’t want it anymore or i don’t feel the happiness/contentment/whatever i think i’ll feel once it’s actually mine. 

examples:

-i’ve played piano since i was 7, and got a baby grand when i was 15. i hated it because it wasn’t my old one even though i WANTED a new one (and let’s be real, a baby grand is beautiful) but still once it came i hated and regretted it. 

-had the same car since i was 16 (i’m 26 now). got into an accident that crushes my front end so i decided to go with a totally new look (it’s a show car). 
i’d been bored with the color and wanting to change it up but now that i have i miss the old setup. 

-started seeing a new guy who i was insanely interested in for a while. we’d hang as friends but i was still with my ex at the time. once i broke up with my ex we went out for real and it was great. the day of the second date (before i was even on the date) i randomly went from super excited to BOOM felt nothing. nothing happened and it didn’t make any sense. not like i was never around him before or anything. i feel a bit more now but it never went back to how i felt before

- i have been feeling unfulfilled and wanted something to fill up my life more since dumping my emotionally abusive ex. i love animals. always had them. decided to get a dog (GSD). did all the research for months was thrilled! picked the right one and as soon as she arrived i freaked. i couldn’t handle having her and felt like i no longer had a life because she needed to be cared for. i didn’t feel like i was connecting with her either and gave her back to the breeder. once i made the decision to give her back, then i started to bond and now i fear i made the wrong decision. i can go back to living my own life but i’m also back to feeling unfulfilled like i was in the first place. 

-had my last dog (sheltie) for 12 years. got her as a puppy when i was 11. same deal, wanted a dog so bad but once she came i immediately switched gears and got close with my cat whom i’d had for 10 years at that point. he was always there and i was never super close with him until the dog came. i never did feel like i bonded with my dog.

My sheltie (as well as the GSD i just gave away) was cute and fun and beautiful very well behaved so it wasn’t something about her, it’s definitely something in me i just don’t know what. i bonded super hard with my first dog (whom lived with my dad when i got my sheltie) so i wonder if for some reason my brain doesn’t let me enjoy anything twice (like “one and done”)

worth mentioning i do have generalized anxiety disorder and some stomach issues but all that came about in my teens. my childhood was normal except for having separation anxiety from my mom and anxiety going to my dads after their divorce. nowadays i work from home running my own business and don’t do any drugs or drink alcohol. 

any insight, ideas for healing or stories if you’re going through the same thing would be amazing. i really feel crazy a lot of the time 

tl;dr: i never want or bond with the second or upgraded version of something once i get it like i did with the original even though i wanted a second or upgraded version. could be a pet/boyfriend/inanimate object/etc",04Aug2020,1

I'm trying to get better but these thoughts are really intrusive and they are so overpowering I feel like I have no control over it. At the end of every day i write down one reason to stay alive and usually that one reason is enough to keep me going but I feel so defeated I struggle to find one reason to stay alive but I can find one hundred reasons on why I should die.

12,"Posting this on an alt account.

I should mention first that in years prior, I struggled to have any confidence. I took the role as a punching bag for friends in early high school because it ended up just being fun. 

Now a few years into college, I am very academically successful, and have landed internships in my field. In several of my classes, the professor took a liking to me. 

I got promoted to president of a club at my college as well.

I made programs that I believed most at my age couldn’t out of pure assumptions. 

I got to a very high rank in the video game *Overwatch.* I have a ton of accolades in the video game *Destiny,* and *Destiny 2*

I believe it’s these things that inflated my ego. However, I also have these thoughts that “keep me in check.” 

They aren’t berating thoughts that would hurt my ego (which on some topics, is not hard to do at all), but ones that mention “you don’t look as good as you think.” They make me obsess over anything I’m self conscious about, generally my looks, but occasionally come in when I’m faced with adversity (on a problem I can’t solve, lose money in a trade, etc.), and make me feel awful. 

Despite that feeling, I still put myself intellectually above my peers. That’s it though, just intellectually. 

I believe this has been getting worse. I don’t know if this is a mental affliction (not a hypochondriac, but it matches parts of bipolar disorder), but I keep thinking that I will be an immensely successful person no matter what I do. I keep comparing my path to that of billionaires, and how my name would sound as a CEO of a corporation. I don’t even like to spend a ton of money, so I don’t know where the strong desire to get immensely rich comes from, but it’s all that’s been on my mind since around 2018. 

This has caused me to avoid making new friends or socializing much at all with the exception of friends I’ve had since high school. Even then, I rarely see them in person, we usually just play Xbox together. I feel even if I wanted to make new friends, my superiority complex would show  more than I think it does (I tell myself I can hide it because I’m aware of it) making it off-putting. 

I want to see a psychiatrist about this, but appointments aren’t cheap. If this something I need to see one about, please let me know. 

Thanks for reading.",04Aug2020,1

14,"I tend to ramble and to not make sense because I'm constantly distracted or losing energy/motivation, so I will try to be concise and give this one last go as I've never been one to just give up before I tried my hardest.

I guess it all started when I was born (/s). But really, I was the last child born, I have a twin brother 7 minutes older than I. My brothers are 36, 28, and my twin brother and I will be 25 in October. I'm a female, and my mother got a hysterectomy after my twin and I were born because she wanted a daughter, but that daughter didn't turn out to be me. My parents always allowed us to think for ourselves, but we were punished when we chose wrong, for example, my twin brother was reluctant to get baptized (we got to make that choice), and my parents agreed that he didn't have to do it (we were 15 almost 16), but he was not allowed to do anything but go to school and come home. If he didn't go to church on Sunday, he was grounded for a week. My twin brother was probably grounded 99% of the time. My twin brother has some issues, like anger and anxiety, because of our past, and I'm sure stuff like this contributes.

I was always very quiet. I had my friends, and I wasn't ever sad or worried that I had nobody. I did have some underlying issues that made friends something that is now hard to acquire, but when I was younger, it was no big deal. My mother started physically, mentally, and verbally abusing me starting when I was 8 or 9 and going to public school (private before that). Around the same time, my father was teaching me how to shoot guns and load them, which I thought was fun, until it was 11pm and he handed me a gun, and was telling me how to shoot him. Then my oldest brother, 11 years older than me and a proud Air Force vet, started molesting me. I won't get too much into it because it just disgusts me, but it lasted 11 years until I moved out at 18. The thing is, I would go to like a friend's house, and then the friend's uncle would start hitting on me and stuff like my brother would before he would molest me, and it's far too many people that did that.

But I never knew any of this wasn't normal. My brother told me to keep the secret, and I know what he did bothered me, but I never once knew it was wrong. Until I turned 16. I got my first boyfriend, the first guy I had sex with, and I loved the emotions and the feelings that this person wanted me. The thing is, that's when I first noticed the schizophrenia. The voices. The delusions. And the doubt. God the doubt...I wondered why my now ex was touching me the way my brother did. He ended up cheating on me with a best friend of mine. I was never anyone's first choice. I tried to kill myself at 17 after I found out he cheated. He called the police, I got locked up, and I was shamed for trying to end my life. I thought it was bad then.

I got with my 2nd serious boyfriend after all that and we broke up when I was 19, living at my college, because he thought I didn't think for myself and we weren't on the same page with like abortion (and many more things). I remember him saying that no one would love me for who I am. And I spent the next year and a half trying to figure out who I was. Then I got with my now husband, and we've been together since 2016. Woo hoo.

Alright, I think that's a decent amount of backstory, so time to wrap this up with current day situations. I was locked up in a psych unit last February because of delusions and suicidal ideation, and that's when I was finally put on anti psychotic meds. I don't know what I need or what I'm doing wrong, and I hope that maybe someone will read through this and tell me what's missing.

I can't feel anything. I go through my days (and have for a long ass time) by doing the same things. I lack energy and motivation. I spent several thousands of dollars last year in college that I didn't set foot in because I couldn't will myself into the situations. Sometimes, I was scared of others because of delusions or the voices, other times it was simply not wanting to exist. My current day consists of getting up, dealing with my hyper active dog (I love him, but he has a lot of energy), sitting down at my computer, and staring at reddit and listening to the same YouTube videos I've watched for months. Occasionally, I will stream myself on Twitch because my husband will tell me to (I want to, I just lack the energy to want to? I guess), and I will play a game or something. I have a discord server (or my husband and I do), but most of the people in there are his friends/people we've met in gaming, and I feel no connection. My best friends from schooling all deleted me because I was upfront and honest about my abuse and mental health. I have trouble forming connections, doing anything all, and I just want to sit somewhere and do nothing and wither away. I have no friends, and the one person who I consider my best friend, I don't even want to put in effort to talk to her.

My husband will beg me to feel something, to not hurt myself, but I feel nothing. I can feel myself start to tear up because I know it's a proper response, but I feel nothing. I love him, and he's my best friend, but I feel so empty. So alone. So..fucked up.

Even my twin brother, who is someone very near and dear to me, is someone I've pushed away. Ultimately, I think I may be better off with just ending my life so I don't feel so left and lost and forgotten about. If I post something on my Facebook, and someone randomly messages me, I don't feel like they care. I don't even want them to message me. I've tried to just scream into the void, I've tried medications (several for about a decade), I've tried therapy and talking about how I feel, when I had energy and motivation I tried hobbies. But as it stands, I just watch the clock move and go to sleep. I hate the outdoors, I hate people, I hate that this has happened to me. And the worst part of it all is that I can't tell if I'm ever being honest with myself at this point. I've always been a good liar. I can lie to anyone's face and be fine and not get caught. But I never was able to lie to myself like this.

So, reddit, and your infinite wisdom, help me. I don't know what I'm asking. I guess I don't want to think of my husband lowering me in my grave at the ripe age of 25. I feel nothing even writing that sentence, but I know I don't want that. I can't keep seeing him cry and me feel nothing as a result. I need to take care of him. I want to feel, if not for me, for him. He deserves so much more than what I've been able to give him. Nothing helps me, but maybe there's something I haven't tried yet. Do I need to pick up drugs, or swimming, or have I exhausted my options of medication, therapy, meditation, etc..",04Aug2020,1

I’ve never met anyone else that seems to do it like I do it, or hasn’t admitted to it and I don’t really like to ask people because if they don’t then it’s weird.

It’s basically my thoughts are going out loud because I feel like they get jumbled in my own brain if I don’t say them out loud, idk. 

I think I started doing it when I was in high school and was feeling really depressed and didn’t feel like I had anyone to talk to, and I wasn’t going to a therapist so I was like...I’ll just be my own therapist. 

But lately I’ve felt like maybe it’s a little bit weird and not normal, and I’ve been caught a couple of times when people have overheard me, and it’s really weird for me to try and explain who I was talking to, so I was telling myself I should stop and just think quietly lol but I like can’t??

We live in a town that can't provide chlorinated water, we get hard water (water with tons of minerals in it) it gets so bad that once every two weeks we have to clean out our faucets as they get clogged. I neglected my dental hygiene when I was in my pre-teens and now it's getting really bad. For the past few months, I've only been drinking water and brushing my teeth after every single meal. Well, today I discovered 5 cavities and it was soul-crushing.

I called up my mom (who is a dentist but I don't live with her) and she told me she would make an appointment asap and to tell my dad. My dad has always been extremely judgemental and is a ""do as I say and not as I do"" kind of guy, so this was very stressful for me to do. I talk to him about it and all he can muster up is a monotone ""yea"", not even looking away from the tv. Mind you I haven't left the house in 5 months due to the virus, so he (and my grandad) are the only people I see on a daily basis. I'm not close to him for many reasons but the big one is that he is a huge teaser and due to previous interactions with my mom I have low self-esteem.

I called out my dad for the lack of care and he immediately started yelling when I didn't even raise my voice. And now im writing this during a cry session.


My mom - 

She is very headstrong and stubborn. A terror to her children as she has a very VERY short fuse and yells a lot. When I was little and when id do something good (such as getting a good grade on a test) instead of praising me she would say "" why can't you do that all the time "" and say something like that. My mom is married to my stepdad who heavily plays favorites with my little brother, taking him to carnivals, movies, and arcades (obviously not during COVID and before I moved away) leaving me home alone. He has had a son from a previous relationship who he cares more than anyone (my stepdad is a father to me, he raised me since I was 6 months old) 
My stepbrother is extremely entitled and often bullied me, when I came out as gay he beat me and called me a faggot. This was the final straw and I moved away to my dads

My dad-

He wants people to feel sorry for him. And constantly thinks he's better than everyone else, he is a huge hypocrite and often gets extremely defensive when every I confront him sober. He taught me that crying was only looking for attention and so was feeling sorry for your self. And he's extremely controlling, he will go out of his way to let you know that you're beneath him. He is manipulative and often wants himself to be the victim.


And then there is me, a 16-year-old boy who isn't the greatest person but is trying. When I was little I was by no means a good kid, I was even expelled from my elementary school. But since middle school and on I've retreated into myself, losing more and more confidence. I've been bullied by most everyone in my life both at school and at home, I can barely make any friends even online. I've lost so many friends groups and the most recent one was utterly devastating. Due to my bulling by those around me, I just know who I should and shouldn't trust and I often did vent to my close friend about the people we both knew who I didn't like. I thought I had her by my side and could talk to her without worries. Well I was wrong and I overwhelmed her and she said she wanted to leave the friend group. Not wanting to hurt her I decided to leave so she could have friends.

Now im alone locked away behind my shell. Every time I take three steps the left I get teased and insulted. And due to my frustrations, I hurt the few left closest to me. I haven't had a hug from those who love me in a very long time, I haven't been told an ""it's okay matty'

Long story short I used to have a job where I worked at a desk with a coworker, so there were always two people working the desk. My job was like a secretary and receptionist combined. I’ve had many people stare at me when they came to the desk (I look young) but this one time a teen boy came to the desk with his mom and his mom was being helped by my coworker at the desk with me but the son wouldn’t stop staring at me and began looking at my privates. In that moment I normally would have either ignored it or went to the bathroom but for whatever reason I felt compelled and literally jumped out of my seat to behind and under the desk, pretending to fix the computer or pick up something. It’s like something was controlling me, it felt compulsive. I was there for 2 mins until I heard they were wrapping it up.

I told my coworker I got a little nervous. I didn’t expect him to but he reported it to my supervisor and then the director of the organization above my supervisor ended up finding out. My supervisor took me aside and was pretty understanding but reported it to the director and the director had a hard time understanding why I’d react that way and seemed really angry and annoyed and asked me “Is that really a proper way for an adult man like you to react?” Since then I’ve been thinking about why exactly I reacted that way. Do I have a problem or a disorder? I’ve literally never reacted this way to anything in my life nor since and he was just staring, it’s not like it was anything significant.",04Aug2020,1

49,"Reply as you wish, comment and share, I dont care. Maybe telling my story will help some else. Posting from phone, im emotional and not good with grammer and with my fat thumbs typos happen so move along if you can't stand it. 
Short hand of the issues are that there is alot and im juzt going to express a few things.and not of this is the full story. Been married for 6years and basicly been raping her since we been together. Despite me trying to awaken her sexuality, (this was before we even knew what asexual or demisexual were). I thought we were fine, and she was in denial thinking that this is what she had to do was to satisfy me as her wife/girlfriend duties. After we had our kid, it got worse, even thougb I was aware of issues going on, I was in denial and didn't know what else to do. I was just trying to express my love to her, make her feel loved. At the time I didn't know what else to do. Of course we got through that and started trying to make things better but we kept falling into that rut, and she kept playing off as things were fine. Finally we came to ahead and decided to fix things. We talk and decided to open the relationship as poly. See we are fine and are great together, except when it come to sex. We dist want to split up, dispite the sex issue we didn't see any reason to split up. So we started dating new people then covid happen and it been up and down in the dating scene. We red books and everything. Wish I read them along time ago, could of avoided all this maybe. But we both have the ruts we been drag out of because we both just want to make the other happy. Though I have been alot better and less sexually driven or acting on those behaviors. Thougb i have been getting intune with my sexuality and kinks. Also letting my self be my self more working with more concent. 
But still been living a lie. Finally got to a broken end. She had been up and down and back and forth with this guy that is really good for her. It has opened her self more to me o. The sex front. Though, still an issue. She keep having sex with me out of a since of duty, not for desire like I thought it was. They both work at the same place and same shift. I work elsewhere with a completely different shift and they are at odds so we don't get much time together. Hence the poly daing. It has helped. So he takes a leap and deside to stay the night(technically the day, they work a night shift) while im home and my day off. We have a kiddo and he is at a school program at his time so I was getting some chores and gaming in. I told her to pitch the idea of the two of us enjoying her, she expressed that she would mind but didn't think he would be game since this was the first time him staying at the house while I was there.(a d they just had a whole da y and night together at a hotel 2 days prior) I told her to ask anyways or just present the idea. She said ok, but I missed the fact she said but not going to happen this time. Well back to the situation, I walk upstairs to get food, I hear noises, sex noises. I creep up to makes sure that what I'm hearing. And it is, she is sucking all over his cock. My lil sex primal brain gets all excited, and makes this thought making it seem logical and appropriate, ""the guy has been feeling like he is invading my space, and tiff want him to move in, and im I. Support of this. Obviously she has told him, maybe if I go in and have us share her, it will break the barrier and he won't feel weird anymore and he will be more willing to move in.""
Well i entered, it surprised them, and I was calm and collected and made insurances that this will be fine and fun. Amd it seemed like it was. But after it was done and he had to leave to go back to his house before the next shift. She layer into me, and into me hard. And I realize how bad I fucked up. She was afraid he will a ant nothing to do with moving in or anything. Luckily it didn't but she was still passed. The the truth came out and we faced what we have been avoiding.  That we probably will separate and get a divorce. 
So I have inacted aplan with different paths that can intertwine and a path that is my nuclear option. Plan N is me just leaving her, out kid, and everything and checking into a mental health facility. I feel so toxic that that is an option, because like stated above, I have been basicly raping my wife since we have been dating. Yes she has been able to enjoy sex at times but, its still isn't good. Until she met this guy, its been like that for her with me and her past partners. Now with him she get wet, she want him, she want sex. 
And I will never get that from her unless therapy and counseling helps. Other wise its, divorce papers and on good terms hopefully. Thougb we would like to aim for a non hiarchey polycule with him and I as her partners and all live together. 
But i don't see that happening, nor do I think I deserve it. I hope counseling works so I can stop feeling so angry all the time inside and I can be a good dad to my kid, but I just feel that he would be better off with out me in his life than a me who seem mad all the time and yells at him because even though I my self have ADHD and such, and he is just like me, but not as bad, I dont know how to deal with it sometimes when I have repeated my self so many times or he does the thing I just told him not to do because I told him not to do it. (Yes I know henis just akid, but the worse I do is yell sometimes and grab or tap him a little too rough to get his attention, especially when he is about to do something dangerous.) 
But right now I dont feel like I deserve to be happy anymore. So this is my real plan. Im going to stick it out. We are starting things out for sepertation, we are going act and be in accordance as being separated but living in the same house, (we still have to pay that mortgage). We are going to clear out all our junk and get the house ready for him to move in (hopefully) that way things can progress as we get counseling and therapy, she and he can really connect or see how deep that connection goes. All this is in place to have the house ready to welcome him in by the end of the year or the beginning of next year. Slowly, im coming to bit by bit over the next year phase my self out and just leave them behind so they can be happy without needing me. And I'm just going to move and disappear from their lives. Not gonna kill my self. Had tried too many times and survived to many thing that should of killed me. So I'm gonna keep living and just play my role in the lives of others. 
Going rhrougb somany dates and possible partners and just all the talks I have with people, including my friends and wife, I seem to have a support role, I help people realize they ca. Do things or get through things that they couldn't.  Then I never hear form them again. I try to stay in touch but after 3 days of heys and hope you are well, and hear nothing, I let it be and move on. I think this is wjat have to do now. I hope im wrong but, I have placed it in motion. Now I am here hiding from my kid, writing a novel for strangers to read that will send supporting words, or condemn me. Or i will be a joke, or no one will even give a damn. ""Too long didnt read just skimmed or just the first paragraph""  or ""couldnt get past your spelling and grammar"" i don't care. Still hiding, crying, lamenting, denouncing my self, incriminating myself and fighting my self. I dont deserve your pity, your support, your ire, your judgment, i dont even desrve nothingness. I get what I get. I try, I fail, thats life, and I just need to play my role.",04Aug2020,1

My parents divorced before I can remember, and I spent the rest of my childhood bouncing back and forth between my parents until 8th grade when I started living with my grandparents. Until that point I had been to 7 different schools and lived in even more apartments and homeless shelters. 

I never really learned to be a normal kid growing up. Having a meth head mother prevents that. Growing up my parents never taught me how to be honest, hardworking, or how to care. In the 7th grade my mom started to teach me and my little sister how to get tons of Oxys and Percs and sell them. She would be gone for days some times a week at a time and we would be selling pills out the back to the neighbor's the whole time.

 I have no friends in the town I live in, so I'm stuck home growing weed all day and its soooooooo boring. I'm mind just gets going and then doesn't stop thinking about the past and just how unfair life is, and I spend most if the day angry/sad over things that happened a long time ago. Hanging out with my friends use to be the only  thing that kept me in high spirits.  Now find it hard to make friends because every thought I have is negative. Which leads to people really disliking me or I dont bother talking to any one in the first place.

Now I'm a 22 year old man and I'm just realizing I dont know how to do anything and my life is more of a wreck than I first thought. I think I've been depressed since I was 11 years old. I just didn't know that's what it was. I usually pass out around 10 or 11pm and dont roll out of bed until 12 or 1 in the afternoon. It's so hard to get out of bed everyday now; I feel so heavy, and I can never think of any good reason the get out from under the covers. Even if I'm hungry I'll just lay there because eating has felt like a chore since I 18. I have a weak appetite and have struggled to keep on weight since I was 18.

I know that in comparison to most everything that people can have as a problem, this will seems trivial but it does lead to a lot of sleepless nights and wasted hours. I will do my best to explain, whenever I create a RPG character in one game, be it pen and paper or video game, I immediately feel the compulsion to make this match across all games. Say I make a big armored tank guy in a game, I now need to make and play this is every other game. I feel compelled to look and search for whatever game might allow me to recreate said character into another game. If I can't find such a concept I will abandon it all and start something new, the process repeating itself. I will spend hours theory crafting and looking at all the options I could twist or change to make them all match. I see myself doing it and can't stop. I know it is incredibly trivial but it feels like a compulsion, like I can't stop myself. I do it so much it impacts my day to day sometimes. I am thinking about it while with my family and not paying attention, I stay up late looking and hunting for a way to make these characters across multiple platforms.

But the main reason I’m scared to bring anything up is because I already have so many things “wrong” with me, I don’t want to look like I’m trying to rack up another diagnosis.

59,"My relationship with my parents was always good when I was younger but when I went into my teens I definitely saw a strain on our relationship. My parents have always been tiger parents, often pressuring me to perform at my best whether that was academically or athletically. I just went with it throughout my childhood trying not to disappoint my indian parents until around sophomore year of high school when I burnt out. I hit one of my lowest points in my life. I would stay up every night studying so I wouldn't get a B, stopped eating, cut off friends, and cried for months straight. Fast forward to this year, I didn't get into any Ivys which has always been their dream for me. They were so disappointed and I don't think they will ever let me live it down. I guess when I realized I needed to live for myself and break away from their stress, our relationship went sour. I fight with one of them at least once a day. I try to keep my calm, but I can't when they won't let me be myself. They put down my friend group, limit how many times I can go out, don't let me see my guy friends even though they said I'm allowed to be friends with boys, the list goes on. They invalidate me. When I tell my mom I'm stressed she deflects it and said I have no reason to be stressed and I am faking it. I had to beg her to let me seek mental health because she said I had no reason to be depressed. My dad can never say anything nice to me. I don't remember the last time he said I love you. Everyday he HAS to say something negative whether its my appearance or my intelligence. I hate the narrative that we let our parents get away with things because they provide for us. Well that is their job as a parent! I am grateful for all the opportunities and sacrifices they have made for me, but that doesn't erase the psychological abuse they've put me through. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live like this especially with college being online for me in the fall. Anyone else go through something similar and what ways to cope with it? I want to be close and have fun with my parents but I just can't. It overwhelms.",04Aug2020,1

I feel angry, yet confused. I become really distant and rude/harsh towards anyone near me, even though I may have been having a great time with them just a few minutes prior.

I can't control myself when I'm being insensitive and the thing is, I'm very present (mentally). I know the way I'm acting.

Yet, I feel like I'm not looking at me in the mirror when I try to calm myself down, and I just feel scared. Who is this person in the mirror? Why do I feel worse when looking at them?

It's not a pleasant feeling at all, and it usually lasts for a few hours.

I dont want to hurt people around me so naturally i kept it silent and vent it out bit by bit when im alone, but since im almost always around someone i cant completely vent out. I cant scream or cry or punch stuff because it would be too loud and it will scare people away from me. 

I tried to approach the problem by analysing whats wrong with me, and i notice a series of events and pass experiences that are one of the reasons im having a stressful time, but i know there is more to it. There is something deep down that i cannot simply express with words but i know is there. I know there are reasons that caused such effects but i cant seem to understand what that is, and without knowing what my struggle is i cannot tackle my problems. 

I have approached my family and friends to expressed my struggle but everything we've discussed about i already know of. I cant afford professional help so im stuck here not knowing what to do while my mental health keep declining day by day.

Past year has been the happiest and I am shit scared of going back to whatever it was like before that but since last week I have just been constantly falling away, I keep wanting to shut off and I am so very tempted to self harm again because it would give everything a physicality which isn't there yet but thats not a problem, the issue is I am not doing my uni work which I rly want to but I can't seem to pull myself together and get it done. 

I'd rly like some advice about how to get uni work done but this is just mostly me venting about being incapable of doing the bare minimum because any time I start reading a text I feel so dumb and want to cry because it just feels so shitty and I can't understand shit and it's just. How did I make it to a master's without understanding any of it? What if I'm just rly rly lazy? It's been so long with covid, surely, surely I should be used to it by now, thousands of people do things in far worse circumstances and I am just not doing crap here. =//

I thought I had ADHD but now that just feels like a stretch because so what? Shouldn't I be used to stuff by now?? Why is a dissertation any different than the essays I have written previously??

I have realized I am becoming more and more easily angered since quarantining. This sadly  affects my lovely supportive partner and family. 

We only see each other ever now and my sleep is irregular due to being newly unemployed. 
I am fortunate in a lot of ways and I practice trying to be grateful, but these are also serious problems. 

I’m working on trying to get better at sleep and I have a suspicion that this is the root cause. 

It’s not bad (yet), I am keeping myself in check and I’m not having outbursts, but I’m worried this will continue to get worse as it has been gradually over the past two months. Would love advice on keeping a look out on this. 

Obviously trying to understand what’s happening in the moment (and recognizing these reactions might be overstated) is most important, but I’m worried this too will become increasingly difficult. 

This may be a natural and reaction (coping mechanism?) to having serious life changes in tandem with being isolated for four months, but still - advice appreciated.",04Aug2020,1

Life has been hard since COVID. I was a college senior, with an internship lined up in Chicago, and big plans. 

Then all of a sudden everything changes. No graduation ceremony after graduating, no internship anymore, everything fell apart.

It’s been so hard, to be living throughout all of this. I feel like everything has been stripped away from me. All of my accomplishments seem unimportant and I am struggling financially now after 4 years of stress. 

I feel broke, I am struggling with supporting myself while trying to find a job and it’s becoming so much. 

I am feeling depressed and so beat up. Having to ask people for money just to be able to eat is just so embarrassing and it’s taken such a toll on me.

75,"Title pretty much says it all. In high pressure situations, typically 1v1s, I actually start to shake a little, my chest tightens, and it's just not pleasant. I love gaming, and this is a fairly new feeling I've been getting really consistently. The two games I get it the most are League of Legends and Chess. Let me explain:

With league, I really enjoy top lane; all the characters are super enjoyable, as well as their dynamics into each other. For those who don't know, top lane in league is basically a 1v1 for the first 20 minutes or so of each game. I never used to have problems playing it, but I also never really understood the game. As I've gotten better, and begun actually perform well, this feeling began to appear. Even if all goes well and I play great the first game, the feeling still lingers as I play more. And the next day it's back to square one. I guess I'm just worried I'll embarrass myself in front of the whole server? But I don't even know them, that's the thing. I don't know...

Now I know chess isn't much of a ""video game"" but I think it's another great example. It recently has been blowing up on [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) and it's inspired me to watch a ton and even begin practicing. Doing puzzles or playing against the computer, I'm great. However as soon as I queue up against real people, the sick feeling comes over me. Like, I'm in my room by myself, playing some random dude in Iran, and I'm sweating and shaking again. It's almost comical haha. 

My friends are all competitive too, and I think one cause may be that when we game together, if someone does poorly they get roasted. It's all fun though, they know I'm still not very good at the nuances of the game, and most other team based games I have none of that feeling. I think it may be some kind of performance anxiety, but it just doesn't make sense because back in high school I was VERY into various performing arts. Although I got the usual butterflies before performances then, it was never too bad.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on this, or if it's relatable at all. It's just kind of stressing me out, I know it's a bizarre thing to post about. Thanks.",04Aug2020,1

I got a problem, I put certain ppl on pedestals.

For me, it’s my friends.

I genuinely think they can do no wrong most of the time. Like my mind cannot even humor the idea that they might be human and make mistakes. So I have this perspective and yesterday it got shattered.

One of my friends was in a online relationship. Everything was consensual, but it came out that my friend and his partner were being narcissistic and gaslighting each other. It seemed like a genuinely messy and abusive relationship. This was the first thing that shocked me. I couldn’t believe that my friend was in a bad relationship, how could they not see the red flags right? They can’t do wrong so why did they do that.

The next part was even worse, there was photo evidence of their relationship, and specifically my friend gaslighting and being manipulative. This rlly has been breaking me. Every time i think of it, it makes me feel like i’m having a panic attack. I honestly cannot imagine my friend being mean or a bad person. The fact that he didn’t conform to this strict view that I had of him makes me feel sad as well, almost like i’ve been betrayed. 

My friend told me that he was in a bad place mentally and sought out therapy (even suspects that he has bpd) Yet I can’t get this feeling out of my gut.

So why do I feel this way. Why cant i see him as a normal person, that can have bad days and can improve. Why does the fact he didn’t fit my idea of him make me feel so awful.

106,"Hi all

Mobile user so please excuse any format issues. 
I (27F) suffer from anxiety and depression brought on by OCD (intrusive/obsessive thought patterns).
I recently started having this weird feeling of being trapped in my body, as if it is a shell that is just too small for me. I end up having to stretch continuously to feel like I am ""stretching"" out my skin, because otherwise it almost feels painful. It usually comes about when going to sleep or reading in bed. It's this restricted, almost claustrophobic feeling and it is super uncomfortable. It also sometimes feels like ky limbs have too much energy to be contained in my skin.

I have been getting it on and of since childhood (my parents used to laugh it off when I tried to explain), but it hasn't happened in quite some time, and it has never been as intense as it has the last week. 

When I try looking it up on google, I tend to get results describing an emotionally trapped feeling, not the physical feeling of your skin being a size too small.

Has anyone else felt this sensation? What could be the cause?

A little background of the story: My relatives were hanging out in our house pre-COVID last January and we were singing karaoke. His turn comes up and plays Pumped Up Kicks. I was on the kitchen because I was busy cooking food and he texted me saying, ""This song makes me sad. (referring to hte song before PUK) And this too. (referring to PUK)"" I replied, ""Really? Oh right, the beat is nice but the lyrics show otherwise."" To which he replied, ""Yeah 100%. I feel it sometimes."" 

Now a little background of my cousin: He has undergone depression and has been taking drugs to cope up with it or as what he said his problems.

Going back to the conversation, I felt that he was sad while saying this so I didn't really reply afterwards. 

Flashforward today, I remembered the conversation that we had so I decided to look up the meaning of the song Pumped Up Kicks.. My heart sank when I learned it was about a school shooting and is ""written from the perspective of a troubled and delusional youth with homicidal thoughts. The lines in the chorus warn potential victims to ""outrun my gun"" and that they ""better run, better run, faster than my bullet.""

I'm a 21M that has struggled with anxiety all my life, which led to depression and addiction starting in 8th grade. I had been sober for a few months here and there but last september i went to my 2nd detox center and have been sober since (10ish months). My anxiety and depression aren't as bad as they were in my teenage years but i struggle with motivation issues and fatigue, plus feelings of anhedonia / loss of pleasure in activites. I also severly struggle with self esteem / confidence issues which are holding me back from getting a job. I've worked 2 jobs before (2 food jobs) but ended up quiting both due to stress and being terrible at them. Not working is starting to take a huge toll on my relationship as i can't move on in life with my girlfriend and start advancing into adulthood properly. I think it boils down mainly to a fear of failure and getting in trouble or yelled at by customers or management, plus lack of motivation. This is something ive tried to work on alot but its honestly a chore just to take out the trash from my room, or brush my teeth. Im very lucky to have amazing parents and my girlfriend who has supported me for the last 4 years, but the guilt of handouts and dissapointment of not being able to moveout and continue through life is starting to pose risk to my sobriety and relationship. I've been on plenty of antidepressants to no avail, along with antipsychotics, mood stabilizers etc. If anyone has any thoughts please let me know.

I was overweight when I was young, got bullied and rejected for it. It happened a long, long time ago and I have delved with a lot of therapy and self-help to get over those dark times but even though I have managed to find a way to be above these troubles, those demons linger in the back of my mind.

I still suffer from self-doubt, being self-conscious about my weight, my looks, my diets and everything. It makes me feel determined, mature and somewhat confident of being able to be disciplined with my lifestyle choices.

Sometimes I am not sure if I am being disciplined and dedicated, or whether I am being obsessed and unhealthy because unfortunately, I went through an eating disorder at a very young age and even those demons still linger every now and then.

Sometimes I feel like that I need to eat a lot to maintain my size and to gain muscle. Plus, being a foodie, I find this a plus.

Sometimes I feel the need to make sure that I am keeping myself in check and constantly doubting my habits because I am not sure if I am doing things right or I am being obsessed or making myself unhealthy or following a fitness fad

Sometimes I want to be sure that I am doing things right because I know how the fitness industry tries to profit from all the insecurities and misconceptions about fitness, or mainstream thought continue to push inaccurate or misinformed beliefs about fitness.

Sometimes I feel like I am in a battle between wanting to accept myself as I am because I am aware that people have their own body types and ways of living, while also finding out if I should better myself even though I know that the so-called “ideal body type” changes from time to time and shifts and changes depending on the trends or whatever Hollywood body is the most famous.

Sometimes I want to stick to my diet and exercise routine to be consistent, disciplined and mature about my goals and desires. Sometimes I feel that I should be flexible and not as strict and expose myself to other ideas and even other foods and ways of living because life is too short to live in one way and I wish to experience it like an adventure worth living.

This year, now, after a year long mild intermittent pain on my toe, and 2 doctors' visits (one almost didn't pay attention to me, the other found nothing on my xray) I went to another doctor who ordered an MRI.  


I am terrified. I am panicking, I cannot work, I cry and I read on the internet (which is scary and irresponsible especially for me). I have an MRI tomorrow and I am soooooo scared.  
I want to be healthy and happy. I am afraid of the worst and all this internet reading does not help at all.

Ok so I have pretty bad anxiety, it’s worse because of school, and school shootings add up too. 
I’ve kinda talked about it with my family before and they don’t really take it seriously because they don’t really believe in mental health and believes that god can fix all our problems. 
So I gathered up a lot of courage to tell my mom about how bad it is. 
Some background info I feel really sick before school (sometimes I even throw up), I have a hard time breathing in certain classes and situations. I get really sweaty and out of breath. And I shake a lot and my eye twitches. And i don’t just get panic attacks/ anxiety in school, it happens with or without school.
So I wanted to try to talk her into getting me proper help and/or  meds. But when I talked to her she said “just try to breath and get over it” and “don’t let the devil come inside of you”. I tried the best I can at explaining how I feel when I have anxiety and panic attacks but she just doesn’t understand. I’ve also tried a different approach by saying that god created therapist and medicine to help people like me.

We live in flats and all get on. He was shouting his head off and i could hear him through the window, it woke me up and i went to comfort her.
I woke up sunday morning and my dad has had an accident, hes broken 3 ribs, pierced his lung and needs plates put in to fix his ribs and sort his lung. 
Yesterday my neighbours ex was caught by me waiting at the bus stop over the road waiting for her to come home from work. 
My dads surgery has been postponed yesterday too.

I feel dead inside. Im struggling to feed myself, sleep, work..i feel like a shell of who i am and when i talk to people on the phone i just want to hang up and be left alone. The only person i have been able to tolerate for more than half an hour is my ex who im still friends with, but hes in a relationship and i dont want to spoil that for him.

163,"We have been dating for two and a half years now but we've recently run into communication problems since quarantine. We believe the stress has made his ADHD and my disorder more prominent, though he has recently gotten on Concerta to help that and I have gotten on Lamotrigine and Zoloft. He blames his ADHD getting worse for our relationship changes.

Keeping it short and sweet:

I feel like

- He isn't as affectionate with me anymore, isn't the one to initiate intimacy. He was very affectionate our entire relationship so this is something new.

- He is quick to get upset and angry about anything, whether that be traffic, loud music, not understanding what someone is saying, or something as simple as our dog whining or trying to find a comfortable spot on the couch.

- He’s pretty negative about anything that goes wrong or if someone does something that he personally wouldn’t do.

- He was the one that taught me routine and structure but since I am currently unemployed, I am the one taking care of most of the chores. When I ask him to help, he gets upset and says that he's worked all day and I haven't. (I think that's just me being unfair though)

- He is pretty quiet now, almost like he's not in his body anymore. Usually lying down while watching Netflix and Youtube a lot during his free-time, though I'm sure this is a hyper-fixation at the moment. This doesn't upset me, more-so worries me. (He's brought up his thoughts of being on the autism spectrum, I think it's an interesting thought too.)

He feels like

- I'm quick to get hurt by however he is feeling, even if it's not towards or about me.

- I don't appreciate the effort that he does put in when he has the energy. That I'm never satisfied or whatever he does doesn't match up to the ""scenario"" or ""expectation"" in my head.

- he's always feels like he's doing something wrong, even when he tries to get it right.

- I think he doesn't love me anymore when he feels he does everything to show me that he does. I tell him I know he does love me but he says that my actions say otherwise.

- I need to give him more than he can give me at the moment because he's struggling with his ADHD. He said the other night, ""I'm sorry, I know you need certain things from me. But I can't give you that. I can't even give you 50% of that. I need you to give me more than I can give you right now. More than you even want to, just know that I won't be like this forever."" (I think this is something I need to learn about long-term relationships, ""for better or for worse"" kind of situation?)

165,"⚠️TW SUICIDAL THOUGHTS &amp; SELF HARM⚠️




Hey guys so I was having a moment this morning and it brought back a dark memory for me. When I was 11 I had my first thoughts of suicide. It came after having a crazy fight with my bio mom who by the way constantly mentally abused me. Well I pushed the thoughts away because I was terrified about the thought of death. Well that lead me to want to hurt myself. I thought about cutting myself. I was turned away from that because I could not think of a place on my body where they would not be seen by my bio mom. Especially since I lived in the south where it was hot year round, I didnt want to change my wardrobe to hide cuts just for my mom to get suspicious and investigate. So I turned to scratching myself. Not to the point of blood but serious raised and red marks. I would do this when I was anxious or depressed almost as a distraction from those thoughts. The reason for this long backstory is my little sister is now 11 and already getting into it with our bio mom to where she comes over to my dads house and cries a lot about how our mom treats her. I want to bring this story to my dad and stepmom because we do talk about mental health but I dont think they quite get how deep it can go for us kids. How should I present this to them because I know my dad is going to be highly upset (not with me more so himself) and I want them to be aware but also not smother her. I know how I reacted in my situation obviously I dont know how she would react and I just want them to know that any kid can think like this.",04Aug2020,1
166,"Please before I get any hate just hear me out. Also wasn’t sure if this was the right sub, but I do suffer from bipolar disorder and I definitely feel like it played a big role. 

Basically I used to be addicted to cocaine, mix that with not taking my meds as I should be and a tv show where people are always doing drugs, I just wanted to get high. I also did not give a f where I got the coke from, so naturally I decided it was a good idea to leave to meet a random stranger at the park at 12am. The guy said he had some so I was like okay awesome, but when I got there he went to look for it and was like “oh sh*t I think I dropped it somewhere” so I was disappointed. Then he asked if I had ever done speed and I said “no, what is it” and he just said it’s way better than cocaine and lasts longer so I was like um heck yes. We didn’t chill too long, and I ended up calling my friend and told him what happened, and that’s when he told me that speed is meth. 

I knew(know) I f*cked up bad. And even worse, is I actually enjoyed it. I thought it would make me crazy or something, and it really did at the end. But for the most part I felt just happy and at ease. It was honestly the most normal I have felt probably all year. Normal 2.0

The thought of doing it again is definitely there, but I’m gonna try very very hard not to. This could very easily turn into the biggest mistake of my life, and my mom is still doing meth to this day so it’s really scary. Just needed to share somewhere

Tl;dr I accidentally did meth and liked it, not sure what to do next. I also have not slept",04Aug2020,1
167,"Hello. Well... I'm not really the one who has mental health issues, but an online friend of mine. She's been feeling depressed a lot more often lately. And I'm the one who's been comforting her every time. But right now, she said something that really pushed me to my limits. 

I might offend a lot of you, and I'm really sorry in advance. I don't know where else to ask for opinions. I just want to know if what I really did was wrong or maybe I still don't fully understand my friend's situation. 

So, my friend was upset because she feels like her friends are ignoring her. She told me that she vented in their group chat and they didn't reply at all, which is why she left the group chat. So, I tried to make her feel better, and she did. But not for long. 

A few hours later, she was feeling down again. So I talked to her, sent her cute emojis and lullabies that can help her feel better, anything that I knew she liked. 

Then we chatted for a while. She asked me if I ate, I told her yes, then I asked her the same thing. She replied she didn't eat yet, so I was like -&gt; "";^; eattttttttt or at least drink lots of water"" She told me that she'll eat later, and I was a bit relieved that she was considering to eat and all, so I replied with a -&gt; "";^; okie""

She got mad at me after that. I asked her why and she told me ""What's with the crying face? Do I have to eat or drink when you say so?"" And I just told her that it simply looked cute and I didn't know that it looked bad in her point of view so I just apologized. But I cried. Yes, it's a very childish reason to cry about. But I was mentally exhausted. Comforting her is taking a toll on me and I don't know what to do anymore. 

She then told me that my messages looked like she was the one abusing me. I apologized again and explained that I didn't mean anything bad with the crying face. She then ask me -&gt; ""Did I hurt you? I'm sorry. I won't bother you anymore."" And from the way she typed it out, it looked like she was mocking me. 

I simply apologized again because I didn't know what to do, my brain feels so fuzzy, I'm still crying... I didn't know what else go say. 

Now she's acting dumb and she's saying things like -&gt; "":// why are you apologizing? What happened?""

I am so frustrated I don't know what to do anymore.",04Aug2020,1

169,"I'm tired.

I'm finding it hard to enjoy things I like. I can't find the motivation or energy to do them. I get little bursts here and there, spend an hour on it, and that's it. I'm done for a week. I can't do it until the next burst.

My iron levels are lower than ever, my meds aren't working, and my doctor's not being exactly the best either. Went to her for help for more physical problems and she's constantly put me off. I can't see her for another two weeks and I'm starting to get bad acid reflux so it's just making things worse.

I haven't got an appetite for anything. I don't want to eat anything because it either tastes bad or makes me feel sick. Recently became lactose intolerent so we're still trying to figure out whats good for me to eat that won't make me feel sick or doesn't taste nice. Doesn't help that my family thinks I can just have cheat days and eat dairy products which make me sick as hell for 3 or more days.

My physical problems make it hard for me to focus on my school work. I've luckily experienced most of my energy bursts during these hours so I've got the work I enjoy doing done. I'm constantly zoning out though, nothing seems to stick to my memory, I forget everything in the span of two seconds, and it's really freaking people out at school. I hate it.

I'm tired. I'm so, so tired. This has been slowly going downhill for the past 3 months. I thought the worst of it was over but it just keeps on going downhill again. I don't know how long it'll be before I relapse.",04Aug2020,1

Most of them for me, especially the teen years have been a nasty cycle of everyone conveniently forgetting. So soon as the day is here I’m alone with a few cards. In pity some family end up having a “well you’re alone” or “whoops we forgot” meal somewhere they like. 

I don’t really have friends as always been forced to be my mothers husband as she drives any person away. She kept me hidden and made things hard to say the least. The few friends I had typically never really cared about me. My mother kinda blames me for never finding the right man mixed with men are pigs and no good sort of behaviour. 

This year it’s my last “big one” in terms of age. Thing is for the first time I have a partner that actually cares and has planned what they can so I can have a good birthday during the pandemic. I’m grateful they have but mentally I can’t stop thinking they are going to ditch me when the day comes. Have talked to them about these worries but no amount or reassurance can stop me feeling this way. I feel horrible being like this and I try to push the ideas and feeling away but o guess because I’ve never really celebrated any birthday it’s an unknown experience for me.",04Aug2020,1
171,"Hi guys. I think it's time for me to get help. So last year and this year was crazy shit. To get started I have to tell you I'm an marijuana addict, started to feel addicted 3 years ago, when my girlfriend dumped me and started a relationship with my bestfriend. And problems with relationships with my parents and friend/girlfriends are trigger for my addiction I guess. 
Last year after two years of feeling like shit, hating myself and getting high from morning to evening, I met a girl, and she was amazing, maybe I didn't feel anything like that in a long time, but I felt happiness for the first time in to 2 years. It didn't last long, but it was rly  intensive. But you know, nothing is perfect when it comes to my life, I lost a job, only job I ever liked, and she was working with me too. I started to feel insecure, more like a shit than before, I lost something what was giving me a feeling of being a man, every man has to work to keep his family and his loved ones in wealth, I couldn't do it, I couldn't find other job cause it's not that easy. So I was a depressed piece of shit, her ex boyfriend just attempted to suicuide, so she wasn't in a good shape either, so we broke up. That day earlier my father discovered my addiction, told me to get the fuck out of his house, and it was Christmas Eve. So I lived in a friend's house for like a month, then I came back. My dad is very toxic, I don't have a good relationship with him. So I found a job after 4 months of being unemployed, that's nice, it's better payed,  so it's a plus. But you know, I wasn't happy, I'm not happy. Every day I'm thinking about her, we had a little messenger fights, she told me, she don't want to be friends, she don't want to have a contact with me, cause she thought that way would be better for me. What a bullshit. It wasnt better for me. She is working with my friends, and my bestfriend -which I knew 22 years of my life(I'm 25)- girlfriend is her bestfriend, and i started to feel paranoic, it was February. I started to think, everyone is gossiping about me, laughing, my friend started to hide some facts from me, like that he and his girlfriend was at hers housewarming party, and just lied to me. So I stopped having contact's with them. Literally any1, I just was working and getting high. I lived like 3 months without any conversation with human beings that I once thought was friends. Actually I have no proof of them gossiping or laughing at me, so it's only my imagination. So 3 months, work, getting high, some computer games, and sleep. In that time my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer, so she stayed at ours place. I loved my grandma very much, I talked with her all the time and was witnessing how the cancer is growing. She lived one month from that day and only me was home at this time, so no one other saw her dieing and no one other knew how I felt. So after that, I thought I have to meet some people just to don't get crazy. But that wasn't working, my paranoia got stronger I think, I could even imagine ion which situations they are laughing, what exact words they are using. It wasn't true, I guess, never asked anyone if they are laughing at me, never wanted to know you know Schroedinger cat or something else. 
So that's my story, I'm 4 days sober, ya I know that not much, but I want improvement in my life, I want to talk to other people freely and don't want to be stuck in past and depressed. I have scheduled appointment in psychiatrist, but I want him to understand me good, cause I know that the problem is not in marijuana, it's something more complex, I was once in another psychiatrist, he said everything is my addiction, but my addiction came from something. And if there's more addicted people, how you are going through everyday struggle without it, I'm constantly sad and thinking I will be capable of laugh and smiling if I'm high, but I dont want to be anymore. Can't focus on games, TV shows, can't workout cause of medical problems from playing basketball.",04Aug2020,1
172,"I need to vent I guess, and I don't have many people to talk to. Last night I went to a get together and was just totally unable to engage with people. I've had this problem for a long time. The thing is, now I'm in recovery from addiction. I'm doing a lot of things right and getting better every day. But I still have this problem. 

I have endured a lot of things in my life; I've lived in extreme isolation and am very well adjusted to it. Of course, there is still a devastating loneliness, but I have a million tricks for managing it, even without drugs. When I left last night it all suddenly hit me that I am very alone and that the isolation has been breaking me down for a long time. I still have my ways of convincing my brain that I am not isolated, but they just aren't enough to keep me going for too long. When I was a kid someone I knew had two birds, and when one of them died, they gave the other bird a mirror so it wouldn't die of loneliness. I'm reminded of that a lot. 

Well, it's nothing I can't handle, that's for sure. And I'm unlikely to relapse over it. I'm trying not to cut because I escalate, but honestly, my will is not so strong with that one. I don't really want to talk to AA people about all this because I know that they'll say I'm self absorbed, which is true but not helpful, and I have a pile of bitterness and guilt that's hard enough to manage as it is.",04Aug2020,1

174,"Hi, I have never posted anything on reddit so excuse me if my story telling isn't very good.   
I am a 20 year old female that is concerned about my daydreams I had when i was 6-8 years old. Firstly I should say that I have never been abused as a child in any kind of way, I was a shy introverted child and my parents had a rocky marriage but they didn't take it out on me.  
So anyway, my daydreams consisted of being kidnapped and tortured/sexually abused and i found them satisfying. I have no idea why I had those thoughts that young...I didn't even know how sex worked and I dont understand where i got the inspiration to think about those things at such a young age.   
I know that it's been 12 years since but  can that be a reason why now I have problems with my mental health and I am female with a very high sex drive? Has anyone had a similar experience as me? Or does anyone have any thoughts why I would have those kinds of daydreams???",04Aug2020,1

176,"Now, this is something I should be talking about to my friends and family first, but I figured starting by talking to strangers on the internet could be something. Anyways I've just felt fed up with life as of late, and yes, I am also fed up that I'm getting fed up because I just feel like such an entitled little bitch for thinking like this. 
Ok so let's just start with the big one for me right now, which would be school. I'm studying business right now and while some apparently think business students study business because they ""don't know what they want"", well I was fairly sure it was what I wanted at the time. But after joining, I would just lose interest and stop paying attention. Before it was fine because ultimately your results were dictated by an exam with a high weightage at the end, and I managed to get a GPA of about 3.3, which while it's nothing to put on the internet was ok with me. Now this semester it's just been worse than usual. The lessons are real dry and all the entertainment I can access at home just makes it even harder to concentrate. I've also had a few episodes of just lying in bed thinking about how mediocre all my achievements were and stuff like that, the usual. All this made it really hard to work on my projects which we have lots of this semester. At first I thought it was gonna be all cool because I actually quite enjoyed project writing, but when I received my first C+, well frankly I was pretty shaken. Oh yeah all those doubts I had about myself led me to starting to keep journals and to-do lists too, and all of that was supposed to help me. Well come the next round of projects and things just didn't get better, I missed a project deadline and ended up having to rush 2 at once, as you can imagine, neither came out stellar, which really just made me more stressed. Anyways now there's a last round of projects, all with very high weightage, and all of em are getting sidetracked and rapidly becoming shit too, I feel like I've just lost my sense of time at this point, maybe it'll be better to take the L and do better next time.

Anyways when I first started being racked with feelings of self-doubt, I was big into blaming people, but I've done my very best to get over that. But then, now I'm just constantly reminding myself of how I have little in the way of educational achievements, and also just beating myself up constantly. Ok, everybody has that, not a big deal. But I think I'm just suffering from an overinflated ego. I mean there have been some small things I've excelled in and I've allowed myself to base my identity off that. But you know, I realize I'm pretty messy, and not very observant, and I can be naive, and not good at thinking in the long term, so whatever it is that I'm good at will amount to nothing in the real world. Yeah, frankly I'm at my wits end, and cmon these aren't the biggest problems in the world, but you know it's just forced me to change the way I view myself and the world a lot, and that has been tough. Not so sure where I should go from here because I've convinced myself that this is the best way moving forward, and I'm not particularly good at making big decisions like switching courses to something I might like or taking on an alternative educational path later by myself.",04Aug2020,1

I have been seeing my therapist, let's call him James, for about a year and a half now. He's been really helpful and supportive and I have felt safe going to him.

Today, however, he made a comment that made me question it all.

I was talking about self-harm, and he asked me if I was suicidal. I said no, but it's always in the back of my mind as a like ""get out"" if I ever needed it.
He then said that he understood that feeling and ""would never try to stop a patient committing suicide and would encourage it if they were of sound mind"".

Am I over reacting at this statement? It really shocked me that he said that and I feel oddly betrayed by it. I never expected him to ever say suicide was the answer, but now I am wondering if he is saying it is for me?

**does anyone have recommendations for how to plan FMLA for anticipated mental health issues?**  this is basically my only question, but i'll provide detail below in case it's relevant.

my dad is dying of pancreatic cancer but is in denial about that and about covid.  largely in response to these two things and the fact that the bulk of my family is just rolling with it like it's whatever, my mental health is starting to cause physical symptoms that make working very challenging.  my relationships with my family members are already complicated and stressful, and this has just made everything significantly worse.  i've been using PTO weekly because of nausea, headaches, shutting down, etc.

i am essentially wondering if anyone has experience with trying to guess when you'll need significant breaks because of mental health struggles, and with navigating that with work in a way that does not leave you super vulnerable/looking like a slacker.  my manager is decently understanding and we're kinda hiring, so i'm not immediately worried about being cut, but i also don't want to push myself to the head of the list for if cuts are coming down the pike *or* push myself to the point of breaking.

some time will also maybe be needed for visiting him, possibly a couple of times, and for services afterwards, helping my mother with final arrangements, etc.  this is somewhat easier to schedule, though i say maybe because i may have to decide not to go &gt;!because my family is behaving like they made a covid suicide pact!&lt;.

183,"I’m 18 and I’ve always been very shy - even in elementary school I would wander around the classroom as other children played in small groups in indoor recess - I was a loner, even then. 

I have always been overly sensitive and prone to feelings of awkwardness. When I was nine, I accidentally exclaimed that I was now older than my mom when I had meant to say taller - I was embarrassed for weeks. At eleven, I wrote on a piece of construction paper “god bless Charlotte” in honor of a victim of the Newtown shooting. I planned to do the same for all of them. When my mom asked what it was, I almost hyperventilated and never responded. 

I never told anyone when I first got my period (my mom found out a month later though). At 13, I had to type a note to ask my dad to take me to a Lindsey Stirling concert because I couldn’t bring myself to ask in person. I was terrified for years of them finding my Instagram account. When, last year, my mom got angry at me and looked through my photos, I seriously contemplated suicide. When, several months later, she found a picture that a printed of a girl from school whom I liked at the time (I’m bisexual), I contemplated suicide again. 

Last October, my aunt found my YouTube account and a playlist called “pagan songs” which was basically just being-pagan bands (even though I’m agnostic, I like their music). She was confused when I got pale and “looked terrified”. Around the same time, I wrote my college essay. In it I made brief reference to the fact that I found it amusing to imagine what states/countries would be like if they were people. My English teacher asked me about this and was confused when I started stuttering. 

A few months ago I suddenly decided that I would make some changes in my life to be more environmentally conscious and bought reusable menstrual pads. When my sister wanted to open the package, I freaked out and she became suspicious. Just today, some Carl Sagan books that I had ordered from the library came. Since all our library cards are connected to my parents’ email, they got the notification that they had arrived. When she began to read aloud the titles, I started screaming and trying to distract her.

185,"For the last like 6 or so months since I started psychs and then just opening it up to normal life I started trying to get better in control of my emotions and that, I heard again someone say that a lot of problems in their life come from a traumatic experience from when they were younger.

I’ve had this fear of the dark and of people coming for me in the dark for a long time. Currently at 20 and during the day I feel in complete control and if someone came at me to fight me I’d happily fight them back and be confident, if I know they’re a human I’m fine but it’s the thought of shit like shadow like characters and other scary shit that genuinely actually terrifies me even though logically I know how stupid it is.

I stared at a reflection of me in the window just before and as it’s midnight it’s quite dark (just with some lights on) and I felt a second of pure panic, so instead of fighting it I convinced myself to look back into it and think. I ended up very convinced that those traumatic experiences came from nightmares when I was younger, where I had no control and my mind fucjed with me.

But could trauma possibly come from nightmares ? It would make sense but it seems irrational as then how do you stop it from happening in one way or another

Just to add - in April I took .8g of MDMA and I found out later that over ~.25g of MDMA your body starts converting it to MDA anyway I was tripping a fair bit seeing whack shit not caring too much because of the MD and weed, but I ended up seeing a black shadow man in front of me irl and it threw me off for weeksssss.

We had a lady come and help with the chores around the house but it was mainly to keep my grandma busy because I was at school, my mom was working during the day and gran doesn't really have a hobby so that lady was good for her. Because of the pandemic though, she started coming 2 days a week instead of coming every day and I guess that confused my grandma and she started to see my mother as a stranger who kicked that lady out and started living here, plotting evil things. Now I can't talk with my mother properly because gran thinks she's a stranger and I'm also plotting with her (maybe?), can't talk in private because then it's even more ""evil"" and whenever my mom's out doing something my grandma comes and tells me to call my mom or that evil woman etc. They went to a psychiatrist and were told to play along but I don't want to treat my mom as a stranger or tell someone else that she is. I also think that playing along would make matters worse and I really don't know what to do, how to act. I can't even imagine how frustrating it must be for my mom to be seen as an ""evil stranger"" in her mother's eyes.

198,"So I was put on Zoloft (SSRI), because of my crippling depression and social anxiety. It worked! After a horrible(!) startup I really began to feel better, I took a interest at some of my hobbies again, started cooking healthy and taking care of myself and was able to actually do my job. Which also led to keeping my job, as i started functioning way better. Also socially it had made it possible for me to make an appointment with friends and just go, before the meds i would cancel alot due to depression. It had made my relationships better. Didn’t really work against social anxiety tho, still had a really hard time in a group of people. But hey i Didn’t wanna die anymore. Had met my boyfriend and we moved in together after a good year of being together. I’ve had therapy during that year (mainly grouptherapy (focused on my social anxiety) and now i am on the waiting list for psychotherapy. It will take 8 weeks. 
First of june, I decided i was strong enough to go without meds. Spoke to my doctor about my wish, she was ok with it and togheter we made a plan to build the intake down in little steps. Tho Zoloft did help me make my life a whole lot more stable, i’ve also lost certain aspects of myself. For example, i really LOVED music without meds (and when not, or only mildly depressed). I spend hours and hours listening to it and writing about it. With meds, it really isn’t the same. Ofcause i still like listening to it, but it almost seems as if i hear it diffrently, and it is less intense and i do not listen to it everyday. I also love creative writing and dancing, but same thing, when i’m on my meds, i don’t really care for it and i’m not as good in it. I have very regular headaches on them and gained 15 kilo’s over time.. 
Anyway now 4 weeks ago since I took the last working dosis, and it is safe to say i am not allright at all. I feel really depressed, nothing interest me, i’m tired all the time, i don’t really enjoy anything and everything is too much. Called in sick on work because of it, came home in such a state that i thought it was going to kill me if i kept pushing myself. Now i lay on the couch all day hating the world and myself.. I don’t want to start them again, but it seems like the only option,  maybe i have to accept that i need Zoloft to function. For long during my medication stop i thought that it was just the backlash from the chemicals in my brain getting used to no more zoloft. But now i don’t know anymore, it feels the same as during my previous depressions and i want out.
Has anyone here expirience with building an SSRI down and eventually stop taking them? 
How did you feel, how long did it last before you felt Ok again? Should i keep pushing? Or accept that now is not the time and it might never be, because i might simply need them?

I'm an 18-year-old soon-to-be college student who's on a gap year right now, and over my gap year I really want to spend some time writing about mental health. I recently wrote a post about something called post-traumatic growth, and how our scars can sometimes become the very reason for our joy.

If the topic interests you, would you be willing to have a read? I've linked it down at the bottom of the post.

I'd love to talk about it more with you guys as well! Post-traumatic growth is something I personally wished I did more research on when I was going through my gripes with depression, and it would mean the world to me if any of you guys can let me know if my essay relates at all to your experiences.

201,"Title as says. My anxiety is out of control, but for some reason my psychiatrist, for years, has insisted on only treating my depression. For college I get housing accommodations, which typically is just a single room (as opposed to a dorm room with roommates). 

I was placed into a single with an attached private bathroom this year, but was notified a week ago I’ve been kicked out of that room so students who need to quarantine can use the space. I’m not on a waiting list for freshman housing (I’m a sophomore with junior credits) that all have a shared bathroom. This is an extreme source of anxiety for me, as the bathrooms are shared with 20+ students. 

I asked my psychiatrist to refill out the accommodations paperwork to an include an attached bathroom since since this is such a source of anxiety. It took a week to get it filled out (was turned in past the university’s deadline), they charged me 65$ to fax it, and the secretary called me to shame me for asking them to do it on short notice. 

Today I got an email from the housing department saying nothing about my housing will change because the paper is the same as the last one he filled out last year. It did not include an attached bathroom.

That's way I could say that I've watched thousand of anime,movies,tv series. Even though it catches my attention my brain can't f**king cooperate and that's just my hobby part. 

I can't concentrate if I'm doing one thing at a time. Doing homework while watching some movies and eating gave better result than doing just my assignment alone. I can't just watch one anime and finish the entire thing continuously I have to stop and read some other stories go back to watching that anime and again stop and do the cycle until it's done.

When I look around, I see the worst case scenarios for everything, like I'm creating future based on my observations. Example; One day I was walking home from school. In my way home, I saw mother and child looking at deep excavation i thought to my self  ""what if I kick the child inside? what will his mother do to me?where should i run? what will i do afterwards?"" that's just an example of how this crazy brain works and I always felt like there are more than one mind inside of my mind.

Sometimes my hands and feet start tingling. And I start to get a dull weird pain in my left arm sometimes my right. Its like a cramped feeling or like my veins feel like they are full of pressure. I thought I was having a heart attack so I went to urgent care who did an ekg and said it was normal so they sent me to an ER. Got another 2 EKGs, blood tests, and chest xray.

I keep feeling the chest tightness most of the time but then get these random episodes of the bad heart palpatations and tightness in left or right arm and lightheaded. Ive been to urgent care one more time and the ER twice more after that. I was told im probably having panic attacks and severe anxiety. I just dont feel any anxiety at all. Like there's no butterflies. And the only worry on my mind is im having an impending heart attack. Im only 26 but my dad passed of a heart attack when he was 36.

These episodes are happening sometimes 3 to 4 times a day. This morning it started right when i woke up. I took the lorazepam the hospital gave me and the worrying and being scared im having a heart attack is gone but the left arm pain and chest tightness is still there.

Has anyone ever experienced this before with severe anxiety and panic attacks? Is my fear of having a heart attack causing my brain to make my left arm hurt and random quick pains in my shoulder and neck.

They are loud, dramatic, ratchet, and always act as if you owe them your attention when they walk into the room. If you don’t give them the time of day, they strive to call you out on it with really passive aggressive comments such as “Oh, I know I’m the stepchild” or “Oh, y’all wanna act like y’all can’t hear me.”  To compensate, they are very adamant on throwing blame on others and brown-nosing where they can to make everyone else look bad by comparison.

When management gives them positive attention (the thing they clearly want the most), their face lights up and they put on their “sweet” demeanor. This, in my opinion, only boosts their large ego and self-entitlement. Despite admitting that they’re “ghetto” a despite admitting that people at their previous jobs didn’t like them very much too, they have convinced themselves that they are never the problem, the people who don’t like them are. Despite my manager complaining about them behind their backs, they insist on ignoring the problem for the sake of avoiding training another person in their role.

Then, the second time I got my blood taken, a year or so later, I cried for literally half an hour after it was done.

After this, every time that I would accidentally cut myself or get some sort of wound, I would freak out and feel sick to my stomach.

Then last year, I went for another blood test but the nurse refused to take my blood, claiming that ""I was too nervous and she was scared I would faint."" I haven't had a blood test since.

But today I reached my breaking point. About a month ago, I stepped on a tiny glass piece and cut my big toe. I squirmed as my dad tried taking the glass out. I thought he was successful a month ago, as the pain went away but TODAY IT CAME BACK and started bleeding and and being tender again. I sat down for him to look at it and try to take it out again but I freaked out on him and told him to stop. I felt sick to my stomach and almost wanted to puke, I was shaking. I put a band aid on it but i don't think the glass is actually out - I don't even care at this point since I don't want him touching my foot anymore.

I have a genetic test coming up in September (I believe blood will have to be taken) and I don't know if I'll be able to do it. Just thinking about it, I'm in tears.

What goes down, eventually has to come back up. You’re too valuable to be let down, disappointed and sad. In due time, you’ll be recognised and given what you truly deserve.

224,"My IRL friend group recently fell apart and I am worried. A couple of days ago stuff just went to crap overnight. I got blocked, kicked from all group things, etc. And on my end, it seems like my whole friend circle fell apart.

My friend group was never too big, it only consisted of about 8 people, but it seemed stable, but apparently, it wasn't. I have diagnosed social anxiety (That everyone knows about) so maybe I am a bit too socially desensitized to know if I am doing anything wrong?

I have found a lot of comforts recently in gaming, YouTube, Twitch, and Reddit, it really helps me relax. But I don't know what to do next. I can't and don't want to go outside and socialize because of COVID, and I don't have any social ties outside of my friend group.

Any help would be VERY appreciated. I really need it right now.",04Aug2020,1

230,"Hey everyone! 
So as the title says, I'm looking for a therapist, but I have some weird (?) needs. First of all, let me state that while I am from Hungary I do not want to have a therapist here.
For some reason, I have the hardest time talking about anything feeling related in Hungarian. 

I find it much easier to talk about my feelings, my mental issues, my struggles in a language other than my native tounge. This is one of the reasons why i would like to have a foreign therapist who offers online consultations or even via writing if that is a viable possibility. The other being that if I had a therapist here, my family would definitely know about it and that is not something I want or need right now as they are mostly the root of my problems.

I'm asking for your advice on where to find English speaking therapists who offer online sessions and accept payment via bank transfer or paypal.

Thank you very much for all your help in advance too, I appreciate it a lot.",04Aug2020,1
231,"Hi guys. I quit drinking in January in large part due to the suicidal thoughts, depression and anxiety I was having. I assumed quitting drinking would make it better, but it's gotten increasingly worse all year. I guess I was self-medicating, quite literally. At any rate, I started Lexapro 13 days ago and the last few days I feel absolutely terrible. No motivation to do anything. I'm exhausted and have been sleeping non-stop. I feel really really bad. Is this something I need to wait out, or should I let my dr know? I'm not necessarily having suicidal thoughts anymore, but my depression has sky-rocketed. I'm super bummed.

232,"I run outside 4 to 5x a week and it’s very beneficial to my mental health. I suffer from bipolar depression and anxiety. I moved to a different area though and am now running on a narrow bike lane around a park that’s indefinitely closed due to covid.

I’m constantly going around couples strolling, children on scooters, bikers and other runners not to mention the drug addicts and the homeless (it’s a rough area). For some reason this drives my heart rate up so much I can barely keep going. Today a little old homeless man stood opposite me and raised his hands trying to get me to stop and listen to some gibberish he was saying. I was full on running with earphones on and didn’t stop but eventually had to walk the rest of the way because this small incident made me so incredibly anxious. 

I’m saddened and angry that my brain does these things to me, where I feel irrational fear and can’t go on with daily activities. It happens often at grocery stores or malls, but usually running is my happy me time.

For some reason I feel like other people want to hurt or harass me. Anyone with similar experiences please share or advise. Thanks 🙏",04Aug2020,1
233,"Lately i’ve been having a very weird feeling in my brain when I do some thinking or reasoning. Its sort of like a forgetful feeling, in which you get a weird tension in your brain that you just cant shake. Example: Today i was watching this cartoon. One character was eating chips on the bus when there was a bump and he got chips all over him. He brushed them off. While he was doing this, another character was walking down the aisle when the bus driver yelled for him to sit down. He looked at the character who was brushing his lap and thought that he was motioning him to sit down. So he sits down and the character who was brushing his lap gets weirded out. I know perfectly well what the joke was and i understood what happened. I didnt struggle at all to understand what happened. But for some reason my mind then tries to explain what happened (even tho i know what happened) and it forms this tension in my mind. As if i’m having trouble understanding it, but im not. And then i spend too much time worrying about it and overthinking it. Am i second guessing myself too much and doubting my intelligence too much? Am i overthinking? Am i stressed out? A couple of weeks ago i would not have been like this at all but now all of a sudden im looking too much into things and worrying for no reason. I dont really know and its kinda scary. Does anybody know what this is called, or whats happening?",04Aug2020,1

235,"I don't have an eating disorder, but when I fall into a depressive spell, preparing food, eating, or even remembering that I'm supposed to eat all get much harder. If I feel like eating *and* I can get myself out of bed, I probably won't prepare food, I'll just grab whatever I have, which is usually candy or cookies or cereal. That means that I might not eat at all, but when I do, it's all sugar that definitely won't help me put on weight. (I'm on the very low end of appropriate weight for my height because of some previous health problems, and there are lots of things I can't eat now, which makes it even harder than normal to put weight back on.) This is the first time in a long time that I've been in a depressive spell that lasted more than a couple of weeks (I think quarantine just finally got to me after 4 months), so it's gotten much worse than normal-- mostly eating food with low nutritional value for a week or two isn't awful, but this has been going on for more than a month. 

The reason I'm hiding and hoarding now is that the last time my roommate (who is 10 years older than me, a friend, and a doctor who knows about all of my health problems) noticed the kitchen trashcan had basically been full of candy and cookie wrappers and nothing else for a week, she wanted to talk to me about it. She asked what was going on, was I ok, I can't really just be eating sugar, especially because of my health, etc. I know she wanted to help and I know she'd want to help now, but instead of that, I'm throwing everything away in my desk trashcan in my room. The truth is that some part of me just keeps hoping that she never will because the depression side of my brain wants to keep doing what it's doing. (Consciously or not, sometimes we actually want to stay in our negative emotions even when they're not helping us.)

My fridge is full of healthy ingredients that I could turn into full meals, and my freezer is even full of sort-of-healthy foods that I could prepare in maybe 15 or 20 minutes, but this past month it's felt ""too hard"" to even do that most days. 

If anybody has any advice, that'd be great, but I also just needed to say these things out loud to someone else, or write them for someone else to see. I know what I'm doing isn't good for my body *or* my mental health, I just can't seem to pull out of it this time.",04Aug2020,1
236,"Everything is just too difficult. I can never get myself together. There are so many barriers that just make everything impossible for me. I don’t even know how I will be able to get through high school. I’m starting in less than a month and with everything that’s stood in the way lately, I can’t see myself even trying to get through. I don’t even think I know how to try anymore.

I don’t know how to even clean my room. I’m just staring at a void of manga, pencils, legos and papers spread across the ground. Sometimes I feel motivation, but it is lost very quickly as I realize how hopeless everything is. Everything is getting worse. I plan on cleaning it later but the other issues are always still there. 

In middle school, I didn’t pay attention in math at all so I’m essentially screwed already in that area. To be fair, I have no excuses. All I wanted to do was draw on the papers being handed out and I couldn’t stop. I came out with better drawing skills, but I don’t know anything about actual math other than some geometry as that interests me. 

Even if I tried to pay attention, there was so much to get distracted by. This will sound strange, but it’s hard to pay attention with so much going on. The lights are always too bright, the people are too loud, the desks are cold and everything is just scary. Even my own clothing begins to bother me sometimes. I feel too much of everything, and the only way to attempt to tune everything out is drawing. Especially last year, my math class was extremely loud and obnoxious. These kids would always throw things at me and make me pick them up, then say really confusing things. I’ve even been punched for no reason and I don’t really know how to defend myself. All of this made me choose to just draw the whole class as that as that was the only way to cope. It also made me look too focused to talk to people as I feel better just avoiding that altogether at school. I was already hopeless with math, and now I know nothing. 

People at school are always jerks. I get chased in the hallway by people making weird noises, I get made fun of (especially when people think I’m not listening) and everyone seems to kind of dislike me other than a few people.  I only really talked to two people in school. I had three friends from there, but one of them I talked to online as we didn’t have classes together, the other I never was really close with but sometimes we talked about nintendo, and the other guy was kind of a bully but it was better than nobody. Or at least I thought at the time, but my only friend who seems to actually care about me (I don’t go to school with them) told me I shouldn’t talk to them anymore if they were going to be a jerk to me. This made my focus even worse as I have no clue what somebody will say in order to make me feel uncomfortable or embarrassed so I feel like I’m always scared while roaming the halls.

My constant fear of everything makes my only instinct as to just get through the day. My grades eventually stopped mattering to me and I just focused on trying to cope. I’ve always had this focus as people were hard to deal with in elementary school, but everything got worse instead of better so I had to completely forget about my performance. I don’t even know how I passed last year. Quarantine made thing worse when all I wanted to do was cope to the change in routine rather than do my work. My computer screen also broke and I never figured out how to tell my mom so it was really difficult to see the assignments.

My feelings are also making me less functional. I cry way too much, sometimes more than once a day. It’s because I hate myself. I realize that I avoid talking to people simply because I don’t know how. I should know social things but I don’t. People always misread me and I always misread other people. I’m horrible with other people. I admire many people who are nice but still good with socializing because of this. Particularly my best friend. I sometimes feel that I even LOVE her.. it’s weird looking up to people, but I feel so much lower than everyone else. I’m too stupid to talk to others properly. I don’t even know how to tell others when I’m upset sometimes because I don’t always know how I feel other than bad. I feel like a worthless scum who always accidentally makes others feel bad. People always think I’m being rude. Apparently my body language is out of sync so that could be why. I feel like everyone else’s is out of sync, but that clearly isn’t the case as I’m alone on this most of the time.

I just feel so wrong and almost disconnected. I feel that nobody truly wants me around. Sometimes everything feels one-sided. I care about my people, but do they really care back? Sometimes it feels that they are just trying to be nice. It really sucks. All of the info I’ve stated is what makes me want to give up. I don’t want to uncontrollably cry anymore just from being the way I am. I won’t last in high school. I know it. I think my mental health is collapsing. It’s never been the best, but I feel constantly unmotivated and exhausted and I can’t stop thinking about how much I dislike myself and how many social interactions I’ve screwed over. I don’t know what to do. I’m too scared of telling my mom that I almost feel sick from everything. 

Sometimes I want to just run away from everything. I think it’s bad that I hit myself sometimes but I don’t know. Everything is just hard now. There are so many things to come to terms with, that I’m gay, that everyone hates me for some reason, that I suck at everything I do... I don’t know how to get help. I’m so alone. My mom will likely disregard me as she has in the past, and my dad is not responsible for me. Even if he was, I don’t think I would be able to trust him as he abused me in the past. My mom doesn’t even care that my teachers said I might be autistic. She always says that I don’t have it, and other times she calls me an “aspie”.. she doesn’t want to get me tested, and I can’t trust her with this either I guess if I will just be invalidated. I’m only 13, but I think this might be  what a a midlife crisis feels like. Alienated and lost. everything just hurts.",04Aug2020,1
237,"**The background:**

Hey im 17, from Germany (If the answer depends on the country) and Im therapy because of some stuff including that Im transgender (the only reason my parents know) for about 1 1/2 years now. A couple months or weeks ago my therapist suggested that i go to a psychologist and doctor (same practice) to get a diagnosis. I struggle with school and the work for it so he wants to know if I may have a undiscovered disorder. I had to go to a specific amount of sessions and the comming one is where i get my diagnosis. The last one was recently with the doctor only. I talked to her and she mentioned that i show some symtoms of ADS and suggested medication for that and my anxiety to test if I do better in school with it. But she also said the psychologist with whom I spent the last sessions with is more on the depression path. Let me explain: the worst what could happen is if i get diagnosed with depression and my parents get to know about it. I dont care what my diagnosis is I just dont want them to know. It isn't even that they are strict or whatever, its more like i dont want them to worry about me. They are seperated by the way. My mother has some heavy problems and tried to kill herself when she was my age mainly because of her shitty parents. She wont get help but and I feel she is way too attached to me. I dont want her to think that she had done the same mistakes as her parents. I dont want to be the cause when her situation gets worse and she may hurt herself more. I dont want to get closer to my parents i just want to be free and live my own life. With my dad its similar. He lives alone, has barely friends like my mother (besides she has a husband now). I just think in general they care too much about me and I dont want them too see how I really feel. I probably  sound like sucky asshole and I mean its pretty odd that a lot of people dont have loving parents or lost their family and never felt the love. But I feel like im choking on this. I think this is the result of me growing up with them rather than me being a teenager but heck I go of topic. I just cant tell anyone. I feel really bad for them and i dont know i just want to keep the illusion until I move out. I hope you get my point, its probably nothing big but Im scared and dont know what to do. I even think about trying to lie to the psychologist  and doctor somehow.

**My actual question:** 

Have the doctor and psychologist to tell my parents about my issues (If I have some) because Im a minor, or can I talk to them so they dont say something? (I dont want to die while my mom, dad and dad2 (husband of my mom, I know him longer than half of my life) are alife so Im in no danger of killing myself or something like that.

When they have to tell my parents: what should I do?

238,"But I don't understand why.

To make a long story short, me and my mom, who struggles with anxiety, got into an argument a few days back. I didn't think it was necessarily a big deal, until she told me I wasn't welcome home anymore. I was genuinely confused, but my mom proceeded to tell everyone how I was making her feel like she was in danger, how I was being aggressive and intimidating, like, a ton of stuff.

Eventually they hold some kind of big family intervention, and sit me down, and proceed to explain what I was doing to be aggressive. It made and makes absolutely no sense to me, and I mentioned that it must be my mom's anxiety, which only made the situation worse.

Now mom's saying that she's a complete failure of a mother, that my entire life has been a failure too, and that something is extremely wrong with me. I am now being sent to therapy, since they're saying I can't make it on my own because of how unstable I am.

Meanwhile, I'm just absolutely confused and incredibly hurt at the same time.

She's saying things happened that didn't and things that didn't happen did, saying that she believes I must be developing a personality disorder that runs in the family, stuff that to me sounds completely insane.

Idk what to do in all honesty. My girlfriend of ten months is just as confused, but my family is saying that I just put on these fake facades around everyone else and no one knows the real me, who's apparently a danger to my own family? What?

Maybe something is wrong with me but I genuinely don't understand or see it. I said maybe therapy will help me to understand, but I feel like this is my mom blowing this out of proportion. Even then though, it really hurts.

About me: I'm 18, have a full ride to a well known expensive private school, am well respected and well liked, and work as a shift supervisor and pharmacy technician. In other words, I'm trusted enough to have keys to a drug store

But, even with those, my mom's saying that I'm a complete failure of a son and she failed as a parent. How all my accomplishments are worthless. How I have no respect for her and she's scared to be around me.

I just don't understand, and it hurts.

239,"Hey everyone, throw away account due to not all my friends know my situation yet. With that said I wanted to get this out there in case anyone is struggling. Forewarning this will probably be a longer post.  


TL:DR Help is out there don't give up or give in. Keep pushing until you find the help that suites you. Quite a bit of my issues stemmed from my childhood and I didn't even know! If you are bad off something I didn't think of until after all this. I didn't call anyone because I knew they couldn't help me but I didn't realize THEY COULD HAVE HELPED ME FIND HELP SOONER.   


Hey everyone, early 30's male here. I'm in emergency services. I have a wife and a kid.

I almost killed myself on 3/10/20 due to issues. I'm glad I didn't. I'll try to keep this to the point. To provide context my entire life I've been very outgoing, positive, funny, can do, I don't give up, helpful, etc. I've never in my life thought of hurting myself until that morning of March 10th. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to life, things I had not dealt with that I thought I had (bad calls, early adulthood bad decisions) and issues just kept piling up I was in a slight depression I had knee surgery which didn't help. I have tinnitus that got worse and I knew it would get better but I just couldn't see the light. I thought I was doing ok, I put on a great front. One morning I woke up and that was it I was going to end my life. I wrote my goodbye letters and I was out. Thank God (or whoever you believe in) I didn't go through with it. At the time that was mixed emotions in it self.   


I reached out (as a medical provider I thought I knew the system) to my doc. He threw me multiple medications. I didn't want medications I wanted help but I get it. I wont lie to you I didn't take them and had no plans to. I was referred to a psych after he tried talking me into checking into a facility which I did not do. I talked to the psych and the same thing, here's some meds, take these feel better. Literally told him I didn't want the meds he told me to at least try the xanax and klonopins if it got to bad. 

Through this my wife was my rock. She held up so amazingly well for me/us. 

&amp;#x200B;

For me I thought my tinnitus was my sole issue so I started calling people I thought could help non-stop. Cold calling them. During this I started drinking more and not realizing it. I also started taking the xanax and klonopins. I had some tell me they couldn't help me and others say they could just for me to show up and then they say they couldn't or here's more meds. I finally found a audiologist after 2-3 weeks from 3/10 that said he could help me. He called me 5-10 minutes after I emailed him because I told him how bad it was for me. He was upfront I can't cure it and no one can yet so if they say they can they're lying (which I knew) he had me. He set me up the next day. He helped me get hearing aids which helped a lot.  


There was still something wrong though. I wasn't me and I still had suicidal thoughts. I pushed it off and thought fake it to you make it right? Ill be back to my old me in no time. As I drank more and took more pills at the time not even realizing it. (for those who may wonder or care I never did it before work or at work)   


I reached out to some friends and a friend of a friend told me about a mental health facility/retreat. So I filled out the forms and talked to them. What do I have to lose? So I went for it.   


While I was there I learned a lot. I have scattered memories throughout my childhood as in I can't remember a lot of my childhood. During all our talks and figuring things out I started remembering my childhood, more of it, and other things became more clear. I was physically and mentally abused. One of my parents put a plastic bag over my head. I was molested, more then once. I lived in fear.   


I realized I was still holding onto that and some from my early adulthood like some of the emergency calls I had been on. I never processed all of it. I never really truly grieved it out. I realized I was addicted to porn. I was borderline addicted to drinking and benzo's. I was on a path of self destruction which would take my life one way or another.  


I made peace with everything in my past. I finally understood a lot more about myself (some small things, I was using porn to numb feelings I didn't want to deal with along with alcohol and pills, I cared way to much what people thought of me, I wasn't truly honest with myself, I didn't practice what I preached). I now meditate 2-3 times daily. I had never been big on meditation and take it for what you will but man, that's helped change my fucking life!   


I live in the moment now, I don't live in the past, I don't hold onto the past. I live for now. I have plans for the future but I don't live in the future either.  


Something they said that has stuck with me, ""Simple not easy"". Now that I look back on it yeah, it was simple just let all that go but it's not easy. 

  
Most my life I had been told Men don't cry. I never saw anyone I looked up to male wise cry. They never discussed their feelings. At work we don't talk about it much we just deal with it in our own way (that's changing for the better though). Fuck most of that! I cry, I talk about my feelings, I break down here and there, I don't hide that shit. It's OK to not be okay.   


I'm now over 30 days clean of alcohol, drugs and porn. I've never been happier in life, honestly. I am at the peak of happiness. I hardly worry now, I don't stress, I'm not anxious, I'm happy. I'm so happy I'm here. I can't stress that enough if you're thinking of taking your life please don't! It will get better just push until you find the help. Find a friend and ask them to hold you 100% accountable. I have a close friend who I know, now, will call me out if I'm fucking up or he even thinks I'm fucking up. That's uncomfortable for him and me but that's what a true friend does.   


I hope this reaches someone if you're in a bad situation. COVID isn't helping anybody with mental health right now.   


  
If no one's told you lately, fuck it; I love you!

So don't be afraid to be vulnerable if someone give's you a hard time fuck'm they're probably not good for you anyway. If you're thinking about opening up to a friend so far I've told about 20 friends/co-workers and they have all been extremely receptive and cared.

I've tried to explain this to my psychiatrist and he just ignores me and says I'm not psychotic so it's nothing to worry about. But when I have to lock myself away at home because I'm scared of lashing out, surely it's not healthy and something they should be able to help me with?

It doesn't help that when I say I'd be better off dead than hurting someone, that my family just tells me I need to live for my son. But surely it's not good having a mum so close to anger? Please if anyone knows how to deal with this stuff, any help would be appreciated.",04Aug2020,1

244,"After reading all of these posts, I realized that I've had a lot of feelings built up in me, and I need somewhere to release them.

To elaborate on the title, my parents are insane. I'm Indian and 18F, and I'm glad I'm moving out in two weeks to college (even through this whole pandemic).

&amp;#x200B;

My parents hate each other (gotta love arranged marriages am I right?). Sometimes they're fine with each other, but most of the time, it only takes a couple words for them to literally fight each other. This has been a constant thing for 18 years. I know they're not good for each other. Basically, my dad is so insensitive. I hate to admit it, but it's true. He doesn't like my mom. My mom wants affection, she wants care, she wants love from my dad but my dad doesn't want to give it to her. He's only staying together with her ""for the kids"". They just think in polar opposite ways that when put together, it's deadly. It's even worse because they literally drag me into it and ask me to choose sides and be their ""marriage counselor"". Both of them tell me to not be like the other parent, but I'm like- it's genetics I can't just not be like the other parent-

I've tried to ask them to divorce so that at least my younger sibling can live in a peaceful household, but they said that divorce isn't ""part of their values"" and my sibling needs ""two parents to grow up with"". I mean, if both parents are so selfish and stubborn that they don't even care about the emotional needs of their child, I don't see how growing up with these parents will benefit, but okay-

&amp;#x200B;

After being in quarantine for like 5 months, I'm now starting to realize that these things *really* affect me. If I can't remember what I did for my fourth grade science experiment, but I can remember the time when my mom left the house in the middle of the night saying she wanted to die, THAT'S A PROBLEM. If I can't remember the time when I won an award at a math competition but I can remember the time when my dad yelled at me for not sticking up to him when this is about HIS MARRIAGE, there's a big problem.

They either argue or give each the silent treatment, and there is no in between. Even when they are \*rarely\* happy with each other, I don't believe that they are actually happy with each other. I just worry about the next time they will argue or leave. You see, my parents didn't expect having me. I was a surprise kid, but out of the goodness of their heart, they had me. They CHOSE to have me, but it makes me feel like I owe them something. I owe them some type of happiness because their marriage might suck, but hey, at least their children are successful!

&amp;#x200B;

Because of their situation, I've constantly pushed myself to the highest expectations, not for me, but for *my parents*. It's deadly, being in a cycle where the output is external validation that isn't even guaranteed. They've yelled at me for my grades, test scores, not being good enough, basically the whole shebang, calling me stupid, a disappointment, an idiot, a moron, and basically any other hurtful word you could think of. It was stressful during college application season because they both genuinely thought I wouldn't get into any college.

I developed eating issues at an early age, and now I can't eat certain foods today without bawling my eyes out because those foods remind me of my past. I can't even eat CHICKEN NUGGETS without feeling bad, because it takes me back to a time where I was crying eating chicken nuggets while my parents were arguing. Now I have body issues and I fucking hate how I look :/. I wish I was skinnier and had fairer skin since that's what people care about these days. I wish I was more outgoing because ever since I was little I was quiet, and my parents have always labeled me as shy, making me think that I can't get out of their prophecy that they've set out for me.

I don't have that many friends because I'm honestly scared of letting people close to me for fear of them leaving me or betraying me. I have had friends leave me multiple times, so that might have something to do with it. I'm basically controlled in every single aspect, including what major I'm studying, who I hang out with, etc. I'm complying because maybe it'll finally make them happy and it'll make them stop arguing (but no matter what I do they will always act the same way).

Not to mention they're both racist and homophobic (which sucks because I have friends of diverse cultures AND I'm bisexual). They caught me speaking with my ex girlfriend (because they check my phone) and forced me to break up with her. My ex basically stopped talking to me after that (I don't blame her, to be honest).

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks mom and dad, now I have crippling anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Thank you so much for your service. Now I've grown up being so romance averse that I think getting into any romantic relationship will just be a repeat of my parents' relationship! Yet you two STILL expect me to get married by 25. Yeah, in your fucking dreams. Once I pay off all my debts to you so that you can retire (aka all that money you spent on my college education), I'm cutting off all contact with you two. I'm actually going to be alone forever.

If you've read this whole thing, thank you. Thank you for reading. Thank you for making me feel heard.",04Aug2020,1

248,I’m 18 and for the last 2 years have been the worst years of my life. I have dealt with a lot of shit in the past 2 years but I’m just so lost I have no vision for my life and nothing makes me happy anymore. I’m more and more alone and even going out and being with friends isn’t what it used to be to the point where sometimes I just wanna be alone and do nothing in my room which makes me even more sad. The only passion right now I have is the gym where I’m making great progress and the only part where I’m extremely focused and goal driven the rest I don’t really care. It’s not that I’m depressed sometimes I feel like my past excessive MDMA consumption could be a reason but for my sadness and anxiety but I think the main thing is I don’t have like a purpose in life like no excitement or anything. I’m a chronic over thinker and always think what could go wrong which is also partly why i drink so much. I’m becoming more and more of a Nihilist which I fucking hate because I know life can be so beautiful I just don’t know in which direction to start.,04Aug2020,1
249,"Hi guys,

Basically, ive been in a weird place the last 3 years, been feeling depressed or sad almost everyday, anxiety, and i think its been taking a toll on my head, massively.

I used to think it would go away with time, as most people say, but it just has gotten significantly worse recently, i got better a couple months back, but now it sprang back into my head full force, and all i feel like is darkness, as cringy and weird as it sounds, i just feel dead, uncontrollable. I feel like i have no way for me to tell mu feelings,mental state nothing, i just am existing. Ive been contemplating ending it alot, like almost everyday, actually id say everyday. I just dont know why im here no more if im honest, and the only thing keeping me here is my family, otherwise i would have gone years ago. I just dont get whats going on at all.

I think ive got a eating disorder now too, over the last few months i just gag when i eat and take a bite, i can baret fill my stomach without having to stop myself being sick, i dont know what it is. Ive always been skinny since day 1, and really underweighy as it is, its been a massive insecurity of mine since as long as i can remember, because everyone comments on it first thing, and it hurts. When i was better i was trying to gain weight, having 5-6 meals a day, excerising all of it, but then i realised i cant afford this at all, after spending about 1000£ in 2 months on just food and being unemployed at 17 it doesnt help. Before anyone bashes me for not having a job, i really tried, but the anxiety and paranoia just always resulting in breakdowns, the thought of interviews, or just uno social interactions with professionals almost makes me sick and idk why. Bottom line is i constantly feel like im dying, im like 55kg and 6ft now, and it makes me cry, i just cant do this shit no more. 

Anyone know what this is or if it is a disorder? I just dont know

And no i havent been to seek professional help because ive been told by two other mates who are clinically depressed to not bother because they dont do anything until 2 years after you go through their step by step process, i guess you could say.

Any help would be appreciated to no amount, thanks guys",04Aug2020,1

I breathe really fast and I can feel my heartbeat speeding up and I feel faint, my vision sometimes blacks out or I 'see stars', but I don't think it's a panic attack because I experience those too and they feel different: there is no sense of fear, only elation or adrenaline.  I usually self-harm to subdue it because it calms me down, but I reckon I would find more success in figuring out why this happens in the first place.  I find it hard to sleep and it usually makes me pull all-nighters, in which I am not at all tired afterwards.  Sometimes I find that time has passed in a blur and that I've managed to finish tons of school essays after weeks of procrastination and demotivation.  I'm not sure if this is relevant, but my stomach often feels empty during these periods, even though I've eaten normally.  If you need any more information I would be happy to provide it.

Like that’s my resting pose. It’s not really because I’m suicidal, I just don’t see a point in life really. Like sure, I enjoy stuff, but at the end of the day, why? I know this sounds like an existential crisis. “You are loved” yeah sure, but it feels as though it doesn’t matter. I’m selfish like that, I know. But I cant help but feel this way. I used to be afraid of people leaving me and now I just expect it, even though I’ve only had like 1-2 close friends do it to me. 
I don’t know what my personality is, I guess I feel left out in a weird way? I’m always conflicted. I get really upset when I’m not invited to a party, but when I do get invited, I kind of don’t want to go. And when I don’t go, I feel I’m missing out on my friends and not being social in general.

263,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. I hope this question doesn't come across stupid. Basically, since I was a child I have struggled with obsessive thoughts. Obviously a child can't think many bad things, but at the time they were thoughts that made me feel extremely guilty to the point where I couldn't think of anything else, and at around 5 years old I was completely convinced I was going to hell for thinking such terrible things. 

As an adult, this problem continues to plague me, despite me having a better sense of rationality now. The thoughts I have normally concern people I am close to, which intensifies the guilt as I feel like a terrible person, or if I believe that thought to be true then I feel like ""oh my god, I need to tell them otherwise I'm basically lying to them and that is worse"". Obviously I don't just go around voicing these thoughts to people, and it doesn't always concern others. Sometimes, they are snippets from the past which I have all but forgotten about, and suddenly I won't be able to stop thinking about it. My chest gets heavy and I find it hard to breathe, and I often end up dissociating from reality because I can't process anything else but that specific thought. I have severe anxiety which I know these are symptoms of, but I don't understand why my brain has to obsess over thoughts which I literally cannot control.

The longest I have ever been plagued by a specific thought is almost a year, where I woke up suddenly every single day struggling to breathe. I've never told anyone else because I've never been able to describe it where it makes any sense. I should also note that I go through periods where I am fine and a bad thought is a bad thought and nothing more. Other times, I will think about something and suddenly it will plague me. It's never anything specific and is something different every time, and I generally have to 'ride it out' and wait for my brain to stop obsessing. This is the worst part though, as during this time I cannot function at all.

Has anyone else experienced similar? Is there a specific name for this, or is it just a form of OCD? Is there treatment? Literally any advice would be appreciated. Thank you 💙",04Aug2020,1

I have worked, was getting used to already to the job I was doing, and then corona pandemic happened and I lost my job. I have few friends, close ones. I only rarely spend my time with them, and with others I dont spend time at all. The things that used to make me happy, no longer make me happy. I have noticed in this time that my emotions went blunt. I no longer feel anger as I used to, and that is maybe a good thing, but I also dont longer feel happiness. I also left my university at end of it, and I almost finished it, but before ending it I quit it. It was not hard for me, because I was always a best student since elementary school. But I just lost motivation. Like there is nothing there in the future, like all is futile. I lost my father 1.5 year ago, and he was my best friend. I loved him very much, and he also loved me, and spoiled me.

His behaviors:

•Follows people around the house screaming and arguing. 
•Constantly insit's someone is lying or being manipulative, etc. 
•Constantly enters specific thought process loops where he can only think of one negative topic, (something I have done in the past even though we have addressed it 10000x times.) He can't break out of the thought loop and ends up livid. 

•""Trying to put all of the pieces into the puzzle in my head.""

• Hits, shoves, throws things, screams in your face, dumps luggage onto the floor, steals my phone and digs through it, runs outside and throughout the house with it.

•He deprives me of sleep shaking me awake if he is upset with me. 

•""Why CAN'T  I know -?"" something. 

•He apparently has done these things to all of his family members since childhood. 

•He has admitted to fantasising about cheating on me and has used dating apps to match with other women. 

•He admitted to downloading loads of porn in spite of me even when we weren't fighting and things were great. Sometimes even beside me. 

•He believes he may have moderate OCD tendencies. Counting steps, actions in 4''s or 16's. 

•He has a subtle tic that gets more apparent and he develops new ones when he is under a lot of stress and anxiety. 

•He talks in much slower drawn out sentences trying to find the ""perfect words"".

What did I do? Well, nothing violent or any kind of criminal act against another person. Mostly was just a rude asshole to a lot of people in my drinking days (quit two years ago). Used to ride a motorcycle after drinking too, which, even though nothing bad happened, is something I feel extremely guilty and ashamed of.

I remember one time about 10 years ago, I was in a bar talking to a group of women. Going in I guess I was going to flirt with them, but instead I abandoned that for no reason and said something insulting. Almost got slapped in the face.

I wonder where they are now. Probably doing well, hopefully don't remember what I said or it didn't bother them too long.

Meanwhile, here I am, suffering all the time. I quit drinking, which is good, but is it enough? How much longer do I have to go on like this? If it's a life sentence, then I would rather know now. It's starting to feel unfair. 

Deep down I know it makes no sense that the two things are connected. Lots of terrible people feel great, lots of really good people are down.

280,"Can I just keep the long story short? My mom is super paranoid and thinks that every noise she hears is someone on the roof trying to invade our home and rob us, etcetera etcetera.  


I'm not stupid so I know we need the help of a professional in order to get through this. 

But the problem is that everything has been immensely difficult. This is the second time she's started behaving like this in this year, the first time it only 'ended' once dad installed an electric fence+sensors on both of our doors.  


Cutting to the chase. This is really hurting us all as a family. Mom does not trust us, she just won't trust us. She is angry, and I know we're hurting her but she's also hurting us.  


My father is dense and has 0 emotional inteligence. He doesn't have any patience ( even though he says he does ) and every talk between him and my mom ends on a fight.  
My mom spends most of the night awake when she's really scared about this. She has cried, she has gotten very furious...  


I just don't try to talk to her anymore. She won't listen, and she's hurt us so much.  


I know we need professional help and I have talked with my dad about it. We have an appoitment with a psychologist, for me and him, so that we can talk to the psychologist and learn how to deal with this. But this stupid appointment got delayed to next monday.  


This is hurting me, and I am tired. I feel bad for my mom, because she's not okay but she both refuses to listen to us and refuses to believe that there is a problem.   


I also feel bad for my dad because he can't cope with this. He deals with depression poorly and he's just tired as well because he's just a mess and never learned to deal with his own problems in a healthy manner. He's focusing on installing cameras on the house now, to try and help her. It just won't work. We have an electric fence...the only things on the roof are STRAY CATS. But my mother won't believe this no matter what we say.  


Everything feels like a struggle. I wish I could just leave and be by myself but I can't. I do not have a job nor can I get one yet with absolute no experience and with these bad vibes on my mindset. I haven't even finished a full year of university yet; hell I don't even want my current major, but I'm trying to finish 1 year of it so I can ask for a major change and get into one I actually feel like I want.

I feel like even talking about it is pointless, because I know that no one will help me solve my own life's problems. Can someone just tell me something useful? Just what do I do? I just want my family to be in peace. I don't want all these problems.",04Aug2020,1

282,"So this is all probably going to be fairly common so I'll just give you all a short rundown:

I am a 21yo male living in Germany, I study at a university (only second semester because I changed after 2 years in another major), live in student housing. Amplified by Covid I feel like I'm sliding into the same patterns as with my last major, dissatisfaction, not getting stuff done, self sabotage to avoid accepting it's me thats failing, alcohol/drug abuse, obsessive procrastination, gaming, youtube, masturbation etc.

I'm also becoming more and more frustrated with my sexual/relationship status, due to previous abuse, due to sexual abuse at 13 and various factors with my first and only long term relationship I am still a virgin and have a hard time making myself attractive to people, also because I have a significant problem with competition and have started to refuse to make myself physically appealing (I very much practice hygiene etc, but don't have a style and wear stuff a 15 yo would bc I haven't bought any clothes since then). Confrontation with my sexual issues wears on me, I am becoming desperate and creepy, and even seeing attractive women makes me physically sick with kind of a feeling of missing out (best way I can describe it). I have a few good friends, m and f, but tend to self isolate and don't interact with them enough but also can't get myself to do so.

I have been in therapy 3 times and talk (way too much and too openly) about my issues with others but I always felt left alone with my problems, and while I know it's not my friends job to keep me together and get me on the right path I was disappointed with all of my therapists, as even when asked all of them refused to actually critizise me for doing something wrong, call me out when I am obviously lying or to tell me what to do/ have initiative of some kind.

I am looking for advice or resources of any kind on how to improve my habits \*long term\*, and maybe ways to motivate and fulfill myself along the way, maybe someone from germany can give advice on therapy/medication/maybe going into some place for a while.",04Aug2020,1

My dad was abusive and home life as a teenager was super unstable. After finally standing up to my dad I ended up loosing all my childhood friends.

Since then I have struggled with relationships. Initially thing's are great. Until there is an issue and then I don't handle it in the healthiest way. Usually by this point the guy has ended things and I wind up begging him to take me back. Then end up suicidal when he won't... 

I know it's not the right way to behave but I get manic and feel like a completely different person.

284,"I mean, i think i have some form of anxiety, im 22 and don’t drive, never went to college, prom or my graduation (for fear of filling paperwork out wrong, needing more help than i’m comfortable asking for, etc) Dragged out of ballet as a kid bc i was hiding myself during a recital, froze up before diving in at a swimming competition. I’ve never been able to do anything that involved other people potentially looking at me. Always been too scared to risk any judgement that might come my way, even though i’ve had dyed hair, piercings and tattoos practically my whole life lol and because of my fear of taking leaps and doing things for myself i’ve become a burden on the people around me. they claim i’m not of course but i definitely feel like i am.
Comments like “they’re not looking at you” “everyone gets nervous driving for the first time” “nobody thinks about you the way you think they are” don’t help, i know all of this is true but i can’t just stop the thoughts.
things have gotten bad recently, my mental health has just been getting worse and worse with my living situation and not having a job during the pandemic. i also came out as nonbinary and have had really positive feedback from the people most important to me but i wish i could go back in the closet and make everyone forget i came out. now i’ve deleted pretty much all social media because i hate knowing other people know of my existence. The best way i can put it is living in a constant state of embarrassment. For. No. Reason. it’s draining. 
i messaged a tattoo artist and panicked, asked my friend exactly what i should say cause i felt weird about it and like i’m intruding. i’ve been tattooed before, by the same artist and still overthinking now. every time i hang out with somebody, even if i have a great time the whole time, as soon as i’m home i’m overthinking and up all night thinking about how annoying i am or how dumb i sounded. even when i can’t think of anything specifically that might have been a dumb thing to say or do i start feeling embarrassed over the fact i was there, with them, they saw me and heard me speak. ive never been on any kind of medication for my mental health but have thinking about it a lot recently cause i just want to stop feeling like this. feeling like everybody’s eyes are on you, judging you 24/7 even when you’re alone in bed? i can’t handle it. but i don’t know if an anxiety medication would even help cause maybe i just have insecurities and need to work on myself? 

oh it also doesn’t help i go through phases where i CRAVE attention, i’ll download dating apps just to have conversations, message all my friends, repeatedly sometimes, start posting on social media again and then when that phase is over i feel like dying of embarrassment that i messaged anybody and they’re now aware of my existence again. 
i’ve told my therapist almost all of this and she doesn’t really say or do anything that helps me. can i ask her if i can be prescribed something that will help me?? is there anything i can take that might help?? 
this also doesn’t extend to strangers, i can go to the stores alone or even parties with friends and be perfectly fine. the over thinking is only with people i’ve directly interacted with or people i know follow me on social media and stuff like that. idk it doesn’t make sense to me either. i’m just wondering if this actually sounds like anxiety and if there’s medication for it.",04Aug2020,1

I can home and then realized... it wasnt the snake that ran me off.... it was the fear of meeting that snake again and having nothing better than I did before. I came home and found my true happiness, gained an amazing life, and am moving onto bigger and better things with someone who i once thought might be a snake but after 4 years off and on with them... i realize the only snakes there really were in our relationship is the ones that didnt want us together.... so after all these realizations I have found my peace therefore I have died.

287,"recently I’ve just become so disconnected and not motivated by anything, I’ve had a traumatic upbringing and a terrible relationship if that may contribute some way.

in my relationship now I’m just constantly breaking down, if that is what it is. It could be something so small and it tips me off and makes me go insane crying, feeling like I’m gonna die as I’m shaking and just crying. 

my boyfriend lies so much and tries to convince me he’s not and when he does, something as stupid as that makes me think I’m crazy, or that he’s trying to portray me as crazy and I don’t know what it is it just makes me lose my shit and I just can’t describe what it is I’m feeling when I’m breaking down and breaking stuff I just can’t stop thinking about death and dying and then whatever’s going on in my head it’s just such a rush of thoughts and emotion and it’s happening so much lately I don’t even know what to do.

sorry if this is hard to understand but currently in the middle of an episode of whatever this is now and I just need help because it’s happening at least once a day and the rest of the day where it’s not happening I’m just so so miserable with everything from the way I look to my weight to just everything",04Aug2020,1
288,"I tend to call these episodes,  becuase, quite frankly, I don't know what the heck is wrong with me.

Let's take the most recent example, which would be now. I'm at a camping and my little brother is sleeping below me. He isn't even snoring, just lightly breathing. Sometimes more louder than others. But it's like the sound reverberates in my head, and it's the only thing I can hear. I get impulses and I act upon them. Not all, but some.

I started banging my head against the wall and clawed at myself. I clawed at the wall to make the sound stop. I just did anything to make myself sleep, because i am TIRED. or to just... Block out the noise. As soon as he stopped, my episode stopped. And then he started again. At some point my stepmom even entered asking what the hell I was doing, and she then later asked why I was crying. I couldn't even speak, I was afraid she wouldn't take me seriously so I just kept repeating ""I can't, I can't."" over and over and she, not understanding what the heck I meant, told me that I could play on my phone for a while.

And now I'm in a toilet because I can't take the stress it's giving me to hear him all the time. I'm getting impulses to strangle him and hit I'm and I don't want to do that. 

This isn't the first time this has happened, either. Another example is when my stepmom was playing music on the radio as she drove and all of a sudden the music just got... Overbearing. It felt like it was forcing itself into my head and I couldn't do anything about it. Everything just felt so much louder. So I blocked my ears with my hands for 20 minutes straight... Doing my ABSOLUTE Best to not scream, or cry. Or generally just... Harm myself.

I'm sick and tired of it. During these episodes I'm hyper aware of what I'm doing and what other people are doing and the consequences of what I'm doing, but to the most degree I just... Can't control it, because the mental pain is so stressful I just can't.

I just want to know what's wrong with me, because I'm hyper sensitive and NO ONE else I know is like this.",04Aug2020,1

I'm interested in studying engineering after high school but every time I read up on it, all I see are just people talking about how crappy and stressful their engineering jobs are. Every time I think about what will my life be like in university I get anxious because I think I might not be able to make friends or develop relationships with anybody. I'm usually a talkitive person around people at school. I'm worried I'll just be studying all by myself with no social life. I'm afraid that I will just have a 9 to 5 job and do nothing for the rest of my life. I might have no friends or nobody that cares about me when I'm an adult. Then I see all these people on the internet who have great jobs and great people around them and I think to myself that I will never get to be like them. I will never be happy like them. I've never had these thoughts before until a few days ago when I took the day to research the future of an engineering career. I then realized how stressful and depressing the engineering field mostly is. I know that people might say that I should choose a different career path but my parents only want me to do engineering because it is a good paying career. I know if I decide on a different career path they would not let me go to university and they are the only ones who can pay for my tuition. I dont really know what I like anymore. I feel so lost in life right now and I really need a solution to all of this. I've been feeling depressed, anxious, and tired for a few days now and I want to stop these feelings.

I found out I listened to 231 songs (11hrs 42min) but my average session time is 19min lol like this is so intimate I had to share cause I'd love feedback from others cause I feel like I found something dope.

I was at my cousins and it was their birthday party , more like a pool party... Anyway, everything was all right for an hour, two or more but I started feeling like crap after my cousin started joking around and being funny, everyone laughed... We are the same age but I'm anxious, shy, introvert... And my cousin is so funny, happy, an extrovert type. I just want to be like him, he doesn't need to care about every little problem he has in life. So, I start feeling like I'm gonna black out or something and I felt tired af, I wanted just to go home, I wanted to go away, I couldn't breathe properly and besides that my head was hurting like hell. I even begged my dad to go home but he was already drunk... My mom didn't notice me first so pretty much she didn't care. Everyone asked me what happened but I couldn't tell them. I give up because my dad even punched me away, I sat down behind the house and cried like I was kidnapped or something. I couldn't.... I don't really know but I didn't felt all right. After my mom noticed me she talked with my dad to go home but his drunk mind didn't give up, he wanted to stay. I yelled at him because I couldn't do anything else that time. Anyway, he didn't come with us my brother kept punching me the way home because he wanted to stay as well and my mom just walked in silence behind me. We couldn't drive home because none of us know how to drive and my dad, of course, he's drunk. Anyway, after a moment he came to us because he didn't want to let us go alone.

My cousin's mother was the one who begged you to don't let me leave alone) So we walked like that for hours but all the way home I was just sobbing and twitching (a little). My brother got to the Mall and my mom send me to go faster than them (like I won't hear you arguing about your anxious useless child) Anyway, we got back home and I slept, after all....

- got asked if I was new to fitness. Im not, im just particularly weak. Ive been working out for two years. Im trying my best and I can lift more than my body weight in most exercises. Its still pathetic though because I only weight about 135 lbs. Im short. I try so hard, and i get injured a lot, and I lower the weight so I dont accidentally kill myself and i deal with it but it gets me mad. I wish I could lift more and knowing I can't makes me so angry. If I had to hurt myself every day for the rest of my life to be strong I would do it.

I think everyone need to hear this so Whether or not others might have it worse than you, doesn't mean your own suffering isn't valid. You have a right to feel sad regardless of the struggles of others. And you might feel like you haven't had enough struggles in your own life to warrant feeling like you do, but we can't choose how our brain is feeling. It's not your fault if your brain makes you feel poorly. How you're feeling is perfectly valid.
