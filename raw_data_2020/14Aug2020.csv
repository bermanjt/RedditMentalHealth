1,"My negativity is toxic and I don’t know how to stop.

I’m day 4 post break up. I’m heart broken and hopeless. Covid cases in my state are rising and everyone is scared and stressed. I see my world through shades of blue. “I’m never going to connect with someone again” “dating is over, allow me to jump off a bridge” “covid ripped me away from someone I really cared about”. My negativity is seeping through the walls in my house. I hate this life view. My roommate finally told me today that my pessimism is getting to be too much for her. I hate myself even more now that I know I’m hurting her too. I’m on the antidepressants. I reached out to a therapist for help and I’m waiting to get a call back (with covid it’s taking a while). Other than just staying in my room and keeping my mouth shut I’m at a loss of what to do. Beaches, parks, hiking trails, bars and restaurants are all closed. I exercise several days a week. I don’t eat garbage food. I’m just so fucking sad 😢 I feel so alone AND lonely. Help.",14Aug2020,1

3,"Hi guys!

I’m a woman in my late twenties. I have been in a serious relationship for about 1.5 years now. I have always had insecurities around my own personal worth, value to my partner, and the threat of other women. A few months ago my boyfriend and I had to deal with an incident of me discovering some infidelity behavior. He apologized, I’ve forgiven him, and he’s made a big effort to be truthful and change the way he copes. 

Since then though, my constant need for reassurance and my lack of trust have put a huge strain on the relationship, and it’s making him crazy. He has tried to be supportive in the ways he knows how, but it takes a lot out of him, and recently we agreed I can’t burden him with my insecurities anymore. It’s not his job to heal me, it’s mine. 

I also now HATE other women. I hate what I feel like they did to me (i won’t get into details but long story short some knew I existed and participated in the betrayal anyway). I don’t trust anyone, and even just going about my day is emotionally draining unless I just stay at home and avoid everyone. I see a lot of attractive women often while working and each time I do, it hurts. It’s exhausting. 

He told me recently that if I don’t fix this, he’ll leave me. I’ve done a lot of damage to the relationship already, and the pressure is immense. I hate myself for being so weak. 

TL;DR I’m insecure, my boyfriend betrayed me with the help of some other women, now more insecure, and it’s killing me and my relationship. I need to fix it. I can’t afford therapy right now, but any resources and/or advice would be greatly appreciated!",14Aug2020,1

i just want to be sedated. i just want to not have to feel this way it’s so exhausting. i want them to put me in a coma until the new medication (Lamictal) starts working. i’m 2 years sober and just want to go back to drugs just so i don’t have to feel this way. 

i have no idea what my diagnosis is. in the past i’ve been diagnosed with bipolar 1, bipolar 2, depression, GAD, BPD, ADHD, panic disorder, just about every diagnosis one could have and i don’t trust that most, if any, of them are correct. 

i’ve called hospitals trying to get admitted, but none will take me and i don’t want to say i’m suicidal because i’m not (yet) and i don’t want to be held for longer than i would need to be.

To things and we have group-chats together I always feel like an outsider whenever I’m with them, or after.  They always end up talking about things they did during the week and didn’t invite me to, and conversations from groupchats I’m not in.

She’s also received multiple gifts and baskets during and after her quarantine.  And here I am feeling like if I was in that situation they wouldn’t even notice I wasn’t there.

I remember being a child and being pure. Genuinely connecting with others. I used to love people and all animals and wanted to care for them.

39,"**Introduction:** 

To not make it not too long and complicated, my dad's been in and out of hospitals for the last year. Within a year lots of different medical complications occurred. I believe some of which were him not following the diet and doing almost everything opposite of what was recommended by a doctor. My dad's been extremely stubborn his whole life, so no matter how my family tried to convince him to live healthier, it would simply not change his mindset at all. Throughout a year, he's been through multiple chemotherapies and a huge surgery on liver that took 70% of his liver. His liver eventually grew, but the bile that liver produced wasn't making its way into the stomach and resided in his body. He gets constant fevers and chills even with the bile pipe that drains the bile out of his body. Spending too much time in a hospital without a decent prognosis had its toll on my dad's psychological health. He started saying that he would rather die than live a life like this, which is totally understandable given his complications. Doctor was avoiding telling my dad why he has constant problems, but today me and my mom confronted him and asked what is going on. In private, he told us that my dad has a few months at best to live. In a few hours from now they will try to connect him to a nutrition dropper since he hasn't been eating for a while. If he feels sick after having a nutrition dropper, it means he will have even less time to live. At this stage the doctor said that his liver is completely dysfunctional and can't operate on its own.

This is the quote from the recent study on the subject matter: 

&gt;In conclusion, our results showed that bile leakage after hepatic resection was associated with a high risk for liver failure and surgical death

**Background Info:**

The first concern is of course losing my first and closest relative. The second concern is the depression. To understand the possible impact of the second concern, I will provide a little information about me. My family moved to another country when I was around 17 years old. I was never close with my family, but I had great friends which were there for me until we moved to another country. Not just your typical friends, but those that are ready to die for you and you'd be ready to die for them. My friends were my world growing up. In a new country, I had to go to school which was taught in English. I don't want to say what country it is for various of reasons, but long story short, I had to go to school that was taught in English and outside, obviously, everything was spoken in another foreign language I didn't understand. At that point of my life, I had never spoke English and the language of a country I moved in. I was extremely extroverted, but few years in a new country made me a complete introvert, which isn't a bad thing, but I definitely was depressed for at least 5 years. My parents were extremely negative about me going back to my friends to a country we came from, so I wasn't never allowed to go back for at least 5 years. I was depressed to the point where I wanted to kill myself and cry myself to sleep every single day. As silly as it sounds, I had dreams reuniting with my friends almost every single day in span of 5 years. Everything in a new country was different : people, humor, culture. I couldn't cope and not understanding the language made it worst. 

Fortunately, everything changed gradually after finishing my undergraduate studies and I truly believe whoever reads this and is depressed, YOU CAN DEFINITELY GET OUT OF DEPRESSION BY BELIEVING IN YOURSELF. As I started working out and eating healthy, I definitely noticed improvement in my mindset and the way of thinking. I wanted to live for myself and see what I can become going through the tough times. Today, I might be seen as those gym guys who think they're at the top of the world and who think that they're better than everyone, but in reality it took me years to achieve the mental state I am in right now and that the gym was more for my psychological health rather than physiological. Currently, I think I'm in the healthiest state for the first time in my life. The healthy mental state have been there for at least 3 years right now and I do not want anything to bring me back to a depression blackhole which I barely found my way out of. 

**Concern:** 

With a currently healthy and stable mental health, I'm afraid I will lose my dad and with him my mental state will go away. I'm afraid of what depression from a passing relative might bring. I can definitely see myself right now regretting every single moment I didn't spend with my dad and reflecting on our live together. With today's unfortunate news, I felt a deep sink in my chest. The sink you get from riding a roller coster, but that doesn't go away. It feels like my body is empty and there are no organs but an empty void that you can feel with every muscle of your body. To be completely honest, I am not close with my dad. We have nothing in common and I haven't seen him for the first 10 years of my life, but he has worked had and chose to stuck for us and he is the sole reason I ever went to college and finished my graduate. I became what I am because of him. Since we chose not to tell him about the prognosis to hope for the best and not deteriorate his mindset even further, I can't express my feelings to my dad right now. My dad and I have a relationship where we never talk to each other and stay out of each other's way, so it is extremely hard to express my feeling towards him. I believe expressing my love and admiration will make it so I don't regret not doing it after he's gone, but he will definitely suspect something if I do so and might guess why I did such thing, understanding the reason behind it and what the doctor told us.

I understand that there's somebody who's been in the same position as me and who coped through a loss of a relative. I hope you can give me an advice of what a right thing to do, what is coming and what I should expect emotionally in a long term. Any kind of feedback will be greatly appreciated.

P.S. I apologize for the long text and I hope that nobody will ever have to go through what I am going through right now or any kind of emotional distress for that matter. I understand that my concern might sound a tiny one compared to a depression of other people, but I hope you can understand me. 

I still truly believe with all of my heart that everything will get better. 

One thing is that I am sure I will still believe in a quote below after all that might eventually happen, be it for the better or for the worst.

40,"I’ve been receiving mental health care since I was 11 years old, I’m 22 now. I started because of severe ADHD issues, extreme fidgeting, inability to sit still for more than 5 minutes at a time, etc. I was diagnosed with ADHD, and depression. Many doctors later, and I end up with a woman doctor that was very intimidating, in my perspective, and I just always felt uncomfortable with her. I had her from ages 14-22, I just quit services after not feeling like I was receiving the help I needed. The last 5 years of my life have been very traumatic. I’ve had 2 boyfriends die of suicide, a scarring sexual assault, excessive alcohol/drug tendencies (now sober), the list goes on and on. I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and adhd by my old doctor. Today I got a new doctor, and she diagnosed me with the following:
-ADHD
-PTSD
-Depression mania 
-Anxiety and panic 
-Suicidal ideation 
-Bipolar 1,2,3
-Schizoaffective disorder 

I honestly feel extremely mentally disturbed about this, yet happy that I can actually get the help I need, it’s just a lot to take in at once. She was very professional, polite, made me feel very comfortable, and I felt like I could be completely honest to her without stepping on egg shells, so I did. I’m honestly kind of proud of that but I can’t stop thinking in my head that I’m crazy. 
Has anyone else ever been diagnosed with any of these disorders, and or had 4 medications prescribed at once? How do you manage to get through, and how do you deal with your panic attacks/crying spells? 
I feel so detached from the real world, like a psychotic freak. I just want to know I’m not alone.",14Aug2020,1
41,"Hi, I'm just trying to get some outside advice on this issue I've been dealing with in some form for my whole life (and vent while I'm at it). Like it says in the title my mom suffers from schizophrenia, what little I remember of her before her decline she was a caring mom who was trying her best. When I was six she got into Hasidic Judaism which has since fueled all of her delusions. When I was seven she met an Israeli man through a matchmaker, married him, and we all moved to New York without my father's knowledge, all of which happened over the course of a couple months. I don't want this post to be extremely long but the short of it is my life there was hell, school was eleven hours a day, six days a week of almost nothing but religious studies, there were communal baths with grown men and children of all ages, synagogue, dietary restrictions, extreme racism, I was forced to cut contact with my family, the Sabbath, I will always believe Hasidic Judaism is a cult and I will happily talk more about it if anyone wants to pm me with any questions. Home life was worse, my stepfather constantly abused my mother and I and my mother ignored every issue I had with the religion and forced it on me more when I voiced my discomfort in the hopes of rehabilitating me or something. After dealing with all that and more for eight years I got out and lived with my dad ever since. I'm doing much better overall but my relationship with my mother is something I wrestle with everyday. She's my mother and she's sick and I love her but she still calls me by my Jewish name and pushes the religion on me every chance she gets. On the one hand I want her to respect my desires as a person but she's sick and at this point I've lost hope of that happening. I just don't know what to do, I barely know what I'm even asking for. If anyone has any advice or has dealt with something similar I'd appreciate it.",14Aug2020,1

On Sunday I got really baked and I think I had a panic attack. I felt fear and I knew that my mom was talking to me but at the same time I didn’t know her and I just felt disconnected with the world. It was like I was playing a video game or watching a movie that I was the main character in. I eventually came down from being high but I still couldn’t connect with my body and I felt like my personality changed or my brain broke. For example, I started talking a lot more and my coworker noticed it too. I’ve felt like an alien in my body for the past 4 days.

I feel kind of better now. I know who I am now if that makes sense. I’m going to call the health line tonight and go to the clinic tomorrow.

TW: self-harm, suicide, sexual assault involving minors

I finally thought things were going well for me. I was no longer in a relationship, but I was ok alone. I wasn't being abusive. I could have some fun with friends. But now, I feel myself spiraling again.

&amp;#x200B;

The trauma of being only 16/17 and being groomed by a 28/29 year old man never really goes away. As much as I joke about my experience to people online, as much as I say it doesn't affect me and it wasn't really all that, it honestly fucking was. Joking about it has in turn given my friends permission to joke about it, which in turn makes me feel like shit. It's always a constant reminder for me that I'll never live a normal life or be with anyone normal because I simply can't handle being in a relationship. Never could either.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that my first relationship began when I was 14, almost 15, and it was over the internet with an 18 year old halfway across the world. He was a nice guy, flew all the way here to visit me, but he had his own set of demons. I took advantage of his poor mental state and I very harshly abused him for much of our relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

When things finally ended between us (after being on and off for over a year), I was so broken. This brought about my hospitalization, where the dosage for my meds (which clearly were not working for me) was doubled. The moment I was discharged, everything was so much worse for me, from self harming, to my relationship with my family, to pretending to be nice to my ex just to get under his skin, hurt him again, and threaten suicide over and over. I was extremely fucked.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually quit my meds cold turkey after almost being charged with threats. I found that once I quit, I was better able to control my actions. Still, my ability to manage my emotions was fucked, and I was still extremely suicidal. With not a single friend in my life in or out of school, working was the only thing I enjoyed. My only true form of social interaction.

&amp;#x200B;

It was at my workplace (a restaurant) that I met this man. We can call him Jared. Jared was the grandson of my boss, who came to work for him during his off season (he was a seasonal worker). I found Jared to be extremely funny, despite the fact that his jokes were very inappropriate for a work environment, especially when directed to minors. I didn't really think much of it though. I had a weird sense of humor too, so I figured he was like me. When Jared showed me the slightest bit of attention (asking me how I was doing, talking about our personal lives), I was so extremely happy. It was a person who I could have a chance with.

Initially, I did not know of Jared's age. Hearing that he was recently out of college, I originally assumed his age to be around 22; however, I very soon learned that he was 28 and divorced. In my fucked up state of mind, this barely made a difference to me. I liked his personality and he made me happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day, only a week or two after I had met Jared, my manager asked me to stay a little late after my shift since we were busy. I depended on my uncle for rides at the time, so I said I would need to arranged for someone else to pick me up. Jared was very quick to offer when he heard our conversation. Initially, I said no, that I would have a family member pick me up. But, after giving it some thought for a few minutes, I thought it would be fun to have him drive me home. So I took him up on the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

On the car ride home (we were about 15 minutes away from my house), we discussed a lot. He asked about my past relationships, including questions that were sexual of nature. It didn't even faze me that he was asking these sorts of things. I enjoyed talking to him about it because I felt really happy around this person. When we got near my house, he ended up telling me he lived super nearby, and asked if I wanted to see his house. I said sure!

He pulled up into his driveway and we saw his dog in the window. A minute later he pulled out and drove me home. 

I realized I never got his number! So, being the intellectual I was, I got on my bike and decided to bike to his house the next day, knowing he was at work. I wrote my phone number on a piece of paper and taped it to his door, asking him to add my number.

Around 8:30 pm that night, I get a text and I am happy! He asks me why I didn't wait to come by when he was done work, I said I wasn't allowed to leave the house during the dark and was pretty nervous about hanging out with him. We began texting a whole lot. He was my only non-online friend during this time, he became the person who I would tell all my life updates to, and very very quickly, this man became the sole basis of my existence. I was finally able to replace my ex with someone who lived so close to me, who could (I thought) be there whenever, and who I could have a good relationship with. 

&amp;#x200B;

We hung out a few times before things turned into more than just friends. I was extremely stupid when texting him and messaging him on other social media platforms. I said I wanted to kiss him, to give him top and such. He said not to say it if I didn't mean it. I said I did mean it. I was just super socially anxious.

The few times we hung out as friends consisted of him watching YouTube and me sitting on the couch furthest from him. I didn't ever dare sit near him. I was so nervous.

But then this all changed one day. It was probably my 3rd of 4th time hanging out with him when I began to breakdown in front of him, in his living room, on the couch. I was sobbing uncontrollably about how bad my life has been, how I have no friends and a shitty relationship with my family and how I don't think life is worth living. He got on the couch and gave me a full body hug. It felt nice and allowed me to calm down. However...

Somehow, giving a crying 16 year old a hug while she sobs turned this man on. I felt his hard on against me, and he said ""oops, I'm sorry,"" and proceeded to lay down on the other couch. Very shortly after my little breakdown, we miraculously began discussing things of sexual nature again... I brought up how I never even kissed him before, and how I was pretty nervous, but I assured him that it was legal when he doubted whether it was. (Note: the age of consent is 16 where I live, but exceptions exist when there is power or authority over the minor. Take what happened as you will; I find it strange to call any of this rape since I will always feel as though it was my fault). And so, I convinced him there would be no legal repercussions for doing this with me, and that's where it began. 

I was in no way experience sexually, considering my only relationship had been an online one (and he knew this), so this was all quite awkward to me but I felt as though it was what I wanted. Besides, I gave my consent, I liked this dude and I knew where it was going, and I wanted that. We were kissing, he began to unbuckle my pants, and I froze. I started panicking slightly and told him that I had a lot of scars on my legs and felt uncomfortable with him seeing them, but he shrugged it off and said it didn't matter, continuing with what he was doing. Being a very small person, the experience was painful to say the least... so we ended up stopping and he asked me to give him head and I did. 

I ended up going home not too long afterwards, feeling good but unsure of what to think. I did not like the fact that I just did what I did, but I almost felt like it was good because I was finally getting over my ex (this was 3 months after we had broken up - I was so attached to someone I met on the internet). Jared and I ended up calling when I got home, and I asked the big question - ""What are we now?"". He said he didn't know - ""best friends""

""Best friends?"" I was shocked. I definitely thought we were more than that....

""...Becoming best friends?"" What? I didn't think I would do something like that with someone outside of a relationship....

And so, we decided not to label it initially, which I guess eased the awkwardness surrounding our age gap. In my head, I guess he was just a friend whom I really loved. 

I am only now realizing I've been typing for an hour. I will spare many details about our relationship to narrow it down to the bad...

He started to pressure me into having unprotected sex with him. I would always say no, being so extremely scared of being pregnant, but he would always reassure me - ""just for a second"" or ""I'll pull out."" I didn't know what to do in these situations. He wouldn't take no for an answer, so I went with it? This happened too many times I can't even begin to count... I don't want to remember. But I let it go on for a very long time until-

One night in his car I was extremely mad at him. Not sure why. I started accusing him of being a pedophile and of pressuring me into doing things with him. He laughed at me. I threatened to report him to the police. More laughing. ""Who are they going to believe? Me, with a house and a job, or you, mentally fucked kid with a criminal record?"" I screamed at him for hours in his car, and he was so angry, saying people were gonna hear my crying and think he was abusing me. For some reason, he started saying ""Want a piece of gum?"" over and over again while shoving the package into my hand while I cried, and this was beyond irritating to me. After he did this a few times, I decided to punch him in the face repeatedly as hard as I could. But I was a small person and obviously it did nothing but poke the bear. He couldn't believe I had it in me to hit him. I have no recollection of what happened after (my memory is so damn foggy and with the amount of fights we had... this isn't too much of a highlight in my life), but still, after all this, we were somehow still together as a couple.

&amp;#x200B;

\- My mom knew about our relationship eventually - did not know it was sexual. She was ok with it. Her culture sees nothing wrong with it. Had she known it was sexual, I would have been kicked out, which is why I am so hesitant to file a police report against him. 

\- I was made to lie to his family when I met them and told them I was 18.

\- He got me into smoking weed, which made me more at ease and able to say ""yes"" to him, or I would get so high that I couldn't say yes or no, couldn't even care. 

\- He drove high all the time. He would get mad if I said anything about it. I'm not sure how I haven't died in a car accident. 

\- I have been in therapy for almost the entire duration of our relationship, still am. I rarely ever talk to my therapist about what happened. Not about his age, the pressuring, or how traumatized I have become since the entire experience. I'm too scared. 

\- Whenever I had any doubt about the legitimacy of our relationship, whether it was really okay for me to be dating a 28 year old... he would reassure me by saying that my life would be easy with him. He would take care of me forever, I could move in with him when I turned 18, he would drive me to school and to work, and that he was more of a man compared to anyone I have or will ever date. 

\- He turned 29 before my 17th birthday. I treated him with so much love that day. I loved this man. 

\- On my 17th birthday he got mad at me for going to work (I requested the day off but was scheduled anyway, so I went). We ended up closing the restaurant early due to staffing issues, he ended up convincing my mom to let him pick me up. I was stuck there alone for over an hour, thinking my mom was on her way, just to get a call from him saying he was going to come. Being the anxious fucker I was, I was tearing up because it was just me and my 72 year old boss with a history of being inappropriate (to both adults and minors) left in the restaurant. When he picked me up, he was furious at me for even crying or going into work that day. He was speeding over 30 km over the limit. It could have been so easy for me to kill us both. I was so sick of my life. The entire ride he was calling me ungrateful, immature - ""you're 17 but you act like you're 7,"" ""we could have had a great day today but you ruined it."" Obviously, this made me even more emotionally fucked, and so, I jumped out of his car and ran away, hid at a car wash. This was probably the single worst day of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

All these things that have happened to me... so many times of trying to break up with him and realizing how impossible that would be for me... we still ended up being together as a couple for 9 months. 

I ended things out of nowhere. I don't know how. I quit my job at the restaurant, ignored him for a week, downloaded a pseudo dating app for teens and became interested in someone else very quickly. But stuff most certainly did not stop there for me with him.

I was prescribed Prozac around this time. It made me feel so dull, almost nothing, which was so much better than what I was experiencing before. 

He wanted to be friends, I said ok. He would get touchy, I would get mad. He would get mad that I was mad. I'm a bad friend. I don't put the effort in to make him happy. We would fuck around. I was high a lot. 

Once quarantine hit, I took it as a good excuse not to see him anymore. Said I wasn't allowed to leave the house, Coronavirus haha. He would get mad. There eventually came a point where I made it super clear - I did not want to be in a relationship with him again, at least not until I was done school. He was so upset by this. Even months after we had broken up, he thought we would get back together. And because of this, I tried putting even more distance between us.

This is when I stopped answering texts as much, going days without speaking to him. And this makes him even more mad. He stops showing up to work, telling me he's sick of everything and everyone and doesn't even want to live anymore. He says I was never a good friend to him (despite the fact that I was doing online school during quarantine and he was the only person I ever visited). And so, being the naive person I am, I felt bad. I told him he didn't have to put any effort in anymore. I would do it. Because I was so scared he was going to kill himself, and if he killed himself, what if all our texts were read by his family, or worse, the police? (I openly accused him of being a pedophile over text a few times while I was in a depressive episode). Then, there could be a whole court case, my family would know. My life would be even more fucked. I did care about his life, but I was much, much more terrified about the possibility of all of this getting out if he died. So I started going to his house again, only to of course end of being touched in ways I did not want to be and being told I wasn't a good friend because ""that's what friends do."" Right.

Come June, I stop talking to him completely. My last text was telling him to fuck off, saying I didn't want to deal with him anymore. He still texts me, every day, over and over again, wishing me a good morning, asking me to respond, apologizing for being grumpy. He starts randomly calling me, and of course I don't pick up. At this point, he's literally the biggest joke to me. I take advantage of his poorly written texts and make fun of him with my online friends. 

And then he ends up texting my mom (she didn't know who it was and asked me if it was his number - I said no. She has no clue that he's been harassing me over the phone). After a month of ignoring him, I tell him to stop fucking messaging me, stop calling me, and don't fucking text my mom. He couldn't understand why I was mad which was mind-boggling.... 

He still continues to message me. My friends tell me to block him. I can't, I say, what if he threatens to come by my house? He does exactly that. I'm scared shitless whenever I go outside and see a car like his. What if that's him? Hasn't been, not yet. 

Only about 8 days before today (2020-08-14) after he continued to message and call me... I threatened to file a police report against me if he didn't stop. He was upset, but said he would stop... 4 messages later and he hasn't said anything more. I hope it's over. I know it probably isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I had a date planned with someone who I really like. I thought I was a better person now. Well, the person cancelled on me, saying he was scared and didn't feel good at all, offering to see me next week although this was the 4th time we've had to rescheduled.... I thought I was better now, haven't lashed out at people in so long, but I was so wrong. I got high, had my therapy phone call, lied about how I was feeling, decided to go to the park alone because I couldn't tell my mom my friend had cancelled on me yet again, and I couldn't stop myself from spiraling. I broke down over and over again until I went home. Got high. I blamed him for leading me on, called him a bunch of names and told him to die alone. And then I went to sleep.

I woke up after having an awful dream about this person. And when I woke up, I was panicking. Did I really try to hurt someone like this again? I thought I was better than that now... and so, I began apologizing profusely... message after message attempting to explain the way I was feeling..... for no use. I barely get a reply, and rightfully so. He tells me it's not that what happened wasn't a big deal, that he's used to it since his old relationship has scarred him so bad he isn't even fazed by suicidal threats or verbal abuse. I know what I did is wrong. He says it isn't, but I know I royally fucked up my friendship with the person I would spend my entire days talking to. I guess that's why I'm writing this in the first place. I have no one else to vent to, since I fucked it up with the last person I had. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't expect anyone to even read through this. I guess writing it just gave me something to do while I wait for my family to head to bed, so I can once again get so high I forget what even happened. I didn't think I would get to this point again, but here I am. And as soon as I click post, I know the tears will start falling, but it's whatever. Like this kid kept telling me, there's nothing I can do about it now. I guess.",14Aug2020,1
57,"   Lots of people have had silly fears as kids- Ex: feeling like there are eyes watching you when you go to the bathroom, even when there’s no one there. But when does simple paranoia turn crazy?


 What if that kid didn’t think that there were people watching them, but instead zombies would come out of the walls and attack them. Would that still just be paranoia?


  And how does the fear’s intensity effect it? What if the kid who thought zombies lived in walls just had a sneaking suspicion, and didn’t let it interrupt their business at all, or if the zombie kid felt so strongly they might get their brains eaten, they couldn’t bear to lock the door in case a quick escape was in order.

59,"Hello,

I wanted to put this out there and get some opinions and experiences of others. 

So I've kinda always thought that there has been something ""off"" with me mental health-wise for awhile. I, of recent have realized that I definitely need to talk to someone. And am working toward finding a therapist. 

I just wanted to see if anyone here has experienced some of the things I feel I'm experiencing. I of course know it's not smart to self-diagnose and I'm not asking any of you to diagnose me either. Just looking for advice and opinions. 

Have any of you dealt with things like mood swings? (emotions going from bursts of highs to bursts of lows). Things like 'episodes' of intense concentration and desire to get things done and then having moments of not being motivated to do anything?  Indecision, restlessness (I pace a lot too), and becoming easily distracted is another thing I've been feeling for a while honestly. I also feel myself getting humbled a lot. Which is fine lol, but if I'm honest I think I overestimate myself sometimes. I've always struggled at making ""good friends"" but have always been good at meeting people. I think I'm impulsive and can't commit or am afraid to do so. It could be why I've struggled with serious romantic relationships and struggled to turn people I've met into good friends. My appetite isn't the best either.

On the more serious side of things. My memory, and kind like I said before decision making is I think being affected by the state of my mental health. I'm not suicidal at all. But maybe because of the times, we are living in I do find myself thinking about death more than usual in general.

This kinda turned into me venting. But, I'd like to hear your opinions and your own experiences. 

Appreciate it!",14Aug2020,1
60,"Hi everybody,
I, (24, F) have always been someone who needs lots of sleep to make it through the day. 8 hours is a minimum to function like a normal person.
Now here's my problem. I am someone who worries A LOT and gets anxious quite often (I think it's part of the autism I got recently diagnosed with, but that's another story) 
The Corona-crisis, in combination with a job in the health care sector, makes the worrying and anxiety so much worse. It keeps me up at night, so I sleep around 4 hours per night. Wich is really not enough. I'm exhausted! 

I was wondering, other ""bad sleepers"", how do you cope with this? With being so tired? How do you make it through the Day?

64,"I’ve never before felt depressed or felt any type of lasting anxiety but I’ve reached it at this point. 

I care too much about politics and let it get to me. People are so extreme with either cancel culture, or anti masks, or COVID conspiracy. (I am feeling anxiety from vocal extremists in both parties)

I am feeling depression from work. I am in sales and our goals are higher than they were pre covid despite still being in a pandemic. I am a manager and we are losing money because of lack of sales. It’s getting hard facing my team telling them to push themselves when I’m mentally checked out and knowing we will not hit our goals despite how hard we are working. 

I am a major (probably too major) college football fan and my team will not be playing this season. College football is something that I look forward to every year and as soon as the season is over I’m on message boards and sub Reddit’s discussing next years teams and players to watch. I was really hoping some how the season would happen (and sounds like for some schools it will but not mine) to get my mind off the stresses of this year. 

Finally some joy (but has been raising my anxiety the closer it gets) is my wife is due with our first child in a couple weeks. I am over the moon happy and excited for it but the closer it gets the more stressed I am. Am I ready to really do this? Our money situation is fine but I still always worry if it will be enough, especially with pay down at work due to lack of sales. (mentioned above) 

Since sales are down we are expected to work longer hours and often I won’t get home until 9 and I work weekends. My wife works a regular 9-5 m-f and with all that’s going on I’m really worried my wife and Is alternating schedule will cause us to become distant, and not enough together time with our baby will cause resent. My wife is great and I don’t think it will happen but with my mental state I can’t help but throw that into the equation. 

I am not a big drinker. I only drink when I’m happy or bored. I don’t drink when I feel stressed or anxious it just makes it worse. I don’t drink to cope with problems. So I’m sitting here really just wanting other people going through something similar to tell me what is getting them through all this. 

My mental state has been great up until really august. It kinda all hit me at the same time. Never felt this way before. Usually mentally tough but even people who usually don’t let things get to them can have enough I think.

The problem I'm having is, despite knowing I need to talk to someone, every ounce of my mental energy every day is spent just holding on and putting one foot in front of the other.

I know therapy would help in the long run, but how do I overcome not having the mental energy to make the call or go to the appointment? The idea of doing it is so exhausting and overwhelming. I just can't.",14Aug2020,1
66,"So a year ago I came across a meme telling to breathing manually. It stuck on me for a while and I kind of got frustrated by it but it just went away (I was finishing high school, preparing for university, and basically have many things to distract me from it).

A few months ago, when quarantine starts the thought about that meme about breathing manually randomly came in and I started getting anxious about it. Every single day I tried not to think about it but it ended up getting worse. And sometimes later my mind connects random objects (usually something that sticks out) to this anxious thought. For example: whenever I see a teddy bear, my mind tells me to manually breaths. Sometimes I it doesn't bother me, and sometimes it makes it hard to breath.

I don't take any medications whatsoever and for the whole time I've been keeping it to myself.

I don't have much to do in quarantine to keep me busy and distracted because I left my university for scholarship in another country. We (awardees) were supposed to depart in April but as you know, coronavirus happens so it kind of got delayed for god knows how long.

67,"Hello Reddit -

I’m really questioning our actions right now and would like some reassurance. 

My cousin is 20 and genuinely the nicest most kind and loving person I’ve ever known. A lot of people have passed away and I am the sister/mother figure in his life. 

Last week I got a strange phone call from my cousin. He was speaking rapidly, acting a bit paranoid and with a lot of urgency about making another family member who wronged them accountable. I told them to sleep on it for the night and remember he is loved and I am always here for him.  He later text me saying he was going to get into therapy. I genuinely thought he was probably drunk and figured he is 20 and brushed it off because this was very out of character. 

Fast forward to today. I got a call from his gf who was frantic. She said that she, him, and her mom were going to Costco and today and yesterday he was acting externally weird, but today it was over the top and bizarre. He then got aggressive and did aggressive actions and crazy stuff then collapsed and had a seizure. 

He was rushed to the the hospital who did a full work up and said he was fine. His behavior got even more bizarre so they called for help and we took him to another hospital (I met them there with my husband to help talk him down and get treatment for whatever is going on)

One thing to note he absolutely does not do drugs and never really drinks. His tox screens all came back negative and they couldn’t find anything on his ekg and mri. 

He was having what I can only describe as absolute breaks in reality. One moment normal, next sobbing, next moment was him saying he has super powers, next extreme paranoia- I’ve known him his whole life this is so absolutely uncharacteristic. 

He opened up to my husband and said he hasn’t slept for weeks, that he was hearing voices, and discussed some things that he has been thinking (it is very real to him but they are total dilutions and fixations about violence on certain political people and weird religious ideologies like he can spiritually leave his body and communicate with others) 

At this point we decided to have him places on a mental hold until we can find mood stabilizers or sedate him so he can get sleep, further evaluation etc. the hospital, finding nothing wrong physically was going to just release him. 

He agreed to this willingly we told him there should be no stigma and we do not judge him whatsoever and love him but his behavior is not normal and he really needs help we can’t give him at this time- so though it was “involuntary” he didn’t really know that- he willingly agreed to go. 

Now I’m second guessing myself. Should I have pushed for more tests? This behavior was so so so out of the ordinary - he is an all star athlete, a student, zero medical or mental history. What if we made the wrong choice and he has an undiagnosed stroke? What if he simply needed to go home and finally sleep? What if he gets angry later about this? 

To confuse my decision even more- our extended family gossips - a lot. So when they called to ask what was going on- we simply said he had heat exhaustion and was rehydrating and sleeping- I personally felt this wasn’t my secret to tell anyone- nor did I want him to be shamed or feel embarrassed- I only want him to focus on getting better. Now I think that he is in the hospital without an access to a phone- did I just isolate him from support (these busy bodies would have feigned support but gossiped later- but I’m not absolutely positive of his personal relationship with them- what if I should have told them??)

So I’d like reassurance I did the right thing- or a hard truth I fucked up- if I did I’m accountable and will beg for forgiveness. 

The whole decision was based out of pure love and protectiveness but that won’t matter if I was wrong.  I have no experience with this and have never witnessed anything like this. The doctors seemed dismissive and the psyc people obviously wouldn’t even guess about a diagnosis at this point to us (psychologist did reassure me at the very end he things this is psychological and not physical)

I apologize for the long post today has been such a roller coaster and long.",14Aug2020,1

I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety about 4 years ago, I used to be on antidepressants for about 2 years but my dad lost his job in December and we haven’t had health insurance since. I think it’s only made it worse not having my meds. It’s gotten to the point where my heart, stomach, and head will just ache all day. I’m not eating well, I either pig out or I don’t eat at all. It’s not that I’m not keeping busy, I’m currently working two jobs but I don’t talk to my coworkers like I used to, and I’ll normally cry after I get off work. I’m also having panic attacks more frequently. My friends and I don’t talk as much after everything and honestly I feel like I’m bothering people when I talk about my mental state, especially with everything that’s going on, like no one is doing well. But I do think I need help and it feels like I have no one to go to or to talk to about things. Does anyone know of therapy options for someone in my situation?

75,"Like, yes, I have a lot of issues. Guilt, regret, insecurities, trauma, etc. But every time I'm put infront of someone to talk to, I decide not to say anything. 

I just feel so much shame for things I've done before, and feelings/thoughts I have on a regular basis. I couldn't bare the thought of opening up to someone, just for them to thing ""Damn, you're one pathetic creep""

So many things I wanna run from and things I want gone. So many terrible things that run through my mind. So much second guessing and Insecurity that it makes me feel like I'm gonna explode. 

On top of all that, I'm so fragile. I always have been. When I was I kid, I hated being told no, or not to do something. So I learned to just never ask for or do anything that my parents or people around me might disapprove of, or tell me no to.

And that carries on Into my life today. I don't like the idea of people thinking of me negatively that I just refrain from putting myself in a position where people might think of me as so. I try to stay quiet and not be a burden, I try my best not to be an inconvenience to other people.

I just wish there was a pill I could take that would make all these bad feelings go away, so I don't always have people telling me ""Talk to someone about it"". That's the thing. I feel true shame and guilt. Do you really think I'm going to just tell someone why I feel that way?

I'm so stressed and anxious all the time. Afraid that something bad might happen. 

And, I've opened up before, and every single time I did it only brought me more anguish.",14Aug2020,1
76,"So I don't know why but I am choosing to talk about this now. All my life I've body shamed and bullied for my entire life and it has taken me roughly all my life to accept who I am and find the people who do the same (still struggling with this part). I won't point names or blame anyone for it but I will just talk about how it modelled me. As a child I was said to be hyperactive and very talkative/smart child. While I am still smart, all of the insults and look downs on me hit my self confidence and emotional state really hard, and to a point that I would just avoid what I felt like about anything. This led to another issue, which was me not able to ever make a decision. Not even a simple decision such as if I wanted to choose a place to eat. 
Coming back to me ignoring my feelings, it caused me to just do tasks which were not including other people (work and studies) most of the time... Which has now lead to burnout and to such a state that I cannot work with concentration for a few hours anymore. This has affected me in so many ways, professionally and socially. Yes, I do divulge in controlled substances, but that is not the cause of this issue... Because I've been feeling like this way before consumption of the said substances. 
My family has always been supportive (but they've also been partly abusive,  unknowingly on their behalf). They always try to know what is happening with me. But what do I tell them? I don't know how to define all of this bullshit myself!
I've tried asking a person out twice in my life, and always have been shut down. I understand that I cannot decide who has a thing for me because at the end of the day it is what they feel. But trust me when I say that it hurt me so much that I just don't talk to anyone anymore apart from very superficial small talk. 
But things haven't been all bad I guess. The friends which I have have been with me for a long time now. I have started to play online games which has helped with my decision making and confidence. And I have found a few hobbies which often help me with getting my mind off all the bullshit happening on a daily basis. Also, I've finally gotten the confidence to accept my body and how I do anything to a point that I wouldn't flinch if someone said anything. 
PS. I am not mentioning my name, putting my picture and asking my friend to put it up because I am ashamed of what I look still or anything. It is because I want to fucking avoid those titles like ""victim"" or a ""survivor"". Also, this was written by a 20 yr old male.

They even abuse my dad mentally. Being a girl, I'm treated unfairly by my grandmother and she always favours my brother. Since my brother is favored by her, he also takes her side and tell her fake things about me. I try not to get affected but both of them are robbing me of my mental peace. What do I do?",14Aug2020,1

101,"I am so frustrated. I am struggling so much to function. I can't sleep at night and just want to take naps during the day. It takes me forever to get things done and it's quite difficult to get places on time (for instance, I always arrive about 1/2 an hour+ late to my girlfriend's house). I don't change for weeks and I very rarely wash my clothes. Its been problematic for quite some time but now its progressed to the point where I seldom leave my bed and sometimes even feel like texting/chatting with people is so much work. I don't feel depressed in the way in which it is commonly thought of- I don't feel sad, necessarily. I'm definitely frustrated. It's overwhelming to think of cleaning or unpacking (I moved in almost 6 months ago and havent really unpacked much at all). I look on the internet at jobs but inside I know I couldn't handle them and just looking at listings overwhelms me. I've spoke with several individuals about applying for disability coverage because I can't pay my car insurance for the times I rarely leave my home to go to appointments or to see my partner. Even going to see my girlfriend exhausts me, by the time I'm done with the 40 minute drive to her house I'm already worn out and wanting to nap. I hate being around people I feel afraid of them and also angry towards them for no reason. I'm desperate for answers. What if I'm actually just a lazy person? I'm so frustrated and confused and I don't know what to do. Please offer some advice. I am in the process of psychological testing (I completed the initial testing just need to do the ADHD testing now) but I'm worried. What if it doesn't provide any answers? What if I'm just lazy and useless and a weight on the world? I feel such hate towards myself.",14Aug2020,1

It makes household chores really troubling for me because usually cleaning utensils are designed with ""women in mind"" and therefore must include all sorts of cute imagery on it.

I get lost tripping on such images for a couple minutes and have room for nothing else in my mind. Heat/cold waves rush though my body. Anxiety. An urge to run away. Feelings of impending doom. After I get on my feet again and remove the object from my view, that uneasiness takes a while to go away.

Interesting is that it only happens when I am sober. I use small doses of marijuana (~0.1g) to help transform this ""OH JEEZUS CHRYSLER HELP ME"" into a ""I don't like it"" kind of feeling.

Unfortunately no doctor was able to help me with this issue and I don't even know if it has a scientific name.

109,"My sister has been having terrible night terrors since she was in the 3rd grade. Her recent one was so bad that her girlfriend had to call me (they were in a facetime call sleeping together) and my sister started having a extremely bad panic attack. She's been having these night terrors since she was in the 3rd grade, and apparantly my father and 20 year old brother has the same issues. My sister has confided in me saying that she is close to killing herself because of how bad they are. She says that the only reason she hasn't is because she loves her family and her girlfriend. She cuts herself from these dreams and her recent dream went as followed: She saw her girlfriend get strangled to death by this 7 foot black figure with sunken eyes with very long fingers. Of course she couldn't move but was yelling at it to stop but it didn't care. It then tried to strangle my sister before she work and couldn't breathe and had a bad panic attack. She has taken anger management classes, therapy, all that but she says it never helps her. I don't want to lose my sister I really don't know what to do.

113,"I’ve always been one of those “gifted and talented” people. All the advanced classes and stuff. When I was younger(elementary school) I was easily the smartest person in the room, and since I graduated high school with the same people I went to kindergarten with, it kind of cemented my reputation as the smart-ass with all the answers. And I guess I felt compelled to keep up that perception of me. Don’t get me wrong I was easily top 3, by grades, at any given time, but now I’m in college and although I’m smart(Honors, pre-med, etc) I know I’m not the smartest person in the room, but I still can’t help but feeling like I need to keep up this illusion.

114,"I've been seeing a psychologist for a little while now, and this week we discovered a lot of my mental struggles came from my mum. She got really bad post-natal depression, and really struggled for a long time with dealing with it. She would cry a lot and get really angry for no apparent reason. My psychologist said children are very egocentric, as in ""something is happening, it must be because of me"". Because mum was upset/angry a lot, I thought it was my fault, and when I learnt it was post-natal depression, I blamed myself. She wouldn't have depression if she didn't have me. 
Two of the things she said to me during fits of anger/sadness that have played over in my mind for years are:
1. We were arguing about something, i dont know what, when i was around 4 or 5 years old. I (being the stupid kid I was) yelled ""you don't love me, do you?!"" I remember vividly her face and the anger in her eyes as she screamed ""you're right, I don't love you!"" Now I know thats not true, I'm 23 now and we have a good relationship, but it still plays in my head sometimes
2. I was around 14, had just been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety, and had attempted to commit suicide prior to my diagnosis. I was sitting in the passenger seat of my mums car, and I flipped the sun visor down, it hit me on the head, I felt an irrational surge of anger and hit the visor, which broke the little mirror. When mum and my sister got in the car, I told them I had broken the mirror and apologised. Mum got angry, and yelled ""if you're going to do shit like this, you should've just jumped off the cliff!"" This still plays in my head today.

Mum doesn't remember any of this, as she was obviously in a very dark place herself. She is much better now, on medication and lives a very normal, happy life with my dad. 

My parents have been helping me through my current mental battle, and have stated they want me to be able to talk to them about stuff like this, so they can help me through it. But I feel so awful telling my mum she played a big role in my declining mental health. I feel so guilty that she feels bad for hurting me. I don't want to hurt my mum, even if it means I'll get better.

My whole life, I've tried to only be happy around my family, so they don't feel the stress of having to deal with my problems, but I'm being told now that I need to start letting in the more ""bad"" emotions so I can learn how to properly deal with them. I'm scared and exhausted. But I need to do this, so I can deal with emotions properly, and not put stress on my friends and family because I haven't acknowledged bad emotions before and don't know how to deal with them.

116,"So at the moment, things actually seem to be going OK. As far as I know, nothing negative has happened. She hasn't harmed or had truly negative thoughts, though her paranoia is bad at the moment which I shall explain a little later. Her depression seems to have less of a strangle hold on her right now, which I'm honestly thankful for. So, I would say in general we're actually doing quite good.
OK, now to her paranoia. She has a recurring nightmare, and by recurring I mean every single night and time she falls asleep. It's honestly brutal, and she's become so on edge about for she's scared it can come true (this is because she's had dreams come true before, only simple things, but this one is so vivid she believes it will). Not to go into detail, but the basics of it is kidnapped and tortured brutally.
I've recommended her to talk to a professional, but she's scared of talking to someone whose a stranger to her. We're gradually warming to the idea, but it'll take a little time. We'll get there, I'm not giving up on this.

117,"I haven't slept in 2 days. I'm depressed. My uncle passed away 1 year ago in 2 days and I can't get over that I'm never going to see him and apologize for what I said to him. My girlfriend just left 4 days ago for someone better, she said that I'm a lost cause and maybe she's right. I got fired from my job and I know that I'm the one to blame. I've been depressed for so god damn long that I don't even remember what I've been depressed about in the first place. Like the amount of anxiety and sadness I feel is to much. Like I'm only 17 soon to be 18 and I've been considering suicide for the last year and a half. Like if my teen hood is this bad I can't even imagine how being a adult will be. I've legit failed 5 classes due to how stupid I am, and my anxiety like I am so insecure and scared. I've tried moving to the big city so I can fresh new start for my last year of high-school but I'm to stupid to even get into the school in the city now I have to go back the hell hole that I call my old school. I think when the suicidal thoughts first came in was on my 16th birthday, that was the worst week of my life I think that was the lowest I've ever been. During that week I was failing all my classes, the girl I loved my entire life became pregnant with someone else's child (she is getting married next year) and my aunt died like i was sad and I thought to myself ""you know what? I'll go visit the boys. Being with them always cheers me up"" (they are my life long best friends) so I went to go see them the day before my birthday cause I had nothing planned after crying myself to sleep and when I got there they told me to go away, that they don't want me there. Well they actually said to go fuck myself so I cried and went home and on the day of my birthday I was like ""you know what? I'll forgive them it's my birthday"" and no one said happy birthday to me THAT WAS MY DAY, THE DAY ABOUT ME AND THEY FORGOT. So I grabbed a knife I was about to slit both my wrist but then my phone went off and it was an old friend of who I hadn't seen in years he said happy birthday to me. Then I stopped and told him thank you. Some guy who I haven't seen in years remembered me not my life long homies who say they care about me very much. And after a week of isolating my self and crying, I saw them and they said ""omg we were so worried about you!"" Like come on man if you were actually worried maybe you could've texted or called, like you got my number man. And that was the story of my 16th birthday. And I'm still thinking of killing myself. I hate myself so much. Ive kept these feelings bottled up for so many years that I've lost all feelings for anything. Like ya know that little rush you get when you find out someone likes you? or the way you get all jittery when your about to ask a girl out? I don't feel that or even when you breakup with someone. I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING I truly think I'm dead inside and lost all my emotions and don't care for anything and I hate myself for that. Like I wish I felt something.

118,"Yes, there are those times wherein it feel as if achieving happiness is impossible. However, I want to say that no matter who you are or what your situation may be, you will be able to get the happiness you deserve.

There was a point in my life where even I thought that I wouldn't be happy again. I hated my job, I didn't know where my life was heading, and I got fat because I tried to eat my sadness away. It was so bad that I actually thought about...ending it all.

But what saved me was my girlfriend as she helped me realize what goal I needed to achieve in order to be happy again: I had to return to being the man that she first fell in love with.

It was a very tough road and I nearly gave up as I thought I wouldn't be able to do it. But with a lot of willpower as well as both love and support from my girlfriend, I managed to achieve my goal. Looking back, I can say that I'm glad that I did what I did as me and her have never been happier.

I know not everyone has somebody that will give them the support they need. I also know that different people have different situations and that some have it much harder than others. However, so long as you're willing to work towards that happiness you deserve, you will acquire it. Just don't give up.

I made something to help those who are having trouble when it comes to realizing what their goal towards happiness is, or for those who are having trouble achieving it. I really hope it helps (You don't have to click on it if you don't want to, I just hope that what I've shared has managed to help someone.)

119,"Im so sorry for the long post, but if just one or two people read it and give me advice it would mean to world to me.

I know you guys aren't mental health professionals, but I've been to so many psychiatrists and they all refuse to diagnose me with anything. 

For literally as long as I can remember, I've been mentally and emotionally unstable. Sure I didn't have the best childhood as I was neglected and sexually abused and lived in a very violent and drug/alcohol ridden home, and every psychiatrist I've told about this says that whatever mental health issues I'm experiencing right now are likely  result of my 'traumatic' childhood. 

I don't consider my childhood to have been traumatic at all, and I've never had an issue with the way my parents raised me. They're not perfect people but they always loved me. Even when I was put in foster care and sexually abused I didn't feel any resentment toward them. 

My main issues are being extremely sensitive to others emotions and becoming extremely attached to people prematurely. Growing up, I didn't have a single friend and was socially rejected by literally everyone, which lead to a lot of social anxiety and self hatred that I've sort of overcome in the past few years. 

Last year I moved away from home and finally met a good group of people which was good for a while, but instead of enjoying all my friends company, I latched onto one or two of them and we became really, really close and I started to ignore all our other friends. This also happened in the last few months of high school with a friend group I found - I got too attached to one of them, ignored the rest without meaning to, then they all hated me and eventually so did the one I was close to. This resulted in me being violently suicidal and if act out to get their attention and make them show that they care about me. 

As hard as I try not to be like this, I still am. My best friend left the country for a few months and went home, and he still kind of talks to me but not as much as I wish, and seeing him with his friends at home literally feels like a stab to the chest. 

In the months before he left, I began becoming irrationally scared of losing him and my other close friend, and I did stupid things like tear my entire arm apart with a razor, I'd hide in my room for days at a time even when I was feeling ok(ish) just so they'd get worried and come check on me. 

At the start of this year I sent a semi-subtle goodbye message to our groupchat and swallowed all of my sleeping pills. The fucked up thing is I knew I wouldn't have died, I just wanted to see them scared/worried so I knew they care about me. I fucking hate being like this and I really want to stop because I feel like it's going to drive them away. 

This happened again a few weeks ago. I woke up late in the afternoon in a relatively ok mood and then I realised my housemate (2nd close friend) wasn't home and had gone to his boyfriend's. I checked snapchat and saw that my friend who is in his home country was hanging out with his actual best friend and I just felt completely abandoned. It was the worst feeling and I couldn't deal with it, so I swallowed a lot of sleeping pills and antidepressants. I initially did want to die this time though, but about 30 minutes after, I freaked out and called an  ambulance. I was in the ICU for a few days and when I came out of my coma I video called my best friend, knowing he would freak out as I still had the intubation tube down my throat, a nasogastro tube down my nose and was connected to a bunch of machines. I couldnt even speak to him obviously but I just wanted to see his face expression so I knew he cared. 

After that I was put in an inpatient psychiatric facility for a few days and while I was there, I messaged my friend and told him that most of my self-harm and 'suicide attempts' were just for the attention and explained why, and I told him that I didn't want to be his friend anymore because I am a 'toxic piece of shit'.

On the surface it might seem like I did the right thing, but it was me being manipulative because I knew that he would understand and wouldn't let me just stop being his friend. I took it even further by saying shit like, ""I'm sorry I'm like this, I can't stop it so I'm going to kill myself successfully this time."" BLa bla and ""do you want me to call and say goodbye before I do it"" etc. 

I eventually stopped because he called me and we had a really deep conversation about it all and talking to him kinda put me in a better mental state. The past few weeks have been ok, like I've been studying and sleeping and eating properly, and not being toxic to my friends. But now he barely messages me and is hanging out with his friends back home, which makes me feel irrationally jealous and sad even though I know he still cares about me. 

For example, yesterday was a really good day in terms of my mental and social health. I woke up early in the morning, studied and actually managed to get out of bed and go for a run (ik it doesn't sound like much but that is a really, really big success for me). We talked on Snapchat briefly throughout the day about random shit, I had a good day with my housemate so I felt really good. But later in the afternoon I asked him what he was doing, and he opened my message but didn't respond. This made me feel like he was mad at me and didn't actually care about me, and only ever messaged me because he didn't want to feel like he could've done more if i killed myself. Obviously all of that is irrational and I realise that now, but in the moment it felt like I was right and it was agonising. I cried myself to sleep for the first time in a while, and it was a good thing my housemate had the TV up because I was literally wailing. 

I woke up in the morning feeling shitty but then saw I had a Snapchat from him. I said something like ""i Miss you monkey"" which doesn't seem like much, but it made me so, so fucking happy. Like ridiculously happy. 

Didn't talk to him much for the rest of the day and eventually fell asleep midday and woke up feeling shitty again, and saw on snap that he's with his best friend back home and surprise surprise I feel abandoned. 

What the fuck is wrong with me?
 Why do I keep doing this even though I know it's wrong? 
I love both my best friends to death, and care about them so much, but all that goes out the window when I feel the in-the-moment emotions of being abandoned. I don't want to be like this for the rest of my life, I hate the person that I've become. 

What do I do? I can't afford to go to anymore psychiatrists and psychologists because I'm saving up to get my extremely infected wisdom tooth removed (love being a student). 

Does it sound like any kind of disorder or am I just a fuck up?

120,"I suffer from Bipolar disorder. I grew up in an abusive environment that made me want to ignore it and run away from it and start over. This is how I've lived my life for 25+ years in regards to issues with people being upset with me or vice versa, I didn't know any better.

For the first time however I haven't ran away, I've faced it head on, it was awkward at first but it soon became the way it was again. This was a situation at work and work to me is a permanent situation that I cannot run away from. I care about myself enough to want to move on and be able to afford to live. It's not something I can just run away from, enough was enough.

My trust had been betrayed, we had a big argument on the shop floor.. It's not like me to argue back, but being so tired of always being blamed and framed for everything, I actually defended myself and stood my ground! Fast forward a couple of days and I was able to apologise for shouting, but also still standing my ground and say ""look it was a heated situation, I am sorry for shouting I shouldn't have done that. I hope we can move forward"" This was met with a hug and a sorry from the other person.

NEVER in my life have I had this kind of closure and acceptance for it is what it is.

124,"(Not sure if this subreddit is most efficient to post this question to but we will see)

I’m 22 and truly have no desire to get a job. I went to art school for a bit until I dropped out realizing that it’s a waste of money to go to art school when I’m technically already an artist; I Top of art school being a joke because like any school, it’s all about the grades &amp; deadlines and not actually about the effort. So I am the creative type; not the cubicle type. I had a side job serving birthday parties for 6+ years (on an as needed basis), but that also became a joke to me because I would set up, wait an hour until the kids were ready for pizza &amp; cake, and then serve them cake for 20 minutes and then that was it— useless/pointless waste of time job. I only say it’s a waste of time because my coworkers would be on their phones the whole time and I would get bored which then lead to more anxiety (I have GAD).
Also having my own reselling store online, doing “nothing” at work for hours was painful because I could be using that precious time for my own business.
I also had another job at a dog store and that became too much for me. I did all the work while my coworkers would slack off and be on their phones (see a pattern?) and I was tired of doing all the work. After a while working there, I just couldn’t do it anymore. I was extremely against the whole aspect of breeding dogs for profit (adoption is better), it was a very wasteful store, and the people couldn’t acknowledge the work I do. 
Anyways, since I’ve been ‘unemployed’ (well my resale business counts but it’s passive income), I have spent so much time on my own business and self, that I cannot really see myself working for another business. In the way of I don’t think I can be expected to do so much. Like, I wakeup every morning with a different attitude, mindset, &amp; feeling (as we all do), but sometimes I really can’t ‘snap out of it’ and if I were to be in a bad mood, I would not go to work. Thats happened a few times with all my jobs. It’s almost like I really can’t control it. I’ve struggled with depression &amp; GAD &amp; social anxiety &amp; CPTSD most of my life, so difficulties are nothing new to me. 


*And also being a creative person, my mind is always thinking of new ideas, so thats another reason I can’t keep or get a job. Sometimes I wakeup and want to be a florist, sometimes I wish I was a photographer, sometimes I wish I could just be a ballet teacher, sometimes I just wish I lived on a farm with no worries. My mind is constantly changing and is never the same. If I get a job today in stocking pantries, tomorrow I will not want to do it anymore and be interested in something else.


And that’s why I don’t think I will ever be able to get a job. At least, not for longer then a year. I’m not sure if this is just my indecisiveness mixed with my creative mind not wanting to stay thinking on 1 thing, or if it’s just how I am; a temporary worker.

I live with my parents and I hate living in the suburbs. For someone who hates attention, being looked at, loud noises, distraction, being a HSP &amp; highly anxious, it’s not a place I can thrive in. I want to eventually be able to save up enough money to buy my own plot of land in the middle of nowhere. But I cannot do that if I don’t have a job. IM SO LOST &amp; CONFUSED WHAT TO DO",14Aug2020,1

127,"Everyone in our company who could work from home was made to do so about March time. I loved it at first as the whole department was working well together and we generally happy. I could actually say I enjoyed working for the first time ever really.  Then everyone apart from myself was put on furlough and have only come back last week. 

I found it incredibly stressful at times and was ignored by HR and management for 4 months until a couple of weeks ago when they started discussing us coming back to the office. I tried to explain that productivity is up at home and we are so much happier here. I even said coming in twice a week wouldn't be a bad thing but working at home 3 days at least is best for me. They don't want to have that conversation until we have started our phased return to the office but they said they want us back 5 days in the office. 

Despite the workload and stress during lockdown I have improved a lot about myself but the past week has reversed it all and I just feel at rock bottom again. It takes me just just under an hour to drive to work to do the same thing I can do at home. I feel as if I get paid very little for what I do and want to leave but this is the only job I've had. I want to leave and go somewhere else but I everything seems so hard right now. I don't know what to do anymore, I just don't want to go back to how it was and just the thought of it is making me depressed again. I don't really know where to turn, who to speak with or what to do to help me, I just feel so mentally exhausted thinking about it all now.",14Aug2020,1
128,"Title is a bit confusing, but let me explain. For almost my entire life, I've been infatuated by games like Minecraft and Terraria, then later got into FPS games. These past few weeks/months, I've been burnt out like crazy, and my days go all the same. Wake up at 5 am, play a game and mindlessly surf the internet for an hour before I hop onto my bed and look through Tik Tok for an hour. Then I go on my computer for a while again, eat lunch, spend the rest of the day playing games I don't even enjoy, eat dinner, rinse and repeat. I don't like doing this anymore, I need to change, but I don't know how.

I want to do something productive, but I don't know what. I've figured that I don't want to be living my life like this, I want to do something I enjoy or something that benefits me. The only thing I get out of gaming is minimal enjoyment and lots of rage. I'm not old enough to work a job, so you could figure I'm still pretty young. Many times I've tried to work out, do some hobby, and every time I try I give up. I just want to enjoy myself, have fun, and right now I'm not. Gaming hasn't been working, maybe I'm burnt out and I'll enjoy it again in a few months if I stop now, I know that. What I don't know is what to fill my time with. School starts in a few weeks, so maybe that'll take up most of my days, but I don't know anymore. This pandemic has screwed over a lot of people, but I'm not even sure it's the pandemic.

As weird as it sounds, I'm alright with not going outside for a while. I did that during the summer anyways, didn't go anywhere except the occasional sleepover with friends. I don't think the pandemic changed anything about me or about what I do. I enjoyed writing fantasy stories for a time, but it's been a while since I did that and I don't even have an incentive to do it. My attention span has been widdled down slowly but surely, and now I can't even focus on the smallest things. Even when I go through Tik Tok, if a video is over 30 seconds I just go past it.

I want to also say that I've had little to none mental health issues in the past. I've always dreaded going to school since a young age, I think most people did. I made excuses not to go and cried in my dads car everytime he drove me. One time I even yelled out that I wanted to kill myself, but I'm sure that was just little old me trying not to go to school and taking it to the extreme, not realizing how severe what I said was. Nothing came out of that, I've never harmed myself, other than when I rage. From whenever I got into gaming, I always bit my arm out of rage. Nothing more than habit, I'm pretty sure.",14Aug2020,1

Lately I've been feeling sad at times and I don't even think there's a reason behind it? 

I'm 26, have been in a relationship with my partner for 9 years (and whilst we're solid atm it hasn't been without it's issues, I live with my parents (currently at my partner's parents due to my parent's house getting flooded and needing to be renovated and repaired) - although we are house hunting and have enough for a deposit for a mortgage so it's not really an issue, currently employed full time in a job I like and dislike.

I did consider if I should goto university and study nursing but part of me is really hesitant to do that as I don't feel smart enough for it and I don't know if we could cope financially as we plan on moving out also 


I don't know why I feel sad at times considering my life doesn't seem that bad? Like, I sometimes feel a bit lost on whether I should do something more with my life, as I sometimes feel like I'm just coasting through life? I tend to just feel like sometimes I need to cry - although I've never been a big cryer and I absolutely hate crying Infront of people so I don't really talk about how I feel because when I do I normally tend to cry - like when I get really angry and ""let it out"" I cry. I don't know why I'm like this and I don't even know what to do about it. 

I can't really go to counseling because whilst we have money it's for a deposit for a mortgage so I don't want to dip into that - and I like in the UK so the NHS waiting lists are long especially for mental health related issues. I also don't really want to rely on drugs because I don't feel that's fixing the issue, it seems like it's just trading it for a dependent.

I am a straight, adult female. Happily married for 10 years. 

Whenever I hear stories about paedophiles being arrested or similar, I feel guilt and fear. I feel scared that somehow I’m going to end up getting caught for something like this and sent to jail, even although I know that I have never done anything like this in my life and I absolutely never would.

I do wonder if this fear comes from this being the most abhorrent thing I could imagine. I suffer from anxiety and depression and had an abusive childhood, although it was never sexually abused as a child. 

I just don’t know why I keep feeling this guilt when I know I’ve got absolutely nothing to feel guilty for.

But like right now I can’t even watch a movie. If I were to watch a movie I can’t follow anything I’m not into it and I just feel spaced out.


Is this dissociation or depersonalization ? 

Only time I seem to tap out of it it when I MD shrooms and then I felt a shit ton of negative emotions rush back to me and I felt back into reality.

I even had dreams of my therapist and I eloping somewhere to be together. All my feelings are getting mixed up. I want to be his friend, I want to be his lover, I want to be his patient. I know it's probably just the fear of saying goodbye that's messing my emotions up, and that what I really want is to continue seeing this therapist that understands me so well. I'm scared.

153,"A lot of this might turn into a huge vent, but it's what I need to do right now, and I don't expect a bunch of people to read the whole thing. 

So, I'm a 36 year woman who was raised by some pretty messed up people. My dad was an abusive narcissist, battling his own demons, he took it out on his three daughters in blatant physical and emotional abuses, such as slapping, choking, yelling, brainwashing, control, etc. My mom, also battling her own demons, totally checked out and let it all happen. I can't ever decide which was worse? She has had major depressive episodes her whole life. My dad would blame her unhappiness on us. 

I'm a parent now. I have two teenagers, around the same age that I was when I really started acting out in response to all this treatment. The more I think about my own children and how much I love them, the lengths I would go to in order to protect them, what I would sacrifice for them.....the more I realize what utter pieces of shit my parents were. 

The way this all surfaced in me as a teen was that I just abused myself more than they abused me. I become extremely self destructive. Anything that would destroy me, I welcomed and ENJOYED. For example, I put myself in situations where I would get raped. And I got raped, multiple times. But in my head at the time, I was having FUN. I drank, abused my body, cut myself, did recreational drugs, dropped out of school, tried to overdose on drugs, ran away from home for a few months and lived on the streets with horrible people who took advantage of me and hurt me, basically anything I could do to just utterly and totally destroy anything good in me, so I could just become BAD. 

The common theme from adults who knew me while I was still in school (like teachers), was that I was ruining all my potential and they were sad about that. But no one ever stepped in and helped.

I left home at 16 and another family basically adopted me, but they had their own set of problems. 

I hit 18 and joined the military. But, ended up getting kicked out for doing cocaine. I became pregnant and got married, had two children. I continued to drink and be self destructive after they were born, just in a more subtle way. Anytime I felt bad I would drink, so I never really felt the emotional surges at all....they just got tucked down. Of course, this meant I was not a good mother to my kids when they were little, because I was dealing with my own problems (just like my own mother). 

Eventually though, thankfully, I was strong enough to realize that. When my kids were about 7, I stopped drinking as a coping mechanism completely. A couple days later I started having massive panic attacks. Never having had one before, I basically thought I was dying. They got so bad, I honestly couldn't tell if I was alive or dead anymore. I would have one, then try to catch myself, but have another ten minutes later. They just came in waves and waves and waves. This went on for months. 

Meanwhile, physically I was also a wreck. I developed a horrible immune disorder called ulcerative colitis, which basically means you uncontrollably shit blood because your large intestine is destroying itself. So I've got the two things going on at once and I'm struggling. This goes on for about five years, me struggling with the mental and physical effects, until eventually I end up in the hospital almost dying multiple times from blood loss, a pulmonary embolism, and whatever else. I was hospitalized for about 6 months altogether while my body repaired itself. 

It was a massive wake up call. After I was healthy enough, I started intensive therapy and got on some very good medication for the immune disorder. I have been in remission for about 6 years! Still haven't drank any alcohol since then. 😀. I got an excellent job, I started achieving goals, I have become the mother I wanted for myself,  bought a house, have a good marriage. Things are GOOD! However, I still struggle with some residual anxieties. 

For example, I can't get over how my parents were such horrible people. I know I need to accept it. I want to accept it. The last time I confronted my dad was maybe 5 years ago? He told me none of that ever happed.....I will never get an apology from them. I need to let it go. 

So, how do I process it and move on? Some nights....memories of the situations I put myself in when I was a child literally haunt me and make me feel horrible about myself. Like I'm that bad person again and don't deserve my happiness now. And then I blame my parents, because they should have been caring for me...not letting me roam the streets and hurt myself. They should have been protecting me from getting hurt by others. I was a little girl.

I know this all logically, but still the feelings come out randomly in panic attacks here and there. Social anxieties like not being able to enjoy attention on me, being unable to public speak in professional situations, not feeling good about my achievements, not feeling like I really belong anywhere, having panic attacks while driving sometimes, having a major tendency to be pessimistic and negative, increased sensitivity to EVERYTHING, and a whole bunch of other stuff. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for. Advice? I will be finding another therapist soon because I just moved across the country for my job. I would like to work through my traumas. I think my goal is to just find a way to get them out of me or live with them harmoniously? It's like they are rattling around in there like demons, hindering me from being the person I am supposed to be.

My husband and I went through a very difficult time last year and I don't think I want to get into all the details of that on here, but we worked through it and we got into a really great place in our relationship afterward. We had never been so open and honest or loving with each other as we had been after this and things were great for months.


But suddenly, on the 4th of July, everything changed. His place of employment shut down for a few months during the pandemic and at this point, he had been back only a couple weeks. He had to stay the night at a friend/coworker's house because he was asked to work late and we live a distance from his work and it was safer than him driving. After this... He started sitting in his car after work and not coming in for hours, just listening to music and smoking. When he would come in he would say he is just going to bed. He stopped asking me to come outside and smoke with him, which is what we normally did when he got home. He spends most of his time when he isnt working with his buddies. Our sex life has gotten... weird. He started getting frustrated with me very easily. He doesn't want my affection.

Then came the really crappy stuff. Apparently, he loves me, but he's not *in love* with me. He told me he doesn't know if he wants to be with me anymore because he is unhappy with life and everything and he just doesn't want to deal with it. He says he feels angry and frustrated all the time. He got in trouble at work because he pulled a door off its hinges. He got angry and was yelling at his coworkers. 

The thing is... This isn't him. I know my husband and something is going on. He tells me he doesn't know what or what started it or even any specific things he is unhappy with. He will say things like he doesn't think he wants to be with me, but then does things that show the exact opposite. He has mood swings. The aggression and frustration isn't normal for him. He says things like he isnt sure if he may kill himself or not. He won't get help and he tells me to just wait and try to coast it out and see what happens... he gets angry if i try to talk to him about it. I tell him I want to help him and ask how i can and he tells me I cant and maybe its a phase.

 I'm worried about him and the whole vibe of our relationship is causing me to stress out and I can't handle it. I cry on and off all day and I am in a constant state of anxiety. I don't know what to do to help him and I have no idea what is going on.",14Aug2020,1
157,"I was laid off from my job two weeks ago.

This was my second job ever after leaving school. I was there for two years.

When I first started the environment was nice and the people were kind, I had high hopes that I would remain there forever.

But then cracks started to appear. Friends drifted away and became cold, or were bullied by management into leaving. One of my friends even had what I can only describe as a nervous breakdown and became suicidal because of one of the managers. Promises were broken repeatedly, training was non-existent, management was toxic, office politics and gossip was rife - and the worst part was I kept coming back for more because I honestly thought I was being treated well.

I got furloughed at the end of March, then called into a meeting towards the end of July. They sang my praises about how talented I was and how I was ""part of the family"" but they would have to let me go due to a loss of suppliers. I didn't believe it for one minute. I took control and told them that it was fine, that I would be fine, and I wished them all the best. At the time, to be honest, I was happy to be going. I'm still pleased that I was made redundant and no longer have to go back to that awful situation with those awful people.

But it's been over two weeks, and I feel empty. Well, when I say that I mean I fluctuate between extreme motivation and extreme crushing sadness. I haven't started looking for another job yet because honestly: I don't want to subject myself to more of the same shit.

Every so often I'll see a post from a former work colleague about how well they're doing, or one of them will message me with fake well wishes (actually just trying to extract some gossip), or I'll just see something that reminds me of that place and I just can't help but feel depressed.

If that job was so harmful for me, and the people were so bad for me, then how come I'm grieving? Surely I should be over it by now.",14Aug2020,1

159,"I know some may not consider ADHD as something that should be in this category, and I understand that. The whole reason why I’m posting here is because my ADHD is affecting my anxiety and my depression. 

A couple days ago I got into a “fight” with my mom because I can’t hold a job well. I had called in quite a bit in the past two weeks for many reasons, all valid to not go in. I told my mom and she got really upset and said I need to grow up. I know that she says this stuff because she loves me but i sent her a text saying sorry and she replied with what’s going on with her. I read it and responded with what’s going on with me and how I can’t mentally be as hard of a worker or responsible as an adult because of ADHD+ other things. She hasn’t responded to me since then. 

I’m at work today and I just have no energy to do anything, but I don’t just want to try and go home. My emotions have been all jumbled because of my brain, so I can go from Mad to angry to upset to sad in 3 minutes. I just don’t know what to do but I needed this off my chest.

161,"So, recently given the very turbulent times with Covid-19, and being at home for 6 months, my mental health has been less than spectacular. I’ve been dealing with depression, anxiety ( panic attacks, derealization, depersonalization (scary things)), and OCD with some really disturbing obsessions. I’ve been to therapy and found that he was telling me things that I already knew for the most part, so I found it to be a waist of time and money because I could work through my issues myself. I know it’s good for a TON of people and props to you all for finding something that works, but it isn’t for me. I also feel like I waisted my time going to a psychologist, because I was prescribed Fluoxetine (Prozac) and stayed on the same dose for 2 years without making any changes. The medicine really helped. It brought me back out of myself, and I really thrived. It gave me the clarity, strength, and motivation to help myself and find peace, and happiness. I felt like the old me again. It was really great. It helped me find my passions, talents, and purpose again. 
Now, this was not just the medication remember. It simply gave me what I needed to find these things again.
So, I have been hospitalized twice before because of my issues in the past. These were both due to deep deep depressions triggered by family members passing. I have a hard time processing and dealing with that. This time though, nobody has died. I’ve just been sitting idle for far too long (I’m sure there’s a ton of you in the same boat), and I think it would be beneficial for my mental health to get back on the medication. Ive been on Prozac once before and it helped. I’ve been off that since 2018. I was also on Zoloft before this and i hated it! It made me foggy, And I gained 100 lbs (!!). So, that’s the background.

So, I’m 17 (m) and I live in the Kansas City MO, which is a pretty conservative place and I live in a very conservative household that believes in just pushing through the tough times, and doesn’t really believe in mental health issues. So, my hospitalizations, and me being on medication is really hard for my parents to understand. They hated it to be exact. Don’t get me wrong! They love me to pieces and I love them to pieces, but they just don’t get it. My current mental health issue started in May, and I was told by my mom (who just got angry about it) to try more natural remedies like Saint Johns Wort, magnesium, 5htp, vitamin b, and vitamin d. Which I was hopeful about because I read a lot of positives on all of these online. But none of them have made a noticeable difference. If anything, it’s getting worse. So, I don’t know how to go about asking for help, because I need relief and I don’t want my parents to get mad. But at the same time, I know that I need help and deserve it. I just don’t know how to go about it. And I’m ready to get back to life. Thoughts?",14Aug2020,1

164,"\[United Kingdom\] Hello. My partner \[22F\] has been diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression, Bulimia &amp; Borderline Personality Disorder. She has suicidal thoughts daily and has tried to commit suicide multiple times throughout her life, including twice in the past 30 days, which I found her crying in the shower while attempting to cut her wrists and tried to hang herself but thankfully the rope wasn't strong enough and it snapped.

She has been in contact with multiple agencies/organisations/services/charities/etc regarding her issues and it seems that nobody seems to care nor will help her, they just pass her around and refer her to a different team and the cycle continues. She has been constantly told by these places that someone will call her weekly to check up on her or call her on given dates. They never call back or check on her which results in us having to chase them up to find answers. 

Some places won't touch/help her due to her multiple diagnosis which makes it even harder to find support and help. The places she is in contact with are:

* Doctor/GP
* Steps to wellbeing
* CAMHS
* April house - Bulimia
* Priory - BPD
* College Keep - Psychiatric nurse

I understand you may not be aware of some of these services as they are local to where i live in the UK. The only thing that these services have offered are either medication (antidepressant &amp; something to boost serotonin) or for her to be admitted to a local psychiatric ward. No other support has been offered, my partner doesn't want to take medication or be admitted to the psychiatric ward. 

I understand this post is a bit frantic and very personalised but can someone, anyone out there offer any guidance on what to do? I'm afraid one day i will get a phone call saying my partner has killed herself. Please please please can anyone help us.",14Aug2020,1

My house (alongside a lot of the other ground floor flats on my street) was flooded with ankle deep water and I couldn't open my front door. I had to climb out of my window after grabbing a bag of essential clothes and putting both my cats in a pet carrier. The experience was extremely traumatic, and my family are acting like I should just get over it. I have dissociative anxiety disorder and severe depression, and I have done since I was 13 years old (another story for another time).

169,"Lately, I've been feeling depressed...well, the last few months actually. It went from stress to slight depression, to being crippled by thoughts of death, and now? Well, I just don't even feel like I'm here, right now. I feel so foggy that I question if I forgot smoking weed or not because I feel so disconnected from everything, like I'm high and waiting to fall back down to sobriety but it's just not happening- not sad but it's not pleasant. 

Anyways, I really don't want to go to my primary doctor- she's an absolute monster. She diagnosed me a year or two ago (when I felt fine) with severe anxiety because I answered one question on a survey about how much I trusted people as a ""2 out of 3"" and the fact that I told her I smoked weed every other weekend or so. To which, she then went on a whole rant about how I'm addicted to weed and using it to cope with my anxiety, using it before I go out into public so I can talk to people (which isn't true at all, I'd smoke some and play Red Dead 2, relaxing night), etc. Then, accused me of only telling her because I wanted a green card and she's not going to prescribe it to me because of my ""anxiety"", but she will put me on Prozac. I just- ugh. 

I found her credentials to be a nurse practitioner in ""family medicine"" but every single one of her 30 reviews were the same horror story of going to her and her being rude, misdiagnosing people, being impatient and mocking the disabled, and being extremely pill pushy. So, needless to say, I will be switching primaries but I haven't gotten there yet. 

After that experience, I really just want to find a place that's understanding, that actually listens instead of interrupting you to tell you, ""this is what you're thinking, this is how you're feeling, and this will fix it"". I really want maybe a specialist that I know will be accurate about it and can get me something based on many symptoms and not just roll with one, I guess.

170," I would like to start out by saying my parents are partially just mad I got a tattoo. My parents get mad EVERY time I get a new tattoo. They are very much on the you can't get a job, that's trashy, etc. side of the spectrum. This is obviously stupid because I have my BS, I have a management position in the medical field, I'm in grad school and on track to work with the CDC. I'm also 24... which I feel like is plenty old enough to decide what I want to do with my body. 

 My parents have ALWAYS taught me to hide your mental health status, your struggles, etc. My parents handled my sexual abuse legally and with therapy etc. like they were supposed to, but I remember having it drilled into my head to never let ANYONE know it had happened to me because they would judge me. My parents told me to hide my suicide attempt, they didn't even tell my grandma because it was ""embarrassing"". My sister got in trouble for telling one of her friends I tried to kill myself even though I didn't even care/ try to hide it. When I was mandated to go to therapy after the attempt my dad told me that if I was bipolar or anything that I would never be able to get a job because all of my employers would be informed (which I obviously know now isn't true, but at 14 I believed it). I struggled really heavily with an eating disorder from 19-presentish (in recovery).

 I got a tattoo on an area I would frequently body check (the back of my ribs) when my ED was really bad. It is a suicide awareness/ personal growth tattoo because I got it for the 10 year anniversary of my attempt. I literally got it because at 14 I did not think I would be alive for another 10 years, let alone actually enjoying life and doing well. 

 I posted it on social media and very openly told my story and my parents found out. They were saying how my business is my own personal business, don't understand why the whole world needs to know, I'm just looking for attention. I said in the stuff I posted that I was shocked to still be alive, how I wanted to get the tattoo for myself but share my story to show that even if you're the stereotypical idea of 'successful' you can still come from or even still be in a very dark place.

I’ve thought about committing suicide many times in my life, but it’s always felt like an intrusive thought, I’ve never actually wanted to go through with it (other than one time when I backed out of the situation before it got too irreversible). 
Now something seems to be different and I feel like I’m being ripped apart.
I am so tired of battling anxiety and depression, I never feel like I’m enough, and I know that people only interact with me because I initiate it. No one truly cares. I want to be in control of something - anything - even if it’s how my life ends. I see intense visions of me killing myself from my own perspective, and they started off scary but now I feel nothing. Sometimes they even bring me a little hope as I can imagine the relief I’d feel.
However, I know that it would be an inconvenience to my family. A lot of my siblings have mental health issues too as well as my mum, and I’m sure it would impact them negatively. I don’t know what I’d do if they hurt themselves in my name. I feel like they wouldn’t be sad, but more angry at me. I truly don’t believe that any of them actually care about me, but I still don’t want to hurt them.
The few friends I have would be sad for a few days and then forget about me, so I don’t have to worry so much about their reaction.
I worry about what would happen to me after my suicide/attempt. If it succeeds, what will I experience? Will I go to hell? Be reincarnated as something else? Or just experience a big black void? What if I fail, and I end up as a vegetable, or in an institution surrounded by pity and judgement?

182,"I am in a long distance relationship. Due to corona, we barely ever got to see each other and as a result, we have spent very little time together in person. I truly love my boyfriend but my jealousy and insecurities make it incredibly hard for me to trust him. It’s starting to become an issue.

Just to clarify: I don’t really burden my boyfriend with my fears because I know that it would be very unfair to him. Sometimes I have minor slip ups like most partners do (like asking an annoying question) but nothing that could be considered out of line. I don’t think that he knows to what extend I sometimes suffer on the inside and to be quite frank I don’t want to tell him because he would definitely think i’m crazy. 

So I guess this post is more about my mental health and not wanting to sabotage my relationship.

There is no reason for me to worry about my boyfriend cheating or being interested in other women... still, i have this little voice inside my head telling me that i can never be sure. It just feels reckless to trust someone I barely spent any time with in person. Some people are married or spend every waking second with each other and will still get screwed over by their partner for no good reason at all. In my past relationships, I just judged my boyfriends‘ characters based off their actions rather than their words. I made sure I could trust them just by being observant and not dismissing any red flags. Most of the time this was enough for me to keep my sane. 

The problem is that i have no way of judging my long distance boyfriend based off his actions. I can only take his word for it. Sometimes, the fear of being betrayed keeps me awake at night and I obsess over it to the point I start feeling physically sick. I’ve become so paranoid that I have reoccurring nightmares of him cheating on me/ leaving me/ ridiculing me. Whenever I see posts on reddit about someone in a relationship being screwed over i think „oh god, I will be next“. When these fears take over, I feel this crazy need to finally find out who he really is - It makes me want to catfish him, snoop on his phone... All kind of awful things I am afraid to say out loud. I would never stoop this low but I also can’t find a way out by myself. Nothing seems to give me peace of mind. 

I know I must sound like a horrible and insane person. You might understand why I feel like I can never tell anyone about this. Especially my boyfriend. 

In case you want to suggest therapy, I already considered it but it’s impossible at the time. I’m still studying and in my country there is a rule that requires people who get therapy to put this on their record so to say when they apply for a permanent job position in the field i’m getting a qualification for. I will lose certain benefits and might potentially not get hired. I could only consider this after I got a permanent position in that field. 

Do any of you have any kind of advice for me? How did you learn to trust people? How can you live with the fear of potentially getting your heart broken? How do you overcome insecurities, jealousy, and paranoia? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you so much for reading.",14Aug2020,1

187,"*The length of the list of my mental health issues is astronomical. School and the internet ruined me. Corona gave me the fucking rest. I am the definition of dead inside now. The only thing that would excite me right now would be sky diving, I think. My father would buy me that lol.*

*How did this happen ? I was a normal child, apart from minor daddy issues &amp; trauma (that everyone more or less goes trough) , I should've been fine! I should be living the life right now, with friends. Parties. Boyfriends. Hobbies, passions, vitality...*

*That's not how it went.* 

*Combine social anxiety super-hyper-self consciousness (these go hand in hand) and the mindset ""everthing happens to me, I don't have to do shit"" in middle/high school (which stems from a childhood where literally everything was handed to me, life just unfolded itself) and you get... an apathetic, pathetic neet with no real personality (my personality is dry sarcasm and cynisicm) or sense of self. Or the sense of actually living (I have to pinch myself to notice). In the past 6 months I slowly but surely lost my sense of normal and so much more. I lost myself.*

\*\*\* Pain \*\*\*

*Despite never having have had a boyfriend, I now know what it would feel like to break up with one; upon realizing how I wasted all my life on the internet and that I cannot socialize properly anymore - I broke up with my hope for the future. I broke up with the idea of ever finding friends again, since I am too far gone. I broke up with my old self, I killed it, accidentally. (My old self sucked too...)* 

 *My head &amp; heart hurt so fucking badly for 2 weeks, I constantly felt nauseous, couldn't eat shit. My mother (who obviously doesn't know me) thought I broke up with some boy, actually, because that's literally how it feels. But this was \*far\* worse. (I cannot open up to her, because it would shock her to death. She prays a lot for me.)*

*This is why I am numb, the pain of being me is literally, fucking unbearable. Despite having food, clothes, money... but that shit is not what matters in life. Without people in your life, life becomes worthless. (Although I too sometimes think, is other people REALLY the only thing that makes life worth living? It sure seems that way. I just didn't \*know\*.)*

*Especially the knowledge that I \*could\* have been entirely normal and the only thing that ruined it all for me is my hyper-sensetivity to being uncomfortable. My passivity. Those reasons are fucking retarded. I get the impression that I am now retarded, too, in a way. How am I supposed to ever access my feelings again, if these are the circumstances?*

 *I told all this my therapist and she asked me 5x times whether or not I wanted to kill myself, in the end I said yes just so that she would leave me alone. (I mean I do think about it, but those thoughts don't feel like real thoughts, or like my thoughts. ) Fucked up, I know, but don't care anymore. Apathy guys.*

*\*\*\* Suicide? \*\*\**

*In general, I actually think there is nothing wrong with wanting to end it all. Life literally has no higher purpose, we all are just the universe exploring itself for the sake of doing it. Quoting spiritual videos here, but I like these views. God is constantly creating the most horrendous and beautiful lives. To him, which is us, everything is perfect.* 

*Look at this dude:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST9vj2PAScY*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST9vj2PAScY) *He makes me feel nothing,because I can't, but it makes me think: Man, even this dude has friends and interests. He has a girlfriend.* 

*I feel like his outsideness represents my inner state. (Writing this gave me a hinch of stomach pain.)*

*Furthermore I think:  I don't want to come to this earth again. And that suicide is nearly impossible as well. (HOW DID HE SURVIVE?). I think we will all experience his life, though. Inevitably. For sure. And Jesus' life. The life of the handsome boy who bullied me. The life of the popular jock. The life of your grandma. Even the life of a mushroom, we will all experience it. / Are experiencing it currently anyway. All is one and shit.*

*This stuff calms me down. It makes me take me life less serious. I will get to live beautiful lives as well.* 

*\*\*\* What do I do now, though??? \*\*\** 

*Currently I am in my 12th year of high school.  I survived week one, although it was mostly just floating by, skipping some classes, hiding in the toilet, not really realizing I was there anyway. I avoid everyone because I can barely keep a conversation, I don't even know what it funny/right/wrong or weird anymore. I mean I ""know"" (this is a very very subtle feeeling which feels like nothing at all), but I don't feel it. Major fucking difference to before all this pandemic stuff. I feel dead. It's like my entire life hasn't actually happened, or the past 5 months - they passed me by in seconds. It's highly disturbing, except that it isn't to me. I have so much trouble making my therapist understand this. No one even notices, which is telling.*

*I know that drinking water, exercise and getting sun light won't fix this, I tried those lool. Those are DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeEEEP deep psychological issues and complex as fuck coping-mechanisms designed to keep me going. And they do. But it's twisted...*

 *Hypno-therapy, maybe? Mushrooms (would they make me dissociate even more, though?) I should probably quit school right now. People make me paranoid. What if someone actually asks me ""What do you do?"" (nothing) or ""Have you ever had alcohol?"" (No) etc.*

I find myself to be unable focus on tasks, regardless of what they be. I can start out in a course perfectly fine, but as soon as it gets tough or a slip up once, I go into doomsday mode and shut down. I've been suffering from my own anxiety and depression throughout all of this. I'm currently studying computer science, but the more and more I try to get myself to work on the stuff I think I love, I find myself getting distracted by anything and everything that isn't my goal. I can't tell if my interests in computer science has waned to the point of atrophying, since every time I try to start up again, I feel like I need to learn from the beginning.

I guess my true passion or hobby is gaming. I love games and had originally gone to school for game programming, but life, anxiety, and depression had my drop from that. I play games to distract from life and just become immersed. Whether it be gentle adventures or an insanely difficult platformer, I love them all. I've thought about the idea of getting into game journalism to write about them, but with my family dynamic right now, I know they won't support me and think I'm just using it as an excuse to play games. I've thought about just getting some sort of job and starting up a youtube channel and a twitch channel on the side to slowly grow overtime, but anytime I try to start, I keep thinking about my family and how much they want me so succeed at getting my degree.

Being around someone with this disorder is EXTERMELY irritating. The best way I can describe it is 'control freak' to the maximum, constantly knowing what's best for her and eveyone around her, not willing to admit fault, and an obsession with 'doing things right'. The number of times I've heard ''You should..."" come out of her mouth towards myself and others is brutal. 

She has an unhealthy obsession with income taxes and correctly filing them, often bringing up the subject with strangers no time near filing season and telling them what to do... telling people what to do is her forte. Any worker or contractor she hires gets helicopter level supervision to make sure they are doing things to her standards... standards that are based on her thoughts and not any actual research or education. I have my own personality disorder (BPD) and I've recently learned that having a parent with a personality disorder increases a child's risk of also developing a personality disorder... it makes sense.

204,"Growing up, I was always afraid of conflict. It made me anxious, stressed, and was something I avoided as much as possible.

One of the reasons why I hated it so much was my personality. In general, I’m a non-confrontational person. I’d much rather keep things to myself rather than “rock the boat” in a relationship by bringing up an issue.

Another reason was the intense and frequent conflicts I experienced in my family. Having traditional Korean parents as a kid in the U.S. was not easy. There were a lot of hurdles we had to overcome even at the most basic level of communication.

I’m not fluent in Korean. My parents are not fluent in English. This has led to lots of misunderstandings due to the language barriers.

Here’s a quick example. In Korean, a direct translation of the word *seki* (새끼) is “offspring”. Parents often use this word as a term of endearment with their children by calling them *nea seki* (내 새끼) or “my offspring.” However, *seki* can also be used as a cuss word such as *gae seki* (개 새끼) which means “son of a b\*tch"". As you can tell, these two phrases are similar but convey two very different meanings. Unfortunately, this was something that may or may not have been misinterpreted by non-native Korean speakers such as myself or my brother.

But the conflict didn’t just just stop with the misunderstanding. The language barrier exacerbated the situation further because we couldn’t understand one another fully which compounded the pain. It was difficult to get closure because we didn’t know where the other person was coming from.

But perhaps the most significant factors to my fear of conflict were my collectivistic values. There are two that come to mind that that I’d like to explore today: Prioritizing the community and filial piety.

&gt;Disclaimer: I want to be very clear. I don’t believe cultural values are inherently moral. In other words, they are neither good or bad. There are many great aspects to collectivism. But it is possible that these values can become harmful and detrimental as it manifests in people or in society. Read the [difference between collectivism vs. individualism](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-individualism-and-collectivism) for a quick primer if you haven’t already.

## Value #1: Prioritizing the Community

One of the primary core values in collectivism is to place the community over yourself. This is one of the reasons why being self-sacrificial is so highly admired. It perfectly demonstrates the willingness to place the group above yourself.

One of the ways I acted on this core value is by keeping my burdens to myself. There was a lot of pain I chose to keep inside because I didn’t want to burden others with my problems. In my head, I was doing something honorable because I was sacrificing myself on behalf of my family and friend. But what ended up happening was that I ended up being lonely.

It was hard for me to connect with people because I wasn’t vulnerable with others. Nobody asked me how I was doing because on the outside it looked like everything was “fine.” It also never occured to me to ask for help even though I desperately wanted to talk to someone because I didn’t want to burden them.

Another consequence of bottling up my emotions is that I would lash out in passive aggressive ways. For example with my parents, rather than telling them that I hated it when they put food on my plate especially when I was full, I would put the food back. This was something that probably confused and hurt my parents. To them, they were sharing food out of love. By putting the food back, I was rejecting it.

Other examples include intentionally disobeying them out of spite but never telling them why and getting mad at little things they did and completely shutting down after.

Although these are small examples, thousands of them can build up significant [Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-heem-publication-and) and lead to relational death.

## Value #2: Filial Piety

Filial Piety means to be good to your parents and being obedient to them. It even extends to behaving well in public so that it reflects well on your parent’s reputation.

There are several layers to Filial Piety to explore. But for now, I wanted to touch on the aspect that extols obedience and submission to parents.

First of all, I readily admit that there were many times when I should’ve been more obedient to my parents. I should’ve taken their advice on being more patient when driving. I should’ve taken their advice to study more in High School. I should’ve been more disciplined in learning Korean.

But there were times when I should’ve confronted my parents but Filial Piety made it hard. I was too scared to bring anything up because I didn’t want to disrespect them. I was scared that they may get offended and overreact.

Filial Piety also created an enormous [power differential](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/power-differential-why-it-matters-so-much-in-therapy-1009154#:~:text=The%20power%20differential%20is%20the,the%20core%20of%20ethical%20awareness.) which was overwhelming at times. As the youngest in the family, I felt like it was impossible for my voice to be heard. This was especially difficult in moments that crossed into physical or emotional abuse.

Ultimately, avoiding conflict had the opposite effect than what I had intended. I thought it would bring us closer together, but instead we grew further apart. It created a wall between me and my parents. I became entrenched in bitterness and built huge [Emotional Debt that I needed to pay down](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-pay-down-emotional-debt) in order for us to repair the relationship.

## Conclusion

There are many facets to collectivism that made conflict difficult for me, especially within the context of my family. But what I ended up realizing is that avoiding conflict was passively sucking the life out of my relationships.

I thought I was doing the right thing by keeping things to myself. My intention was to preserve the relational intimacy by avoiding conflict. But what I was I was really doing was kicking the can further down the road which would then snowball into something bigger.

Eventually, I discovered that there is actually a lot of freedom and empowerment in conflict. We’ll explore this topic more in-depth next week.

220,"I’ve been posting here kind of too much lately. Backstory is that I have had weird symptoms like hallucinations, sleepwalking, deluded thinking, and very aggressive, violent, uncharacteristic behaviour, I think I deleted my original post saying that the last time I tried to get blood drawn, I had a panic attack lasting three whole hours, ending in uncontrollable, bloodcurdling screaming, piss, and struggling to get out of the chair to the point not even two people could hold me down, and the getting no blood whatsoever. They never even got the needle in me. I was formally banned from the clinic and told I may not come back to ANY clinic unless medicated for anxiety.

Then I posted this (https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/i833jb/xanax_did_nothing/) in the anxiety sub about how I took Xanax as a test medication and it did absolutely nothing.

I decided to get a new perscription at a MUCH higher dose, a full bar (two milligrams of Xanax). They gave me two bars and told me one would likely knock me on my ass, but I could take a second one after an hour passed if I still felt I needed more, but then I would need a ride home and maybe even a wheelchair. I arranged as such.

I have never, ever taken Xanax or any other benzo before in my entire life. There is no way I can have a tolerance.

My WORST NIGHTMARE, absolutely worst catastrophised scenario was that the Xanax would not reduce my anxiety at all and would instead just make me too physically weak to resist. I had nightmares all night about it last night. I knew that likely wouldn’t happen, especially on 4 entire milligrams of it, since I’m extremely small (5’3, roughly 100 pounds) and 2 milligrams is enough to make an average person stoned as hell.

I followed these directions before going back into the blood lab today. Felt nothing at all on the one bar. Took the second an hour later and felt nothing except dizziness, some double vision, foggy thinking, and being unsteady in my feet. Absolutely no reduction of anxiety whatsoever. Went in for blood test and all hell broke loose, worse than last time. Two hours passed once again of pure arguments (I was unable to fully articulate my speaking due to the Xanax fogging my brain) and terror. At some point I was in their faces growling like an animal because they wouldn’t let go of my wrist. They eventually agreed to have three trained, uniformed security guards hold me, one from the back, one holding my legs, and one holding my hands. I have a phobia of police officers so this made things 100000x worse. I made that very clear with them but they did not let go and continued despite my extreme struggling.

But maybe that was the right decision because they did it, they got enough blood, (though they told me they’d be taking it from a vein in my hand but they took it from my... upper wrist?!? with no warning) but I screamed WORSE than the first time, probably 6 or 7 bloodcurdling screams worse than anything you’d hear in a horror movie, I apparently continued screaming long after they took the needle out but I didn’t even notice that, and (TMI WARNING) THOROUGHLY pissed my pants (last time was just a bit) and as soon as the needle was out I began hurling profanities and threatening, highly offensive words (think that scene in the exorcist when Reagan is saying “your mother sucks cocks in Hell! And “I don’t want to see you again until I’m shitting on your corpse!”. I was absolutely covered in blood, the amount of struggling must have made it spray all over my arm, clothes, the phlebotomists coat, etc. Security was already there so there was not much they could do about my freakshow except escort me out by my arms whilst I was still screaming into their ears, swearing, in very wet pants and kicking/banging any surface I could. I believe I even bit one’s arm through my mask I kept trying to take my mask off and spit, so one of them had to hold my hands behind my head. Mind you this was walking through a whole hospital to the exit, WHILE on a dose of Xanax that would knock out a strongman. By that point I shut up but my ride home was not pleased at the condition of their passenger (I put my jacket under me, I didn’t get blood or piss in their car) and I tipped them IMMENSELY. Potentially even enough to cover the price of disinfecting the car.

Mortal of the story is that Xanax doesn’t work on me. But at least they got enough of my blood! And hopefully I will have answers soon of what the hell is wrong with me. This behaviour is not typical of me at all, I have NEVER had a needle phobia on the past, nor have I had ANYTHING push me to the point of this level of panic. EVER. And I know we needed the blood to figure out what was wrong. So hopefully I have answers soon and won’t act like this anymore!",14Aug2020,1

223,"First time posting on this section...I had no idea which “flair” to use. 
I’m 26F with BPD.I don’t have any family, so I guess that’s out of my control. But I also don’t have any friends. The older I’ve gotten the more I’ve kind of, I don’t know what the right wording is, become a loner? Started off when I was pregnant, my “friends” showed their true colours I became the joke and everyone ditched me, but I made new friends at college so that was cool but then I was in an abusive relationship, part of the abuse was him gaslighting me, part of that was manipulating me into thinking I was a bad mom for having any friends and leaving my kid in daycare to get an education, after I was safe from that relationship my mental health was baaaaad, I was suffering from from trauma, severe depression and paranoia etc I remember I just used to pack a bag and take my kids and go on a train and stay places that were really far away just to feel a little safer, then a few years later I got into a new relationship,(with a narcissist no other, cos I really do pick em), I kinda forced myself to do it because I didn’t want to end up how I am now, I tried to socialise a little with people I’d known from the past but then I found out the guy I was with cheated on me and one of the girls sent me all the messages etc over social media and I was so humiliated I came off all social media platforms so no way to reconnect with people I had known in the last  ....anyway a combination of those things and just general up and down moods, sometimes very high levels of anxiety and zero self esteem or trust in anyone has left me completely isolated. I mean if I’m having a hyper manic episode I’ll talk to anyone and everyone but not “make friends” and I’m pretty sure all the people round here think I’m on drugs or something n cos I’m...”different” Everytime anyone sees me. I often go a week or so without leaving the house. The only person I talk to now is my kids, only adult I speak to often is my ex who is the narc and boy does he stress and upset me no end but otherwise honestly if it weren’t for them I’d go MONTHS without talking to anyone. I’ve joined social groups online where they often meet up in person but I never actually talk to anyone on there or  attend the meet-ups so I guess that’s pretty pointless. I’m really fat and ugly and my face just looks miserable even when I smile so I don’t blame people for not wanting to approach me and tbh I probably wouldn’t speak to anyone anyway as I really have nothing to say...no hobbies, no job, I’m just kinda boring and miserable, ha. I mean I don’t even know what the point in posting this was I guess just wondering if anyone was or is the same and how to get out of it?",14Aug2020,1
224,"Some background: I have bipolar disorder and some kind of anxiety disorder. On top of mania and depression, my bipolar includes bouts of paranoia and mild auditory hallucinations during psychosis. I've also had weird OCD-like symptoms before, but they were rare in the past.

My compulsive symptoms and paranoia have been about if I locked the front door and pulling on the door a few times to check if its shut all the way, checking if the stove is on, etc. I just *have to* do these things to calm down at least a little bit. And about 6 years ago I had the symptom of snapping my fingers until it feels ""okay"" to stop, but mostly it's been about checking things. My mom also recently told me that she compulsively counts when anyone is pouring a drink.

These compulsions and paranoid thoughts have gotten slowly worse during this year. It all started as when I lock the front door, I have to pull on it a few times to check if it's closed all the way. I also have to walk back to my car to check that I really locked it, sometimes I do this twice. These are more like habits now, but I can't go without doing these things because otherwise I get anxious and paranoid.

I was just house sitting at my parents for about a week while they were on vacation and I was terrified each night, so damn paranoid, kept constantly checking the front door, checking the yard, looking out the window, I was afraid of the dark and listened to every creak and sound intensely. I used to be this way to some degree when I was a teen and when I wasn't on medication for my bipolar yet. I'm still taking it as prescribed to this day so I don't know what's going on. I had to take an anxiety medication almost every night so I would calm down and be able to go to sleep. I was also incredibly lonely before my parents came back from their vacation, even though I usually thrive from being alone. I'm now back at my apartment and I'm honestly pretty sad and anxious about the thought of being alone. Covid-19 has definitely made me feel more lonely, anxious and isolated. Now that I'm in a few more social situations and in public places, I feel much more anxious than I was last year. My mental health is basically going backwards to the same state I was when I was 16.

We also had to put down our oldest family dog while they were still on their trip w/ the dogs, so I'm going through some major grief and it's also making my anxiety worse. I don't really know what to make of my compulsions and paranoia at the moment, it just makes me anxious and I hope it doesn't become permanent. I also don't know if this is just a part of my anxiety disorder or bipolar disorder. I'll have to ask my therapist and doctor about it sometime soon. My mom also recently told me that she compulsively counts when anyone is pouring a drink, she is also bipolar and has an anxiety disorder.

225,"So I've been on 6 different antidepressants now. Sertraline, citalopram, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, fluoxetine, and now duloxetine for 2 months. None of them work me for. I have anxiety and depression. 

The doctor told me that I am at the max dose at 60mg?! I thought it was 120? He said I can carry on with it or go back to one of the old ones which obviously don't help me. 

It seems very few doctors are interested in mental health and only two have ever referred me to the mental health team so that they can suggest to try a different medication. What happened to desvenlafaxine, paroxetine, bupropion, fluvoxamine, escitalopram, just to name a few?

I have inaudible voices in my head that I can legit have conversations with. I'm not sure if its my conscience or what. But when I get really down I get the voice, in the form of thoughts, speaking to me to do negative things. And I can mentally ask the voices and stuff various things, and they'll reply with a reason to do the negative things. Is this normal? Please reply someone.

If having a specific sexual preference puts you in a separate category then why on earth is the mentally ill grouped with “normal” or non categorized people.

I feel like my whole life someone has held my hand and taken me along the railroad path I was supposed to take, and now they have suddenly left, and after searching for the rest of the railroad I realized it's gone too, and hasn't brought me to any sort of destination. I feel one hand very overwhelmed and like I have no idea what I'm doing, and on the other hand like everything is alarmingly simple and I question if there shouldn't be more to life. And I'm so sad that I'll never be a kid again, that no one is going to take care of me again. Like this isn't something I have to do for five years and then I can go live with my parents again, this is forever. My partner loves me but he can't treat me like a child and take over all my responsibilities for me when I am tired of them. I like my job and my colleagues fine but after just a couple of months I already feel kinda tired of this whole 'job' thing and just want to go back to being free every day. But then I realize I'm supposed to do the 'job thing' for the next 45 years or so (if not this specific job then still A job) and it just feels like forever and hopeless. I suppose that I imagined that when I had a job I could do all kinds of fun things, but partially because of the pandemic I'm just stuck at home more that usual. I'm one into two weeks of summer vacation but it just seems pointless and if I'm not enjoying myself now then when will I? 


I really hope I just have to get used to this and then I'll be fine. In practice it's not very different from going to school every day, but I feel like at least there was always a next test and a next course and a next year, you know?

234,"I’m confused. 

The past few months I have been experiencing a very graphic recurring dream, almost every night. The scenery, the dialogue,— all of that is the same every time. The only thing that changes is the person in focus. 
In the dream, one of my close friends either dies or kills themselves. The dream cycles through about three different people each time, then it repeats the next night. 
Lately, it’s been getting a lot more vivid and grim. The last week or so I’ve been waking up in tears, feeling super groggy and clammy and I can’t shake it off.
I don’t personally believe in spiritual stuff, but it’s been repeating for so long I’m starting to get paranoid. 
I’ve struggled with depression and suicidal ideation for years, and I’ve attempted more than once.
I know that it’s sick, but I’m pretty apathetic when I think about taking my own life, it’s appealing. 

But the thought of a close friend ending their life scares the fuck out of me. 
My s/o has been struggling with these things too, and I know that he has been suicidal recently and I’m putting all of my time and energy to take care of him and give him the support and reassurance that he needs, because he does the same for me. I love him so fucking much. I can’t lose him.
- The dream is about him more than half the time, and like I said previously, it’s getting so much more vivid and it’s starting to effect how I function. 

I don’t know what to do.

Looking for advice/ clarity Hi everybody. Sorry for long post. I hope this post is appropriate for this sub, I am not sure where else to turn. 

I am not sure if I have developed anorexia. 
I have always been thin naturally and until a few years ago I never thought twice about what I ate. 

Then a few years ago I was violently attacked and sexually assaulted on a night out drinking. 
In the weeks after I lost a ton of weight as I couldn’t eat from the shock and guilt. At the time I disliked loosing weight but couldn’t help it. Then when I started putting weight back on I started feeling really bad and I only felt ok when I was exercising and went days without eating. This was never actually about the weight but more about feeling better with that hunger pain in me to keep flashbacks etc away. Anyway over time I put weight back on and started being normal weight. However since that my whole life has been about food. I didn’t diet for years but would binge eat every single night. I am talking 2000 calories every night after my normal meals earlier in the day. 

Anyways to present day. I have earlier been diagnosed with ptsd and 6 months ago I had a relaps from that and well basically had a nervous breakdown and still I am not functioning/ working after that. 
When I first had the relaps I lost some kg unintentionally to the point where my gp asked if I was anorexic. 
But then it just carried on and I cannot stop obsessing over calories . I feel sick to my stomach when I put on a little bit of weight. I can go weeks on 300 calories but when I try to eat normal again I completely loose control and eat enourmous amounts of food and then gain weight. When this happenes it is not just food I loose control over but it feels like I am loosing control over my entire life. House becomes a mess, my mood swings like crazy and I feel like I am on a downwards spiral. As soon as I manage to control again I feel a compulsion to loose the weight again and starve my self and excercise to the extreme. 

Weather I am eating nothing or a lot I am always thinking of food. 

I am underweight on the scale but I feel that I look fat on some days and starved on others and this keeps giving me panick attacks. Some days I struggle to even have a shower. 

However it doesn’t feel like it’s about the weight more about control and distracting my mind as when I am starved I feel more in control of myself and have fewer flashbacks. 

My gp keeps asking if I need help for anorexia but I am scared to talk to him because I am afraid I will be diagnosed with something I don’t have. 

I almost feel suicidal on days when I have lost control but I don’t feel like it’s about the weight
I am so confused because I’m some ways I know I have a problem with food etc but on the other hand I feel like it might just be a coping mechanism especially since I’m some days I can see that I do look thin. 

 I really just want to be able to eat breakfast lunch and dinner without loosing control but I seem to not being able to do that.

Is there someone here who have similar confusion or would know anything about it? 

Any advice would be really appreciated.",14Aug2020,1

It's getting to a point now where I'm beating myself up about it. I feel depressed, I don't know how to talk to him, I've opened that door and instigated that chat and he hasn't resipocared. My mum stuck up for me, he was mad with her too at first but now I'm the only enemy and I feel excluded. Im not very confrontational, I can't just go downstairs and be in the same room if he's ignoring me, I feel uncomfortable and I don't want to say anything at risk of starting an argument bc Ill feel like shit and he will berate me

The school did nothing about the bullying and I would always get in trouble when I stood up for myself.

I came back from the abroad like 4 days ago, was there to work in the financial purposes, physicaly (it's a common thing in europe). It was a first job like that for me, quite hard and challenging, becouse I was spending most of my time in front of monitor before this work. So I came back and started to feel really weak in my arms, legs too. It was kinda obvious, at least for my father and my gf s mother that I just overloaded my muscles and other shit, u know how it goes. The weakness in arms, especially in the left one was a serious problem till this day, now they are pretty fine. My legs are also getting better. Now, to the point. Whole this time I was really scared, like insanely about it, I was almost sure that I will end up on a wheelchair becouse of some serious disease of the nervous system. It was a pure paranoia. Today also, becouse my paranoia, I forced my mother to take me to the hospital. The doctor said everything seems fine by some tests etc. Anyways - I'm still freaking out. I cant eat, and becouse of that my muscles cant regenerate so quickly. Today I started to feel face numbness (at least from my perspective). Idk anymore, Im really done, becouse Ive done more harm to myself than I should, Im supposed to be relaxing and chilling, but Im just sitting on my bed (11pm local time) and having a paranoia about the some very rare disease.

254,"In 2015 I had my first ever depressive episode. For weeks I refused to eat or do anything. I had just turned 18 and my girlfriend cheated on me (I’ll spare you the details) long story short, she cheated and continued to cheat for a year and a half. I had a very hard time trusting anyone since. When I was 19 I became very depressed and locked myself in my university room for weeks. It must have been about 2 weeks before I saw the light of day or had any contact with a human being. 

I started to talk to people inside of my head. Four different personalities. Each had names. There was Kyle a dark shady character who had a taste for ruining people’s day, Steve who was a nervous, shy character, ace who was the funny, crazy and annoying character and finally Russel the smart, academic character. Each of these. Jars tees would have full conversations with each other inside of my head. I would often find myself saying conversations out loud and banging my head on the walls. When I ran out of food, I took to eating soy sauce granules of salt to keep my going. I was incredibly malnourished and one night I did something I’d never forget. I cut myself, and wrote names of people whom I didn’t like on my Calendar with my own blood. I then took the calendar and set it on fire in the sink. Fortunately the smoke alarm didn’t go off. But then I realised that I was crazy and started seeking help. It took a lot to tell my counsellor what had happened. He spoke with more professionals about this and they decided that this did not sound like psychosis, but more like autism. I tested negative for autism when I was about 10. 

Each day the characters still think out scenarios in my head. I am relatively happy now, taking medication etc. But I still have the characters talk to me, I still have major trust issues and I dwell on things every night and have really vivid dreams. If anyone could tell me what this sounds like. I would be very grateful.",14Aug2020,1

256,"It all started 6 months ago. 

there was someone harassing/bullying people through account/s. Not sure if it was just one person or multiple as apparently it was like 5 different accounts. It was blamed on me, not sure why as when I mean I don't know these people and their situations I really mean that. 

I'll go over the things I've been blamed for, for perspective. 

the account over a year ago dmed someone that I didn't even know existed a year ago, telling  something about his then gf that left her child. This was linked to me as I knew the father of that child, I didn't know the situation or her though.

the account dmed a bartender that I also don't know informing her of her boyfriend + manager and her co worker + best friend that they used to casually hookup. This was linked to me as I used to work there for a year. I didn't know of the bartender though.

5 months ago the account dmed some guy making fun of suicide and his mums death or something, don't know why this was linked to me as i don;t know this person or that his mother was dead.

the account dmed some girl that i don't know being really mean to her calling her names and laughing at her. I don't know why this would be linked to me also.

As well as some other things that no one would tell me about. I don't understand why this had to be all tossed on me. I don't know if it's actually some person close to these people blaming it on me as it's convenient or what. Or maybe blaming this on me because I'm foreign and stereo- typically foreigner's are 'crazy' and 'weird'.

It's been 6 months and still people are talking about me, calling me all sorts of things, I got rid of my social media as I really had enough but still it hasn't stopped. I know that no matter what I say it'll be blamed on me as I can see that these people are adamant of it being me. Now in my town I'm labelled as some freak that has nothing better to do than to stalk these people, making fun of them, or make fun of awful things like suicide. It's really frustrating as it's not me, how am I even suppose to go anywhere anymore. I barely got out the house since then, ghosted my friends too.

I was also sexually abused 6 months ago, I only told a few friends that did believe it BUT it somehow got out so on top of everything I'm also being called a liar that cried wolf.

My life has been nothing but pain since 2020. Reading what these people have to say about me, (which btw ITS ALOT OF PEOPLE)  it slowly makes me believe that I am a horrible person even though I didn't do anything wrong. Sometimes I just feel like killing myself just to prove to these people that it's not me, cause if I'm dead and this person is still doing this then it clearly wouldn't be me if I'm dead.

Any advice would be highly appreciated.",14Aug2020,1

258,"My grandma died recently, I’m not sure what to do besides cry and watch the videos of the funeral. My Bf’s friends love hanging out frequently and have been understanding, but even after a week I don’t really feel ok. We got invited to a friend’s house to swim and play games. I don’t want to go. I don’t want feel insecure and explain why I look sad and not laughing at jokes or participating in conversation. I’m not really sure what to do. I told my bf he could go, it makes me unsettled when I’m not with him, but I don’t want to be a villain he looked so unhappy when I said i didn’t want to go and confused since I’d wanted us to hang some where else since we always hung out at my bf’s garage. I feel like something’s wrong with me. Is it weird I don’t want to be around other people? Ever since I moved from Texas to Cali it’s been weird like that. I’ve always been insecure and self-deprecating/hating, i don’t like the body I’m in, and being around other people intensifies those feeling so much more. I just want to minimize the amount I feel bad. I lost the friendship I had in Texas and don’t really have anyone I can just text right away if I feel bad. I’m not really sure if I’m not just typing to the void, but doing this helps if not a just a little.",14Aug2020,1

267,"I’m an artist with a long run-in with depersonalization/derealization. Since like high school when I had a couple bad years of bullying until now, I learned that the best thing to do for me was to disconnect completely from my identity to keep myself safe. And so I’ve lived 6 years of my life this way, taking the backseat and only making moves when other people tell me to. Now that I’m seeing a therapist and really starting to ask myself questions about my life I’m beginning to face the fact that I live passively 24/7.

The idea of having a “self” scares me. The idea that I’m a person with an identity and not just an amorphous blob destined to do everything for other people only when I need to, it feels so alien and unreal to me now. 

I want to take control of my life, and my body, and start living the way that everyone else around me seems to be, making amazing artwork, networking, getting big on youtube, making great things that they want to make only because of themselves. I don’t see that motivation in myself, and I don’t know how I can get there. I feel like I’ve lost that drive, and now I have to fight to get it back. I don’t know where to even start.

Has anyone else here felt this way? How can you escape from the endless pit of complacency and apathy for your own self and identity? How did you reform your persona? 

Thanks, I really appreciate the help.",14Aug2020,1
268,"I just don’t know what to do and needed somewhere to vent about my mental health/what I’m dealing with at the moment. 

Basically I was put on short term disability and taken off of work for 3 months due to my mental health. I am diagnosed bipolar w/ non psychotic episodes, panic/anxiety disorder and depression. I have trouble functioning day to day but my anxiety and panic disorder make it almost impossible to say no/ my drive to people please due to this causes me to go into a mania of “functioning” and agreeing to do things I just cannot handle. I end up burning out and hitting a low/have a full on episode because of this and I am just tired.

I come from a family that doesn’t recognize mental illness even when diagnosed by professionals/ being hospitalized for it. My therapist recently told me during a session that I need to start getting comfortable with the the fact that I may not be able to function “normally” or work, and may be permanently disabled due to my mental illness. This has caused additional stress and has added to me not being able to say no when people ask me to do things for them/come to different functions (ex: socially distant birthday party with less than 4 people)

I don’t know how to come to terms with the fact that I might be permanently disabled due to my mental illness/set boundaries in place that others and myself recognize and respect. I know and feel like me not working would put a huge burden on my fiancé who works full time already. I am also young and disability is very hard for me to get when under 30-35 years old I have reached out to several disability lawyers and they wouldn’t even take my case until I was 30.",14Aug2020,1

271,"Hey, first time posting here and just looking for some advice/ perspectives by the lovely people of this sub. 

For most of my adult life, I 26(M) have felt this lack of fear of death. It’s not that I wanna die, it’s more that I often think that, were I to find out that I don’t have much time to live, this wouldn’t bother me too much. 

While I have a history of bouts of extreme sadness with suicidal ideations (never been diagnosed with depression), my “normal” state is one where I don’t feel very strongly about living or dying. I have a pretty decent life and am working towards achieving my goals, but even the things that bring me joy in the present or make me hopeful for the future aren’t enough to make me go “This is absolutely worth sticking around for”. While I have spent much time in my life trying to find that feeling/hobby/career or person who could give me this sensation of “I wanna stay for this”, I haven’t found it and have been contemplating whether living an “alright” existence is enough. Maybe I’ve been conditioned to expect a life that is exciting and meaningful. Or maybe I’m really just depressed and lying to myself about doing ok? 

It also doesn’t help that, when I have brought this up to friends and family in the past, the responses I’ve gotten have been pretty divided, with some telling me I was obviously unhappy and depressed and others thinking this was normal. I’ve also gotten therapy in the past, which helped with some past issues but never really got me rid of this feeling. So I wanted to hear from anyone whose ever experienced this. Did you ever grow out of this “apathy”? Did you ever get treatment or did you find that feeling of meaning/purpose/joy on your own? 

Would be really great to hear some thoughts! Bye y’all",14Aug2020,1
272,I’m 29 and male and I’ve recently had my baby girl and she is my entire world. I have never been happier in my life or in my marriage but one thing I feel is holding me back. I’m absolutely terrified of the idea of death. I can’t imagine a world without the people I love the most and when they die they are simply gone and that’s it the world keeps moving and all we have are memories now. And then when I am gone I’m struggling with the fact that life will just go on for everyone else and what happens to me? I’m not religious I have a hard time wrapping my head around it and pushing the I believe button on the afterlife when all I can think of that happens is that I just cease to exist for eternity. I know this is a common problem and I’m sure I’m not the only one but I was looking for some advice if anyone else has grappled with this after a major life event.
