0,"Tl;dr: pointless ramble don't read

I've cut off 99% of the people I was friends with, I haven't seen anyone that isn't my mother or my therapists in more than a year, I only talk to two people who live on the other side of the globe.

Everyone in my family is worried and they say I should go out, but I don't want to.

I'm okay with not leaving the house for months straight, I have a job that allows me to work from my room.

I used to have a girlfriend and many friends, but then my she broke up with me and kind of validated my negative thoughts towards people. Ever since then I haven't been able to trust anyone and I purposely cut off people who try to get close to me because I know that they only want to use me and hurt me.

I'm deathly afraid of all social interactions and if I could I wouldn't leave my room for the rest of my life; nobody can hurt me here, nobody can manipulate me and nobody can shatter my heart in here, I have food, water, video games, and a job that I enjoy doing every day. I have no reason to connect to people when I know that any and all relationships I get into crumbles to the ground shortly after.

I've self harmed a lot in the past months, as a form of punishment for being so repulsive in the inside and the outside.

I've been on sertraline and alprazolam for the past 6 months and they've been helping me deal with episodes of strong panic and near psychosis, before the meds I would self harm every night when the screams inside my head became too much and the void inside my chest would burn unbearably. The sharp sting helps me ground myself and to distract myself from the pain inside.

I've started having fantasies of severely hurting people and I often see images if mangled bodies in my head which is another reason why I decided to isolate myself.

My greatest fear at the moment is that at some point I won't be scared of hurting people anymore and that the demon inside me will come out and actually physically harm somebody.

Sometimes I can feel it, I imagine myself in these situations where I hurt someone and I feel good about it, just out of pure spite for the human kind.

If I had a quick and painless way to off myself I would do it, I would have done it years ago infact, but all I have is plastic bags and improvised ropes, which never worked, I only managed to become briefly unconscious once before my body automatically woke up and ""saved"" me.

They say it gets better but you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel if you ripped your eyes out.

Sometimes I have delusions of me being some sort of demon, or the physical form of hatred and suffering, to help me cope with my feelings; it gives me purpose, to know that I was sent by someone or something to spread death and famine makes me feel more in control and less miserable and inferior to everyone who surrounds me.

I just want it to be over, to be given eternal rest, I fantasize about someone breaking into my home and brutally beating me to death with a bludgeon, and leave my corpse disfigured so that everyone will be scared of looking at me even when I'm in my coffin.

The sea turns red with blood and the rotten corpse falls to the earth to terrify the living.",23Sep2020,1
1,"Nearly two weeks ago I was prescribed Parnate, since nearly all other medications had failed up to this point. I was taking it for 3 days, and the insomnia was horrible. Other than not sleeping properly, it wasn't too bad. But of course, it's hard to function on 4 hours of broken sleep per night, so I called the psychiatrist who prescribed it. They assured me he would call back the next day when he was in the clinic. That day came and went, and I called again, and he finally called me back two days later. 

He suggested I take more melatonin and take both 10mg Parnate pills first thing in the morning. Ok, I tried that and it made me too stimulated all at once, so I went back to one in the morning and one at lunchtime. Next day, I had horrible abdominal pain about 90 minutes after taking my second dose. I figured it was something I ate. Day after that, I developed excruciating abdominal pain about an hour after my second dose. It was the worst pain I've ever had, and I measured my blood pressure at 200/130, which is close to life threatening levels. Fortunately, it started going back down, and the pain started to subside after about a half hour of agony. Unfortunately after that, my pressure rebounded to dangerously low levels, and I could barely stay upright. 

This reaction freaked me out so much that I stopped taking the medication, and called the psychiatrist again when he told me to call. That was this morning. The secretary assured me he would be in later in the day and he would get the message. I waited and waited, and later in the afternoon called again just to be sure he didn't forget. I was told that he would be done with patients soon and would probably call after that. After 6 pm I gave up. 

In case you're wondering, I tried my family doctor after the first failed attempt to reach the psychiatrist, but she was unable to give any advice other than to stop taking it until the psychiatrist talks to me.

So, the tl;dr is: Psychiatrist prescribes powerful new medication and advises me to call if there are any issues. I find out it's damn near impossible to reach him even after having a dangerous reaction to the medication.",23Sep2020,1
2,"I guess I’m writing this to finally accept how I feel. I’ll probably get uncomfortable and delete it later. 

I’m in such a low point in my life honestly. I never felt so down about myself and I’m having a hard time being positive. I feel like I’m just not good enough and my effort is useless. I’m starting to believe I’m just a negative influence to the people I love and it results in my own hurt. My ex claimed I was a positive influence on his life but over the course of us being together, he went from loving and faithful to cheating on me, lying, and hiding. How can I not believe that it was me who turned him into this person that hurt me? I feel like there must be something wrong with me. How do I let go of this feeling of unworthiness?",23Sep2020,1
3,"I (F20) recently moved back in with my parents and I knew in the days leading up to the move it would be difficult. While on my own I had gotten myself to a very healthy point with my bipolar disorder and started a healthy, loving relationship. But I had to move anyway. The night I moved in I was so sad. Since I moved back in I went back to my old ways and habits. Started drinking and self harming which I had been clean from for almost a year. I just couldn’t handle any amount of stress. 
Then my sister lost her baby at 18 weeks and my grandpa passed away. And that leads me up to today. I thankfully had a med management appointment already scheduled with my psychiatrist today. While on the phone with her she asked me what was hardest with living at home and I realized then it was my stolen childhood. My Psychiatrist thinks I really missed some stages of development due to the lack of interaction and straight up fun I got to have. 

My parents didn’t abuse me. But they never let me be a kid. I lived on a farm and was expected to work, split wood, feed the animals, bale hay, etc... all from a young age. I was scolded for playing instead of doing chores or homework. In my teen years I was never allowed to have any friends over and was never allowed to go out with them. I wasn’t allowed to drive, except to my job, that I worked at 6 days a week. I’m angry, resentful, embarrassed, sad, and confused about all of it. I wish I could have had those carefree fun days that other kids had. Or those stupid nights that all teens experience. I will never have any of that. I don’t have many friends, the ones I have are great, but they make me feel so sad when I hear their fun stories and I have none to contribute. I feel embarrassed that this bothers me when I know others actually suffered abuse and neglect. Am I the only one in this situation? The “my childhood wasn’t insufferable but it also wasn’t good” category?",23Sep2020,1

5,"Hey guys, so I recently was able to find myself a therapist while away at college. The rules about receiving mental health care are so complicated when ""living"" in two states, but I managed to start going to a therapist. She's super nice. However, she can only meet every two weeks and can't meet any more frequently than that. I'm really struggling right now with my classes, socially, and my mental health in general. Do people normally meet this infrequently? I'm thinking about trying to find someone who could meet more often and consistently, but I'm also wondering if I should have tried to go to a psychiatrist first. I honestly don't believe talk therapy would be enough to help me, but I know next to nothing about getting diagnosed and the process about it. I've only met with my therapist twice and it was for 50 mins each time. I don't know if I'm just being impatient, but I really feel like I need something that's going to help me faster. Opinions and thoughts?",23Sep2020,1
6,"Today I tried talking about my mental health to my friends and I told them that I had an anxiety attack, at least I think that's what it was, and they told me that my problems weren't as bad as theirs and that they have anxiety attacks pretty much every single day. I tried to tell them that I don't like the way I look so I try to skip lunch and breakfast and they told me that since I am skinnier than them that I shouldn't worry about it and that I should just eat. I tried to tell them that my parents are toxic, that I don't like them and want to leave my house as soon as possible and they said that they didn't know what I was talking about because they met my parents and they were super nice to them. Are they right? Are my problems not as bad/as important? I really need guidance and I'm not sure what to do and if they are right.",23Sep2020,1
7,"I haven’t told anyone. Actually that’s untrue.  I told one person but he just says I’m being a coward. I already know that. I’ve had a plan now that has been progressively becoming more detailed since March. I don’t know what to do the thought is becoming more and more permanent and fully formed. I know what it means that I’m being silent about it. Please this isn’t for attention. My life is falling apart all around me, and it has been for a long time. I know I’m going to be told to call a hotline or see a psychologist. I’ve been in treatment before, I’ve called the hotlines. It’s not helping and everything feels so dark. I’m losing the fight and I’m scared.",23Sep2020,1
8,"Thank you for at least starting to read it. I never contacted or shared most of my problems, so I will be thankful if you just manage to help me with one of them. If I dont find any help, I guess I could just screenshot it, since it is the best way for me to summarize my thoughts. Every problem that is in a list is a thing that negatively impacting my life. 

Problem 1 (not important): 

Right now it is 00:44 and I couldn’t sleep at all, thinking about random things and feeling hopeless. It feels like the room of my dorm is some kind of a cage which I can leave right now, but nothing whats happening outside wont be different for me than whats inside (this thought just came now, and I turned the lights on, hoping that it is going to put me into working/living mood and calm me down). I am not sure if this was happening before however when I was in the room at my other house I also felt a heavy feeling inside of me (if it makes sense, its like as if you are carrying a big weight, just inside of your soul).


Problem 2 (I think about it everyday):

I feel like i’m different than others, and everyday I have to swim against the current to stay at one stable position. Sometimes I could pretend to be more social and active, to become more interesting to people around me (which allows me to swim with the current) and sometimes I feel that I am just not made for life surrounding me, and also have to pretend to be positive when I am not, so no one ever suspected that something could be wrong with me. I overthink the things that people barely think about, everything has more meaning for me than it has for others, I am told to be more relaxed when I am stressed when stressing is not logical. I feel like I am not normal, and whatever I do I still know that I am pretending and not being myself, as if being myself would be judged by others and put me into more problems and useless explanations to others. I am aware that I am hiding all this stuff (also some secrets) from others, and it kills me that I will never share it with anyone, which is strange because I feel like Im an opened person and can speak about most of my stuff (as if I have sorted it like 99% normal stuff can be shared and 90% of secrets and emotional stuff has to be hidden.)

Problem 3 (I think about it when I think I have it):

Sometimes I think that some of my emotions are fake. I mean the feelings are like they are usually, except I shouldn’t be feeling that at the specific moment. I laugh when I’m expected to laugh, I act confused when I am expected to act confused...Today I was hanging out with some friends, we all had fun and enjoyed spending time with each other, and suddenly I felt sad when I remembered how hopeless my life is right now, and that nothing different is going to happen in the future, since I am the way I am. I can imagine some bright future, like finding someone I could love or finding a dream job, but still I would think about my problems and my past and how it has possibly damaged me and led me to the outcomes which are possibly not the best, who knows maybe if I developed and acted differently I would be able to achieve something earlier, more, and live without all the negative memories and thoughts that I might have forever. I also blame myself in every situation that I face, I am thinking that maybe if things were different I wouldn’t have those problems, but now fuck my life and because of me I am dealing with this. 

Problem 4 (I think about that in stressful situations):

I cannot completely trust my friends, and people around me. Sometimes I think that they have planned something bad against me, waiting for my reaction or what I am going to do. If something bad happens (when Im almost sure its not my fault), I start suspecting them, that they have betrayed me and now they are hiding the truth and will never be honest about it with me. I feel like my relationship with everyone (except parents cos they are parents) is basically me walking on a very thin ice, and I am ready to just lose a friend if a conflict happens and I wouldn’t really care about it, and will replace them by different people. 

Problem 5 (just weird, basically a summary of all things above)

I feel like one side of me is attacking and blaming me for everything bad that I think happened because of me, and another side is just passively trying to defend and justify everything I have done and feel. In most cases the second side loses and I blame myself, and in rare cases I can actually admit that it wasnt my fault and come up with 100% correct evidence that it wasnt (bellow 100% wont convince me) and live happily until some point.

14,"I am struggling horribly with my anxiety and it’s making it so hard to want to live. my ex and i recently broke up after a year and i relied on him very heavily emotionally. there was a LOT of trust issues in the relationship on both sides. However we both came very attached to each other (me more than him). i cannot stop thinking about him. we broke up so we could better ourselves and hopefully try things again in the future. i really believed he was my soulmate but i’m pretty sure he doesn’t feel the same way and is just being nice and staying in contact because he’s worried i’ll do something. it helps to type out my feelings to him and text him even though we aren’t together anymore we agreed to stay friends. is this unhealthy? am i just too attached to him or is it okay to stay in contact with him while i better myself? i still want a future with him and i am still convinced he is the person for me, we just never had any trust which tore us apart. i’ve never felt so unhappy and so alone without him in my life and it hurts. i am constantly anxious and worried about him. i am trying to become independent from him but it has been very hard. i still want him in the future because i really love and care about him but i’m afraid my anxiety has ruined that. any advice would be helpful. coping with my anxiety has been extremely difficult especially without him. today i got a notification on my xbox app (we game share so his account is on my phone) and i opened it to check it thinking it was my account. i checked my xbox messages and began to read through them but realized it wasn’t my account or my messages, however, i found out he had gotten in contact with his ex through xbox about getting her a job at his job and i freaked out on him. sent him texts accusing him of lying to me and he gave me his exs number and she sent me messages to prove the only thing they had talked about was getting her a job. i felt so stupid and realized how out of hand my anxiety has become. it’s a horrible and i feel like a piece of shit for dragging him through this. he doesn’t deserve it and never has. he was a great guy to me and it’s not his fault i don’t want to let go. he did not tell me about it because he knew i would overreact and freak out, and he was right. what are the first steps to becoming independent from him so i can better myself? regardless of my anxiety and attachment issues, i’ve know from day one he was the person for me. he has made me so so happy and made me feel so good about myself but we had bad experiences with lying on both ends (mainly mine because i’m a horrible person). i want to become independent from him in hopes of bettering myself for a better relationship with him in the future. any advice would be BEYOND appreciated. and please no keyboard warriors. he has a reddit and will most likely see this post and does not need any hate. he did nothing wrong. my mental health and anxiety and lying drove us apart but i’m ready to get help and better myself for him and i don’t know where to start.",23Sep2020,1

It's been said before, but it never hurts to repeat it. Often times the friend you assume is happy and lively because he/she makes people laugh, is actually going through a pretty rough patch. Many people feeling anxious/sad/lonely, will often try to make others laugh as a way of sparing them their misery and/or hiding it. That's why so many times people ""never see it coming"" when someone kills themselves. So, please, try to talk to your funny friend every so often, make sure they know you are there for them.

1. I have been giving a terrible most cringe worthy fucking nickname of all time and its manifested into me believing im not worthy it also gives people the sense that im the dude you should doubt and mock and bully and make fun off when you can, before the nickname blew up i guess you could say.... Plenty girls liked me had good social circles and felt ""accepted"" now i got like 3 freinds no gf and lonely as a dog, a good loving but also broken family
2. When i was 14 or 15  i was with this girl i liked a whole lot well she broke up with me for a ""freind"" and got pregnant well im hispanic and we were all in a practice for a quincineara well by the time it was my birthday we were no longer together and this other peice of shit decided to tackle me infront of everyone from the back and i stared crying out of anger
3.  My dad is an alcoholic and was verbally abusive my whole childhood and left abruptly when i was 14 for another woman and left my older brother to pay bills he could no longer afford to stay we moved 3 times that year and i started getting anxiety
4. Embarrassing drunk moment i cant even fathom saying what happened and will die in my grave with this except for the people that were there
5. Being blind as a bat didnt wear glasses my whole childhood and would only listen and write down notes miraculously i never failed but when i did get glasses they were so thick people looked at me different 
6. Abused alcohol marijauna psychadelics porn and  fast food i also make music which is therapeutic but i think i got a addictive personality or obsessive behaviors because even making music ive had nights where i dont sleep because im writing or recording ive stopped smoking and drinking its been 2 months but porn and fast food are a much scarier demon
7. Im highly intelligent and start questioning too much shit that no one in the universe has a conclusive answer too without being biased and with knowledge theres pain because the wall of illusion and innocence is gone
8. Bad lsd trip i was in hell for a split second but scared the shit out of me because i felt hell on earth absolutely terrifying was the middle of the night and was alone only with my thoughts waiting for the morning so i could see my family and have a lil sense a comfort

Theres more but thats the basis for my discomfort with life like how can i make freinds when the second they find out what other people call me its like they lose respect for me or feel like this dude is lame i dont wanna be freinds with him it makes me sick it honestly feels like torture in a sense its like i cant be my true self and the only way ill get this back is most likely if i move but i do have a couple freinds i do love and i dont want to leave for that reason but im a afraid of having a gf if when she hears everyone i known since i was a kid call me that shit she will most likely want to leave because she now finds me repulsive its fucking pissing me off ima keep trying ive had thoughts about killings myself i dont think i can because its not that the pain finishes it just goes to someone else I also have thoughts of vengeance sometimes some evil shit when i overthink shit because how come life test me everyday and these people that do the ugliest shit have things i wish i had something simple like a girl to talk to i do have peace sometimes its just other times like today that one thing ticks me the wrong way and its a fucking nuclear reaction to the point im in tears because i cant escape like how tf are people gonna help with shit they havents experienced.

24,"I just phoned the Samaritans for the first time due to some difficulties I’m facing at the moment and there was one comment the person on the phone said that made me feel a bit weird and I was wondering if this kind of thing is normal.
We were talking about making doctors appointments and I mentioned that it felt strange making a doctors appointment without telling my Mum about it. For a bit of context I’m 21 and I’m really close with my Mum. I tell her almost everything and that’s never been strange to me. 
The person on the phone said she thought it was ‘absolutely shocking’ that at my age I’d never made a doctors appointment without telling my Mum. I first of all thought that being open with your Mum about these things was fairly normal. I know plenty of people my age and from my background who tell their parents these sorts of things and secondly I thought that Samaritans volunteers weren’t supposed to say these sorts of things. I was a bit taken aback with this comment because it was so unexpected and I’m now slightly worried that maybe I am unhealthily close with my Mum and if it’s that bad that even a Samaritans volunteer had to interject like that then maybe there’s a problem here that I’m not seeing. 
Other than this they were perfectly helpful and nice but I’m a little put off after that one comment. As someone that overthinks things a lot and so I’m a little put off phoning them again. Maybe it just isn’t for me. 
My question is what I should expect from the volunteers there? Maybe I’m just being too sensitive. Is that kind of assessment on my situation normal? Surely they must get people phoning up who have far more dependencies on their parents than that. Was it just one bad experience? Any suggestions on what I should do about it? 

This also isn’t the first time I’ve had a comment from a counsellor or something that I’ve felt that for someone who’s job it specifically is to not judge or make assessments like that based on fairly little information has ironically come off as slightly judgmental.",23Sep2020,1

34,"Like the title says, I've [16 m] been feeling this horrible feeling of concentration all day, evey day, every month since March. It was caused at first by me trying to listen to more music obsessively, which made me concentrate all the time and feel horrible. Since then, I've put stress on myself with music, art, and pretty much everything I like doing, with exception of a few things. And I'm focusing on it more since slipping back into depression about a month ago, and anxiety a few weeks ago. This is most likely the depression, but I feel like i cant feel much emotions intensely at all, besides jealousy and nostalgiac pain, and I don't feel joy by things that made me happy before, which could be because I forced myself. Songs that made me feel something specific before do nothing at all.
The exact pressure point of it is around the same place as a tension headache, except it doesn't feel like a band, it feels like a stone stuck in my head. I hate it. I want it to be gone and all the tension to be released and for me to feel normal again. These are all the thoughts that come to mind right now, but if I'm reminded of anything I'll put in an edit.

My symptoms are as follows: 
- Confusion (trouble speaking in fluent sentences, trouble communicating with coworkers and clients, forgetting work policies and numbers) 
- Tiredness. Needing to sleeping 10 hours or so a day 
- Sensitive to different types of touch against my skin 
- Severe Intrusive thoughts to the point of being scared 
- Disinterest in everything 
- Loved ones looking un familiar 
- Difficulty with concentration 
- Myself feeling/looking unfamiliar 
- Unable to work for days until the cycle stops

For example I will be extremely happy, content with friendships, and thriving in school for a month or two or even up to half a year. But then either from something that triggers me or even with no triggers at all, I fall into a deep hole of random sadness. I do not think I am depressed because I still ""Have Fun"" and I appear happy to my classmates and teachers. But when I am alone sitting at night before bed I get an immense sense of worthlessness and sadness, and I begin to think that, there's no overall point to life so why do I put up with these bad feelings when I could just easily off myself and not have to deal with the stress, and the keeping up of relationships, and the sadness ever again. I start weighing the cost and the benefits of suicide and deciding that maybe the happiness isn't worth it if I have to go through the sadness.

38,"I don’t really know what I’m hoping to achieve with this post. I feel so sad and lost about this whole situation. It’s so nuanced and there’s so much to it, but I’ll try keep it short. 

I was referred to my therapist (let’s call them A) when I was 14 for an earring disorder. They were part of a clinic for young adults. A lot of her therapy was centred around self care, self love, art &amp; creativity. I liked this approach as it allowed me to kind of avoid talking about anything in particular, instead taking up the time talking about those things instead. It took me two years to even begin engaging in therapy as although I was referred for an Ed, I had a lot of problems.

They were a big proponent of positivity, and every time I would bring up something negative, they would tell me not to and instead focus on something positive. I’m not saying this is an inherently bad strategy - it just meant my problems never actually got dealt with.

About four years in we began having problems, as my mental health began to decline and my other issues came to the fore. No matter what I would bring up, my therapist would give me the same advice; draw it, put it into a movement, make a gratitude list, take a bubble bath. I want to point out that I now know the symptoms I was describing to this therapists were psychosis alongside manifestations of severe OCD, anxiety and depression. Only recently, after finally going to a new therapist, have I discovered this. Both my new therapist and my new doctor said to me they were shocked I had gone undiagnosed / treated for this long and couldn’t understand how my previous therapist didn’t pick up on it.

Anyway, around 4 years in my therapist started telling me I was resistant and “like a moody teenager” and that it was my own fault I wasn’t getting better. This arose after I’d (politely) brought up how I felt my mental health was declining and if we could maybe try some different approaches. For the following years, nothing changed on her end and I tried everything to be a “better patient” I was convinced I was the problem. Only now, in retrospect, can I identify the main red flags from that therapeutic relationship;

1. It turns out she had no qualifications. She had gone through ED recovery in the same centre when she was younger, and worked her way up from a volunteer to “therapist”. Everything she taught was from her personal experience

2. She didn’t believe in medication. There were several times where I had psychotic episodes in my home and had to be tranquilized. The doctors always asked why I wasn’t on medication, and she never encouraged me to go on it.

3. She said she didn’t believe in things like social anxiety, and that any “OCD like” symptoms I was experiencing were just part of my ED 

4. If I’d tell them about anxious / depressive thoughts they would say “oh you don’t really think that, you just think you do”

5. When I was very close to suicide, I told them about it and detailed my plan and they told me “oh don’t do that, that would upset me very much”. I was 17 and there was nothing put in place to stop me doing it.

6. She consistently criticised the way I dressed &amp; presentes myself, saying I should wear more makeup etc and then I’d be more confident 

7. She shared a lot about her personal life, and talked about herself like she was of great inspiration 

8. She would constantly invalidate what I’d say. Anytime I’d bring something up she would act like I was creating a problem or that what I was talking about was not something she wanted to hear. She was only interested in hearing me list the positive things in my life and once I did she’d be like “you see!!! No need to worry about xyz problem, you’ve so many positive things in your life!”

9. When I finally cut ties with her (it took me so so long because I was convinced I was the problem and that I wouldn’t be able to trust anyone else) she took it really badly. She said it was my fault and that she couldn’t believe how ungrateful I was being. She said “I’ve been so important in your life, I don’t think you’d be here without me, you’d be nothing without me” and made me feel awful. So much so that I wrote her a long apology email explaining that I did greatly appreciate her and outlining the reasons I wanted to change therapist.

10. She never ever ever considered the possibility of referring me on / never offered any extra help or solutions (such as a specialist etc)


Anyway, I just don’t know how to think about this whole situation. It has really messed me up. I feel awful. And also a little exploited. The fact of the matter is - if she knew she couldn’t help me/ I was getting worse not better, yet she continued to take money off me for years, this makes me feel terrible about myself. I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable, but this whole thing has been really hard on me. I am seeing a new therapist now and she’s great, but my relationship with her is very compromised due to how scarred I am from this last therapist.

Any thoughts / advice would be appreciated. Sorry if it doesn’t make sense, writing it has made me quite upset.",23Sep2020,1

40,"I often find my seemingly eternal emptiness interesting. How can nothingness be a bad thing? Nothingness can by definition not by bad or good. It's just nothing, and yet my emotional emptiness feels so sour and hopeless. Why is it that my nothingness is bad? Why can't I have the positive nothingness that most people seem to have. Bolstered by their meaningless small talk, keeping their mood as unchanging as mine, and yet being okay with it. Why am I the one who has to gasp for air under my own ocean of nothingness, when others get to float on top of it, unaware of the depth that it can have?

Maybe it's my fault that I'm like this. Maybe I don't talk to enough people, don't do enough things. Maybe I can just swim to the surface of this empty ocean, and I'm just being dramatic. But how can I be dramatic when all I am is nothing.

46,"My experience with irregular mental health began 12 years ago, when I was 12. I am 24 now. I was just a normal 7th grader with a healthy group of friends, a loving family, and no history of childhood trauma. 

One weekend, not long before Easter, I lost two very important people in my life. My paternal grandfather, who I was very close with and looked up to greatly, lost his battle with lung cancer. He passed in his sleep only 2 days after my paternal uncle, who I was also very close with and inspired by, overdosed on heroin.

I was cast into a very severe depression that I never fully recovered from. This was my first experience with suicidal thinking. My grades suffered, I withdrew into myself, and began on a steady path into what would become, several years later, the deepest and darkest place I could have ever imagined.

A few months after the onset of the depression, I experienced my first psychotic episode. It was surreal and terrifying. I would go on to have probably thousands of psychotic breaks over the next 12 years, some lasting a mere few minutes, some lasting weeks. 

I would see terrible creatures, fires that weren't there, people being cut down in front of me, angels, strange people dressed in stranger clothing, and worst of all, situations of mass destruction and tragedy. I would hear familiar voices telling me to hurt and kill myself and telling me that I was a horrible person and deserved nothing more than to rot in hell. I would feel bugs on and under my skin and feel my organs trying to rip their way out of my body. Thse were all experiences that I perceived as real, but they weren't really happening. They may not have really been happening, but they pushed me further into my depressive state, deeper and deeper each time it happened. 

Over the 12 years following the loss of my Grandpa and uncle, I had dozens of real experiences that were also detrimental to my mental health. Death of a serious girlfriend, losing patients during my 7 months as a paramedic, loss of friends, gender identity crises, suicide attempts, drug and alcohol addiction, my son being born with a heart defect and having to undergo open heart surgery 4 times before the age of 2.

I took hit after hit, heartbreak after heartbreak. People say a broken heart can mend, but mine didn't. I became heartless. Apathetic. I turned away from my family and the few friends I had left. I hid this from them so they wouldn't pity me. I trusted no one, cared about no one, cared less about myself.

I got off the drugs when I was 19. I thought getting clean would make the other stuff go away but it didn't, because the real and perceived traumatic experiences continued to happen. It stayed the same, even throughout dating and marrying my wife. Still just didn't care. Getting clean did help me reconnect with my family and friends, who were all, to my surprise, still blind to my problems. Not their fault though, I went to great effort to hide it. I was at one point, after a failed intentional overdose, given a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, and put on medication that never worked. 

Fast forward to only days after my 24th birthday. I was finally marginally open to only 2 of my friends about my mental health issues, though I never let them know just how bad it really was. My friends and family were all supportive when I came out as transgender, but I guess I still didn't trust anyone fully. 

I was weeks into a particularly bad stint of self harm and was ready to cut through my neck to once again try to end it. I was also back on drugs. The night I was ready to finally kill myself successfully, I had a single moment of humanity where I realized how it would effect my wife and children, and had the courage to cry for help. My best friends helped me, forced me, to go to the ER and request admittance to a psychiatric hospital. 

I was there for 18 days. I was rediagnosed as Schizophrenic, then diagnosed again with Depressive Schizoaffective Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I was put on meds that mostly worked. 

Now, almost a year later, I am still depressed, but nowhere close to as severely. I haven't had a major psychotic episode either. I am still paranoid and apathetic and distrustful but it's not disabling. I am 1 year drug free, 1 year self harm free, and with only 1 exception, free of suicidal thoughts. Looking back on it now, I see that I would have had an amazing support system had I turned to friends and family for help back in the beginning when I was 12. I still have a long way to go, but I am truly getting better.

For half of my life, from any given point in time, I never expected to still be alive 3 months down the road. If you are still going through mental health crises, and take only one thing away from my story, let it be this:

There is always help available if you truly want it. No matter how hopeless or inescapable your situation seems, there is always a way out. 

I used to think death was the only way out, and truth be told, I should be dead. But im not, and for the first time since I was a kid, I am happy about that. I get to watch my kids grow up, I get to live my life the way I want to and be who I want to be. I get that second chance, really my 11th or 12th chance, and if somehow I of all people deserve that, then so do all of you.

47,"Today my therapist asked me if I was suicidal. I thought I hadn’t been suicidal for 4 years but after today I’m not sure. I’ve been having a hard time. Today while thinking I realized just how much of my behavior is concerning.

I tell myself I don’t want to kill myself, but I think about my own death, and death in general a lot. I don’t want to kill myself, but I think about other people killing me. Just like being randomly stabbed, the idea of a school shooting, stuff like that. I don’t want to die though, Atleast I don’t think so. But I do want to stop existing. Is that a suicidal thought? Not wanting to exist?

I have ptsd and I literally re-live my trauma every day due to the fact my abuser is still in my life. It’s my dad, I have to go see him every week, once on my moms week, and from Thursday to Sunday on his weeks. He still treats me like shit, trying to manipulate me to make me feel bad that I don’t like him. He’s not even sorry for all the trauma he put me through. From the ages of 6-12 (I’m 15) I was suicidal. I wanted to kill myself, everybody at school told me that nobody would care if I died and that I should just kill myself. And they continued to until 6th grade. In 6th grade suddenly they stopped. Left me alone. And then I was alone with my own thoughts. But after 6th grade I began to feel like these thoughts subsided and I was no longer suicidal. That they just went away randomly.

I’m not sure if they can actually do that. But I’ve been telling myself for almost 4 years now that I’m not suicidal. But I say things like “I want to disappear and not exist” or “I want to get hit by a truck”. I usually say this in a joking manner, but I used comedy as a coping mechanism. I’m not sure if I’m lying or not. I’m not sure at all. 

I’m not actually diagnosed with ptsd, but according to my therapist, and the therapist that visits me at school (who works for the same resource center my regular therapist works at) it is very very clear that I have ptsd. I’ve wanted nothing more than to go see someone to get diagnosed, but nothing around is open for me to even try to. Plus not to mention my mom thinks I just only have anxiety, pushing any idea of depression or ptsd on to “your hurt a teenager, this is normal” “it’s your period” “I had a worse childhood than you”. My mind is a genuinely amazing woman and I love her so much, this is the only thing she really does that makes me feel bad. What I don’t think she realizes is that if she’s right and there’s nothing wrong with me, nothing bad happens to me. But if My therapist is right, and this goes untreated and un-diagnosed, it continues to hurt me.

My therapist asked if I was suicidal today, I said no but quickly then said “I’m honestly not sure” she told me that if I were to tell her I was suicidal, that she’d have to sorta hospitalize me, and get me screened(?) for any mental illnesses. The idea of finding out what’s going on in my brain I like, but the idea of having to stay in a hospital scares me. I don’t want to hurt myself, Atleast I think I don’t. There’s a part of me telling myself that I’m only questioning if I’m suicidal now because she mentioned getting to know what’s going on in my head, and that I only want attention.

I genuinely don’t know anymore, I’ve not told my mom about any of this. I’m worried she will just play it off. I don’t want to kill myself, but I don’t want to exist. I don’t understand it at all. I’m crying, and I feel so alone. Please, I just need some advice or something.",23Sep2020,1

62,"So last January my best friend texted me that he was cutting himself and couldn’t stop. I FaceTimed him and he wasn’t doing well. He told me that he wanted to kill himself but it would be too painful. There wasn’t much I could do because we were in different time zones (he was 6 hours ahead). Long story short, I dmed his roommate to go to check on him and make sure he was safe. Next day he went to the hospital for the cuts on his wrists and a few days later flew home (went to boarding school). 


I forgot to mention that there was a period of time he wasn’t answering his phone and I played a whole ice hockey game (I should have skipped it but I didn’t want my parents to know what happened) while I genuinely thought that he could have killed himself. I think this adds to the reason why the feeling of anxiety and stress is still there but idk.

He was socializing, doing projects around the house, and he was healthy. At the end of the month something completely switched. He went into the hospital for stomach pain and they ran every test possible but found nothing wrong with him physically. After he came home he started to deteriorate mentally.

Well, now he is retired and his wife who he met at 16 is gone. His kids are grown and I’m all he has left. He won’t sleep in his room because it reminds him of her. I think he’s going through a later life crisis and I want to help him.. I want him to be happy so bad. He’s been on different antidepressants the past 5 months but none of them are helping. He had a depressive episode years ago and Effexor helped him bounce back but now it makes him severely anxious. It’s now been 2 months of him being on lexapro and the only change I notice is that he’s been watching sports which was always his favorite thing to do and he has been eating more. But he still is severely depressed and nothing else has improved. His mother committed suicide so depression runs in his family. He promised me he would tell me if he got that low but he doesn’t open up to me. He doesn’t express his thoughts and feelings and never has been that type of person. But I know the thoughts that are going through his head and I just wish he knew how much of an amazing person he is. I want him to live the rest of his years happy and hopeful. Can this type of severe depression be cured? Can I get my dad back? Any input or advice would be so greatly appreciated.",23Sep2020,1

Earlier in the year I became extremely depressed and suicidal, I started dating my girlfriend and my depression got way better but I was still very suicidal for some reason. I cut a few times back then, attempted to slit my wrists once but I was stopped unknowingly by a family member. I’m under a lot of stress right now due to recent unfortunate situations, and I think I may be becoming suicidal again, however I don’t feel depressed like I was, just merely unhappy. I’ve cut the last two nights to relieve stress. I don’t know if I’m just attention seeking subconsciously or what’s going on to make me question life on the daily while not being depressed. If anyone has anything to suggest I’d really appreciate it. Thanks.

I forgot to add that whenever my day starts to go downhill now my mind immediately shoots to that and I can’t shake it. I feel like I’m lying to myself and faking it as I have no trauma or any thing like that to make me feel this way. It’s kinda hard to explain.",23Sep2020,1

When I tell her I have no motivation in life or I don’t wanna be anything or do anything she tells me it’s depressing for her and I stress her out even more. She tells me I better find some motivation but if it was that easy I’d do it

I also fight with my 15 year old sister a lot which also stresses my mom, she usually tells me this is why she’s never home anymore and she can’t stand us
I want to be the bigger person but my sister is a nasty person most of the time, she’ll be sweet for a while then turn on me, insulting me, sometimes even throwing little things at me ( if she’s mad she’ll throw bigger stuff)

in return I become extremely petty, for example I’ll annoy her by turning off the light, or putting up the volume or argue with her or making comments (not necessarily nasty) but annoying like
‘Are you big mad or little mad’ (that one gets her a lot)
it’s entirely childish and petty of me but my mom expects me to sit there and take her jabs and insults, it hurt me a lot though, I can’t keep myself from being petty when my sister gets like that. But my mom always bring up that I’m the bigger person and that I shouldn’t let her get to me and to just shut up

My sister sometimes tells me she hates me and after everybody getting in a big fight earlier she told us to go to hell, I know I belong there
I barely leave my house now( COVID helps with that) and I’m scared of death, when my mom goes out I get mad at her for not texting me if she’s okay or anything and she gets mad at be and says she’s an adult she doesn’t have to text me that and I have no right as her child to get angry when she goes out at night.
(She works at night and my dad was put in jail in May)

I have no friends anymore (even if there was no COVID 
I’d still have no friends, they drain me)
I graduated a couple of months ago from high school and I’m doing nothing, I don’t like anything besides reading sometimes, watching tv or scrolling through my phone.


**Long story short**
I can’t do anything right, I overthink simple tasks and end up doing them wrong, I don’t talk to my friends anymore because they used me as their dumping grounds for their problems and emotions, I have no reason to be sad or crying in the bathroom all the time. I don’t have a bad life really, my mom tells me other people have it worse than me. I know that and I know I’m acting like a spoiled brat. I have social anxiety ( not diagnosed) and I can’t do simple shit right and I ask dumb questions. I cause problems for my mom, my sister hates me and it hurts.
how do I stop feeling petty and anger? Can I shut that off? I wish I was a emotionless thing that can make people happy

75,"Feeling really down knowing that I’ll never get to physically meet my close online friend, Facetime them, or even see a photograph of them and it’s not even their fault...

   Some Context: Were all age 16 and females

I’ve had an this online friend for about two years, she means beyond lots to me, we first met because me and my other very close friend we’l call her Friend A was really into online roleplaying/story writing and so was I. (I know Friend A irl btw) Anyhow Friend A met my future online friend (Ima call her Friend S) online through a online role play site. Ever since Friend A introduced me to her, we slowly became very close friends. 
    At the time and still do I don’t have  very much friends, atleast one’s that would actually put in time to talk to me and help me out of dark places. I’ve recently struggled with a mentally abusive parent which really brought me down to a low place in life. When this happened I went to Friend A for help and of course friends online since I didn’t have any who would talk to me irl besides Friend A. Since Friend S (the online friend) has struggled alot with depression and rough times, I shared so much empathy with her and she helped me out without even knowing it sometimes.
   Until now even, me and Friend S go online every single night, we make time for eachother to roleplay and write stories online, and it’s the most fun I’ve ever had in the most indescribable way, we just create worlds togeather and it’s such an amazing connection.
   You may be wondering so what’s the issue? The truth is i’m not even sure why I’ve been feeling like this. 
    This all started when I noticed my online friend acted extremely paranoid when it went to talking about themselves irl, despite her saying she trusted me and we knew eachother for so long. Eventually, Friend A told me that Friend S is paranoid because she has been in an unfortunate experience that gave her pretty severe ptsd when she was 12. Basically she was lured by someone online, and since she was 12 and didn’t know better and trusted this dude, she gave him her phone number. The pedo used her phone number to find her town and he waited at her school till she saw her and spotted her car, he then nearly broke into her house but luckily friend S called the police just in time. However this was a really traumatic experience for her, so now she’s afraid of giving away any possible personal information to anyone even if it’s been 4 years since the event.
   Now I know that being traced down by a pedo at a young age isnt my friends fault at all, but It just makes me angry how one person ruined everything for her, and some things for me. I know I should be more understanding but I can’t help feeling so down that despite whatever proof I send of her that I’m real and not some 40 yr old man, she will still be afraid to Ft me, or send a picture of her face. I know I don’t need a picture of her, but it just feels like a big gap in between us despite all the things and stories we’ve created despite the gap.
   And I’ve seen so many stories that may be fake online about online friends meeting up.. and they sometimes turn out to be great but I know I’ll never be able to hear my friends voice or see her, and if something bad were to happen to her I have no idea how I would be able to find out.
   I’m only saying all of this now because recently me and friend C were talking in snapchat and everything was seeming all well. But she then accidentally clicked the FaceTime button and basically panicked really badly. She thinks I pressed it on purpose and she now says she has a piece of tape over her phone camera since she feels unsafe. I’ve tried messaging her but she still seems very paranoid.
    I know this is not her fault, but does it make sense for me to feel sad about this? Just the fact she’s so afraid- I can’t help but feel she’s afraid of me but I know she’s not...it’s not her fault...",23Sep2020,1

80,"Hey everyone, 
  I have a really bad issue with obsessively taking extra neat notes. I am really struggling with staying on track in school because of this. I always fall behind and it’s ALWAYS because I spend too much time taking notes. I have an iPad, so you would think it goes faster, but wrong!!! Anytime I write something and it doesn’t look aesthetically pleasing or the way I want it to, I erase it or click the undo button. I do this so much and I don’t do it intentionally but seeing my handwriting crooked or not neat enough really irritates me to the point that I don’t feel like I can move on. I go as far as lining up my bullet points (use gridded or dotted paper). I have to make headings look a certain way, certain words need to be highlighted in the same color whenever I see them, etc. I am basically super anal when it comes to my notes and every time I tell myself I’m wasting time, I just can’t let go and let my handwriting be free and messy. It’s really really hard for me. This is definitely putting me at a disadvantage academically. I feel like i could do so much better in all my classes and with time management if I could just accept messy/not so neat notes as okay. But my mind tells me otherwise. I don’t mean to rant but I really hate myself for being this way. I wish I could just stop. Has anyone else experienced this or have any insight/tips?my therapist told me point blank that I need to stop because it’s taking so much energy out of me but honestly it’s easier said than done. I’ve tried handwriting my notes on paper too but the problem is I’ll do the same color coding thing with words and different pen colors. For paper notes I also have stencils of different shapes for if I have to draw diagrams. I realized in high school that i had this issue because whenever I would take notes in my notebook, if I made any mistake, I hated crossing or whiting it out. Instead, I would rip out the page and start over. This led to my notebooks going from like 100 pages to 50-70. I ended up buying multiple notebooks for just one class. I know I’m insane and I honestly feel helpless with this issue",23Sep2020,1

82,"This was a comment posted on a twitter post I made, which I shortly took down after seeing the comment. This was not a random person.

So I used to play this game called overwatch, I was a high level player (4.4-4.5k) and so I was on a team to try to go semi-pro with. And at this level I basically was a nolifer who just gamed all the time :))) and well I ended up edating someone who was on my team, even if normally I'd never really try to do that, normal relationships are rough already as they are. But I really liked this guy on my team. We were flirting with each other all the time, until fast forward one day I had to miss practice because I had to attend a friends funeral because she committed suicide. I tell this to the guy I like and the next day he tried it too. He wasnt successful but he then asked me to date him afterward. I know, red flags. At the time I also didn't understand why I wouldn't, at least logically declined if I already liked him (although I had a bad feeling about it). I generally lose all feelings for guys after a bit, and just as expected I lost feelings for him too and tried to break up with him after day 2. He convinced me to stay, and I actually rlly tried for the relationship. Although, I read something about caring 80% for your partner = long-term happiness, so I just put him first altogether, and would try to tough it out if I was unhappy, until I really wasn't. I tried to break up with him 7 times. He was very good at convincing, bad at keeping his promises (or at least to keep up on what he was saying). To be fair, he was clinically depressed. But, I was still unhappy &amp; one day I got a new job &amp; wanted to go drinking with my coworkers. I did! Except I kissed a coworker. I had to think about it the next day about my dating situation, like really really think about it. OF COURSE! I thought nahhh ima try my bf again. I told him the next day what happened. He vanished for 5 days and came back. He was very angry. We also had a huge argument about it. And then, I was genuinely happy for the first time for a whole week, he was actually spending time with me. But then... I had told my coworker (who was in a 2 year, I guess unhappy relationship as well) that I chose my bf and that I wanted us to just be coworkers. One night he gives me a drink, and keeps begging me to. I felt bad, because he was always helpful &amp; because I was basically the catalyst of his own relationship, so I drank. Soon enough, I was already drunk. And it happened again. We kissed. I was completely regretful the next day about it. And I didn't understand an inch of what happened, or HOW it happened. 2 days later after me and my bf talk about everything from the past, I finally brought it up and he was really pissed. It was a very heated argument to say the least, one that would make at least small scars. He didn't speak to me for 3 months after that and I kept trying to msg him. Eventually he did (lowkey I exploded on twitter on a post and I think that's why he did) we sorted everything out and it was great, we almost started dating even, but then we just never talked. I'm pretty sure we both knew it was a bad idea. 

Now to come to the real deal, the person that told me to kill myself is his best friend. And another friend that I also know (and they were both on our team too) liked the comment. I don't think blocking them would make a difference since I've been trying to run away from the situation, not really resulting in much for how I feel. Btw we are now 9 months forward since the breakup. I've been pretty happy, but at times I have backflashes of the whole situation, and it makes me feel shitty. After the break up I blamed myself for absolutely everything. And I just felt like everyone in our group hated me. I'm the bad guy. I'm so mean. Even though I care it's a weird way of caring isn't it. I knew for a FACT that I could never be trusted again.
I don't believe this today anymore, but those backflashes man... They suck. I only even dated this guy for 2 months. I don't know why I care so much and why this has affected me so much. It's helped me to learn to truly love myself and value myself, but especially about respecting boundaries, and make them. 
I'm pretty happy now generally, but I have those moments where I'm not. And it's been progressively getting worse ever since that comment was made and I have a whisper in my head saying ""why not? Why don't you?""
Litterally everyone I know has told me not worry about all of this, and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. And believe me I used to be really hard on myself, back when I used to game. But then again some of those people actually suggested me to cheat and that I am young and its fine (just turned 21 btw)
I consider myself as a strong person, but holyshit why does this make me crumble. It's literally embarrassing. Even if I have a voice now that says to kill myself it won't happen. Im strong. But I don't want this voice. I don't want these flashbacks. I want to be heard and understood. I want someone to just tell me that I'm genuinely okay and that I really don't need to be hard on myself about all of this, and I want this someone to tell me why.

88,"*Trigger Warning: Self Harm*

The past few months have easily been my darkest ever. I’ve always struggled with depression, anxiety, and ADHD, but it all came to a peak recently. Last month on my birthday I ended up in the hospital for self harm. This was after a night of heavy drinking with friends, but as the psychiatrist said “drinking doesn’t make you do things you would never do, it just takes away any inhibitions you may have normally.” 

Well fast forward to today and I thought I was doing better. I am on new meds that help a lot. And then I realized one of my long time friends blocked me on everything. I saw him not even 5 days ago and everything was fine so I was at a total loss. I finally was able to get in contact with him and he said it’s because “all i do is talk about my problems”. He is 100% referring to my birthday because the next day I talked to him about it. And about a week prior to this I talked to him about having thoughts of self harm. That’s it. We havent talked much the past year or so honestly because he is horrible at making plans. But I would still try to text him random stuff and would visit him at work. Half the time he never responded. But for some reason I still considered him one of my best friends. Until now. 

I’m just so hurt. And almost ended back up in the hospital tonight because now I feel like all my friends feel that I am just a burden. I guess I want to feel validated in thinking that it’s messed up for him to straight up block me after knowing eachtother so long and acting like everything has been fine? He never even tried to talk to me about it. The last text I sent him was me asking him how he is doing in his math class and if he needs help...

I never tried to complain. I just needed someone to talk to and both times he just happened to be at the top of my messages list. And I guess I thought he cared. I don’t know. I feel so hurt and lost and know I’m not going to be able to stop thinking that everyone around me just thinks I’m a burden now. Ultimately that’s why I didn’t admit myself tonight.

I have no reason to be this way towards them but I can’t stop it, even my thoughts lately when they ask me anything it’s like my inner monologue is fed up and thinking what the fuck are they wanting to talk about now.

90,"My partner ”Bob” has struggled with his mental health for most of his life. He was abused as a child by his stepfather and as an adult by his ex wife. No one in his family took responsibility for his childhood abuse and he really struggles with this.

Fast forward to this moment. Recently Bob has been feeling mentally way worse than usual, suicidal and depressed. I can read him pretty well and know this is serious. We have been calling and emailing places to find him a couselor asap. His GP suggested a psychologist we have both previously seen and really liked, so we contacted the centre where he used to work. Bob found out this psychologist has moved to his own private practice, which he then messaged. They texted back late at night saying there is an available online appointment today at 3pm if Bob wants it, which Bob of course wanted. He replied back, finished work early for this appointment and waited to hear back from them. Bob’s reply was read at midday, but he never received a response. We waited together till 3:30pm, and then my poor Bob went to sleep. (He gets extremely fatigued when stressed) I messaged the psychologist on his behalf, asking what is going on. They claim they never got a reply from Bob and offered a new appointment. I sent them a screenshot as proof.

My heart breaks for Bob. He already feels that nobody cares or has time for him, and now this happened. I don’t understand, this psychologist was so lovely, caring and warm when we used to see him...

So about a year and a half ago, I got semi rejected by a girl I was really into where she didn't explicitly say no, but said to forget about her. For the past year and a half I haven't been able to get her out of my mind. But the problem is that, it's not in a good way. Whenever I hear her name or see her face, even if it is just the first name or someone who looks similar. I start to feel sick. When I'm around her, my legs wobble and nothing comes out of my mouth. I lock up and freeze. I'm not sure what to do, I have blocked off all social media, but right now, because we both were in high positions at a club that we are passionate about, it's inevitable that we will see each other again.

92,"I have had this problem my whole life, I basically obsess over people who are invalidating and highly critical and try to earn their approval and compliments, but when I get the same type of approval from someone who is a normal and not a cynical/invalidating/asshole type of a person I feel like I cannot accept it and I also feel highly ashamed and uncomfortable. I have this weird tendency to feel more comfortable with abusive people and people who don't treat me best and shy away from people who respect me. I cannot describe how uncomfortable, terrified and ashamed I feel when someone genuinly likes me and respects me. I am terrified of losing their approval and usually avoid them like the plague after they complimented me. Whilst, with someone who is highly critical I know I am not going to get approval very often and even if i do, soon they will hate on me again so I feel more comfortable. I also don't feel as hurt when I lose a toxic person's approval as much as I feel hurt when I lose a ""good"" person's approval. I hate being criticized by people who respect me, but can brush it off from those who don't. I also get more of a rewarding experience when an abusive person compliments me and it's a boost to my confidence. Sadly, that puts me in situations where I intentionally avoid relationships and friendships with nice people and end up with toxic people. Why do I do this and how can I fix this?


TL;DR I feel more comfortable with people who are invalidating, cynical and toxic, while I feel uncomfortable and ashamed with people who genuinely like me and respect me.

I wasn’t required to stay for any certain length of time, but i really should have stayed later, and it would have been best for me too to stay later to get better photos. 

I don’t know what to do, usually when an opportunity like this comes up I just avoid it because of my anxiety, so I am proud of myself for actually going, but I really can’t let my anxiety control me like this. My passion requires me to not be so godamn anxious all the time and I feel like I am incapable of making my dream of being a professional  photographer or cinematographer a reality because of it. 

Does anyone have anything to say that could help? Are there medications that can help with this without turning me into a Xanax zombie? I really would appreciate anyone’s advice, thank you.",23Sep2020,1
95,"I'm just on my way from this month's appointment and I can't help but wonder.. Why the fuck am I still going back to this dense moron?
I came to him today with hope because the past few weeks have been extremely hard on me, my university closed after only two days of semestr due to covid, my roommate and only friend in the city is taking the opportunity and moving abroad, my mother threw me out  just last week, I can't visit my best friends because of travelling restriction and I can't even do my job/study/hobby because my laptop just coincidentally crashed as well. His response? We are all stressed out because of the current situation. And went on to rant about how he thinks government is just being over dramatic with the restrictions. 
He planned on taking me OFF the meds today but last minute he noticed seasonal depression is a thing in my card and so is history of suicides in my family. (fyi I'm bipolar) 
It took me 4 years to drag my ass to him and ask for help. I am not capable to all of sudden switch psychiatrists, best case scenario it would take me months to build up the courage and strength and motivation to even start looking up other therapists in my area and even longer to actually switch.
I'm not handling this well, I used to self medicate with alcohol and weed and even though I've been completely sober for more than 2 years I'm feeling like I might slide right back to this compensative mechanism or even worse, because any other mean of support have just dissolved, my family is gone, my friends are gone, I'm on my own, broke, with weak ass placebo-ish antidepressants and a therapist who thinks I'm just being a Know it all drama queen.",23Sep2020,1
96,"I found out my Medicaid is being taken away, a friend of mine passed away, and my hours have been cut at work for no reason, and I didn’t get ANY of the 4 jobs I applied to. All that was broken to me within the same day and idk how the fuck I’m going to live on this earth. I have nothing to look forward to and obviously things are just going to keep getting worse. I don’t know why I’m still alive. Anyone have any miracles to give? At this point that’s all I know that will help me. Chances are that this won’t even post so idk why I’m waisting my time here.

97,"Taking a mental break from online and shit, focusing on me since everyone expects me to be the cheery happy guy who talks to them. But nobody wants to listen to me, people say they do but end up not listening or getting bored cause of it. And then when I'm quiet because of my sadness they go do other things and don't stay with me. Like you really are not capable of staying with me for a lil bit in a pit of silence, you can't just drop everything for one very short portion of your life just to be here with me. I meet your expectations and go above them every fucking day, but when I'm feeling down and you put irrelevant things over my health, then idk what to say. I stay with y'all and help you guys out no matter what even if I'm down sad with you. Seems I can't share my emotions without being judged for it. Always getting clowned for feeling my emotions. So backed up with life and shit I got hella hard classes in school that takes up some of my time and I have a job online too that I have to do, but you wouldn't know that, because you don't care. I literally have to start every conversation in order for someone to talk, guess that just comes with being a popular loner. I have to worry about my parents expectations so I don't worry them with my mental shape. I legit stay in this big ass room by myself everyday looking for a connection over the internet. Of course I still have friends irl, a good amount of them. But they're doing things and I wish the best for them, I really do. They've treated me right all my life. Yes, I do feel love from where some of you guys give me it, I'm not forgetting or neglecting that... I remember it everyday. But legit, if I'm feeling something then just don't be a bitch about it, maybe help me and I can get back on track. I'm a simple man with great things in my life, but I do have problems like the rest of y'all. I feel like a dumbass just typing this but I thought I'd let you guys know, clown me or whatever you wanna do but this is how I feel. I'm feeling my emotion, I figure out problems like these pretty quickly cause I usually set aside my emotions cause there's more shit in my life I need to focus on. I legit stayed on the phone with my teacher one day because she notice I was down, my teacher I knew for a month cared about me and she texts me everyday to see how I'm doing. I just thought I'd let you all know how I'm feeling. I'm not suicidal or anything btw, just a sad ass dude sometime... But that's how it is, we gotta feel this shit sometimes to clear our mind, I feel better just typing this, idk if I wanna post it but I thought I'd let you guys see what I'm thinking rn. I'd never take my own life cause that's not me and I know I'll get better soon and take on with my life, we only got one so I focus on what's gonna get me to where I need to be. People generally think I'm dumb cause I play videogames for a majority of my day, but that's not if... If that's what you think they you don't know me at all. I display that's side because that's the side present at the time, if you knew me I am chill and I'm really down to earth and I'll helpy you with anything you need in life. If there's something you need and I don't have it, I will get it for you cause that's my love. But shit I'm writing down my thoughts everytime I'm getting them rn so my had if there all over the place, just thought y'all should know this. 

The message isn't directed at this sub, but it was for a discord but I brought it here incase you guys have any insight.

98,"There must be something wrong with me. Ever since I were a little child, the experience of having a self in the world would always be followed by this strange hollowness, this unreal feeling that muddled every breathing moment, this vacuum of my own thoughts and feelings that were observable no matter the time of day. I would mentally calculate what the dynamics of my existence could mean, such as mentally excluding myself from conversations to become somewhat detached from it all while being fully aware that I shouldn't be viewing from this angle, or maybe just walking the streets without feeling the weight of my family and friends besides me, and just be swallowed up by an oppressive feeling of disconnection. It went from innocently relapsing into faint trials of bewilderment into a fully grown horror of what I had become, after the battling years of confusion I no longer have any idea of what was truly heartfelt and what was not. Later on I felt so disgustingly clinical that I secretly wished to hop into other people's lives and live theirs instead. That I wanted to be I became, and I withered into a nobody. It has been more than ten years since I have first felt this feeling hound my days by. I am now slightly more than decade and a half years of age and yet feel so much older than that, my soul seemed to have aged under the corruption and I no longer enjoy the fill of the world with cherishing light. This burden of a corpse has hardened my heart. I am weary of all that I carry.

This feeling also came with an immeasurable feeling of wonder of what I perceived the world to be. Ever since I've held a pen I've I've drunk from its depths, I've spilled whatever was mine onto pages and pages of story and lore that my mind couldn't help but spin out, I drew in portraits from the source of my soul. I felt alive in the colouring of ink and the palette of my lovely fiction. From winding castles I could feel through my eyes just because I never felt accepted by cold hard cement, and dangling fairies that hushed my sleep with their soft sunken lullabies, I buried myself in memories that seem too brightly lit and magical for this world, I could never discern truth from fiction. I could never feel abandoned in the world of tortured shipwrecks and clawing moons, I felt home was the feeling of lost and found, in fiction that was imagination bound. I feel that whatever had caused me so much pain over the years had also brought me a gift of perception that was vastly different from others of my age, this eerie grip on fantasy that has plunged my mind into endless torrents of soaring travels and bedridden laments of heart. All of which were encapsulated by this strange feeling of detachment. Which drove me to become wary of what the real world could bring because I could never see past what my mind and its space in between offered.

One of my earliest memories include me just staring into space, simply confounded by the absurdity of this distance, this space in between the awareness of my mind and the sensations of my skin. It was as if I had retreated further enough to feel the gates of my own body pressing back, freeing me from the ground and yet felt so freakishly abnormal it was impossible to ignore. These feelings have followed me since I were in kindergarten, as even back then my mind had shrank a cautious gap between the real world and the one I sprouted within. I've always been strangely rooted in nowhere, and have had such a long period of time with no overwhelming 'real' emotions that I was afraid that I weren't truly human.

It became so bad that I had to stifle my doubts by casting myself outwards, by breathing in the opinions of others. I could no longer trust myself and had to look for the guidance of words I thought were real, ones that came from other mouths, as contrary to the ones I had trouble distinguishing from the soak of my confusion. I began pushing away any strand of thought that was original because I thought they were inherently wrong, and I gulped down the doctrine of school and parents that have shaped the way I behave today. I still resent myself for allowing my childhood to be distorted by such grave distinctions, to have my greatest love of fairytales smothered by this harrowing butcher of rules. I felt unreliable and inferior to the world around me, because no matter how hard I tried I could never immerse myself in it fully. I felt like a fraud and a scoundrel in goody-two-shoes disguise. I felt too rotten and eerie to be safe among humankind. I slowly dwindled away to the chorus of my prying thoughts, I couldn't bear it any longer.

When I sailed off to high school I became determined to borrow from somewhere other than this frightening fear and began a project I called 'Ear to the ground.' I was captured by the seemingly magical simplicity in which my teachers dealt with things and set off to emulate what they did, by paying double attention to whatever they said. I've had trouble in the past where I'd be overwhelmed by the unreal-ness of the given moment and felt my heart race with the prospect of magic, and have more than once ended up missing the entirety of what other people had said because of it. I felt hollowed out by my own disconnection to this earth and tried to make myself lovable by being the pinnacle of goodness that couldn't draw any hate, I swarmed myself with folks that held no business in the valleys of my heart. I slowly pinned away to the chores of my faulty heart until one day, I finally collapsed, in a pile of broken dreams and broken bones. I could no longer bear this bizarre weight of having no identity, I could no longer hold the pain of having no heart to call my own. I felt crude and evil and filthy and unworthy and horribly fictional in my making, and I was sorry that other people had to deal with this unhappy monster of a person I dragged all alone. I left my faith in the world behind and fell into a chasm of brutal sadness, I engraved myself with the punishment I believed gratifying to my soul, I felt utterly hopeless and as deserving of death as a corpse could endow. I believed that if I could rid the world of one hopeless soul, perhaps I could be reborn in a world I could call my own. I felt utterly righteous in my destruction of self and all my heart could bear, I found solace in seeking a punishment no one had discovered yet.

I think I should stop now. Needless to say my recovery has not been promised, but hope has been brought to me as a blessing through the dark, as an antidote to this hopeless mode of suffering. But even in my deepest trenches of despair nobody could find this hidden part of me that yearned so desperately for an understanding, no one could verbalize the despair I have felt over the years, this soul lost to a tired waning of heart. I feel so deeply sorrowful that nobody will truly understand the full crow of this aching loneliness, this estrangement that has been fed to me through the wedges amidst my self and the world beyond my secrets, these stolen moments of tender love that could never be sowed once again through the epochs of time that flow, these silent cries of a terror that will always be etched in my mind in the form of echoes. I can never shake the shackles of a world weighted by my own shuffling self. I can never find a way through this labyrinthine coil of delusional shelter.

I broke up with my first long term boyfriend because I thought that was the right thing to do, turns out i was just depressed and put him through hell with petty selfish actions just because i was in pain. The second, J, wronged me by ignoring me and ditching me. I shouldve just left it but i kept clinging to him. Eventually i got the hint and left but he still orbits me on Instagram. The third, H, I kept pushing away, id over think and block and delete him, then come back and apologise. I eventually just left for good because who wants to date someone so wishy washy? I think its because of intimacy issues but thats a whole other can of worms.

106,"I have this specific issue that i couldn't find anything quite similar on the net.

I used to be pretty lonely, like foreveralone lonely a few years back. I didn't have close friends, nothing romantic/sexual going on in my life; was very depressed and absolutely felt terrible about my virginity.

Nowadays i've had a few partners, i gained a lot of confidence etc... But there's one thing that stuck: I get absolutely triggered when I hear people having sex.

This didn't happen for a long time until recently when my neighbours were going at it and I could do nothing about it; I just experienced again the same kind of pain I used to have.

To describe it it would be: my stomach hurts a lot, i have ""butterflies"", but the wrong way; my heart is beating very fast and I breathe more; and I can't focus on anything but the sound. 
I had no other thoughts than ""fuck, i'm trapped now""; my thoughts don't match how my body reacts, I got very depressed too, without depressive thoughts really.
This went on for a few hours, way after my neighbours were finished (I just fell asleep from fatigue at some point); as well as the day following, and now I'm thinking about it from time to time with mini-triggers.

This has a negative impact in my life in that it amplifies my moodiness and I get too fucking focused on sounds when I'm about to get to bed (i use earplugs fortunately). I dread the day I'll have to experience this again (and i know it will happen)

I can live with it but I fear it'll make me go all depressive again someday under the ""right"" conditions.

I would have gone to a specialist if I had the money but right now isn't really the moment for my bank account.

What is happening to me? What am I experiencing? I'd feel relieved if I could put a name on it, I'm a little lost rn.",23Sep2020,1
107,"So recently I’ve had a lot of incidence when I’ve been sectioned or had my rights taken away. Mental health ppl and police are saying I’m wasting police time for taking an overdose etc. As it’s been happening daily. They say you want to be sectioned and you just want attention. Which isn’t the case I’m taking the overdoses because I don’t want to be here anymore and I can’t cope with how things are. It’s made me scared to reach out and it’s made me worried as I don’t want someone perceiving me to be that kind of person. Why are they threatening to lock me up for struggling. I never ask for the police or anything they get called by someone else. It’s like I’m being punished for struggling and it’s making me feel like they won’t take me seriously until they find me dead. They have diagnosed me with EUPD/BPD and it’s like every time I struggle it’s just ""shell get out of it she’ll be fine later"" ""this is normal for her"" when I say I’m sick of being in a constant cycle of taking overdoses and being 136 I’m not joking I’m being dead serious because I genuinely am fed up. I’m now stuck and I don’t know what to do because I really need to talk to someone but I’m now in the situation where I don’t think I will speak out about my emotions coz of the stigma and the fact that even MH professions are stigmatising me. And calling me a child. You’d think they would understand. And be supportive but it seems no I take an overdose and I struggle and they let me go again knowing I’ll end up there again. ITS A JOKE BECAUSE I’m trying to help myself and services are pushing me away. If anyone has any advice etc or has similar situations plz leave it in the comments. I’m just genuinely stuck and now I feel like they won’t take me seriously until they eventually find me dead. But the shit thing is they will say all this lies about how they feel so bad. She was a nice girl BLA BLA BLA THEY COULD OF PREVENTED IT. They COULD OF HELPED. But they left me in a space where I was scared to ask for help. And scared to talk. So to the mental health services at KGH and the Northamptonshire police. Screw you and my blood is on your hands. I’ve tried to fight. I’ve tried to talk. It never gets me anywhere. The nurses in a&amp;e saying they’ll sedate me coz they cba to deal with me. Pretty much. Mental health services are shit. And the support is wack. Surely if I’ve taken 3 overdoses in a week that sums up how much I hate living this life. And how tired I am of fighting. Stigma is a joke. And I’ll never speak out again.

108,"So the shortened back story is that last year in november my boyfriend took his life...it was a few hours after I broke up with him and fucked me up pretty bad. I drank and smoked weed quite a bit in the following time so the last year since then had been more or less a blur. 

I’ve made a lot of progress though, after this summer I came back to college and decided to start forcing myself out of this depression and deep grief. I don’t fall into spirals as often and haven’t had a panic attack regarding what happened in a couple months now. The emotional pain is still there most of the time but the moments when it hurts a lot don’t last very long. 

As for the thing this post is about...today I went out to my campus bar with some friends and while ordering, I saw Caesar on the list of drinks but skimmed over it deciding that it wasn’t relevant because it was another drink. A few hours later my friend mentioned to me that she found to weird I didn’t order the Caesar because I went to that exact bar a year ago and ordered the drink and told them about how it was my favorite drink. I even put a few of my friends on it at that time. As she started telling me this I looked at her and told her that wasn’t me because I was so convinced that I couldn’t remember doing that.

Suddenly the memory completely came back and I remembered. That really was my favorite drink, a year ago at any bar I’d be ordering a Caesar and it would be the first thing I’d look for on a menu. I have a distinct memory of forcing my picky friend to try it and the vegetables. Yet somehow the name felt so unfamiliar to me that I couldn’t even picture what the drink looked like. I’m kind of high right now so idk if I’m rambling but I’m so put off by this. I can’t tell if it’s trauma related or maybe I’m just stupid but the fact that something that I literally loved last year became unknown is really bothersome. I also remember the night that I came back from the funeral my sister took me to my first bar and the first legal drink I ever drank was a Caesar. 

Anyways, just wanted to get that off my chest because I can’t stop thinking about it...maybe someone knows something about this",23Sep2020,1

110,"I (20F) don't know how to write this properly but I think I'd feel better if I write it down. I've always been an independent and academically oriented kid. Both my parents work and I started staying home alone and taking care of my sister ever since I was 8. My parents never liked to do that but they had to work to give us a good future. It's funny cause at that time everyone used to tell how mature I was and I took that a as a big compliment. I'm very focused on my education. I've taken a big loan and I have to get a good job to pay it off. My grades have never dropped but I'm afraid I have to learn alot more to get one. (I'm from a CS background so theory will not help). My parents constantly remind me to never worry about the loan and I honestly don't think I do. But I'm never able to relax. I have to keep working. I also teach part time so that's a good distraction. But the second I stop being productive I'm overwhelmed by so many intrusive thoughts. I hate it so much. I also noticed lately, I've started to sweat alot at the slightest inconvenience. I'll admit, I do get tensed when things don't happen the way I plan but now, even though I'm able to come to a solution without getting too anxious about it, by the time I'm  finished with it I'll be drenched in my own sweat.
I don't know if it's related but at night, somehow I can never manage to convince myself that the all the switches are switched off. I don't know why it's just with this one particular thing but I force myself to get up and check although I KNOW I switched it off. This is so dumb but if i ever stop myself from checking I get this horrible feeling something bad will happen to the people I love. I feel so stupid writing this.  I have a happy life and a supportive family I have no reason to feel this way. The only bad incident that has probably happened is the relationship I got out of 7 months ago which lead to harassment but I don't think it has affected me. Am I overthinking this?

116,"I think I have a undiagnosed mental disorder or disability, I have Googled it before but I can’t find anything about it and it’s making my depression so much worse, so I thought I might as well just post on here to see if anyone can relate to what I have. I’m not really asking for anyone to diagnose me, I know you can’t diagnose me, I just want to know if I’m not alone or if anyone has any resources they can point me to.

I think it would be easier if I just listed the symptoms like this:

-I take things too literally and lack critical thinking skills. A good example of this is last year, I found out I was cooking Kraft mac and cheese wrong my entire life. Step 1 says boil the water, then add the pasta. But because “boil the water” and “add the pasta” are bother under step 1, I assumed that meant to do them at the same time. (I would throw the pasta in with the unboiled water and let the water boil with the pasta in it.) So it took me a while before I learned that you boil first, then add the pasta.

-My reading ability has deteriorated to where if I read anything much higher than the level I’m writing at now, I just can’t understand it. I tried audiobooks, but the words won’t process that way either. I have relistened to audiobooks several times over and I’m only able to pick up bits and pieces. Maybe it’s the material I’m reading, I’m not sure. When I was younger, I was a really avid reader, and I wrote a lot, too. I still write, but my writing style is so much more simplified now.

-I don’t know how I’m supposed to act. I always google very specific questions that nobody else has but me, and of course because the question is so specific I won’t find any answers. It just seems like, to me, everyone else was born with the knowledge and understanding of basic social cues, and how they’re supposed to talk, but I didn’t get that.

These are the main things I can think of right now. I did consider that maybe I’m on the spectrum, but it has gotten worse over the years, so I’m not sure. I even considered maybe I had early signs of dementia, but I’m 19 so I highly doubt it. I’m not sure if it matters, but I have a diagnosis for depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety, and undiagnosed OCD.",23Sep2020,1

The thing is, I really want to work and have that responsibility and things but I'm also very scared. I'm worried about covid too but also like how warm I get in a face mask and having to potentially wear one all day for work as that can easily trigger my anxiety.

When I'm around other people, I get more energy. I get dragged along and super interested and happy etc., at least, if it's a happy mood. I'm a real extravert. But then afterwards, when I go home, or I'm alone, or when I wake up the next day, I feel drained. I feel like I have less energy than other people do, because they always go about their day and do their tasks and seem to have no problem. And I don't think this is just my perception, because they seem genuinely confused when I tell them I'm tired.

I feel like the issue is that I can't really direct my energy, and I can't really pace it. Sometimes it all gets spent on something that doesn't really require that much energy, but I get far too invested or excited.

I have so much to do today, but I can't for the life of me start. It's really bothering me. So please, dear Reddit, does anyone have experience with this problem and know of a way to go about fixing this? Perhaps something to structure my day, or something to teach me to be concious of my energy expenditure, while still being my excited, fun self?

If you browse the chat on there you will almost always see people talking about how alone and sad they are. Well since they are spending time in the chat, it makes me think that the stream must help with the loneliness at least a little bit..I know it does for me.

However, I find myself still yearning for a more personal human interaction.

Due to that, I created my own 24/7 lofi stream EXCEPT it has a real human in it (me) to make it more personal. The goal is to create a community of friends where you can chat, chill, and listen to music. Hopefully make the world a little less lonely

I sleep normally, I haven't done anything silly, but I just have this feeling of huge relief and happiness. I've had OCD with anxiety and now I have a lingering worry of all of this being some sort of pre-mania phase.

My psychiatrist has run the test on me and I'm not even close to either types of BP and told me I should just enjoy the good feeling.

148,"I have a problem with collecting things for later. Almost all are from the Internet. When I found something I am satisfied for a moment, then I continue to find much better. If I found some text about something and it was interesting to me to read it I will continue to search. I will open a lot of similar tabs and checking one by one what I found. That can take a lot of time but I can't just close them if I am not anymore interested in it, I have to tick it off in my ""imagined to-do list"". I have a feeling I will miss something important for me and golden found. I can't focus on what is important for me.

I have a lot of open tabs (at this moment about 250), I bookmark them too which are waiting for review, I left them for later just to remind me I have to do that, to read as fast as I can, and of course very soon I will forget I read it but I ticked it on my imagined list I do that. I just can miss something that I think can be important to me. There are a lot of emails which I have to see them and they waiting for me.

In real life, I collected for over 60 books which I want to read. Several years ago I told to myself - Don't buy any more before you read all those, then I had only 10. But I continue to buying and they are waiting for a reading. Some of them are already older for a few years from a day when I bought them. If I start to read it and I don't like it I can't just accept left on the shelf and to forget it. When this happens I read that book for a long period, I will overjump some pages but I have to come on the end and to tick it I finished it. It doesn't matter I almost don't know what I read I just have to have that satisfaction in the end.

Similar problem I have with movies and TV shows. When I start to watch a TV show for me is very hard to stop it if I don't like it after a pilot episode or a few of them. I read reviews and they change my opinion. Then I told to my self to continue to watch and to wait for a better part. Again I lost my precious time for nothing. 

I collected over 1000 courses on Udemy. In the end, I just watch those which I paid for them (some of them I still never started and they old for 2 years or more, I bought about 15 courses. Others are free or from the links of instructors which they gave it for free for some time). At this moment I can isolate my self from those which I don't need it but at some moment I don't know will I wanted to watch them. The good thing for me other opinions are persuaded on me. If I see it is bellow 4/5 I am not interested anymore because I am looking for the best.

I like to taste the food, candies, beverages, etc. When I go to a restaurant I always try different food, never my favorite from that restaurant because I want to find what is best from me from that restaurant. And after some time I forgot what I tasted and then I am confused about what to do next... Just to accept and pick up something which I love it or to start over from the beginning. When I see some chocolate which I didn't taste I have tried it. 

I have a problem when I lost something. For me, it is much easier to accept if I broke something than to lose it. A few months ago I reinstall my system and I didn't back up well many documents from the desktop. I am still thing about what I lost it. 

One funny and sad thing is even when I have to enjoy porn to watch I much more spend time collecting video for later than to enjoy watching (I think too porn isn't good and I fight against them too).

Probably I have more examples which I do but they are all in a similar mold. When I was younger I have collecting issues too such as cartoons, movies, games, music, porn,... Then I just decide to destroy it. But I found other occupations and to continue to do other staff in the same pattern.

One bad thing about this problem is I always start from bad stuff. I cleaning all that is bad and going up to better ones. Where I will have only the best ones which I collected. Because I have to see everything that is given to me.

When I read about mental illness I found those two which can refer to me: Obsessive-compulsive disorder and Compulsive Hoarding Syndrome. Do I have them or this is something other?

I feel like an idiot. What I am trying to do?! This is a very big and hard pressure. Why I am doing this?! Does someone have similar issues? How do you fight against them? Do you have any suggestions? I am loosing and wasting too much time and I can't handle it anymore. PLEASE HELP ME!",23Sep2020,1

152,So I need to be seeing a counselor soon because I seriously need help. But there’s just one thing on my mind that keeps bothering me is the confidentiality towards having suicidal thoughts. I’m not suicidal anymore but I was seriously considering it a couple months ago which resulted in me completely ruining my lifestyle to the point where I was having trouble doing very simple things. And I was practically trying to kill my self but the method was very stupid and (luckily I didn’t really damage myself at all physically) and I was deep down afraid to actually die. This whole situation practically ruined me and I’m trying to climb out of it because I’ve accepted the curiosity of the future and the fact that as a religious person I don’t want any negative consequences after death.

Will he send me to the hospital into a psych ward? I really want to keep this away from my family and keep this private. I also don’t want a huge medical bill if I ended up in the hospital.

I'm in my late 20s and while I wouldn't necessarily consider my life to that *bad* by most definitions, I find myself with a lack of zest for life. While I sometimes find it hard to describe, I can sum it up in this way: I don't want to die, but I don't want to be alive either. I'm not suicidal. I don't have a plan or even considerations towards ending my life, but I do not see a point in remaining alive. I've mentioned to those close to me that I'm going to keep living until I no longer wish to. They were understandably alarmed by this.

I also feel a growing sense of resentment and bitterness towards the world. I feel like I don't belong here. The things that most people seem to love and praise, I find myself resenting. I cannot find any meaning in this existence and there is nothing I can do that brings me fulfilment. I am actively pursuing a career that I am passionate about, but 9/10 times, I focus more on resisting the urge to give up than actually putting productive effort towards it.

I try to avoid social media due to all the toxicity, politics, and overall fakeness of it all, but it's relevant to my career so I have to coexist with it at the very least.

I don't know if I'm looking for answers, advice, help, or just someone to listen, but yeah. I don't know what to do. I don't want to feel this way. I don't know if I'll ever feel different and find a point to it all. I feel lost and hopeless and I don't know how to remedy it.",23Sep2020,1

155,"So I've recently turned on panic mode since my mental health is in the garbage and am taking multiple paths in trying to get help.

1. While in my home country for vacation, I started therapy with a psychiatrist there both because it is much quicker than waiting for my insurance at my work country, and because they speak my same language so I wanted to give it a shot. They also wrote me some new meds. So far I'm comfortable with them but we haven't started the actual treatment yet (have been going through my history and symptoms for 3 sessions) so I cannot judge.

2. I went through my insurance process - they are arranging a psychiatrist visit soon, after which they will advice of further therapy. I still want to go through this therapy in my work country. Just because my experience is doctors here are more professional and reliable than in my third world home country. But I have nothing against my home therapist yet. They seem to be doing their job.

3. I signed up yesterday for this online texting therapy service called Talk Space. I wanna do that because they are available everyday so I can get support most of the time. But they will also have a program based on my case, so it's not just a support or emergency line.

After a few sessions with all of these I will decide who to go forward with.

What are people's thoughts/experience with this?

TLDR; I am soon going to be seeing 3 therapsits: one in my home country with my native language, one in my work country in English via insurance, and a text-therapy app. A few sessions of each till I decide who to go forward with. Is that gonna go bad?",23Sep2020,1

157,"I have attachment disorder and Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified and I constantly struggle with Hypoarousal. I hardly ever find people to connect with about it, as most of my friends have General Anxiety or depression that results in hyperarousal. 

My beloved aunt is dying from cancer and I'm met with a brick wall inside myself, keeping me from my emotions. In my Dissociative Disorder, I have a Monster aspect that tries to keep me safe from scary emotions but he's an overworker in this way. I'm in therapy but we're no longer able to do EMDR since our sessions are remote, so I haven't had a chance to deprogram these reactions lately. 

For people who aren't familiar with the term, I react to scary stimuli by becoming numb, the exact opposite of feeling too much. 

I'm mostly just looking for others experiences along this vein, just to know I'm not the only one with Hypoarousal which seems much more rare in the depression community, or it's possibly the least vocal community within.

I was a very functional alcoholic but my psychiatrist told me I couldn't drink on the meds he wanted to prescribe. I grew up thinking mental health was weakness and pills were a weak man's excuse to feel better without working towards it. So, I am still interrupt prejudice against prescriptions.

I stopped drinking cold-turkey and it's been 3 months. He says I'm bipolar and have dangerous tendencies. So, I'm on two mood stabilizers and ritalin. I feel worse than before and get the vibe that he thinks I'm there only for ADHD meds. He just keeps wanting to increase my mood stabilizer doses. 

My self medication with alcohol had me functioning significantly better than how I am functioning on the meds. 

My therapist and I just talk. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be getting out of therapy. She gives me the generic advice everyone knows and that I've already tried. Counting, touching things in my room, exercising, meditating, routine maintenance, etc. I feel like it's mostly just a waste of time and we haven't improved anything in 5 months.

I M (28) was seeing this girl F (28). However, it wasn't working out and I ended it in July and blocked her across all platforms except for Imessage because I did not know how to. One day after I ended it she texted me on Imessage asking me to delete her pics. I said ""Sure, I have no interest in keeping your pics"".

I was pissed because I saw this as an attempt to contact me. However, I started looking for pictures (compromising or otherwise) of the girl in my gallery in order to delete them. The girl did not take my statement in the right way and said I was refusing to delete her pics. I told her to stop bothering me and we got into an argument. I told her I had deleted the pics, she said I refused and therefore she felt unsafe and therefore she was going to put me into trouble. She works for an NGO that deals with sexual harm and said that she had read a case where a person was blackmailed because of her compromising pictures and that it was her responsibility to keep me from doing the same. I fail to understand where all of this is coming from.

She said she would shame me in front of my family and on Twitter because I had refused to delete her pics. She kept messaging, threatening to shame me etc. on all platforms and after being blocked on gmail. Eventually she laid off in August. Cut back to a couple of days ago, after speaking to my therapist who suggested I try meditation I opened my headspace (meditation app) account and to my surprise I find the Ex - FWB was using my headspace account regularly and when I told a friend to tell her to stop using it (for some reason a password change wasn't able to log her out) she texted me saying she was going to shame me in front of the friend and defame me. She again said I refused to delete her photos and that they were on my phone.

My problem is that every time she says that I refused to delete her photos I get triggered. I told her that it triggers me yet she continue to say it nonetheless. She says she will take action and I should stop threatening her when the only thing I've said is that I shall have to talk to her parents if she does not stop harassing me. I want to know where am I wrong. This is a situation where I never even thought of sharing her photos but rather it came into her mind and when asked to delete I said ""Sure"".

How is the word ""Sure"" a refusal to delete. I would also like to mention that the EX- FWB had an issue with me wanting to reconnect with a former love of mine and it was during that period that I ended things with the FWB.",23Sep2020,1

I'm a 19 year old girl who has a lot of issues, but don't know what exactly they are because of my mother being against seeking help when it comes to mental health. My father is schizophrenic, and he didn't know until later on in life which took a toll on my family since he was abusive, and erratic my whole childhood life. he's not in my life, and he never really was, the only time i truly saw him was in his spur of moments. not only did i grow up with an abusive yet absent father, i also grew up with a bipolar mom who was very verbally abusive. i've also had my fair share of traumatic events that happened at a very young age.

i know somethings wrong with me. i even bawled in front of my primary doctor because i WANTED help, i told him I: TRIGGER WARNING!! self h\*rmed. and he immediately told my mother to seek out help for me and gave her resources. but guess what? she never did. not until 3 months ago where i practically begged her to call someone, just anyone, to help me and to give me a proper diagnosis so i can get the proper help, she called in. but, after a couple of calls here and there, and speaking for me, and telling them i wasn't ""that"" depressed and basically sugarcoating everything i've gone through, she hasn't called them back since then. 

i'm at such a low. i feel so lost, ive been suffering from depersonalization for months now and i feel so suicidal. i feel like i'm always at a sense of panic but i calm myself down if it gets too much, but i need help. i need help. i don't know what to do anymore, i just need help and no one cares.",23Sep2020,1

168,"Hello, I'm in a situation which I think isn't normal or healthy, but I don't know why it might be happening or to what problem/disorder it may be related.

So apparently I've been in a mood I would define as complicated. I'm either apathic or angry by the littlest things.

I don't know if apathy is the right word but, I just feel slightly ""blue"" and struggle to care about other people's feelings sometimes.

A friend has already told me like four times more or less that I get ""too angry to the point it's impossible to have a discussion"", that I twist what they say and that I fight with them for everything.
While I admit that I might get a little bit carried away by anger in those situations, in my defense I'll say that I feel that I had legitimate reasons to feel offended (them criticizing my upbringing, or accusing me of having no empathy because I didn't read a certain situation as they expected).

The problem here might be the amount of anger I feel in those situations, and what my brain ""tells me"" to do.
For example, I have to make a lot of efforts to keep myself from verbally abusing the person (insults, foul language, etc). And I easily lose patience while arguing.

The pain thing.
Pain plays an important role in all of this, since it seems to magically trigger an ""episode"" or just makes the symptoms worse.
For example, I may accidentally hit my arm with the doorframe and I suddenly feel like crying.
I don't feel specially sad. Nothing bad happened. But I just kinda breakdown and cry (not a serious breakdown but you get me).

And the same way it triggers the crying thing, it can trigger that same disproportionate anger too.
For example, kicking the object I stumbled upon out of sheer rage.

The problem is when it is not an inanimate object but a living animal.
Yesterday when I was trying to pet my cat, it tried to get away and scratched me in my hand in the process, to the point I bled.
I immediately felt the crying part, followed by rage.

I didn't do anything because thanks to the gods I (still) have self control and I KNOW I'm going to regret it latter. But my mind was flooded with images of me kicking the cat. Screaming at it, calling it horrible names and overall wanting it to disappear. Like if I wouldn't care if it fell and hurt its leg, for example.

I only did the yelling part, to tell it to get away from me.

When the rage disappeared, only guilt and sadness (and more crying) remained.

Writing this I realize I might really have a problem. But I don't know which.

And I fear I'm making it all up.

175,"I have struggled with mental illness my entire life. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as a child, depression at 14, ADHD at 16, and bipolar disorder at 20. The first time I seriously considered suicide was when I was 10. Needless to say, it’s been rough.

The pandemic hit me especially hard. In June I quit my job of 6 years due to the effect it was having on my mental health. I was supposed to work at a summer camp in July anyways, but the governor decided the day before I was supposed to start that residential camps would not be running this year. Due to me quitting my previous job I wasn’t eligible for unemployment, so I was no longer able to afford a therapist or my medication.

I found a new job in July but my mental health had declined to the point where I was completely unable to do it. It also involved driving to a different facility every day, which would cause me to vomit with anxiety before every shift. After having a panic attack over parking in Boston, I ghosted them and decided that this was the end for me. I couldn’t do something as simple as sit and stare at a pool for 8 hours, even if the alternative was an empty bank account and a rising self-hatred. How would I ever be able to function independently?

That night I attempted to hang myself. Obviously, it didn’t work, and I’m still here. This frustrated me; I felt like such a failure that I couldn’t even succeed in dying. I ended up relapsing with self harm, and I spent the weeks after that consuming any substance I could get my hands on to numb the pain, waiting for the courage to try again.

After the very much warranted disappointment from my parents, I ended up applying for an overnight warehouse job for an online retailer. From the rumors I’d heard I expected it to suck, but they were right, I needed a job.

They hired me, and I started last week. Turns out it doesn’t suck. And I don’t suck at the job either. Within three days they asked me to apply for a promotion, and today I got a fancy new vest, my shift differential was bumped up by $1.50, and I finally have some hope for the future. I also found out if I stay for a year they can help pay for my education, so for the first time in forever I have a long-term plan for my future. Best of all, I can afford to get help again.

I know I’m going to feel shitty again, but it’s going to get better again after that. I have trouble remembering times like these when I’m really going through it, but for the first time in years I feel capable. I feel like I can take it. I’m a hard worker and I’m no quitter, why would I give up on life like that?

I guess my point is that no matter how dark it seems, how hopeless it feels, or how incompetent you think you are, there’s always a chance for it to get better. I’m moreso making this post to look back on the next time I’m suicidal, but I’m hoping my message will help others a little.

176,"Backstory: I (28F) was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at 15, have been on/off meds and in/out therapy since then. Over two years ago my husband was arrested for voyeurism. After a separation and after he served his time we decided to try and work things out. Four months ago he announced out of the blue he wanted to be a fun, part time dad and promptly moved out.

IDK why I'm even really posting but I'm struggling with a lot lately (separation/divorce, working two jobs (50 hour weeks between the two jobs), homeschooling 3 small children, and normal adulting adulting stuff) and it's taking a toll on everything.

I didn't want to finish it. 

I know I need to eat. I don't want to. It's too much work. I'm keeping up with my Celexa but I'm still so tired and constantly on the verge of tears. I'm really good at masking so no one around me suspects how much I'm struggling (or cares, probably).

178,"TLDR; my mum questioned about whether or not people actually wanted to be around me and took a critical hit to my already fragile self esteem and I'm not sure how to cope with her comments anymore

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, I've always had a kinda dodgy relationship with my mum and she quite often says stuff I find quite mean.

This is just an example of some mean stuff.  
I kinda semi have ""disordered eating"" I wouldn't call it an eating disorder because I don't believe I have one and also I'm not officially diagnosed.  This year I went from overweight to underweight - when I was overweight she'd constantly make comments about how my jeans could probably fit her and my double chin was super noticeable (I actually had an underbite which I went to have corrective surgery for earlier this year which caused a double chin and soft jaw).  I always tell her to not comment on my weight or what I eat but she says that she's doing it out of concern.  Like telling me when we're eating out that I'm gonna end up like my (morbidly obese) grandparents and that she was so much skinnier than I was.  Now I've lost the weight she tells me that it's gross because I've got no ass and my body's unattractive.

A lot of comments on my appearance really - before the jaw surgery it was comments on that, I started puberty early so it was calling me gross when I had acne at 9 years old, getting me to dye my hair because she doesn't like the colour, telling me that she wouldn't wanna be seen on holiday with me because I'm too pale so I had to get naked in front of a woman to have a spray tan, telling me that my face looks like it has loads of holes in it (I do have open pores and I'm insecure about it you know), calling my eyebrows ugly until I agreed to get them done when I was about 11 etc.

Even though I'm 18 I'll still cry in arguments because I can't stand it when somebody yells at me and gets in my face, and my mum tries to intimidate.  In one argument I started crying and rather than continue insulting me she just started fake crying as well really loudly and wouldn't let me leave the room or talk - it was really embarassing and to this day she denies she did that.

I chose to go to the university she doesn't like and told me she'll no longer ""pay for my education"" which would have meant I wouldn't have been able to go (she's backed away now though because she can't hold to something like that with my dad in the picture).

Anyway she says none of this type of stuff around my dad because my dad would shut her down.  I do tell him but he always says ""You can't change her you just have to take it on the chin"".  British stiff upper lip and all that.  I think I've actually been quite good at just coping until the past year and a half where it's been affecting me so much more.

I'm at Uni now and I thought I'd gotten away from it, but everytime I talk to her on the phone she says ""don't be argumentative because nobody will like you"" as if that's a personality trait of mine, ""don't act like x don't say y"".  Today really upset me though because I'm doing a very male dominated subject so I thought it would be nice for girls in my accomodation doing my subject to have a picnic brunch (milkshakes and cookie dough and waffles :3) so I messaged a bunch of girls and asked them and they agreed.  I told her and she said ""But are you sure they actually want to come?"".  I was bullied and excluded in primary school and I didn't have a lot of friends in secondary or sixth form so I wanted to make some friends when I came to uni.  I know these girls might not be the ones I stick with forever but I'm so worried constantly that I'm going to be the person nobody wants to hang around.  People \*do\* say stuff you know behind other peoples' backs and I don't wanna be weird or lonely, I want friends and I want to do well.  But my mum is making me think that nobody will like me anyway and that was already kinda a concern of mine.

I'm not really sure how to kinda look past it, our relationship is getting rockier and sure I've told my dad but now he's sneaking around texting me to see if I'm okay because if he talks to her then it'll cause an argument, and he already has enough of those on account of trying to check her behaviour.",23Sep2020,1

184,"I’ve been taking Zoloft for 9 years but last year my therapist &amp; I agreed that I had reached a plateau in my mental health and I needed a change in meds. Since I’d originally gotten Zoloft prescribed by a general practitioner and I am now on new insurance, I decided to go through Kaiser to find a psychiatrist. I sat down with her and read off a list of things my therapist &amp; I wanted her to know before prescribing me anything. I told her about my anxiety &amp; depression, my history with Zoloft &amp; therapy, my sleep problems, my eating problems, etc. etc. I also informed her that I am a regular cannabis user, and that I use it to treat anxiety &amp; depression. 
That’s when the tides turned in the conversation. She started lecturing me about how cannabis can counteract my medication and make me more anxious/depressed. She informed me that I need to quit smoking if I want to get better. 
I shut down. Weed is one of the last things that brings me joy. I cried in her office and told her I didn’t wanna be perceived as a lazy stoner and that I was trying really hard to get better. She barely showed any sympathy for my crying and just doubled down on telling me to quit. 
After that I was terrified of seeing her for a follow-up. I knew I wasn’t gonna stop smoking and I knew I’d have to tell her and she would scold me. And she did. She asked if I quit, I said no and started crying and I told her “I’m not trying to be rude, but I didn’t come here to be scolded.” She said, “that’s all I’ll say about it.” After the appt I had one of the worst emotional breakdowns I’ve ever had in my car. 

So here’s my question: is the psychiatrist in the right for telling me to quit using cannabis or else I’ll never get better? I’ve been smoking for about 2 or 3 years, and have had anxiety &amp; depression for MUCH longer than that. I’ve had people tell me that if I quit, I’d probably be much more motivated and happy. But every time I take a tolerance break, I don’t feel any different besides just missing getting high. Like I said, it’s one of the few things that brings me joy. It helps me be creative, helps me not to spiral into negative thinking, and helps me fall asleep effortlessly (something I struggled with my entire life). I know any mind-altering substance might not mix well with psychiatric medications. And I’ve noted that alcohol + Zoloft is NOT a good combination for me personally, so I rarely drink. But weed never presented a problem. I know there’s long-standing stigma about stoners, that we’re lazy and unemployed and just smoke all day. That weed makes you lose motivation and just sit around all day. For me that’s not true.

188,"i don’t know how to start this post nor how to structure it but right now i just feel like venting and writing down my thoughts. 
right now, my life is falling apart, my dad is a lethally ill heroin addict while my mum is having an affair. i have two older siblings, my sister who is twenty isn’t home as often, my brother who is 25 is going to move to another town in less than two days. i feel super lonely. 
school just started two weeks ago and i already am stressed out. i am above average in regard to grades even though i never study for any of the test but somehow school is just too much for me. i don’t see a sense in what is taught since its all just plain boring. 
in the last two months, not a single day has passed without me chasing a high and i am slowly starting to think that i am addicted. but honestly i wanna stop cause i don’t feel like i have the strenght right now. 
i don’t understand why my life turned out this way; i had a great childhood, i have some great parents that i love to death. they might not be perfect but they sure are loving parents, id consider myself pretty lucky to have them. the fact that my dad doesn’t have much time left is killing me. he’s the most important person i have ever known and i just cant imagine losing him. and i am far from prepared for this happening even though he could literally be gone any day. i am fucking scared. 
honestly, i don’t see why i should carry on living this life where nothing seems to make me happy and i am only 15. i don’t want to live another lets say 70 years there’s literally just no reason. the only positive aspect of my life are my two best friends. they are great and i am beyond grateful for them.

I’ve lived on my campus for four years and have never made a friend, and it’s hard to improve relationships with my friends at home because I’m so meticulous about how I present myself to them. Texts, emails and social media posts take forever for me to write because I worry about every single word in them, and I often choose to not send them at all. Even when I’m alone, it’s very hard to do projects or try new things because I’m afraid of failing and feeling incompetent or inferior as a result. The slightest mistake, like dropping or forgetting something, makes me feel worthless and judged even if there’s nobody around. 

I feel so isolated and hopeless because of this; it feels like years of my life have been wasted and everyone around me is better than I am. I want to be a successful person so badly, but how can I do that if I’m so preoccupied with my weaknesses and how they’re perceived?",23Sep2020,1

I got paint all over my hands, some on my shirt (I am not worried about it because it is easy to wash off)...some on the table...and a beautiful painting started on the large white piece of paper I was given. I was a child again...and I guess it showed in my face because even the counselor noticed. I felt so young. I painted with a brush and then with my hands. Literally. I also painted a rock...that was pretty cool too!  


I just can't stop thinking about how easily I had re-connected with a childhood I don't even remember that well. I was in Kindergarten again...no worries in that time that I was painting, no responsibilities, no pain, no anguish...NO IMPULSES TO SET A FIRE! Nothing.

There are a lot of stigma and stereotypes associated with mental illness.
Does depiction of mental illness in movies elevates or reduces such stereotypes?

206,"Hello. I'm looking for an answer and I'm really desperate to get it, so please read this if you think you can help me.
I'm 19, diagnosed with panic disorder but that's most certainly not the only thing I have. I live in a small city where it's very hard to find good doctors and I can't afford to pay for the better ones so I only use free health care. I am on a therapy. 
I do have many problems but I want to ask you about the particular one that no one really provided me the answer to. 
When something monotonic is happening around me or when I do something monotonic, my mind drifts away. What is very important is that I have absolutely no control over this. I only realise this happened when it stops. I cannot tell myself to go back to reality, because I am not aware that I drifted away. Okay, so more about how it looks - my eyes can see and my ears can hear, but the things I see and hear are not processed in my brain at all. It's like my mind is disconnected from my body and the world in general. I know that during that process I think about lots of things that have nothing to do with what is happening, but usually afterwards I can't remember what I was thinking about. When I remember, it's just analysing things that happened recently and overthinking. It's probably important to note that I don't recall thinking about past trauma when this happens (so it's not like something triggered me and I had flashbacks). Also it feels like this thoughts just go on and on like a waterfall and I have no control over them. How do I go back to reality? I can't choose to come back. Usually a loud noise or a fast motion from my surroundings brings me back. Sometimes when there is no loud noise or fast motion for a long time, it just happens without any reason. In this case, the drifting away lasts an hour or more. It happens everyday, especially when I am more stressed than usual. I waste so many hours daily because of this. At school it happened on almost every lesson so I learned literally nothing there and I had to learn everything by myself at home. This was another struggle, because the drifting away happened a lot when I was studying and when my mind would come back to reality I would have a panic attack because of how much time has passed. I blamed and hated myself for this really hard. I slept the maximum of 4 hours a day because so much of my time went wasted on drifting away that I had to cut on sleep to study enough for school. I skipped classes a lot to study on my own too because I knew I wasn't going to be able to learn anything at school and I just couldn't skip sleep any longer. It was a nightmare. Fortunately I graduated high school in April and my life has been a 100 times better since then. I am going to college in January though and I don't think I will survive those years if they will look the same as my high school life. 
My psychologist thought it might be epilepsy, but I had an EEG and brain MRI and the results showed that everything was ok. Now she says that my brain probably does that because it gets bored. Also what differs my symptom from the epilepsy one is that for me it only happens when I'm doing something monotonic. (also it makes reading books so much longer because I constantly have to go back)
Do you know if the thing I described is a symptom of any disorder or something like that? Does this thing have a name? Is there anything I can do to stop this? Or is it just a normal personality trait and I'm exaggerating? 
I really want to stop this and have a normal life. I want to be happy and to have time for hobbies or at least for sleep. Please help me",23Sep2020,1

213,"It's not that I recently got my heart broken or something like that. It's that I'm in a weird situation I haven't been in ever.

The thing is, since puberty started all those years back, I've always had a love interest, and even though we weren't in a relationship most of the time, they still had a special place in my heart.

My most recent relationship ended about a year ago and like always, I instantly had another person in mind (a girl I know from highschool). However we couldn't meet up, because she was traveling the world at the time, and when she came back, the whole Covid thing happened. Due to all this we started meeting again a few weeks ago (covid is mostly under control in my country). Back in highschool we had a special dynamic and she almost became my girlfriend (I was too shy to actually ask her out). So, I thought, when we meet up again, I could finally take the neccessary step. So we met up.

But then I realized that our special dynamic wasn't there anymore. She changed, I changed, it just wasn't like before anymore. She still is an awesome person and a really good friend of mine, but not more than that. So I decided that she's not the one for me, and I'm okay with that. It was my free decision after all.

So now, for the first time since ever, this special place in my heart is empty. I have all this love and I don't know where to put it. I do put a lot of love into my friends, my work, my enviroment, myself, other people, and so on, but that's a different kind of love and it doesn't fullfill my need to put this specific love somewhere.",23Sep2020,1

216,"When I was anywhere from 5-9 years old (I don't remember my age, I just know I was in the house that I lived in when I was those ages) I think I may have been molested. I have a memory of my brother's friend's brother (who is 7 years older than me) babysitting me (I think) and we were playing ""hospital"". He was the doctor and I was lying on my bed and I remember feeling really awkward/uncomfortable. Next thing I remember is us both standing up and him pulling his trousers down to show me his penis. I faintly remember him doing it as he was trying to convince me to pull my trousers down by doing it too. So, I remember then I pulled mine down to show him my vagina. But I have no memory after that. I held on to this memory for ages until I was about 15 and I remember telling it to a group of my friends as I had a moment of realisation that that was not normal, whether he molested me after or not. Then when I was about 17-18 I was drunk walking home from a party and I called my brother and cried to him about it and then when I got home I told my mum and cried more. I remember a little while ago I was looking up ""signs"" you may have been molested and remember I had the following:

- I cannot STAND when people even just lightly touch/poke my upper arm. It makes me cringe so hard and I have to rub it better.
- I don't like hugging people other than my immediate family or boyfriend.
- I always felt weird about older men until I was older, including men in my family like my dad &amp; grandad. I never wanted to be in a bikini or low cut top even in front of my dad or brother. I always felt like older men were looking at me or were interested in me. I remember I had an old man teacher when I was about 13 and I always felt like he was hitting on me/staring at me and felt SO uncomfortable in his class (hopefully it was in my head). 
- I started masturbating when I was around the age of 5-9, again I can't remember which age exactly I just know I was in that house. I remember I started watching porn when I was about 10. 
- When I was 13 my mental health started going downhill. I started cutting, being bulimic, having depression/social anxiety, body dysmorphia, etc. I had really bad mental health until I was about 17, and since then it's still been up and down but not as bad. I still have suicidal thoughts.
- I couldn't put a tampon in for 3-4 years after my period started (when I was 11). Even just touching the tampon lightly to the part when you insert it made me cringe/nearly gag. I physically could not let myself push it in. I remember fearing sex as I thought it would hurt/looked painful.
- I remember I used to be friends with this guy that potentially molested me (meaning I would hang out with him when my brother was hanging out with his brother and our mums were chatting). I remember sitting on his lap once when he was on his computer. But when I got older I remember being really uncomfortable around him the few times I saw him.
- I couldn't take a shower until I was about 10, and couldn't shower alone until I was about 11-12. I remember being scared of the water falling down on me. I've always disliked water being on my face.
- I have fear of abandonment.
- When I was about 16-18 I used to hook up with a lot of guys on Tinder. So much that I didn't tell my friends as I felt I would be judged.
- I had sexual fantasies of rape/abuse from the age of 10. Not so much anymore but a little bit still. 

The list can probably go on. And I know all of these things could just be normal, but these are just what I've seen are potential ""signs"" of molestation. I know I should see therapist, I always rejected going to one as a teenager, and now I can't get myself to do it.

223,"I won’t bore you with my life story. I’ve been in therapy a long time, and have generally given it an honest go. I have seen many different counselors in different cities/states, but see a marginal difference in benefit. 

Today I had a session where I reported on new homework my therapist gave me. She asked me if I’d been doing it, and if so, how was it going? I told her, I have been practicing it, but didn’t notice anything yet, and that I wasn’t sure how it was supposed to make me feel.

For the rest of the session, we had a circular discussion that went like the following:

Her: Well those things take time. You’re not going to see change overnight. 

Me: For sure, I was just saying that because you asked how it’d been going so far. 

Her: Well it won’t work if you don’t give it a chance to. 

Me: That’s not what I’m saying. 

Her: Well you seem to have your mind made up. 

Me: That’s not what I’m saying either. I don’t know yet if it’ll work or not. I’m certainly willing to continue to practice it. 

Her: But I’d you have the mindset that it won’t work, it won’t. You have to decide what you’re willing to change to get better. 

Needless to say, at that point I was frustrated. I’ve been compliant, willing, etc. but simply am candid with how I’m feeling—which I thought was the goal in therapy. Sure, I’ve expressed worry that I’m too broken for therapy because it’s never had a profound effect on my life. Yet she makes it out like I’m some child who’s unhappy with my situation but also unwilling to do anything about it; when only the former is true, and the latter is that I’m unsure of what to feel about it when months go by and I’ve been putting in the work and feel the same. 

I’ve tried different therapists and I have heard this sentiment from maybe only 2 others. 

Still, I don’t know if it’s because I have comorbid ADHD that affects the way I’m able to practice things like meditation, thought stopping, etc. Or if it’s just largely situational. But I feel like giving up again.

I’ve struggled with suicidal instincts and bipolar disorder all of my life, and these are some of the best reminders I tell myself. Hopefully they provide something for someone :)

- Even in the deepest despairs of life, there is always something to be happy about. It’s so easy to be swallowed whole by the negative emotions, but purposely looking for things to love is a small and powerful way to cope. That frog on the sidewalk, the smell of gasoline, the feeling of a wool blanket, etc.

- Small steps lead to leaps and bounds. Making even the slightest changes can have impressively impactful effects on our psyches. For example, if you struggle with self confidence to the point you hate looking in mirrors, noting even one tinyyy thing about yourself you life is a small step in the right direct.

- Life is incredibly unpredictable; it can whip you around into the worst shape of your life and pound you into a puddle, but it can also completely turn around and present you with opportunities that can change things forever. You will never know what amazing and beautiful experiences you’ll miss out on. 

- Perspective can take a powerful reign over a situation. Mental illnesses tends to lie to us and make it so that we may perceive reality in negative a way, even if it’s not the truth. Getting sucked into those cycles of negativity is so easy, but taking a step back and trying to look at the facts of the situation and other possibilities instead of obsessing over the worst outcomes.


Most importantly, I hope you all stay safe and be kind to yourselves in these tough times. If you’re struggling, never be afraid to reach out to someone you trust or a hotline :)",23Sep2020,1

229,"So, I'm 24 currently doing my masters in a totally new country. I'm from asia but moved to europe to do my masters. That is not going well since I'm most probably going to fail as this course seems way out of capabilities.
I've had depression since i was 15 and i was very suicidal until a few years ago. Because of which, i was unable to do any work and got fired from the 2 jobs i tried to work. Although I'm on meds for depression and bipolar now, they don't really help as much.
Since moving, my suicidal thoughts have increased a lot and has left me unable to go on with my daily life normally. Its hard to explain to my family since they don't really believe in depression as much. And if i fail my masters, I have no backup plan for my career.

I have done therapy for almost 2 years and been on meds for a year but nothing has helped as much, my anxiety and suicidal thoughts dont go away and affect my daily life and anything i try to do.
How do people with depression and suicidal thoughts go on with their life? I just find it so hard to even do anything at all.

Two years ago a doctor told me I had it but I just didn’t believe it. I suffered from anxiety before and I was unable to enjoy myself and also thought negatively about myself. Now even though I have mild hallucinations I absolutely love getting pleasure out of anything I want, I just lie to myself basically and believe that something is a certain way. So I have to believe people think about me in a positive way and that I wanna do good things for them. Once I believed that my girlfriend was accusing me of cheating but read the messages again months later and I cried because she was telling me that she loved me. I know it’s so messed up how I perceive things differently, it’s just that I am unaware of my mental state at the time. I go big when I do something and it’s usually because of some fascination or fetish instead of actual care or what I’m supposed to do. I don’t set out to hurt people and my intentions are not out of anger. When I believe something or someone will have a certain effect I will adjust my life to fit those needs.",23Sep2020,1

I got in to depression and my councillors and psychiatrist  and stuff put me on meds and stuff and everything never helped anyway now that im 19 my life hasn’t changed I’m bottling everything up inside I feel like I’m faking all my emotions and I feel like a fraud I’m too afraid to even step one foot out my door for no reason at all, I still haven’t had any look with work and I don’t know where my life is. I’m still very paranoid and I’m feeling delusional and I think I got derealised from smoking, like sometimes my hands feel very alien and looking through my eyes at my torso or my surrounding seems very stretched and realer than real if that makes sense, I’m very sensitive to orange light and makes me anxious for some reason (mainly at night) also. I’m paranoid as hell and overthinking everything I’m in my room 24/7 I feel very unhealthy and selfconscious. 

Im too afraid to start my medication( I haven’t took them for nearly 2 years) as I’m very paranoid that the government has put stuff in there to control or brainwash me or put harmful stuff in there and I always read the side effects which make me extra paranoid, but I want to start my medication because I know I really need help I need to change and get my life back but I don’t want to tell my mom everything cuz I know she’s gonna get worried.(she’s aware I don’t take my meds but she advises me to).
I’m  also having very very bad intrusive thoughts so bad I feel like driving a screwdriver or anything in my brain to just make them stop they are probably harming me the most mentally, they are very messed up and makes me sick. I also don’t want to reach out because I’m starting to believe I’m a fraud and I faked my depression years ago even though I didn’t and it’s making me paranoid and sad.
I honestly feel so fucking alone I’m always overthink and trapped in my head it’s like I only live in my thoughts and I’m a prisoner to myself, I feel like a fake, a fraud like I’m faking fb every aspect of my emotions and I put on a fake personality to everyone, I never get to be myself .
I want to die but I’m too afraid to do anything 
I just don’t know what to do
The only reason why I’m here because I don’t want to hurt my mom or family anymore I still want to make her proud before I leave this earth but I don’t think I can much longer like I’m afraid I might reach a breaking point one day in the future.

After getting out of my abusive marriage. This year, for some reason I don't feel excited anymore. I'm actually feeling anxious, numb, and it is giving me this chill that I might break down and cry.

7 years with my ex, every time it's my birthday he would give me surprised but in the end he would made me feel so guilty for his surprised. And he also would reminded me how terrible a human I am for not being grateful just because I upset him about something. Last year, he actually made me cry in the restaurant just because he said I offended him for some questions. Because I'm just want to make regular conversation. When best friend of mine gave me surprised without telling him. He was so pissed that I got surprised birthday party without inviting him, because she thought he supposed to work that weekend. I came home from the party and got yelled by him because he was waiting for me while I was having fun. And again, I can't even save this little bit of happiness that someone that care for me. The year before that, he made me feel guilty after taking me out of town for couple days. In 2017, he was cheating with his best friend. Took her with us to this restaurants and ate at the same table as me. While he actually dating her. When I thought he changed into a better husband who is treating me with love, respect, and patience. But I found that is just a lied. And the year before that, there was always something in the end of my birthday that he would make me feel bad that he was giving surprised and celebrate it with me.

This year, I'm finally celebrating with myself and my dog. I get this anxiety that I shouldn't celebrate it. Because I get trigger by all this memory. I don't feel special anymore. I feel I'm a burden if someone decided to surprised me with something.",23Sep2020,1

But in each of these occurrences, the same symptoms occur: nausea, heart palpitations, and restless legs.

So i have been staying over my bfs house for a good while now. Lately i have found out his parents house is infested with roaches. 
I am extremely afraid of them and they disgust me and since i live with a mother who is extremely clean and we had never suffered from a roach infestation before this really bothered me and made me uncomfortable. 

I immediately went to tell my bf and the next morning he told his mom to get an exterminator to eliminate the roaches. She literally said “theres no need to” and started spraying insecticide which in all honesty isnt working because theyve moved from the kitchen to my bf computer desk. His whole family( mom dad 3 bros and bro’s gf) doesnt seem to care that there is a roach infestation going on and this is making my anxiety spark and im literally not sleeping well and night. i have become completely paranoid itching myself all the time and ive come to the point where im imagining roaches everywhere. I really want to break down and cry. 
I am not even eating food from here and i dont want to touch anything from the kitchen. They even let dirty dishes sit over night and leave food crumbs and stuff all over the kitchen. There is a plate with a dead roach on it that has been sitting there for 4 days!!!! 
It f*cks me up that they dont even care about all this. Im starting to think even an exterminator wont fix the problem since they leave dirty stuff and food everywhere.

252,"I really hope the following does not come across like I’m giving a lecture.  It honestly breaks my heart to see how many people are in so much pain and this is my attempt at helping.  I know depression very well, first hand.  I’ve struggled with depression all my life.  But I’ve found some healthy (and some very unhealthy) ways to deal with it.  I’ll recommend two positive ways I’ve learned to deal.  

First, I’ll start with the easier one and then second, I’ll explain the one that will take a bit more effort and a bit more discipline.  

First, and this will sound counterintuitive, but help someone out there who is in a similar situation as yourself.  Help someone in need.  Scroll through this subreddit or r/depression and find someone who is suicidal and talk them off the ledge.  (Unfortunately, there is no shortage of people who feel and post about feeling suicidal on Reddit.). You can save a fucking life!  Like, right now!  Can you imagine doing something more important with your life?  Something more meaningful than that?  And by helping others, you will help yourself at the same time.  Please take it from me; I have been struggling with very bad depression (and I mean VERY bad) my whole life, since I was about 13.  (I’m 31 now.)  But it helps tremendously to reach out to others who are in the same (sinking) boat as yourself and save them from drowning.  Throw them a life vest.  Things will get better.  People do care about you.  I care about all of you.  All of you mean something to me and all of you matter.  Mental illness is a fucking bitch, but it’s a fucking bitch that you can control.  You just need to collect some tools in your mental tool kit to control it.  

Second, and this one is going to be a harder sell but, here it goes, TRY MEDITATION.  I know that probably sounds lame and boring, and played out.  But I’m telling you, try it.  It works.  You need mindfulness meditation.  It will be able to get you through the worst depression and anxiety.  To start, download a meditation app that will teach you how to begin and then just try it for a day.  Or even just search YouTube for a guided meditation for depression.  Hell, just play the guided meditation while you fall asleep at night if that’s all you can muster; but do it.  It will help you.  

I am here for anyone on here that’s suffering.  You’ve got this.",23Sep2020,1

As I’m sure we are all experiencing, this year has given us all a severe battering. I’ve felt it too but somehow up until now have held onto a sliver of optimism and I’ve recently felt that slip away and I’m going downhill fast.
I should also say as well as pandemic and living in California (wildfires have been an issue last few weeks so we haven’t even been able to leave the house) I also live away from my family (I’m from the UK) and have been told I cannot leave the country for the foreseeable future and they cannot come here so I have no idea when I’ll see them again. Not having home and family around me during this time has been hard, but now to not even know when I will ever again is really fucking hard. 
I do all the things you are meant to (meditate, eat well; exercise) but where I’m hugely struggling is my focus and productivity. I have severe brain fog. I’m missing things I shouldn’t and can barely make decisions.
This is I know because of my mind but the problem is I’ve started a new job 3 months ago which was quite a step up and position of power and responsibility. But I can barely figure out what I’m meant to be doing and of course don’t want to fail or look like I’m failing. Do I talk to my boss??? Or am I too new?
