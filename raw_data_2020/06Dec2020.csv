2,"To start off I want to mention a few things: I have no history of mental illness, I have never been in therapy, and I have never had depressive, anxietal, or suicidal thoughts or tendencies. Not sure if this is important as context. Anyway, to my question: I was in an abusive relationship for nearly 3 years a while back. During that time, I actively trained my brain to repress in order to cope. As a result I have very limited memory of those three years. Unfortunately it seems that I never unlearned that repression, and eversince then I have had horrible memory, or at least it feels that way. It seems that I can't retain information (or remember anything properly for that matter) anymore. Is that possible, and if so, how do I undo this?",06Dec2020,1
3,"Backstory shortly: I have had depression from about age 8. Family sucks/sucked etc, then divorce happened (which helped the situation a lot) and at age 14 I found myself first time on the adge of a cliff. It did get a bit better later, but upp until I was 17 I didn't think anyone could ever love me. Not a family member, lover, friend, no one. Just that I have a lot of trauma and such already built upp, so my mental state isn't this bad just from recent events.

2020 has beem rough, for me as well, but not because of covid. Of course it is incredibly unfortunate, it has put a strain on me as well, but living in a country that handled the situation well, much hasn't changed and my social life didn't disappear. Actually my self esteem has risen like a helium ball and it has stayed up. I do believe that many people love me and I finally think that I am pretty. 

I have been in love with this man for 1,5 years now and last may I got rejected by him. (He had a girlfriend) that really bummed me out, but it was tolerable and I was starting to get past that, I truly started to build the relationship as friends, wanted to meet his gf, etc and it was going well in august. Around these times I past out in my shower and my apertment flooded (I live alone) I had to move to my friends place for 2months, not having any personal space and having to work full time. During this me and mu chrush became very close and he admited having feelings for me, said that he could see us dating, but not yet, because his gf is his first priority, even tho he was breaking up with her. This messed me and my progress getting over him upp obviously. We agreed that we are friends now and we can meet as friends, but nothing more. We don't want to be part of cheating. BUT we saw each other almost daily and he was still open about his chrush on me. During the 2months I slept at least 5times at his house (on the floor, no cheating) and he supported me a lot trough the tough autumn. We hanged together all day long, or right after our workdays were over. We went to cafes, bars, walks, I helped him move and was the person seeing his apartment with him for the first time. I concidered this all to be social cheating and in my mind I gave him 4weeks time to move to his new apartment, settle down and figure his shit out. 
To cut things short we now don't see each other, he hurt me a lot by saying that being with me was a mistake, he didn't know if he would miss me in his life etc, even tho not even week before that, he wass all about being always there for me. 
Also: now I'm in over 15, 000€ dept because of the renevation in my apartment. 

So now I have no one to talk to, because he was the one I leaned on, I am in huge dept for a person my age (+student loans) my insurance wont help, and I can't get a loan. I also miss him alot. Now I'm on the verge of suicide again (I want to say AGAIN that there are many other reasons before these events, why my mental health is bad) I don't eat, and depression meds do not work. 

Oh god",06Dec2020,1
4,"I was diagnosed just over a week ago with BPD, and I am getting so many mixed opinions. Some people say that it's a big deal, then no big deal, them some people saying its just a made up thing together!? It's super confusing and I just want to get better. I have such a hard time socialising, I get confused with my emotions and my confusion is getting even worse now because I don't even know what to believe. 

Psychiatrist says I 100% have it, then my friends say it's far too common to even care about, then my therapist is telling me its complete bullshit! I just want to progress but how can I when all this is going on!!",06Dec2020,1
5,"Trigger warning; discussion of serious mental health issues ensues.

Sorry, it's a long read, please hear me out.

28M for context. I really feel like I just need to get this off my chest. If I can say all this openly to another human being it wont feel so isolating. I KNOW it's a fucking long read but man, if someone can just hear me out here please. I dont know how to really talk to about this in a serious sense, I joke with my friends and coworkers about mental health. And I know some of them have issues too, but it's hard to talk about with them. I'm just scared for my mental health lately. I've come a REALLY long way from where I used to be, a very dark place, multiple times. And I can feel myself slipping.  

I've been mostly good for the past like 2 years. Trying to do better I stopped drinking every day and stopped smoking cigs, but still smoke too much weed and occasional vape pen. Was self medicating as an alcoholic for awhile but decided against it because it made it harder to keep in control of my mental state and actions. It's almost like there is an invisible barrier, a thin viel, separating me from what like a psychotic break, or just a breakdown. A mental state where you lose control of your actions and that scares the fuck out of me honestly, I barely survived that shit before. Used to SH and a bunch if bad shit like sui ideation, but not letting myself do anything now. But the thought I could slip back to that if I'm not careful REALLY scares me. Its fucking hard man.

 It's almost like a wave that goes between being okay and being depressed. But the troughs have been lower lately, i.e. the past few troughs have been bad and I feel like I'm headed for another trough now, but could just as well be fine in a few days. Its fucking confusing af. 

One big thing that I'm SUPER scared of is dating. So I've pretty much entirely avoided for the past few years. Multiple times, like 5/6 times, dating has triggered full on mental breakdowns that took weeks to months to recover from. I think I have some serious trust and value issues. My exex gf flipped out and physically attacked me, crushed my trachea with her thumbs. I pushed her off of me, that's the ONLY time I have responded physically to a woman and I still feel terrible about it.. I was in the wrong physically disciplining (not harmfully mind you just a bop on the nose) my roommates dog but I only did what my roommate had told me to do. So that was pretty FUCKED up, we broke up afterward it was the right thing to do. Didnt date after that. And my most recent ex gf's babies daddy had killed himself less than 1 year before we started dating. From what I understand he was grief stricken because she dumped him and was going to leave the state right before their daughter was born. Heavy stuff... Then on the 1 year anniversary of that, she understandably needed space and broke up with me. It is what it is, but it really made me feel absolutely fucking terrible, took me like 6 months to get back to baseline. 

NOW, I want so badly to date again and find someone, but I know it's a terrible fucking idea.  There's this girl at my work I've been friends with for over a year. And I REALLY care about her, she is super special to me, and absolutely a wonderful person. I keep thinking there is some kind of deeper connection there, the other day she called me sexy lol! And like, a week ago as I was leaving work she said I love you KAILASH, responded that I loved her too, which is true. But like, friends can love each other too. But the sexy makes me think... 

On the other hand, both of us should absolutely NOT be dating anyone right now. Her BF (my friend-coworker as well) just died from a heart attack like 6 months ago. Right about the same time that my precious dogo passed away. He had been with me since I was 13/14. Been really fucking depressed since then. And I know shes been going through a lot. That's why I just wanna hang out and talk things out with her. Maby we can help each other find solice by having someone to talk to. I'm just so fucking scared it will (or wont) turn into some thing more. And somehow that could trigger another mental breakdown. FUCK! 

Alright, I feel a little bit better getting that off my chest. I'm usually a really outwardly positive person, which makes it so hard to actually share my emotions. Damn, I didnt think my situation was that bad but after writing it all out it sounds pretty bad. And my dating luck has been fucking terrible. Honestly I'm just hanging in there, taking it 1 day at a time, and trying to be as true to myself as possible.",06Dec2020,1

7,"My father has been seeing a psychiatrist that screams adderall is not an option for him because of his age. He had been prescribed 20 mg xr in past before moving to Florida by a trusted doctor who I do not think would have prescribed it if it was as bad of an issue as they make it seem for his heart health. He’s 58, about 175 lbs and may have pre-diabetes. He also has drunken soda and energy drinks, caffeine aspirin supplements daily for a long time and has been doing it more steadily with energy drinks since not being allowed to remain on the adderall so it’s kinda worrying off the already blatant disregard this psych has for him. She wants to try every med in the book and does not seem like there’s much rhyme or reason nor does she talk about any of his past experiences or issues, tho my dad can’t keep straight all the meds he’s tried in the past. 

He has taken wellebuttrin in the past and that made him feel evened out but still pretty dissapointed and lack of drive or happy feelings. When he had adderall for the short period, he says he felt actually good, and stable. He had cut out almost all caffeine and sugary drinks, seemed like he could handle his strong emotional outbursts a lot better, and even said thanks to me one day at work because he truly felt calmed and normal. I have very similar feelings to him on it much of the time and I was so happy he was experiencing what I have and did not seem to be affecting him at all negatively. I do not want to play doctor here and say these are valid observations, but I don’t trust this psych, seems super old-school and just there to get a paycheck.

I would like to know any possible moves to suggest for my dad, he’s looked into online adhd assessments from email ads, not sure if those  are legit would love to hear experiences on those. If anyone knows of some adhd friendly clinics In Florida or online to suggest that would be great! We do not want to do something that would harm my dads health and he totally understands that, but at this point, it just seems like even if the adderall was a little worse for his heart, it would be really a lot better for him to be on it and not consuming so much heart and vein-stressing material. He also has had a tough life and the adderall I think could make him come to terms with more stuff and not be super stressed. I hope this doesn’t come off bad, I just really could use some general advice on any of this, please feel free to comment on something you see that strongly hits you!

Thanks!!",06Dec2020,1
8,"Context: My friend is my very recent ex who suffers from a major bipolar disorder that results in severe mood swings based on stress with manic episodes when overwhelmed.

So my ex, now friend, was under an extreme amount of stress due to her college work and studies (her teachers aren't amazing and they love piling work onto their students), alongside a few mild communication issues in our relationship which were amplified due to her mood swings. (Which I assured her weren't taken personally since I completely understand what she's going through after having had a brother with the same disorder.) Due to this incredibly high level of stress, she went into a manic episode overnight, and I woke up to a flurry of messages with the end result being a breakup, due to the stress of the issues alongside the obligations she felt from a relationship. That part is something that can be managed, however, because of this manic episode, she lapsed into an emotionally numb state (which she has said is very likely the reason she decided to break up rather than finally properly communicate), this state has made her very harsh, distant, and emotionally unavailable, which really worries me. She is unable to seek treatment, since due to her school, she doesn't have time, or money, and the nearest psychiatrist to her is 3 hours away from her. So I was hoping that I could get some sort of advice or something to help her through this emotionally numb state, both for her health and the sake of our relationship, as with my own mental health issues, the split has been very painful and she thinks she may be unable to be with me due to her state if it persists beyond college. (Her college year ends in May.)",06Dec2020,1
9,"Pretty dramatic, I know. 

Each night I go to sleep and there is a little part of me that hopes I just don’t wake up. 

I have disliked myself for so long. Since I was 15 (I’m 24). I can’t see it getting better. And I can’t see myself liking myself. I feel like I have nothing to contribute. No talent to show. I’m a waste. I don’t have anything that I’m good at and I’m back to being unemployed living with my parents. I had a good job that I left for another job which I ended up hating. So well done me for fucking myself over there. 

I see no light at the end of the tunnel. How can I continue the rest of my life when I have to be me?",06Dec2020,1
10,"So I had a really shitty summer. I was stuck in a very toxic and emotionally abusive relationship. I started dating my ex back in December. I saw red flags but I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt. As time went by they became more and more possessive, aggressive, guilt trippy and controlling. I tried to get out of the relationship but she would guilt me
Back into it and convince me I was the problem. Because of covid we moved in together and my summer well... it was really shit. I was constantly gas lighted, belittled, guilt tripped. She had me convinced I was abusive and a horrible person. She also accused me of cheating when I hadn’t, would pressure me to have sex, and scold me constantly. I was basically walking on eggshells. It got to the point where I was severely depressed and so doubtful of myself. She had entrained in me that I was the problem, that I was abusive (even though I’ve only had healthy relationships and am friends with all my previous partners). After I shared with her that my dad was abusive and would ignore me as his main way of punishing me, she started doing it to me. That’s when it got too much, I began having suicidal thoughts and this one night I felt an impulse to kill myself. I asked for help and she ignored my texts and knocks to her door. After calling the suicide hotline, the phone operator urged me to call a friend to pick me up, so I did. The was the last night I spent in that house. Later I found out that my ex started spreading rumors that I was an abusive guy and had Borderline Personality Disorder. I could talk forever about all the horrible things she did and said... 

Anyways it’s been a few months since I last saw her (back in August) and I’ve met a very nice girl recently. We just started dating and I’ve noticed I can’t get myself to completely take down my walls around her. And trust me, she is very different from my ex - don’t see any red flags. She is kind, patient, and sweet. She doesn’t yell at me and she doesn’t make me feel like my ex did. But I still find myself unable to give her my full me. Like I disassociate when I’m around her. I know I should be having a good time but it’s like I’m just sitting there with my arms around her and I feel nothing. After she leaves I try to remember what we even did that day and I can’t seem to recollect. It’s like there’s this barrier stopping me from caring for this girl as much as I would want to. I know it’s connected to my ex - I’m self aware enough. I am not and was never in love with my ex - but the hurt and abuse they put me through is still raw. I want to move on, but I don’t know how to. I feel guilty that I am not fully here for my current girlfriend. It’s like my brain is trying to protect me by not letting me trust or feel anything. Has anyone been through something similar?",06Dec2020,1

12,"(Trigger Warning for Eating Disorder, self harm, suicide)

I know being hospitalized is really scary and super expensive but I really don’t want to go to school anymore because of how bad my mental state is.

1. I’m binging and purging without my parents knowing. I’m currently at a BMI of about 21, so I’m no where near underweight. So I doubt I need inpatient treatment for my eating disorder. I go to outpatient treatment regularly where they helped me gain wait and recover from my eating disorder, but it’s getting bad again, and I’m not able to listen to my outpatient treatment team’s advice because I feel the need to lose weight. I’m purging into bowls and hiding the bowls, I have several containers of discarded food hidden in my room that I was supposed to eat but I didn’t want to.

2. I’m self harming. They aren’t deep cuts, only hitting styro. My parents don’t know about this and neither does my therapist. But it scares me since I’m doing it more often.

3. I’m compulsively exercising. After my parents go to bed I exercise for two hours every night. Walking back and forth, running back and forth in my room, etc.

4. Suicidal thoughts. I don’t have a method that works so I’m not going to actually attempt, I don’t have a plan, but I have a lot of passive suicidal thoughts (pretty sure I can’t be hospitalized for passive thoughts, only active ones)

The thing is, I really want to stop purging and cutting and over-exercising, but at home, my parents will have to force me to stop and that’s going to ruin my relationship with my parents. I don’t want them to have to watch me 24/7 and monitor me. I’d rather go to a psychiatric hospital where they can monitor me and force me to stop. Because with my parents I know I’d probably fight back, but I wouldn’t fight back with actual doctors and nurses. 

And I can’t pay attention at school and my grades are dropping since I’m not doing schoolwork. Which is why I think I just need to be removed from school for a while, just work on recovery and then come back. But I don’t feel sick enough to need hospitalization since I’m not underweight and my cuts are shallow. I feel like I’m attention seeking for wanting hospitalization.

I’m just making myself vomit several times a day and I’m so worried about what’s going to happen in the future.

TLDR: I want to be hospitalized because I feel like I’m a danger to myself but am I actually a danger to myself or am I just being dramatic?",06Dec2020,1

14,"I’m an 18 yo girl, about to turn 19 in a month, and I’ve had this problem all of my life. I especially noticed the problem when I was in 8th grade and a guy I liked showed the slightest interest in me. This was the first time it happened. 

Long story short, the guy I liked was friends with my brother and we were giving him a ride to play practice. He was super nice and funny and he would always have a smile on his face. Anyways, my brother stopped at our house to grab something and then come back. While he was in the house, the guy literally asked me a simple question: “How are you?” My heart dropped I felt like this cloud of darkness and warmth came over me. It felt like waves of warmth were going down my body. Like a heat flash. I kinda stayed quiet until we reached a McDonalds drive through when all of a sudden, I said “I’m gonna be sick”. I jumped out of the car, ran inside of the McDonalds bathroom and threw up. This continued on weeks. I never told him he was the reason I would always get sick though. Sometimes he’d text me and we’d be having a conversation when all of a sudden, that cloud came over me and I would run to the bathroom and throw up. (Nothing ever happened between us though and we remained friends)

Another time this happened was in 10th grade after I had just got done with the first night of our school’s musical. Most of the cast went to Hoss afterwards and I had liked this boy. My mom, trying to be a “wing woman” offered to give him a ride with my brother and me to which he said “sure!” My heart was racing during that car ride and I tried my best to calm down. When we got to Hoss, He sat at the head of the table and I sat to his right. I tried my best to keep my cool and talk to him. However, I could feel the anxiety coming though and I felt sick to my stomach. Finally that cloud hit and I excused myself and kept my cool until I reached the bathroom and threw up. This happened again when I was in his senior project. We were filming and I had been fine for most of the night. Finally, He was filming someone else and I was taking a break when all of a sudden, I felt nauseous and I ran upstairs and threw up. No one actually knew I had thrown up except my one friend who I told. It happened so quickly and I wasn’t sick before. To calm me down, I could not be near him. If I got near him, I would feel nauseous again. Once again, nothing ever happened between us other than going to prom as friends. Btw, I threw up when I got home that night. 

In 11th grade, I began showing interest in this one guy and he also showed interest in me. Finally one day, he actually told me that he had feelings for me and I was surprised he actually said something. On the outside, I was keeping my cool, but on the inside, I wanted to throw up. I told him we could try, but finally I excused myself and I went upstairs and had a panic attack. Didn’t throw up but I sure felt nauseous. Luckily for me, he was super understanding and knew I had anxiety. He was patient with me and we formed somewhat of a relationship. (We were a “thing” for a few months but ultimately, it didn’t work out. He’s the closest to a bf I’ve ever had). 

Finally we reach present day and the guy I’ve had this huge crush on since middle school is showing interest in me. He’s 4 years older then me but we’ve always had a super chill friendship. Lately, we’ve been texting everyday and my anxiety with boys has chilled out a little bit, but not completely. I still feel this dark cloud come over me with those heat-flash like feelings and I still get nauseous, but I’ve managed to not throw up. I get close though. 

So at the moment, My family is quarantined and I’ve been feeling sick. I was talking to him today and he asked me how I was feeling. I said I feel like poop and that I think I’m sick. Then he said “I was going to say that we should get lunch sometime but I’ll need a hazmat suit!” That did it. I’ve never sprung up so quickly. My heart started racing. Heat flash feelings. Nauseous feeling kicked in. Internal screaming. One part of me excited while the other part of me wants to throw up. The guy I have liked since middle school mentioned going to lunch. I went from being excited and shocked to: “I’m gonna be sick”. I had to take some anxiety medication from that text. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I know this is not how I should feel. I should feel excited and overjoyed, but instead I feel anxiety, nauseousness, and like crying. 

It’s like, I feel like I can like someone, but once they show any sign that they liked me back, I retreat. My anxiety with boys has calmed down enough that I’m fine if someone likes me, but I don’t like them back. However, it goes all sicko mode if I liked them, and they show signs of liking me back. One could say I’m confusing excitement and butterflies with anxiety, but if excitement and butterflies makes me feel like yacking... I don’t want it. 
I’m 18 yo, about to turn 19, and I’ve never been on a date. I’ve never had my first kiss. I’ve never slow danced. I’ve never had a real, full-on boyfriend. I thought my anxiety would get better as I grew up, but I still feel like that girl from 8th grade who throws up when a guy I liked showed interest in me. I want to find a guy and fall in love, but it’s like my anxiety physically won’t let me. I know this sounds childish but I feel absolutely miserable in these moments. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if this is normal. I can’t put into words how bad this feeling is. Why do boy literally make me sick! I’d love to hear your thoughts and advice.",06Dec2020,1

17,"I am working on an interview video with a psychologist to discuss mental health issues specifically related to this holiday season. (I would like to have it released in the next 10-14 days.) I am hoping to get some insight from others about their personal concerns or questions that they may have. Broad questions/concerns are fine too. What are you most worried about? Do you have any plans to deal with distance from family? (Like Skype or Zoom?) What is going to be the big difference this year that is affecting you most? Do you have children at home and are you concerned about dealing with their cabin fever? Is there a question you would like to ask a psychologist this holiday season?

Please note that I will not be responding directly as I am not a psychologist and I am not qualified. I am making this video with someone who is qualified and my hope is to provide helpful information and ideas. Assuming my posting this here is okay with the mods, I will provide a link to the video here when it is uploaded.

I’m not even playing video games anymore. I just stay in the bed, or just spend the day in a daze or in my own world, not accomplishing shit. The quarantine gave me one of the best opportunities and I just spent it doing nothing. Absolutely nothing. I spent it wallowing with my shitty mental health and depression/anxiety. I don’t know really what to do anymore. I’m not motivated to do anything and it seems like I can’t do anything productive anymore.

20,"Hi. It's my first time posting on here. I honestly don’t know where to start in all honesty, I’m just trying to type down what I feel and maybe hope that people will understand where it’s coming from or understand what I’m trying to say cause I have no one else to talk to about it, so pardon the word vomit.

So. I have been feeling really “weird” lately… Not all the time, but I do when I come home. I don’t really know what I’m *actually* feeling in all honesty, but most of the time I just feel this *immense* sadness and tiredness (mentally).

I’m 22 years old. I currently live with my family. Dad, step-mom, big bro and little sister. Before this, I lived with my mom and two older sisters for around 6 years. I’d like to add that me and my brother are currently in the process of moving out since that’s going to be an important detail in this story. Anyways, I had a pretty good dynamic with my mom when I used to live with her. She understood me, I understood her. She adapted to me, I adapted to her. She didn’t hold me back from getting the freedom i wanted. In return, I didn’t abuse that freedom. It was a two way thing because that’s how relationships are supposed to work. 

Going back to it, I currently live with my dad. My dad has always been a strong and authoritative character. He has his good sides and he has his bad sides like everyone else. The first few months of living with him again was okay despite the few instances we had misunderstandings here and there. He was also very affectionate with us… But everything just suddenly spiralled when we got into this huge argument. Long story short, we had this huge misunderstanding and he threw this jab at me when he was talking to my brother and I was really hurt by it so I tried confronting him about it, but he started shouting at me and cutting me off so I couldn’t explain my side properly. I was really hurt by it because I feel like he didn’t even want to try to hear me out. We didn’t speak for days after that. I didn’t really want to talk to him either because whenever I thought about talking to him, I just feel like all my energy just leaves my body. I knew that he had a fault in the situation, but I also don’t deny that I had a fault too. So I apologized first and tried to explain my side again. We made up but the conversation and apology didn’t really make me feel better at all because in the end, he made it about him. It made me realize how unwilling my dad was in terms of adjusting to other people, most especially his own kids. All my life that I’ve known my dad, his ways and rules are *law*. We can’t do anything about it. He doesn’t adjust to you, you adjust to him…. Realizing that made me incredibly frustrated and unhappy. All my life I have been trying to adjust to him, because… well he’s my *dad.* Why shouldn’t I, right?

After that fight, I noticed I became so withdrawn whenever I come home. I was my usual self at work and with other people, but I started dreaded going home because of that thought and realization. The thought of just interacting with my dad just made me upset and anxious. It got worse when my brother told me that he and dad talked about our move out *and* me. He said some pretty hurtful things about me and I realized how low he thinks of me. I was just heartbroken because I was pretty okay with myself, I never put myself down nor put myself on a pedestal… I just thought of myself as someone who was doing alright and is okay. But when my brother told me what my dad thought of me, I just crashed. We were in the supermarket that time and I was nearly in tears and I tried holding back from crying because I was in public. It got *even* worse when me and my brother finally signed the lease to our new place and started buying stuff for our new place. He suddenly gets defensive and asks why were buying certain stuff and why we’re not involving him (which we *are*, mind you, we update him to what we’re doing) and he argues and makes assumptions like that we don’t involve him cause he doesn’t want us to be with him…. I honestly don’t know what to do or say about it anymore. We try reasoning with him and try to explain that that wasn’t the case, but he only views the black and whites. After that, I became totally withdrawn whenever I was at home. It’s weird, being so cheery and energetic at work but as soon as I step foot in the house, I felt like a completely different person. I felt so drained when I was at home to the point that I didn’t really speak nor interact with *anyone*. Even my siblings. I just speak when spoken to. I tried doing stuff that usually cheer me up (like drawing or watching stuff i liked), but it didn’t really help. During those days, I tried sleeping earlier so I don’t have to interact with anyone and I could leave the house to go to work to be myself again. I’ve broken down in tears quite a few times and cried myself to sleep almost every night. There was one point where I just had a panic attack and my brother had to help me and one point where I thought about disappearing. 

By this point, I didn’t know what was happening to me. I thought “Am I depressed? Should I seek help??” but then there was this voice at the back of my head that told me that my dad would say “Why would you be depressed? You eat good food, have a good job, you sleep on a bed, and you got a nice family even though it’s dysfunctional. You have no reason to be sad.” and it made me feel even worse about the situation. It felt like I had no right to be sad. I didn’t go through any traumatizing thing growing up. I didn’t have any triggering reasons for my feelings. That’s why I was really hesitant to open up to anyone about it. I didn’t understand what was happening to me, so how would anyone else understand me? I also didn’t want it to seem like I blamed my dad on the situation. My dad is a good person in general. I don’t want him to feel like he made me feel like this and beat himself up. But… I really don’t know how to explain it to anyone else. Am I over exaggerating? Are my feelings valid even if it’s really so small?? I’m just so tired.",06Dec2020,1
21,"I'm so upset at fact I always feel lonely and depressed and anxious and how It will never go away

And memories in school coming back and bullying and racism and it's getting to me again. Feel like they right behind me

I feel like I can't go on I can't live anymore


Feel like giving up",06Dec2020,1
22,"Im 16F. For a long time I've felt like im going insane in that I have weird thoughts. As in they are not necessarily negative. But weird thoughts. 

For example, constantly thinking about scenarios and I mean literally hundreds of scenarios in which I talk to people. As in these are people in real life that I havent spoken to because im too shy or whatever. Usually it is always the same person that crops up (a teacher). And like I dont have this teacher currently. But I still keep thinking of her. 

And this teacher i never particularly liked having I felt she was critical of me and I still fear she didn't like me. However, in my thoughts she likes me. And is really caring towards me. Some times it goes too far in that I had thoughts of sexual nature about her. As in imagining us having sex. I've also imagined sex with imaginary women. I know this fucking weird and I dont know where to put this. I might take this down later because this is so embarrassing. And im so scared that people know my account and everything im thinking. And im having to fight these thoughts to post this. Sometimes I have thought of her as vulnerable and thought about hurting her. Even though she's done nothing. And these thoughts are really confusing me.  

She's not the only person that I've thought of. Although she is the main one. I have thought of other women or female teachers as caring towards me. However, these are all fantasies and they have never ever been replicated in real life. In fact in real life I seem to be distant and excessively shy. However, I am shy and struggle alot with social situations and making friends however, that's an entirely different problem. 

But this teacher. I deliberately memorise the times in which I've seen her walking in the corridor from lesson to lesson and will be there at those times so that I can look at her. At sometimes I really want her to notice me.  Which is really weird considering the fact that im so shy I avoid every single person. And get really anxious when someone looks at me. And when I think about telling someone that I self harm I think of her. Even though that would be illogical as in real life im so scared of her and also dislike her and dont trust her. But yet in my mind I fantasise about her.

These thoughts remind me of around January I would have this sudden urge to kiss the person in front of me. As in every person I spoke to. Even my parents. But I've stopped that. However, it did recently happen with my sibling.

These thoughts also remind me of 2 years ago. When the same thing would happen with a male teacher. However as soon as it he left school. It was over. But with this teacher even after she no longer teaches me I still think of her. And I dont know if its that I always thought they could help me. As I've struggled with my mental health alot and no one knows. 

I dont know what this is. But I really need some advice. I've bottled this up for ages and have been in denial for so long. But I want someone to maybe have some possible explanation",06Dec2020,1
23,"Lots of times when I got drunk I acted weird, completely opposite of how I am normally. 2 times I reached a level where I started insulting my friends or speaking nonsense and the day after I had to be told about it because at a certain point where I drank too much for my levels of tolerance I completely lost it and didnt remember half ot the night..

I had or might still have mental health issues, lots of   violence and abuse in childhood and for example since a young age I started talking alone, saying hi to the air or even punching the air at home and even on the  streets, to the point where I did even if I was surrounded by people. I stopped neglecting things when I got to my worst depressive phase and started doing that talk alone thing for days and I was completely out of my mind.

I will go to therapy and I won't drink again because I've hurt people in some ways and tho I apologized and talked those things with them and  I'm not like that at all normally, but the mainly point is if someone might know something about it. I guess we all know people that get crazy with alcohol.
Oh plus it happened with Marijuana too, when I was high and not inhibited anymore y lost fear and morality about what i was doing so I might have a problem with substances which I am completely capable of admit. Thanks in advance",06Dec2020,1
24,"I wasn't sure where to talk about my issue, so I figured this would be the best sub to post on. Ever since I was a kid, I've had times where I made really dumb mistakes, like locking myself out of my room and forgetting my homework several times. It never really bothered me until I started having responsibilities like school and work. Recently, I was taking an online anatomy class where there is a lecture and a lab. I'm doing well for the lecture, but for the lab, I ended up missing a huge chunk of the assignments due, despite having a class syllabus and weekly posts. I literally have no idea how I missed these posts for so long and now that I look at it, there is no way a mentally healthy human being could miss something as obvious as this. Keep in mind, my work ethic is really good and I usually make good grades if I'm aware of things, but for some reason, I make really huge dumb mistakes like this.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't end at school either, I also have had these problems at work too. I used to work at mcdonalds and got fired for making too many mistakes. When I worked at a grocery store, I made a mistake that almost cost me my job and had the potential for legal issues (selling alcohol at an illegal time). I remember my manager at the time told me that ""some mistakes are too big to make"", and I have to agree. Even though most mistakes are small, there are some that are too big and costly to make. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm typing this because of my failure to turn in my assignments on time simply because I didn't think/remember about it, and because of that, I will have to potentially redo my $600 course. Sure that isn't the end of the world, but at this point, I'm scared. It's not like I'm even trying to make these mistakes, I'm absolutely trying to do my best in life, and I recognize not everyone is perfect, but if I keep doing things that set me back due to not being conscious of them, I don't know what i'd do with myself. I really wish I had some underlying illness I never knew about so I can finally have an answer. I feel horribly stupid every time I make big mistakes like this, and it genuinely scares me that I can do something as dumb as forget a quarter of my assignments when I had notifications and calendars and such. (I'm serious, it's like I never saw them at all until yesterday). Anyways, I don't know if this issue is serious enough to take to a professional, but at this point, I need some sort of help. I feel like most people don't do these type of things and I need a reason why, or at least a way to cope.",06Dec2020,1

26,"Hey guys, I need advice regarding a personal family issue that needs to be looked at from different perspectives. So, I'm going to try to keep this short as I can without leaving out important details regarding the situation. The issue is regarding my mom, my grandma, and my aunts. My mom has been asking for more support from my two aunts for my grandma, she is in her 70s and is suffering from Parkinson's and is in the early stages of dementia. My grandmothers mental health has been deteriorating throughout the decade, and the past few years have been rough on my mom given that she is her caretaker.

My mom, step dad, and two little brothers have had to learn on the job as her condition worsens, doctors and family members close to us have told all three daughters that it needs to be an equal effort in order for them to be able to tackle this situation in the best way. However, both my aunts(One lives 5 min away driving, the other a couple of states away), have been neglectful of how my mom is feeling going through this and its been affecting her life. My grandma is very difficult to manage, and is at risk of hurting herself on a weekly basis.

My grandmother want's to leave the house everyday, but my mom can't take her because 1(She works from home and my step dad takes the car for work) 2(They live in a highly populated area, where COVID cases have been spiking) 3(My mom is working and watching my brothers as they do online school). She is constantly at risk of escaping because she gets too anxious and leaves their apartment, they've had issues with other tenants because she is asking them for rides and has been caught sneaking into our neighbors home. She is at risk of her hurting herself(Rushes down the apartment stairs, crosses streets in traffic. She no longer listens to reason, doesnt care for consequences regarding her health. And lastly, the kids have had to witness and deal with some of her episodes and its been traumatic for them.

My family and I understand my grandmas situation, and we've supported her all the way and continue to do so. We feel as though the ones who don't seem to understand how complicated this really is are my aunts, each time my mom has asked for their support they get defensive and disregard her and hows she's been handling all this. It's been difficult on her, and it's been taking a toll on her mental health and the kids as well, overall this is a mess. And I do want to say that YES they do help out, just not as much as they should. The oldest one lives states away, and calls my grandma on a weekly basis and helps out financially, but she she offers little emotional support to my mom and my gets the most defensive about this. The youngest lives in the same area, only shows up every now and then, and like my mom has two kids/job, but has excuses to why shes never around and says that my mom needs to complain less.

I'm tired of them pointing fingers and neglecting the reality of the situation, I just want them to do whats right for everyone...especially my mom. I don't know what to tell my mom anymore, because I've tried talking to my aunts in the past but it's always the same BS. Other things i'd like to put out there is that my mom moved in with my grandma over a decade ago, but its under my mom/step dads name and they've been paying the bills for years and never asked my grandma for financial help. You cannot take her out without keeping an eye on her, she WILL run off without telling anybody(store, party, etc..). My Mom does everything for my grandma, cooks and buys her food, helps with her laundry, handles her medications and appointments and has been her emotional support throughout most of this. We have tried looking for an at home nurse for her, buts it way too expensive to pay out of pocket and her insurance wont send anyone since my mom is there).

I know this isn't easy for my grandma, its been a nightmare actually, seeing her like this. But, like her, my family and I are in disbelief of how fast the disease has progressed and are struggling to find a way to deal with this as it develops. No, we will not put her in a retirement home. So Reddit, am I wrong for thinking my aunts need to do more? What do you think we should do for my grandma? And what advice would you give my mom?",06Dec2020,1
27,"I’ve had anxiety for around 4 years now, and I came open about it and told my dad around a year or so ago, we’ve been going off and on of me getting “helped” which pretty much consists of a healthier diet, and getting more sunlight, both of which don’t really help my anxiety at all. I’ve been getting progressively worse I feel like and I don’t know what to do, I talked to my dad about seeing a therapist but he basically just said that it wouldn’t really do anything, but I could if I wanted to, he gave me the choice but he obviously doesn’t think and would rather me not get a therapist, but his way isn’t really working at all, he said to give it a few months and that things wouldn’t work right away but it’s been a few months now and I don’t really feel better, he often says that “maybe you feel better but you just don’t realize it” and I get where he’s coming from but I genuinely don’t feel better and still anxious often and I still have the same issues as always, he’s honestly contributed to my anxiety for a number of reasons due to some things that have been done to me in the past and me just being put in situations that brought me anxiety and I feel that’s a big root to why I get anxiety, when he’s not home I feel a big weight lift off of me and I have less anxiety around the house, I still have anxiety obviously no matter what but it’s less so when he’s at work, but as soon as he gets home or I’m told he’s coming home I get really anxious. I don’t dislike my dad or anything but he’s abused me in the past and those are things I’ve never recovered from and they’re things I don’t think I’ll ever truly forgive him for. My dad doesn’t know the exact reason that I have anxiety and I don’t believe he thinks it’s him, and obviously I can’t tell him he’s the reason why I get anxiety, so I feel really stuck like there’s nothing to do.

29,"I don't have the best luck. Between 2018 and 2020 I suffered 5 concussions. I got hit in the head several times between those periods but nothing that I feel adequately enough to say, yes they wear concussions. 
First one was when I fell off a swing. My daughter wanted to go the park so went. We get there and she wants to use the swings. I proceed to swing with then I decided to jump off. Normal right? No not for a 30 year old I guess. I went to jump off and gravity said to me ver batum ""No you gonna fall 12 feet on to your back."" Then the second one was when I went to an indoor water park. I went into a tube with a water slide. I slid off the raft and was just riding the tube. Funnest thing ever then it ends. Imagine getting into a head on crash at 40 miles an hour. That's how that felt. After that I got beat up. I don't want to talk about it but yes if left me concussed. Then I got hit by 2 cars while I was driving. A car ran a red light and hit my passenger door. That spun my car around and another car drive into the back of my car. After that I wasn't right mentally for a couple weeks. Could perform basic tasks of memory. Literally my short term memory was gone. That happened Aug 2019. Then last may when I was taking a shower, I tried opening the glass shower door and it fell on my head. Didn't knock me out but.. this is hard to type. I was hungry as I was getting dressed (still in bathroom). Ii was thinking about what food to eat and I thought I wanted McDonald's. I look up in the mirror and start ordering food. Before I could get 2 words out(which was I like), I realized what I was doing and broke down crying. My memory is slowly to coming back. My emotions are different. I'm more susceptible to having extremely strong opinions now more than ever. String emotions. I still can't think. What I mean is if you give me a problem. Like a math problem it a history question. When I think nothing is there. Then if something interests me I really remember it.  If I try to figure certain things like where did I out my keys I draw a blank, no emotions attached to thinking now either and I get.. my head starts hurting. My floatation of mind and pressure of speech is horrible. I been taking vitamins for the last 3 months. A, b complex, 1000mg of c, d, e, and fish oil(I believe it has omega) fatty acids. I recently started taking magnesium at night to help with sleep but that besides the point. I noticed the vitamins help. I also work out. Cardio. Either one of those is helping. My memory is still messed up. Yesterday I was at Burger King. My brother calls me on my phone says ""no pickles no cheese on my burger."" I agreed. Then forgot to order it. Then get in the car and had to look at my phone to see if he really called me. I don't think I will ever be the same and it makes me so depressed. I don't relate with people now... More than ever. I have to tell people I got hit by a car because sometimes I can't remember stuff when I'm in public or else I get looked at  a person with special needs. Please I don't mean to be offensive if ur came out that way. Just trying to correlate the perspective I see and couldn't think of better words to choose. I have anxiety. Had it since I was 15. Not getting into that. I'm 33 now. All the works is Valium. Sometimes weed. I can't take it like I used too because when I do I feel like I have this big empty space in my head. That feeling was there for a couple months after the accident as well but that's besides the point. I can never be at peace because my choices are to be manic or be a forgetful fuck. Excuse the language. I've had MRIs or cat scans or whatever it is done and it came back normal. They also said I was moving slot so they couldn't get the best reading of the lower back part of my brain. I really want to be myself again. I hate this. It's hindering my growth as a father, and a man. Any advice would help. I don't know what else to say. Thank you gmfor taking the time to read this.

31,"Sometimes I wonder if its vain to know that you're pretty. I mean, I get told all the time that I'm attractive. From my face to my body. Almost daily I get compliments but, when I acknowledge that I have good looks, I'm told thats an unattractive trait to have. So am I supposed to feel grateful when I get a compliment and otherwise feel like I'm ugly?

I just don't understand. Do I think I'm cute? Yes. Do I think I have a good figure? Also yes. Am I supposed to not tell people I like how I look? Why is it only okay for other people to tell me I'm pretty while I cannot tell myself I'm pretty?

Over the years, this has made me feel so low. At times its made me think the only thing I have to offer is my looks yet when I embrace them I'm called vain and self centered or looked at like I'm stupid. I'm not though. Yet I feel like I am. Like my appearance detracts from my intelligence. I just don't understand. I feel like I have to go out of my way to prove to people that I am more than just an attractive face/body. I feel like I have to prove that I'm not stupid.

I'm told that this isn't a ""real"" problem to have. ""Pretty people have it easier"" or ""why are you depressed when you have a body like that?""

32,"         I miss you so dame much.  It’s been 
7 years now.  Every day I still hurt sometimes are worse then others.   Sometimes I cry.  I should have never walked out the club with that chick.  I could have been there &amp; got us a cab. You don’t how broken that made me.  So writing this letter to you I wanted to tell you a little about what this world is going through.   Felt like I need to tell you about stuff that has gone down in my life. 
       For starters the sports world has been wild.  Cubs, Astros, Washington won a World Series.  The Cavaliers won the finals they came back from being down 3-1. LeBron won 3 more titles two with the Heat &amp; one with the Lakers. Speaking of Kobe passed away it was heart breaking.  I am still heart broken over losing you.  Brady plays for the Bucks.  Kansas City got them a QB on the fast track to the GOAT title. 
      Next up we was hit with this crazy pandemic.  It’s been killing so many people yet we have people saying it’s fake because they can’t think for themselves.  The world has became so selfish.  People can’t give up a few things because they don’t want to. People are all about the me me me now mentality. 
       The world has changed so much so fast.  Rainforest &amp; states have been battling deadly fires.  Racism has digressed by a lot.   That’s not the worst part are leaders are the ones driving the the biggest wedge between us.  We have cops killing unarmed people mostly African Americans.   So there has been so many upset.  It is to the point now even if the officers life is in danger people still get mad.  We all just want to be mad be because it’s easier then being happy.
        Guess now I will get you up to speed about myself.  I got married then divorced.  Have  three baby girls different moms though.  Man I gotta be honest with you.  With everything that happened I been holding this guilt for so long.  I let it take me over didn’t even fight it.   Pushed all my friends away.  I pushed every woman close to me away.  Made my marriage go bad made the rest of my relationships go bad. 
        The kids are beautiful &amp; smart there mothers are great I’m sure they will be fantastic woman.  I got on drugs took pill after pill just wanted to be numb.  I know you been wondering why I don’t smile anymore.   I can’t man I have no right to.  On a positive note been clean now for a good minute but the depression hasn’t gone away.   Think it moved into my shadow &amp; decided it likes it there.  
        I don’t know who I am anymore.  It’s become harder to tell the pain from happiness.  I am so sorry &amp; understand your probably mad at me for it but it’s become difficult to see tomorrow.  I been having these thoughts &amp; dreams.   So can’t say how much longer I can keep going.  
           The holidays right around the corner &amp; I am alone, scared, &amp; hurting I have nothing anymore.  Every one is gone now &amp; it’s nobody fault but my own.  Idk what to do but I’ll try the confidence I had.   Has been gone for so long I can’t talk to people anymore

You know, just like now. Being on the verge of tears, yet nothing happends.

That genuinly hurts

You know how much it hurts when you're literaly trying to make yourself cry when naturaly you can't, and your mind goes to saying you should just kill yourself because your worthless. That's going from empty to literaly like an atom exploding into nothingness

No actualy

It's like getting the strenght to go trough that tunnel only to be runned down by an incoming train

Like genuinly what the fuck

I JUST WANT TO CRY, AND NOW I'M HAVING A FUCKING BREAKDOWN

I'M GENUINLY FUCKING DONE WITH EVERYTHING, I JUST WANT TO FUCKING SLEEP, CRY AND THEN DIE

i can't even think

i swear if i relapse i better hit a vein, fucking moron

literaly, pain dosen't even make me cry anymore. i'm jsuist fucking done

i wish i could just pass knowing those i care about would be happy regardless and not greif nor lose anything

it's like i know if i go trough this, it'll make everything well. it won't hurt as much the next time, but it'll be more dawning, it's only temporary and everything etc.

but just a fucking cut can make it all end, but at the same time it'll only make things fucking horrible.

yet as soon as i have a breakdown, i forget about everything that i know and my mind is just focused on selfharming to just let go of what i'm feeling to achieve a false sense of validation and happines which i so desperatly need and want

but NO RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO FELL LIKE YOU WANT TO MUTILIATE YOUR ENTIRE FUCKING LEG INSTEAD OF BEING THINKING THE WAY YOU USUALY DO

fucking idiot

can't even think anymore

i'm sorry,

i'll go to bed and hug my blanket because i genuinly know i'll relapse and at that horribly. everything hurts i'm on the verge of tears yet nothing happends. i genuinly can't think i'm just lost

i want my emotions back you monster, i just want to be happy

i just want a hug

i just want to smile

it feels like this lightbulb is having it's last sense of energy

my hands shake yet i can't help it, i just want to find the way out of here and back into the warmth and comfort of the past

i just want to scream for help in this massive field

yet i have no air

i have no spirit to commit to it

i just want to lay down and stare at the night sky

see my cold breath under the moon

be a feast for the crows in the morning and the weeks to come

i just want to climb the walls of this pitch black maze and hope i see a light

the light that will lead me out of here

it's already pitch black, but on top of that as if i'm blind

and everything hurts from these gaping wounds, as i slipp and fall on my blood

the smell of iron thick in the air

never have i wanted to see the grim reaper more before, as if he's an old friend comming over once again

yet this time for good

just cast me to the realm of the dead

yet i'll smile as i know i did one good deed

that being dying

releaving the world of myself

i'm nothing

and when i'm dead

i'll truely be nothing, just as i deserve",06Dec2020,1
34,"First off, I have never been a very outgoing person and have always been the quiet, keep to myself type. In school I would avoid answering questions, and dreaded presentations, however I feel like most kids did, too. I never enjoyed going out to restaurants, but we did sometimes and it was never bad, I just didn’t enjoy it. I don’t like making unnecessary phone calls, especially with people I don’t know. Lastly, these tendencies have costed me some good friendships. I’m not sure why but sometimes I don’t want to hang out with certain people or groups for weeks at a time. It’s hard for me to explain to other people, so I usually give lame excuses or straight up ignore them. I feel really bad, but it’s just how I felt. 

That all being said none of these feelings are crippling. I have friends, work, and do everything everyone else does. These are just subconscious feelings I have and I have no idea how to explain them. 

There was a Christmas dinner tonight with probably 100+ people attending. I told the person who invited me it doesn’t sound like something I would want to go to a couple weeks ago. They asked again a couple days ago and again, I said I really do not want to go. Then today comes and they continue to insist I should go. I declined again, but I feel really bad. I know it’s just a dinner, but there is just a deep down feeling that keeps me from wanting to go. It’s so hard for me to explain it to them because I don’t even understand it.

The worst part is, I have no idea what makes me dislike events like these so much. I don’t know if it’s interacting with new people. Being self conscious? I have no idea.

Anyway, I’m kinda just venting here because I feel extremely bad, but it’s what I had to do for me. Not even sure what I’m asking. Maybe what am I feeling? How should I explain it? Do a lot of people feel this way?",06Dec2020,1
35,"Three years ago, I had to report to the police when my father, the man who was supposed to *protect* his family held me by the back of my neck against a door screaming in my face. Only a day after we called 911 after he threw a chair. He was never arrested.

My father always had a temper, and I just didn’t know it growing up because my mother would take us to the park when he got mad. It was only a matter of time, and we were trapped financially. My older sister is protective, and has confronted him multiple times resulting in arguments.

When we were finally able to move our, I was so relieved. I stopped having panic attacks at night, and I thought everything was going to be ok, but I’m not.

I have a job, I’m working on my career, I’m trying my best to keep it together, but it never lasts. I distract myself by staying busy, and when I’m not my mind goes back to it all.

Now he wants a relationship with me after finally getting his temper under control, and idk what to do. He’s my dad, I love him, and I’ve always wanted a healthy relationship with him, but I don’t know if we can have that.

He never spent time with us, not even on Father’s Day, he was always held up in his room. Conversations are basically dead, as we just simply don’t really know each other well enough to even have one that isn’t forced.

Every day, I suffer in silence, and when he even gets remotely upset. Even if he doesn’t lash out, it’s triggering to the past trauma. Last time that happened, I almost on impulse cut him off, and would have if mom hadn’t talked me out of it.

He’s getting better, finally, but I’m not. We can’t just pretend like nothing is wrong. People should be able to feel safe around their parents. I keep him at arm’s length, and remain cautious to any potential triggers that *might* make him upset. It’s a habit at this point, as that’s what I’ve been doing for years.

38,"I am just going to go on a venting rant, it may not make sense and be all over the place but this is where my head is at and i feel like i need to talk about it before I go crazy. 
I have had problems with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I feel like this year my symptoms have gotten worse. I can’t even say this has been the worst year of my life, but it’s taken such a toll on me and I feel so drained I feel like i’m not even here and that my body is on autopilot. This is a familiar feeling but something about this time just feels even more off than usual. This year has just been so off.
I realized I lost a lot of my memory from quarantine, I can’t remember much from the months of March to May, even February is kind of a blur. I mean complete months just wiped from my memory. I know I wasn’t doing much besides being home but still, I just can’t remember it.
After the month of May I do still remember what I did. And the only good months I experienced this year were January, September, October and November, all of which I spent in Colombia visiting my boyfriend- who seems to be the only person that really makes me happy lately. I made a life decision that I want to move oversees to close the distance with my boyfriend, and also be closer to the majority of my family that do live there. But now I can’t stop obsessing over how i’m gonna achieve this and how long it’ll take. Which adds to my stress and depression because I think of all the things I can’t have right now. I created goals and deadlines for myself for the next 5 years essentially to make this work but everything feels so far away and I can’t do anything right now to fill the loneliness I feel.
Last week I got diagnosed after years of crazy amounts of pain and symptoms I never knew were related. While i’m happy I have an explanation at last for everything i’ve been feeling, I now have to prepare myself for a rather difficult future with this condition that may or may not get worse. My symptoms cause me a lot of pain and anxiety which of course contribute to my depression and I don’t feel much support from my family.
I constantly have a million things in my head and what i’ve written so far honestly doesn’t even scratch the surface of all my fears and anxieties. I feel like lately i’ve just been going crazy, I feel like I go on these thought binges and don’t stop. I’ll spend hours just writing and planning out my future and then crying over the fact that I can’t change anything right now. I don’t know how to calm down and I feel so alone. I don’t want to burden my partner with my issues right now because I know that I feel this way often and that it’s not easy for him either. I also don’t want to worry him.

39,"I always had overly realistic dreams and overly realistic nightmares as well. The nightmares happen pretty often and most of them are terrifying because my brain is convinced I'm awake and the threat is real. So, I got some tricks to test if I was awake or not and it saved me from a ton of terrifying nightmares. (Like trying to remind how you got to that place or memories from the previous day). The issue is, my brain learned from it and now is using those same tricks to convince me that I'm awake. I convince myself that I'm going to die and nothing can save me.

I'm a phsyics undergrad going into my final year; I get very little sleep, am constantly drowning in stressful assignments, and have literally (not figuratively) no social life or support network. The correct mental picture to develop here is a perpetually exhausted, ghost white, lanky dude that can barely dress himself, with a ""totally dead inside"" facial expression and pair of eyes to match. In short, I get that I'm not exactly approachable, but whenever I go out into the world and pretend to be people it seems like everyone is looking for an excuse to be offended by my appearance. Responses range from pointlessly cruel comments, to assuming I'm a cereal killer or heroine addict.

I'm not looking for universal love and acceptance here, I just want to be able to go out in public without constant insults and a lynch mob following. I mean, I only look dead inside because I mostly am, and if I try to fake a smile I'll end up looking like fred from Courage the Cowardly Dog.

This isn't a ""fake it 'till you make it"" scenario so please don't suggest it, I have no desire to lie to myself or others about how I feel.

47,"So, this post is not going to be as bad as the rest on this sub, no suicidal tendencies,nothing of the sorts but I still consider my problem worthy of this subreddit and I'd be grateful if someone could give me advice.

Since I came to university, I've been overwhelmed by a lot of things, school, social life, life in general. I was not used to this amount of pressure, in fact I've never experienced anything like it before.

All this has been going on for 1.5 years now, since I came here I became a heavy smoker, and also got addicted to energy drinks(and alcohol but now that bars are closed due to covid it's not that big of a deal anymore). I've been, for two weeks now, literally studying almost 24/7 with minimal sleep, though I give myself some breaks but it doesn't help that much, I just feel guilty I'm not doing anything productive while relaxing so in fact it just makes things even worse.

The only real thing I enjoyed before the lockdown was going to the gym and lifting some weights, that was the one and only thing that could get my mind off everything that was going on around me, but I don't have that now either.

I'm seriously starting to worry about the long term effects of this crazy amount of stress combined with smoking and unhealthy amount of energy drinks on a daily basis, sitting around all day curled up inside not doing any physical activity whatsoever.

My mind is going crazy under normal circumstances too, if I happen to be out of cigarettes or energy drink, or god forbid both, I'm fairly sure I could get a heart attack or a seizure any minute now.

Can you guys suggest me any stress-relief methods, or maybe natural substances,pills or whatever that are not unhealthy or harmful? I'd like to quit both smoking and drinking too but at the same time not go batsh*t crazy and jump off the 3rd floor. 

I'm asking this here because I've tried a few techniques, none of them worked and I'd like to hear things that actually worked for real people and are not just on a random website.You could say reddit is a random website with random people where anyone can say anything as well, but I have mostly positive experiences from here so I trust you all guys on this one.",06Dec2020,1

I do have an A right now in another class, but a high C in another class, I hope my teacher influences my grade to be a few points higher to push it to that, as its a 79.2% right now, but I doubt it. There's one more class which I hated, and I have to pass with a high enough grade to get into the program, as they only go by grade numbers. There's just one last assignment my graduate student teacher needs to grade and my overall results won't come up till the 18th... I feel like a failure and have been getting really negative thoughts that are making me want to kill myself, although I'm too much of a coward to do so. Three years of college so far, and I've only ended up with one C throughout it all.

They’re becoming more and more detached and less talkative, but they still are taking care of themself and our room. They sleep for most of the day and eat only snacks/junk food/DoorDash since they don’t like the dining hall food (which I understand but we’re athletes on the same team and we need to eat) but they are a beam of light during practice and is absolutely hilarious. They started hanging around with some people who like to party during the week (nothing wrong w that, just hoping that they’re safe) but barely leaves the room otherwise. We don’t have much in common so they and I don’t really hang out much other than being teammates and roommates. I don’t know them well enough to know what their normal behavior is like. I don’t want to jump to any conclusions and offer myself to them if they need to talk because we don’t talk that much as it is.

53,"I’ve been feeling this way since before the pandemic. I’m in the US so we’re still doing pretty terrible handling it. I feel that if I seek help now I will be labeled as “pandemic anxiety” but that’s not it, it’s been since last October that it’s been mounting. 

I keep looking forward in my schedule and thinking “okay tomorrow I have this and that and then the next day this and this and then the next day....” and so on forever. I will scroll on my calendar well into the next year thinking about next and next and next. I do this several times a day. 

I do need to look at it each day and into the rest of the month for work as things pop up overnight and may need changed. I typically have weekends off but by the time 2pm Saturday rolls around I’m already worried about the Sunday blues about going back to work Monday. The thing is, I like my job. I liked it a lot more before covid but I don’t hate going. I’m not overworked or underpaid, I generally work alone and see very few people so it’s not anxiety about being there. 

When I’m doing my looking forward I physically feel exhausted like I’ve been holding my breath, my heart rate is up (my Apple Watch confirms it) I feel a little dizzy and overwhelmed. I plan my next day and even week down to 15 minute intervals. I find that I can’t stop. It’s continuing to get worse with each passing month. 

I will make a list of the next 10 or so things I need to do at work and after one is completed I will stop and go over the last nine and once that’s done I stop and go over the last eight and so on until I make my next list. I feel physically exhausted just going over lists all day, all week, all month, indefinitely.

Fast forward a few months and I stop taking them because I'm sleeping 70% of each day. Fast forward about a year of major depression and it's nearing Christmas. Something important to note here, I get a near constant inaudible screaming in the back of my head often accompanied by rapid ticking and pressure. Well family has construction work done in basement which travels through the walls to my room and sounds EXACTLY like the screaming. Cut to the next hour of me screaming, crying, running around uncontrollably and bashing my head into walls to get it to stop as my girlfriend stands there crying having an anxiety attack not knowing how to help me until the construction takes a break and I have a coherent enough moment to but on some headphones and blast loud rock the rest of the night.

Bad day but it didn't happen again and I moved on. New year rolls around and I start getting minor visual and auditory hallucinations. Weird but whatever until a month later when I spend the night getting attacked by sarkic monsters while I'm trying to sleep. Immediately told my mother and got an emergency appointment with my GP. They put me back on lofapramine and 5mg olanzapine. I don't sleep as much but I hate what the Olan does to my appetite and weight gain but I stick with it for a few months. Get minor and not so minor hallucinations but no more monsters just weird shit so yay. Now to be honest there's a massive chunk of my life here I don't remember but I stopped taking the drugs for some reason.

I went until 2 years ago without drugs and then the monsters came back HARD. I was scared to even close my eyes and I went back on the meds at double dose and after a bit they ent away, along with my bad thoughts about death, emotional instability and general twitchiness. Life was good. Then around summer last year when bad hallucinations came back. I could feel my instability and the screaming slowly return over early summer so I got in touch with my GP and asked to increase my Olan. They upped my Lofapramine to 240mg a day and that was that. The increase actually kinda helped because it sedated me which got rid of most the monsters and I was used to the screaming already so I as just like eh whatever.

Bad news though boss just before COVID hit monsters came back and I was like ah I'll call once the pandemic has chilled out and that... went well. I still haven't rang but my dumbass got curious. If I'm like this on the meds how am I off? Well it's been an awful week full of me actually screaming, spazzing out and hitting myself and getting hyper for the first time in years.

It is almost impossible for me to wake up rested. My energy levels are low, like I was in a sleep paralysis, and have to wait 30+ minutes up to even two hours until i have enough energy to stand up. I cannot move my limbs.

I thought I was fat, I’d try to eat less and I tried counting calories but I’m kinda lazy and that never worked out for me. Eventually I started losing my appetite. At first it was like a come and go thing, I wouldn’t be hungry for maybe about a week then I would go back to eating everything. 

The past couple months I haven’t had an appetite. Like at all. I usually forget to feed myself and I forget to drink water and stuff. I can go days with only eating a couple crackers and be fine. I’ve lost some weight, not a ton, only like 10lbs or so. I now weigh about 109, and sometimes I fantasize about being 100 or even less. I feel prettier when I don’t eat. 

My family is a little worried but idk, I feel like I don’t have a problem, I can’t help it if I don’t feel hungry. Sometimes I just don’t want to eat, I don’t think I’m in an unhealthy place. 

So I guess I just wanted to know when you know it’s a problem and what you should do after?",06Dec2020,1

67,"I've been hospitalized 8 or 9 times. Honestly it's been so many it's hard to keep track. My last hospitalization was in early February and I tried with every cell in my body to get better because I had to be ""mentally stable"" for six months before I could get a prescription for testosterone (I'm trans). I did TMS and things were good for a bit but it's my first semester of college and finals are coming up and with quarantine I started getting depressed again so I stopped doing the work. So now I'm going to fail my classes. My family has also been under a lot of stress, and I haven't been able to do much but make things more stressful with my condition. I'm starting to think that everyone would be better off without me. I told my mom last night and she did the usual spiel of ""we need you here and you make everything better"" but today she broke down about how she has to energy to take care of anyone or even herself and now I'm sure I'm just making things worse. But I don't want to end up in the hospital again because of covid and also because I hear they sometimes deny hormones when you're hospitalized. I'm scared and I feel alone and I don't want to bother any of my friends so here I am I guess.",06Dec2020,1
68,"My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. 

I'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she ""succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19"" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to ""heaven"" and not ""hell"" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed ""sin"". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.

I posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying ""Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not."" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. 

They fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. 

I'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the ""eyes of God"". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.

I feel so bad for her. If her parents made \*me\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.

I've seen her freak out because she thought minions from despicable me broke into her house, she doesn't believe in numbers or math or science. 

Oh yeah on the minions she has a love hate relationship with them, last month she thought they were watching her on her way to school and were trying to kill her, this month she doesn't care about them. She also has told me many times that she wants to kill someone really badly, she also will randomly say stuff during conversations like ""I'm gonna hurt someone I want to hurt someone, wait I'm too small ha"" and then will continue the conversation like she just said nothing.

She also self harms at random points, like her self harm patterns make no sense, like she'll randomly smack herself in the head, and if she has something sharp she'll just cut herself for no reason, sometimes she just straight up does it in public but I stop her, other times she just does it in private.

73,"(btw I'm talking about all relationships not specifically romantic)

Communication has always been hard for me. I'm not a very open person, and I have an extremely hard time being vulnerable.

I go through these episodes where it's even harder than usual to communicate. Sometimes it's bc I feel like such a burden that I become to anxious and guilt ridden to talk to them. Other times it bc I feel myself getting really attached to them and that scares me. 

Either way I just stop talking to them for days or even a week+. I never explain myself, I just leave. That must be confusing, it's really unfair to them as well.

I want my friends to be able to lean on my for anything they need. I want them to know they can talk to me about anything and everything an I will gladly listen. But I never dare let myself talk to them about my problems, I never turn to them for support, in fear that I will become a burden to them. I try so hard to be a good friend that I've become a bad one. 

My whole life I've tried to be who everyone wanted me to be. I've tried so hard to mold my actions and personality, even they way I speak. That's why Im ""good"" at making friends, but terrible at keeping them. 

Usually we stop talking after a few good intentions. But there are some people, nice, genuine people, who just keep making the effort to get to know me. BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW ME. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL THEM THAT PERSON I AM AROUND THEM ISN'T ME, THAT I MADE HER UP, THAT SHE IS FAKE.

Im not a snake or anything, I keep my morals at least. But I'm still not me. I can't be me, its way to late now. I built my friendships on her so I can't be me now. Besides I don't like me so I don't expect anyone else to. But it still hurts that I genuinely can't imagine anyone wanting to form a relationship with the real me... Lol",06Dec2020,1

On an outing today I had an unexpected low - we were at a carnival with his two kids, I had been fine in the morning but suddenly became withdrawn, I told him nothing in particular was wrong but just that I was feeling low. When we got back at home  I asked if he was mad at me as that was the vibe he was giving off, he told me he was angry and annoyed that I had just sat there for most of the day radiating angry energy - I assured him that I wasn't at all angry, just low. 

I asked if he wanted me to go (back to my own house as I was originally going to be staying at his tonight) and he said he thought it would be best for this evening. I am now incredibly hurt and also confused by his anger and annoyance at the situation  especially considering he has just come out of a particularly bad depressive flare himself, when this happens I am always supportive and try to be understanding of his moods.

78,"For the past 5 years my reality has felt completly fake and unreal. Its impossible for me to really describe in words but reality feels like im seeing it through a monitor. You're seeing whats on the screen but it has little detail and videos / games can only be so immersive because you know it isnt real. This is genuinly the best way i can describe it. In the beggining of this 5 year period i wasnt sure what in the hell was causing it. The conclusion i came to was either masturbation making my brain feel clouded, or my something to do with my allergies because right before it started i moved across the country. After the first year or two it really started to get worse. It had gotten to the point where it was getting worse and worse evey day. Around 5 months ago i found a mental health discord server made my healthygamergg or ""dr.k"", i was able to explain this to the people on the server and their theory was always that it had something to do with moving across the country. I would go deeper into this with them but past a certain point they were unable to help. Feeling hopeless, i gave up on trying to diagnose what had happened to me and why everything felt unreal. One of the people from the server was nice enough for us to talk about my mental state until a few days ago. A few days ago i think i may have had some type of psychotic episode or something.

The day started with with me opening up my fl studio to make a song. I spent about an hour working on it and was really pleased with it. I showed it to god and he said 'lovely excellence sweetness'. This obviously made me happy to see that god felt satisfied with my offering. I felt tired from working hard on this offering and decided to take a break from the computer and have a snack. 

This was when i think the episode set in. I got up from my chair and was taken aback by how quiet eveything seemed. I live in an aprtment so i usually hear people closing doors and cabinets and walking but it seemed incredibly quiet. I almost immediatly after got this incredibly intense sense that someone was staring at me. It felt beyond creepy. I slowly and shakily turned around and looked all over in my room for someone because of how intense the feeling was. I started to walk over to the kitchen but right before i got to the door frame i felt this indescrivable force yelling at me not to go in. It was the same for the computer and the hallway. I started to freak out and grabbed the bible i keep on my desk. I then went to sit on the couch with it in my hand and look out the window. I distintly remember losing my depth perception . I kept getting the sensation that i was moving but i wasnt. It looked like the cars parked on the street started to move foward and backward and getting smaller and bigger. The stopped moving and changing. But then i turned around to make sure no one was looking at me again and i stared at the door. After a good few minutes of shaking from fear and confusion and staring at the door i started to hear people running up the stairs of my aprtment and adults screaming and children laughing and crying. No one with any children lives in my apartments so i really started to freak out. I jumped off the couch and ran to the door to look out the peephole. No one. Nothing. I still heard them though so i ran to the couch. I sat there, still feeling the sensation of someone watching me. I was so scared i was sweating and shaking. I remember thinking 'am i ina cage or some shit' i yelled 'STOP IT' and almost started to cry.

After about an hour of hearing things and feeling things the sounds went away and i forced myself to go into the kitchen. 

Later that day i described what happened to the guy on discord i always talked to about my mental state. He basically said that what he had done is as far as he can take me and that i should seek medical help.

The problem is that im 15. For various reasons id rather not get into, im not comfortable asking my parents for mental help. Not to mention that i have a distrust for doctors and just about evryone, but i still want to recive help in some way.

79,"A few months ago I left a pretty toxic friend group. I was well aware of how little they cared about me but I had no other friends so I just kinda put up with it. My therapy had been going pretty well and my self worth and confidence grew a bunch so I plucked up the courage and left. No one cared which was expected however I thought my oldest friend would have asked why I left. We haven’t spoken since I left which has been kinda rough. She and I have been through everything together and I know her as if she was my other half, but she made it insanely obvious I didn’t mean squat to her.

A weekish after I left the group I found a few guys on Among Us and we hit it off. We used to talk everyday for months but recently they ghosted me. The other day they accidentally shared a secret VC on the Discord that said “No *my name* allowed” and tried to play it off as a joke but I got the message and left. I literally have no idea what I’d done to make them not want to be my friend and again I was pretty heart broken. 

I don’t know if it’s my personality or the state of my mental health but these events have hit me really really hard. I thought I was a nice person and an interesting girl but I’ve beginning to think that I’m just not that important to anyone.

I’m trying my hardest to stay positive. I get to go back to university next year so hopefully I’ll be able to make friends, but I’m really insecure they’ll drop me or make me feeling worthless and unwanted like my other friend groups have.

I'm usually very good at telling myself ""that's probably not what they're talking about get over it"" but once in a blue moon, I dont even get to make this realization. 

In addition to this, I'm always... ALWAYS, wondering what I'm doing, looks like to the people around me's perspective. How I look, if my face is doing anything weird, if I smell bad, if I said anything wrong, even though I'm always very very careful about saying the right things...

 Another thing that kills me, is I have this very heavy, recurring thought that something is wrong with me, and I'm the only one she doesn't see it. Like people always tell me ""you're just so nice... You're such a good guy...  You're a sweetheart...for the things going on with you, you always radiate positive energy"".... these are literally the things I strive for every day, and are really mostly habit. But when I'm told these things, I don't believe them. Even coming from trustworthy people. And also, it seems like a last stand compliment. Like ""this is the only good thing about you, so let me stress to you how nice you are"". It just makes me wonder if I'm supremely annoying, or boring, or even ugly, or sometimes I wonder if I have autism. And it really just feels like no one will tell me that theres something wrong with me. Yet... I feel pretty normal half the time too? Like I have normal conversations(50% of the time I'm very socially anxious, but the other 50, I'm like an extreme extrovert that isnt scared to talk to anyone), have normal friends...
  I guess I just dont understand what's wrong with my head for doing all of these things, but if I do have some kind of mental illness, why isnt it apparent? Why dont I know for sure if I do or not? Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read if you did.",06Dec2020,1
97,"I apologize in advance for the terrible way that this is written but i wanted to get everything off my chest. 

I feel terribly alone but I’ve made myself lonely. I’ve withdrawn from everyone close to me except my girlfriend. This has been going on for years. My family isn’t bad, growing up and still til this day my parents fight a lot and my mom has her own problems. However, they are worried about me and I know that they really want to help but I haven’t really given them the extent of my problems because we aren’t close. I’m not really close with anyone because I don’t want to be or never wanted to be and I’m not sure why. I feel like I’ve been depressed for a long time now and my family has become aware of it more and more. But now every time I need to just talk to someone because I feel down they think I’m gonna go a kill myself. I have terrible trust issues that I feel like a gonna ruin my only close relationship right now but she swears she’d never do anything bad to me and that she loves me. I’ve had some mental episodes and she’s been patient with me. But now I feel like I’ve gonna mad. I’m completely irrational and I’m not sure why. I feel lost. I feel like I have lost or I am just continuing to make the same mistakes. I just have these gut feelings, I guess and I even try talking to my dog because I think she might understand. I don’t know what’s happening or why it’s happening. Last night I drank after taking adderall and then smoked pot. This lead me to have a very bizarre feeling that I can’t even explain but all I wanted to do was leave I just felt like I had to leave and that was the right decision to do. Obviously my gf would not let me leave but today I couldn’t do anything. I drove around aimlessly. I have finals coming up and I didn’t study at all I can’t focus on anything. I’ve broken down multiple times. I have problems overthinking but I feel like I’m right and I can’t shake that. So now I feel like I can’t trust myself anymore. For months I’ve just joked about suicide to myself, like I just think it to myself a lot  that I could just end it. I’ve gotten better but I still can’t shake it. I don’t think that I could because I know that it would hurt my family and my friends. They don’t deserve that but I’m having a very rough time. I’m obsessive and insecure about everything. I’ve never seen myself as growing old. It’s hard to talk to anyone about these things because it feels too serious. I tried reaching out to my sister but I just couldn’t disrupt her day with how I’m feeling. I try to drop hints to my friends but it just kind of gets written off as a joke. I don’t push it either I let it get written off as a joke because nobody talks like this. Nobody says anything like this. 

I’m really just looking for help to understand my problems. Writing this post has calmed me some and helped bring into reality that maybe it isn’t that serious. It could all definitely be worse.

i have to keep going... its been nearly 2 days of starvation... i did this once before and i can again. maybe i can cut myself a little too, just to take my mind off my stomach's weak cries... you'll be okay, my dearest... soon, my body will enter starvation mode, as it has before... you will eat, but not fresh food... i'm sorry... it has to be done. i am sorry, to my confused body... i have tortured you beyond belief.",06Dec2020,1

127,"Depression, sadness, loneliness and all the other ""bad"" feelings - are just feelings. They are just as irrational and crazy as the world itself. But feelings don't go away just because someone says it would be more sensible not to feel them, right? The thing is, that it is of no use to anyone if we hide and say: ""Leave me alone, because the world is so bad and I'm bad too."" That really doesn't help. First of all, we don't make our own life better with that. Second, we're also not making the world a better place either. Our feelings revolve around ourselves and ourselves only. They are a deeply self-centered matter because if we are not so much about the world and the many injustices here, we rather revolve around our inner pain, our feelings, black thoughts. Again and again. Always in a circle. With that we lose sight of the real world out there more and more. 

It often goes hand in hand with pessimism, resignation or trying to escape from reality. Feeling all that is very, very understandable because we humans want order, justice and stable conditions so much. Indulging in our own feelings when everything gets too much feels right at first, but is ultimately of no use to anyone. Feelings can be things that hurt us outside of our own scope. That we can't do much about. And to accept that, deeply and truly is a first step out of our own misery. To understand that in many ways we are just a small grain of sand in the great universe and that we  really are without power most of the time, especially when it comes to world events. We have to see things as they are. That's the first step in changing things. 

But we shouldn't get into unrealistic expectations. If we fight against reality, we will lose. Every time. And it is the same with fighting against our own Feelings. We humans rub ourselves up against our unrealistic expectations of the world. We want the world to be different from what it is and because the world doesn't bend to our expectations, we get sad. Or depressed. Or anxious. Or whatever unpleasant feeling there is. Because the world should please be as we would like it to be: just, gentle, loving, compassionate, solidary, full of love. We all want a beautiful world. 

The funny thing is, that we think we have an ugly world, which is just not true. Of course, ugly and bad things happen all over the world every day. And the media never gets tired of telling us about every person who was shot at the other end of the world. While we do not learn about all the beautiful things that happen every day in all distant lands because the media has learned that bad and shocking news sells better. Now we get what we got ourselves into with our media over-consumption. Yes, the world is ugly - but the world is also beautiful. Yes, horrible and terrible things happen in the world every day - but great things also happen every day. People show compassion, solidarity and charity. There is love. And there also is Freedom. We're most often just caging ourselves, trapped in our own mind and fueling our bad thoughts every day. 

Yes, the world is black and white - and red, green and yellow too. The world has tons of colors that we don't even know of yet. And feelings of depression or sadness will also arise if we see the beautiful sides of the world and if we stop keeping our eyes on the shadows. But it is much easier to live in a pleasant world with some pits of sadness, rather than indulging in our own bad feelings. One way out of this is to focus again on the beautiful and good things in life, however small they are. There is good out there and we can see it, if we stop focusing on the bad. 

The global illiteracy rate has halved in the last few decades. And more and more people in the world are achieving modest prosperity. Global poverty is falling in absolute and relative terms. Unfortunately, the media does not report such good news. There are many positive trends not only globally. A lot happens on our doorstep, too, which just keeps getting better and better. There is so much positive news. All we have to do is go looking for it. I'm not saying to turn a blind eye to the bad things in the world (even if the bad in the world wouldn't care). It's no less bad just because you're looking - or worse if you don't. I'm just saying that just looking at the bad is one-sided and not good for the soul at all. By taking a closer look at where we can see good and inspiring things, we can change a lot about our mindsets and eventually about ourselves. 

What can you do? Cut back on media consumption and try to stay away from most of the news. It's cliché, I know, but it actually makes a big difference. I've been there, thinking about how stupid it seems that such little things like reading the news could have an impact on how I feel. But after some time you will realize that it's quite true and does change your feelings for the better. The most important (bad) news about friends and family will still end up with you. You don't have to be afraid of becoming unworldly if you go on with your day without your newspaper or without checking the news. Another idea is to keep a little diary/notebook with the good things in life. With the good trends. With the things that are good in the world. With the things that are good here with us. Just in case if you need to remember. 

Yes, the world is getting crazier. I'm not going to say it isn't. But we humans are all a little crazy sometimes, also because we want things we can't have. What we can have (and learn) is to have control over how we feel sometimes. By not surrounding us with the bad things all the time. There is so much beauty everywhere and so are we. I think we fit in quite well with this world.

Thank you for reading! I hope this can inspire some people to find motivation to keep going!

128,"I've been walking back and forth with my phone in my hand, wondering whether or not to post this, I'm not sure if it even fits in with the sub rules.

The situation is long and very complex, I'm basically going to do a huge TLDR instead of writing it all out.

My sister is 21, and for 2 years has been addicted to cocaine, alcohol, crack cocaine and ketamine. She's always been really successful ever since leaving school, the addiction problems started after she met her boyfriend.

So basically we've had several interventions, she says she's stopped, now she spends 95% of her time at her boyfriend (who i know does drugs but family don't know and I feel like I can't tell anyone), my mum thinks she's sobor and just drinking.

Since I used to take the odd thing when I went out as a teen, I know the symptoms of drug use (staying up all night, sleeping all day, chattering teeth, shakes, eyes etc) and I can tell she is still doing it on the weekend and presumably during the week too. 

Its having such a huge effect on my mental health, I'm not sleeping or eating properly, constantly worried about her. Constantly thinking she's doing stuff, feel like driving round to her boyfriends house and driving a brick through his skull.

does anyone’s anxiety lead them to their mind playing tricks on them and seeing things that aren’t there? let me preface it with this: i just got out of a 10 day quarantine because my husband had covid and that whole time i occupied the downstairs and cared for our 16 month old. the stress added up as the days went by because i’m not good sitting with myself. i was doing ok at night, only had to drink a couple nights to loosed up before bed and wasn’t having my crazy people thoughts creep in too heavy. that all started as soon as quarantine ended, which is the strange part.

i have a past drug history with a wide variety of things but my mental fragility really comes from a time i was doing a lot of molly and having visual hallucinations of demons. ultimately it stole a big chunk of my sanity and time. i have since struggled and recovered from other addictions and come to an amazing, healthy and beautiful part in my journey. 

my issue is last night i get up to pee and i’m
transported back to this ‘demons are coming’ like booo! a ghost, entity, exorcism type demon delusion. it’s one i’m extremely familiar with from my drug use but i find it flares up during times of stress and has me holding my breath and listening when i wake up at night. last night in particular i had a visual of a women’s face in my front door as i looked down the stairs which is directly below our bathroom. so i spent the rest of my night from 3am on just thrashing in bed, unable to go pee because i legit almost had a heart attack. i know now it was just an illusion because i did hang up a wreath and there’s no entity in my house lol. 

BUT WHY AM I POSTING ABOUT THIS at 7am on reddit looking for anyone who can relate. i feel straight up crazy right now and my husband says my anxiety is legitimately concerning at times. am i literally losing my mind seeing shit? should i be more concerned. it’s just so weird cause i just felt like i do so great sometimes and this whole past i’ve had seems so far in the distance but creeps up ever so often.

131,"So, ever since I was 13 or 12 (I'm 17 now), I've had an identity crisis of some sort. I've not known who I am, what I like, what my style is, what my spiritual beliefs are etc. And from the ages of 12 to 16 I've tried to use those look like person x subliminals that are on youtube. I was obsessed with trying to look like countless of celebrities, like Ariana Grande, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid. I changed my spiritual beliefs and style/aesthetic all the time. And I kind of felt like if I liked anime, I had to dress and act in a certain way, that I couldn't dress emo and like anime and classical music, you know? My identity issues are still there, but I've stopped using those subliminals and trying to look like someone else, which is a big step. But I still feel like I'm trying to fit in a ""mould"" and that I'm changing aesthetics, career paths, values often. Like I've gone from wanting a whole-body suit of tattoos to not wanting any at all. And I don't know that to do, I've read on BPD and bipolar disorder, but the descriptions don't fit me.

It was one of those days today, and I posted about how I feel about a current situation. I wasn't seeking sympathy or anything, I'm honestly just trying to improve how I react to my emotions. I know I'm not doing what I should, I know that my thoughts and feelings about it are irrational and wrong. I know that I'm being immature. That's literally why I wanted help. I've been feeling confused and sad and I needed insight. 

Someone read my post and DMed me a lot of horrible things. Like, about 10 paragraphs. They mocked me, insulted me, called me names, and they made a lot of terrible assumptions about me. They don't know anything about me other than my post, but they were so quick to call me so many hurtful things. It just felt so... shitty. While reading their messages I started to feel suffocated and then I couldn't breathe for a few seconds. I feel a hundred times worse than I did before seeking advice.

141,"I have a mother who’s most probably depressed and had allegedly tried killing herself. See the way I’m talking about her it’s so evident that we were never really close as I’m growing up and so I never got emotional with her. No sharing, no taking about feelings, no nothing. And almost all the time that she has a breakdown, the family hides it and never talks about it, or is it just because they didn’t wanna discuss it to a teenager like me? Either way, I’m not a psychologist or anything but I’m pretty fucking sure they (my parents) need therapy NOW. Like right this moment. 

They’ve been together for 30 fucking years and has had 4 children together including me yet all this time they’ve had a failed marriage. They have the largest fucking age gap and it does more bad than good, my mom’s in-laws don’t like her and vice versa, my mom got pregnant before their wedding so it looks like a shotgun marriage, and all the other bad shit you could think of. Literally a tragedy, I don’t know how they could stomach everyday life in the same space, is it because my dad had the job to feed the whole family, is it because they were scared that the children won’t grow well if the other parent is absent, I don’t know, I don’t know anything, no one is telling me anything I’m too scared to ask everyone just shouts and talks in an angry manner. Every time they fight I don’t even dare listen anymore I just close the door (which does absolutely nothing because the doors and walls are thin) and put on music, but last Friday was different. I was having lessons online and while presenting I had to deal with their bullshit in the background they were louder than my fucking teacher how embarrassing. I also had a presentation and they were so loud that my friend heard my mom shouting at my dad. They’re literally so embarrassing I wanted to k*ll myself right there. I’m embarrassed that I don’t have a functioning family with adults that know how to settle fights, I’m embarrassed that I’m coming from a home of a cheater, I’m embarrassed for having parents who doesn’t know how traumatised their children are because of all the shouting. Btw, the reason of their fight this time is also insane. 

Apparently I have an elder brother outside because my dad cheated. My mom knew even before I’m pretty sure but they’re both in-denial. But just recently, my mom found out that all this time, they’ve kept their contact and my sibling outside even contacted my other siblings and they’ve been talking for a while. Of course my mom got SO ANGRY and SO HYSTERICAL that...well I don’t know for what because firstly, the woman who was the mother of my outside sibling is happily married now, second my sibling has lived his own life and it looks like they came from a well-off family so my dad didn’t even have to provide for him, thirdly all this time it was us that my dad “picked”, you know like he didn’t “settle” for them so to say, he lived with us. As he should, cheating and having a whole child outside, bruh HE had the choice to not cheat, he was educated and had a good job yet he doesn’t know the basics of society? The fuck he was a married man too. Now I don’t know what the fuck else went down with this whole bullshit of him having an affair and my mom finding out he also has a child with the mistress BUT what I know is, they probably never talked about the set up of things. Like sure right he stayed with us blah blah, my mom finding out was probably heartbreaking for her, they had their first argument and probably 100+ more arguments about the same shit again BECAUSE they never talked about things calmly, they never intended to solve or compromise with each other. This is all SOOOOOO DAMAGING not only for them but to their children also (e.g. ME). I’m brought up in a house always full of shouting and arguing which made me sensitive every time I hear someone else shouting, even in another setting, I remember flinching each time my teacher shouts in our classroom. Their ways were also passed down to their children most probably, one of my sibling got an anger issue and the other resolves arguments through fighting too. 

In all the 30 years, they never did shit. It’s like they don’t want to solve the issue. Sometimes I think of the what ifs, what if I was born in a happier family, what if my mom just annulled their wedding, what if my life was better even with another parent absent, what if my dad “chose” his other family and ran, all of these possibilities. But I know I can’t live in the past, hell I wasn’t even alive then to have a say. Right now, my oldest sibling is suggesting couple counselling for them but instead of that I just want my mom to go to therapy. Just an hour ago she was shouting through the phone saying things like “I worth nothing, Why don’t I just d*e”. I want to go to her and hug her but I can’t do that because I’m trembling myself. Oh no maybe I should also go to therapy. My sadness and worries for her are just understatements. But I also sympathise with my “outside” sibling, they grew up without a father figure and even a chat with my dad is not permitted. It wasn’t their fault that they were made by a cheater. But then again no one can say when my mom should forgive and forget even after 30 years, I understand that. But there’s so many ways to conclude this 30-year madness, and they’re not considering any of it because of their feelings, pride and ego. Shit’s embarrassing, I can’t stress it enough. My mom’s hit rock bottom so many times because of the man she married and had children with, I wonder how long she can go before any inevitable things happen.

142,"it's just getting harder. i don't know what to do. yesterday i cried for probably almost an hour, alone in the shed. i don't feel like i can talk to anybody. i wish i could talk to my wife, but this whole thing is about her, and whenever i'm upset about something that has to do with her, it makes her more upset. i understand, she just hates thinking that she hurt me in any way. but SHE isn't hurting me, her illness is. she said she wants to go to the hospital just so she doesn't have to be around me so she doesn't keep dragging me down. she's so, so depressed, and we're getting close to the one year mark of her last suicide attempt that was very traumatic for me. i keep having intrusive thoughts about what she could do to herself. i know she doesn't want to kill herself, she's told me multiple times. that's the real her coming through. but when she feels so bad, she just wants it to end. i'm so in love with her and it's just hurting me to see her go through all this. she's just losing more weight and it's so painful to see pictures of her a year ago and seeing her now. her spine and ribs and hips are visible and her arms and legs are so thin and i can feel her joints through her skin because she has just no fat and no muscle and she's so weak now. she just can't eat. most of the time even looking at food makes her nauseous. she doesn't want this. she wants to be better but she's so exhausted and she wants to give up so bad. she feels like she's made so little progress but i've seen her grow just in the past year and it's been incredible. i don't know what it is, but she has to be delusional. she just can't believe that she's done any better or that she's safe in her housing (my parents fucking love her) and she doesn't trust anyone. she has bpd so i get the trust issue, but i don't get why she doesn't see how much progress she's really made. i can't let her see me like this. if she sees me like this then she'll feel horrible. but she hasn't done a single thing wrong, it's just tearing me up to see her suffer. i'm scared she's going to attempt again. i can't handle that. she thinks she's going to suffer for the rest of her life but she's not. i know she's not. i don't want to lose her. she thinks i'd be better off if she was gone, but if she died, my life would be over. i don't see a future without her. i see myself in bed, crying, never eating, never leaving the house, never doing anything ever again until i die, whether that be via myself or withering away alone. my dreams and aspirations would be crushed. i wouldn't care about anything anymore. everywhere i look, there's something to remind me of her. she loved this song, she loved this hobby, she loved this game, she loved that color, she loved that food, our pictures together, our pets. i can't help but cry just writing this. why can't i just make her better? why can't i just rip the fat off of my body and give it to her? i'm scared that i'm going to wake up and find her body. if her last attempt worked, i would have woken up next to her in the morning. she didn't write a note. i wouldn't have even been able to say goodbye to her. i don't even know what that would have done to me. feeling like i need to go to the shed again to cry. i don't want anyone to see me. my day has barely started and i feel horrible.",06Dec2020,1

149,"Hello everyone, this is my first post and Ill try to keep it short.

Im 25 y female, and almost 4 months ago I went through a horrible breakup of a 4 year relationship where I was thrown out of our apartment (because i texted another guy, I admit my fault and regret) , I moved 3 times ever since, and the hard part is that I live in his hometown where I have no friends or family, only my job  (which is good).
So I moved  into different apartments by myself, got infected with COVID and had to isolate myself, my family was also infected and sick in another country and in the meantime my grandma and grandpa died.
I got notified that I will lose my job soon, and that was also a huge stressor for me.
I managed to find even better job, but Im so anxious.
Everything is seemingly okay now, I bought a car, I rented an apartment with a roomate, I have a good job, things are settling down but why do I feel worse?

I feel like I was doing better while everything was going on, I was sad and grieving the loss of my boyfriend, his family(who I was very close with), the death of my grandparents, and loss of my job, but I was handling it one by one.

And now that the things have settled, I feel hopeless. I have trouble sleeping, I wake up in the middle of the night, I have horrible intrusive thoughts, even suicidal (more like how I would like to be dead, but not doing anything about it), I cant calm down my brain, its torturing me. Feelings of guilt, regret, despair, sadness, hopelessness.. I feel like Im falling into situational depression and I dont know what to do.

I wake up, put some makeup on, dress up, go to work, used to go the gym, and tried to fill my days, but now everything is closed due to COVID and I feel like im falling deeper down. Im like a dark cloud of negative energy. Everyone says that Im coping so well but I feel like I'm slowly dying off. I dont want to bother people with my problems anymore because its been 4 months and I feel they will get tired of me. Anxiety got the best of me. I feel like I will lose everyone around me, that I will be bad at new job, etc etc. I cant stop it.

I go to therapy, and I didnt take any meds in the meantime, not even when my grandparents died, I somehow survived it. But now that its all settled, I cant seem to cope and move on.

Is this normal? Am I falling into clinical depression? Should I reach out for some AD? Im really scared of the future.

155,"I was a minor when I was kidnapped and sex trafficked. My adolescence was stripped from me to the point I can’t even remember half of my life but I guess that’s just a trauma response. Apart from this I’ve come along way since these events; I had my first child at 21, graduated high school shortly after and have been working towards my diploma to work with children and youth. All I want is to help people even though it’s so hard for me to help myself, and what happened to me is currently happening to others. 

You can’t hear them, so I hope you will listen to me. 

There’s so many pieces to my story but I’ll try my best to narrow it down. I was a quiet girl, I had my own issues aside from this because I was bullied, struggled with academics due to having ADD, severe anxiety and depression. I was still content with myself. I wasn’t into smoking, drinking or sex. I hoped for companionships with likeminded people and thankfully I kept a small circle that accepted and supported me. 

A few months before I was trafficked, I was in my first relationship, so overwhelmed with emotions. A few months in I had lost my virginity to him. He pressured me but curiosity and my feelings got the best of me. It was heart breaking as he was the first person I was vulnerable with and he took advantage of me, giving me a false narrative of his feelings when this was all so new to me.  

I carried on with my life, I was still a high school student, looking for a job and being a “normal” teenager. I chose a bad day to go to the mall to hand out my resumes because had I known I wouldn’t make it home that night, I would of stayed home. I had no idea what was in store for me. I was taken by two girls in broad daylight, stripped down naked in the mall bathroom stall out of my varsity jacket and denim jeans into a mini skirt and corset. Painting my pale skin with bronzer, my lips are now fuschia pink and I look unwell. This all felt so planned out on their end, I was in a state of disbelief this was even occurring. They had thrown into an underground taxi and they brought me to their home. 

I was locked in a room for hours, being forced to watch them eat when I was starving, forced to take drugs and let them tell me I’m a worthless human being. They broke me. They pinned me to the bed and took advantage of me and took away my glasses. I am visually impaired and cannot cope without them. They had taken explicit pictures of me, forcing my clothes off and ripping my tampon out. I had no idea what was going on as I couldn’t see. Little did I know they were sending these pictures to Johns. 

I was being put up on the market like food for horny, old men to pick and choose from. Quickly after, I was in the home of a man 3 times my age. Despite my age, it didn’t stop him from sexually assaulting me. I said no, I did everything everyone taught me about consent and it still didn’t save me. 

He had returned me to them, limping in pain, legs full of period blood, rashes all over my face, body and $500 in my bra. Them telling me I hadn’t made enough money for them and I wasn’t allowed to leave until I made them the desired amount or they would slit my throat. I begged them and before I could clean myself up they had put me in another car to visit another John. 

I had to escape, even though it could cause me my life, I had to get out. I was beyond broken at this point. This man was even older than the last, but he wasn’t as aggressive. He was welcoming and kind but I had no trust in me to even hope for his sympathy. 

He did something right, he asked how old I was. I couldn’t hold it together even though the girls threatened to come for me if I screwed this up for them. He helped me escape in a drop of the hat. He put me in a taxi, I ran as far as I could to seek shelter and help. 

I ended up at a building and I banged on every apartment door begging someone to help me. I’ll forever be grateful for the people who came to my saving and helped me contact my family. 

I had contacted the police and my life has never been the same since. Years upon years of court, I was finally dismissed from court March 2020 for charging my rapist because he was legally allowed to appeal, this incident occurred 2012. As much as I’m thankful that’s over, I don’t have my justice. 

Life as of now I still don’t feel safe, not when there’s no protection order in place but apparently there’s nothing left to be done. Recently, I had moved into a new apartment and I come to find out one of my kidnappers lives here and on my floor. Small world right. She’s a parent now and I am forced to see her every single day. No one wants to help me, not the police or management. I don’t think anyone understands how damaging this is. They just say “I don’t know how you do it” I have no other choice, I can’t afford to live anywhere else. This is supposed to be a safe space for me and my child. 

If that isn’t bad enough, the girl who was in charge of this sex ring is now extremely involved at my college. She is a public speaker and a writer. If that isn’t bad enough I was completely floored when I found out she published a book this year talking about growth and prosperity. All I can think of is why does she deserve a platform to inspire people when she worked so hard to take my life away from me. Someone who had no remorse for what she did to me, she gets to live a fulfilling, successful life? 

Something that I’ve always wanted to do was write a book about my life. I love art and expressing myself through what I’ve gone through. But I’m struggling, every single day. I’ve dropped out of college four times because I’m so anxious. Doctors have prescribed me drug after drug but it lead me to attempting suicide in 2014, wait lists for Councilling are years and I can’t afford therapy anymore. I am a single parent to a special needs child, so he is always at the top of my priority list. I deserve my voice to be heard when it’s been silenced for so long, I just don’t know how. 

I deserve to be heard more than she ever will but why do I feel guilty that I’m wishing for their downfall. I just feel like they’re winning, when they’ve disabled me from my dreams. I hate being a empathetic sometimes. 

If you took the time to read this, thank you. I have gone through far more than this page could even hold with words and my story is still incomplete. I am grateful to have my family, being a mother and anyone who supports me. It’s what keeps me alive and going. 

I also want to say that I am safe and well protected by my friends and family. I am planning to move when I am able. 

Please listen to victims, you might not know what to say in return but let them be heard. Be an ally. We are fighting every single day and living is half the battle.

157,"Hi everyone!

I'm new here.

I  think I know what triggered my pure ocd. It's one strong emotion I had,  when a trauma happend. It was a question I asked the person who caused  this trauma during the traumatic event. The problem was the relationship  with this person, the people involved during trauma and the fears I had  and the questions I asked. Associations.

This  was many years ago, but first later in life I became aware what happend  there. I'm much better now, but I'm on this bullshit for about 7 years  now.

Is it possible somehow to ""rewrite"" these associations? Do you had similar experiences or talked in therapy about such things?

With how the year is going, it’s understandable when someone’s says that they are not feeling “*alright*”. So, what should that person do? Clear their mind as much as possible. The mind can be a very dark place if you allow the negative thoughts to take over. There are countless of ways that you’re able to clear your mind and I shall name them down below: 

- Keep yourself a diary or write a blog on a daily basis 
- Talk to a family member or a close friend
- Reading
- Exercising 
- Gym
- Meditation/Yoga
- Stay off social media for a while 
- Go for a nice walk 
- Distract yourself 
- Give yourself some breaks throughout the day 
- Breathing exercises

I hope some of these will help you out and clear your mind. Take it one day at a day, give these a go whenever you’re available to do so!

162,"As a kid I was weirdly resilient to trauma. 

I wasn’t just taking the pain and dealing with it, I wasn’t pushing it down, I wasn’t just being strong. I genuinely didn’t feel any distress from traumatic events at all. 

My mother has BPD, so obviously there were a lot of times where “your mom tried to end her life” or “your mom is in the hospital” or “your mom is not doing very well” was said to me. As a kid this was not really a big deal to me at all. I knew my mom could die... but... (and this hurts to say now) I genuinely did not care whether she lived or died at all. 

I remember when my mom and all my siblings moved out of state, while I stayed back home with my dad. We were at my grandmas house and she was balling her eyes out, but when she asked me if I needed anything, all I could think of is that I just really wanted to watch the scooby doo movie. I didn’t feel anything at all really. My mom was leaving and I’d probably only see her a few times a year from then on, and I was just totally okay with that. I knew what was happening it just didn’t bother me at all. 

Nothing bothered me. My family was actually really disturbed by it. I was like a creepily good child. Never really had fits, never was very loud, always just did what people asked... I liked it that way, it didn’t seem to make much sense to me why anyone would ever get super emotional. I thought people played it up for attention because I couldn’t imagine feeling anything strongly enough to even address it. 

As I got a little older though, I became more angry and violent, and very sensitive. The anger started when I was about 9 or 10, 3-4 years after my mom left. Then I became incredibly sensitive around when puberty started. It was sort of assumed that I was just hormonal, because it all coincided with becoming a teenager.... but now I’m an adult, and the emotions are still there, and I’ve been diagnosed with BPD. 

I’m super sensitive, super emotional, and incredibly volatile. I’m essentially a walking time bomb of emotions. 

I don’t understand what changed, because I didn’t act like this as an immediate result of trauma. I acted like this seemingly as an immediate result of puberty lol. 

It’s like I grew into my emotions. They’ve just gotten more extreme as years go by. I manage them better now, but they’re still there. 

How could I have been such a stone cold child, but act like a literal toddler throwing a tantrum as an adult?

I was never punished for having emotions as a kid, in fact people would often try to pull them out of me. They thought I was hiding my hurt or something, only to find there was absolutely nothing there. 

Everyone else with trauma says they were an emotional child but eventually grew numb, I don’t get why my brain did the opposite.",06Dec2020,1
163,"Hey so im still Living with my parents my dad is a cool Dude he was here for me my whole life (i'm 17 btw) but my mother on the other Hand was abusing me since i was 8 of course she never hit me but she was insulting me saying i'm not enough that im ungreatfull that i have her in my live (those insults came since i was 10-11) and things like that . So my dad knows about that. But she manipulates most of her actions that makes me seem the bad one. They were once near divorce. She told me its all because of me that im the problem. Today as most of the time she said that i cant make myself a proper meal (like WTF) and that she will make a meal for me. She started making it and i just said can i make it for myself than she said no and then when i wanted to take away one sandwich (it was plain) she gone on a rant (as always) but then she said why are you not explaining yourself so i just said shut up (i never talk back just cuz im scared i cant move still i dont have the money) so she just gone insane and i told her ,,calm down just lets not talk for some time"" and she said lets not talk ever again. So i decided to take her advice but first i said (when she was talking some bs story to my father about me) that i have enough of her. I have not talked to her for 2 days even when she said something nice. Should i continue? My father just hugged me and asked if i want to talk i just said that i do not have power to. That's all

But anyway, the therapy and the meds that help me with everything else don’t help with this. I used to only ever be violent towards myself, but then I managed to stop. Then it became things. I even got into (mutually) physical fights with my partner a few years ago, though likely we both went to therapy and that is no longer an issue. However today I got very angry over something seemingly small and I broke something - which to me rings alarm bells because I always thing that if you break things the next step is to hurt those around you, which I never want to do. I’ve also been experiencing a very low dip in my depression in the last few days. I don’t know how to control this. I don’t know how to relieve that frustration and rage that I feel sometimes.

I keep denying myself things I like, need, want.. Just to see myself suffer, to punish myself. 

For example: For international children's day, my parents said they'd get my sister and me one CD each. We could pick one. But I said I didn't want any, despite having a specific wish. Or they said that they wanted to help me and buy me a tablet I could use in school.. Which I'd find really helpful and good. But I said no. Just so I suffer. Or I was supposed to go to a Halloween party (before Corona started), but I ended up not going, even though I reeeeeaally wanted to. The list could go on and on.. 

The worst one so far would be me telling all my friends I was cis and changing pronouns despite knowing I'm trans, feeling comfortable with my identity as a transgender person and already being in therapy.

169,"\*Sorry for the ESSAY I'm about to write, I can never manage to be brief in reddit posts\*

To be honest, on first glance, I would consider my mental health much better at the present moment than it has been in the past couple years. I've never been formally diagnosed with anything, I used to go to this psychologist, but she was not great. She had a bunch of fancy degrees and such, but she mostly seemed to want to talk about my relationship with my parents and siblings, which really was not my major issue. Of course I had my disagreements with them, like any normal teenager, but she seemed to think that that was a problem, considering how much we delved into our relationship. Anyways, that's not really the point. The point is that I haven't been diagnosed with anything, and I so so do not want to sound like I'm self-diagnosing, but considering the symptoms that I've had for the past couple years, I'm pretty sure that I have OCD, social anxiety, (maybe GAD), and depression. I'm also almost certain that most of it, at least the anxiety and depression, has been brought on by school, something that unfortunately is probably true for many people of my generation.

I'm 16, a sophomore, and go to a pretty prestigious and swanky college prep school. I'm so not trying to sound pretentious, but rather trying to explain how this uber competitive, image-focused school is slowly destroying me. I get good grades; I'm taking all honors and one AP and have B+s and As in my classes. But since I'm put up to people in these classes who think ten times faster then I and get all A+s, my B+s feel like Fs. So, all of that causes the LOWEST self-esteem (to the point where I have no faith of getting into a decent college), massive anxiety (I feel physically sick before every test, and sometimes on ordinary days for seemingly no reason), and so much guilt, for not being the smartest, for not studying every waking minute; I just feel so LAZY and immature all the time, and hate myself for it.

About the state of my mental health; I'm in a tricky place. Since COVID hit, I've had the illusion that my depression is gone and my life is so much better, but I honestly think I'm just covering up my issues and pushing them down, which is not going to be good in the long run. Let me explain. Starting in probably eighth grade, and especially in ninth, when school started to get REAL, I went from hating school because it wasn't as fun as the weekends (doesn't every kid?), to hating school because it made me feel like an abject failure who wasn't going to get anywhere in life. I'm not going to delve into those couple years because that will take much too long, I'll just summarize it with that and focus on the present. This year, with the addition of my AP class (AP Euro, if anyone's wondering), school has become five times harder and so much more real and important. I can tell that in my grade, people are feeling much more stressed and anxious, but I feel like I'm not. This is semi-terrifying. The idea I've got in my head is that people are more stressed because they're working harder, staying more focused with school, and that's a lot of brain power and stress. I feel like I'm not working as hard. This year, I've  sort of experienced burn-out, I suppose. I've given up on trying to be top of the class, considering the geniuses in my grade and how much word they put in. I'm thankfully still doing well, but I procrastinate much more and seem to save EVERYTHING until the last minute. So while I feel less stress, there will be days where it will catch up to me and I'll realize how STUPID and LAZY I am for not dedicating more time to school, something even the less smart people in my grade can manage to do!!! And in addition to everything crashing down sometimes, I'm living under this constant cloud of guilt. If it's Friday, I'll be overjoyed that it's the weekend; I have two days to feel comfortable and safe, but then I'll realize I have put off my 40 pages of history reading. I will stress and procrastinate it all weekend until I'm pressed to do it at midnight on Sunday night, setting me up with a great four hours of sleep to start off the week. I also forgot to mention my sleep schedule is SHOT; six hours of sleep is a good night for me. What's even more concerning is that it doesn't even affect me anymore. I know that's horrible for my brain and long-term even, but I don't even feel it anymore. It's just harder to get out of bed initially in the morning, which is a bit scary. Eight hours is the absolute minimum for someone my age.  

From what I've read, procrastination is often an effect of anxiety, which totally makes sense. My anxiety for school is so bad that, for example, I will only let myself use the new pens that I ordered for non-school stuff, because then if I use them for notes, etc, I will associate them with anxiety, and I want to use them for journaling and writing songs in my room, my safe space.  Anyways, back to procrastination. In the past year, I've tried EVERYTHING to stop procrastinating. Fancy techniques, like Pomodoro timers, website blockers (for YouTube and such), but nothing works. If I block YouTube and put away my phone, I'll end up playing guitar or just wandering around the house. I think it's a mix of some internet addiction and just the fact that my procrastination is so bad, I physically can't stop it myself. I'm pretty self-aware and can be a strong-willed person, but procrastination has been the one big thing haunting me for years. I feel so guilty about it as well! I can't help thinking that I could get all As if I was just productive, that I'd be so much happier and just a better person. But somehow, that thought, nothing in fact, is strong enough to stop the procrastination. 

So, finally to the topic of the question, I'll try to make it brief. Residential. From my quite unknowledgeable outlook, my initial viewpoint is that only suicidal people go to residential, which I don't think is true in all actuality. The only reason I'm considering it is due to the fact that school is just going to keep beating me down, probably more and more, as I get through sophomore year and into junior year, which is fabled to be literal hell. I know that I can't keep this up. Procrastinating work, scrambling it together last minute, getting almost no sleep, pretending my anxiety isn't there, leaving it to occasionally explode and have a massive cloud of guilt and stress hang over my head. I'm pretending everything's fine and that I've got life under control, but honestly, it's just that this horrible cloud of negativity and self-hatred has been with me for so long and so PERSISTENTLY that it feels normal, just a given. I know if I told my parents about all of this (who are amazing, loving parents, don't get me wrong), they would tell me that I was being dramatic and outlandish, that high school is rough for everyone and you just have to stick it out. But I CAN'T stick it out. The fact that this mentality will be my life all through high school and perhaps college is inconceivable, I need to change, and quick, because someday everything's going to explode and all of my stuffed-down insecurities and anxiety is going to come out, and I have no clue what that will bring.

I'm so so sorry for rambling, but I'd just like to know. Are my parents right, does school make everyone feel this way, or do I have validity? Is this normal or not normal? Do I need help?

\*This post ended up being mostly about school, but I also have crippling social anxiety. Again, with COVID, I'm feeling more confident in my social skills, but that's because I haven't had to interact with much of anyone, so I've got a kind of false sense of security. It's quite bad, honestly. Raising my hand in class to answer a question leaves me shaking for at least a couple minutes. It's very irrational, but it's gotten so bad that I know I cannot change it around on my own, much as my mother would like me to believe..\*",06Dec2020,1

173,"Hey guys, I could really use your advice on something. 

I've always had a really close relationship with my father, but lately some of the things that he does might be narcissistic and have been hurting me. He has a very high opinion of himself, often believing that he is the most intelligent and charming person in the room. He will always dominate a conversation, sometimes talking just to fill the silence. He often tells stories that my family has heard countless times, and will get annoyed when we aren't as interested as he would like. Of course, he laughs at all of his own jokes, even when they can be uncalled for or inappropriate. If you don't laugh or call him out on it, you are either too sensitive or need to get a sense of humor. When we do get the chance to speak, he often interjects to try and complete our ideas. 

Politically, it seems that he is unable to reconcile that his own views and experiences on/in the world are not representative of everybody elses. He views people that disagree with him as either evil, stupid or naive. To him I'm the third, and I'll see things the same as him when I'm older. 

When you are helping him, he has trouble communicating what he wants, and then gets angry at you when you do something he doesn't want it can't anticipate what he needs next. He will sooner say that you need to be a better listener than apologize.

When he is helping you, physically or by giving advice, his always works off the assumption that you would want the same things he would in that situation. This sometimes leads to him going overboard trying to make things perfect. An example of this was when I asked him to proof read my paper, and then he spent the. next half hour trying to format my images to his liking. If you ask him to stop, he might get frustrated and say he just won't offer his help again. 

He owns a small business, and is very hit or miss with customers. Either they love him because he is friendly and loves to talk, or they catch him in a bad mood when he assumes that they are trying to make his life more difficult. In that case, he will not be the bigger person. Instead, it's like he uses that as an opportunity for release. Making this big grand gesture or speech 

The cherry on top is that he was recently diagnosed with cancer, so if you disagree with him, do anything that upsets him, or prioritize yourself then you might as well want him to die.

I honestly don't know what to do. I am financially dependent on him for college, but he consistently hurts my mental health and self worth. He has forced me to work with him, and I am not in a position where I can live on my college campus.

I feel like the reason he and I were always so close might have been because he views me as an extension of himself. Our most positive interactions are ones without any signs of conflict.

Are these signs of narcissism? Regardless, how would you guys respond to this kind of relationship? I don't know what to do.",06Dec2020,1
174,"The path. The journey. When starting my creative journey 3 years ago, I just started one day. I thought, theres something more to all of this. There is something more to life then we are told there is. ""9-5"", Marriage, House, Kids, Retirement........Death. I know, very strong for 9:53am, but it is what we are lead into from the moment we are born. Having this mindset and connecting with that we are on this planet once, alleviated stressors and continues to alleviate little things realistically that my mind tries to make it seem that its a big thing, to just **DO IT**, no nike reference but if the shoe fits........., again no pun intended.

  
We are on this earth once, even though I believe many of us have been on this world before, in a past life, but that conversation is for another day. 

  
Just try. Start. Start doing something that makes you feel good. That you don't have to think about, unconscious, unconditional, **PASSION**. Everyone has it. We think that we all have 1 passion, when I know many of us have **MANY** passions, its just we let our insecurities get the best of us sometimes, which is valid, it takes time.

  
The way I started my creative journey was by taking building photos, street photos on my iPhone. Travelling from my hometown just outside the city, to have a fulfilled day that I could feel deep down, was **needed.** Now, Here, I am.

  
I don't have it all figured out, nor do I want to. I love embracing what God has in store for me, what the Universe has in store for me. Its amazing to type that out because a lot of the times I feel that, I am not allowing and I am trying to force; force opportunities, force plans, force the next thing for me to do, so wow, thank you. :') 

  
Anyway, it really isn't that serious but is life? If we make it be. It can really be fun. Yes, there will be many hardships, many moments of lack of understanding, many moments that will make you pause and say ""should I really be doing this?"", but isn't that the best part of life? Its about the moments that are unexpected which leads you to a path that was always made, made for you, made for me. Together, separately. What a blessing we have all been given to Start a New Day Today.

  
I love you.

My parents made me quit and I had to start over from 2nd year in my new university. Ended up switching majors in my new country because I thought getting a psychology degree is useless. (I’m trying to get into the BCom department now)

I’m currently trying to study economics,math and have statistics next semester, all subjects that I never really had in high school and did poorly in middle school, so I’m really not interested in them. In short, i have no clue what to study in college, i have looked at all courses in my university and find none that will actually interest me. I’m too tired to start over. 

I do like to paint, and I’m good with fine art, but I never tried to pursue it as a career because it was ingrained to me since childhood that being an artist = being poor.

I have a big social circle back home, my best-friend and all of my close friends are trying to be supportive but I feel like they don’t relate to me when I tell them about my depression. I don’t blame them they are trying their best to be there for me.

I got a customer service job 2 months after I came here and I’ve been doing really well, I might get promoted soon. Its the only thing that keeps me going everyday because I think at-least I have that sorted out.

I want to leave university, take a year off to figure out what to do, but I feel like I will be judged by my friends, my parents and I will ultimately become lazy and never go back to studying. 

I have always been a straight A student for my entire life, even finished 2nd in my class in high school (I studied psychology, English, geography, political science and history).

I always feel angry, frustrated, I want to punch my parents in the face all the time. They never had mature discussions with me about migrating, it was more like “we know what’s good for you so do as we say”. They don’t really care what I’m studying or what my interests are. 

I have only 2-3 friends here who are in university but I’m not so close with them and when i do meet them it’s mostly light hearted discussions and I don’t want to burden them with my life dilemmas. 

I think about suicide alot these days, even wrote a note (but it was more of a note about cursing my parents and calling them all sorts of names). 

I tried to email 5 therapists from my home country as therapists are cheaper there but all of them said they won’t take clients until February.

I probably have described this really poorly because I’m so disoriented right now and the main point is I’m mentally and physically exhausted, i feel trapped. I have a hard time trying to convince myself to eat, to take a shower, to study. I’m not lazy i need direction in life. If i could somehow go back to my home country i would but i need to stop my wishful thinking. I used to be an ambitious student who thought she would study till she gets a Phd. But lol. I feel like shit all the time and my parents have caused 99% of this mess. 

I’ve never vented to an online community before so any help is appreciated. (Please do not ask me to talk to my parents they are idiots incapable of rational decisions and i want them to burn in hell).",06Dec2020,1

178,"English is not my first language, be gentle.


Shortly after starting quarantine, I started hating myself. I would check the mirror at least every 5 minutes. As soon as I left, I would start picturing myself  with my facial features compressed in one half of my face. I would take pictures and just sit staring at my face and crying. I hated the way I looked. I hated the way every other female face I saw looked. I got my face rated by AI a shitton of times, with the results being between 8 and 8.5. Nothing helped tho.
 
This lasted about a week. I spent the following week in bed crying or taking depression naps. I couldn't find a reason to keep living, I could barely go to the online classes.

Last week I started questioning whether I had a chance of ever getting a boyfriend as a tomboy. I looked for reassurance everywhere, to the point where my for you page on socials was full of sexist shit. I was seriously questioning whether I was just an object for men.

Now I am starting to hate my face all over again. I can't go long without checking a mirror. What the f- do I do?",06Dec2020,1

I think I enjoy it a bit actually but I know it is a horrible trait to have. I'm already in therapy but that's not working at all. I still catch myself daydreaming and spiraling out of control. 
What makes my whole situation way better is that I've just had a huge fight with my ex gf and basically threw her out of the flat of my parents. 
I also always just get way too much into bad thoughts and almost feel like i dont wanna get out of my current mental State and enjoying it in some sick and twisted way. Like I said that is an incredibly toxic trait to have and I really wanna get rid of it but I just dont know how. 
I know that an internet platform which mostly consists of memes and porn may not be the best place to take that problem to but I'm just completely stumped and dont know how to help myself or how to change myself.
Another problem is that I have big problems with changing my way of life or just the way how I behave in general.
And again I know that that's a horrible combination.

183,"     This is probably a stupid question and with all the other stories on here it seems pretty light, but I have an autistic brother. He is older than me, and a LOT bigger than me, me being 5’3 and him being close to 6 foot. He also pretty much has the brain of a toddler. He’s decently high functioning(he can talk), but not high enough to make his own decisions and to know what he’s doing.
     For my entire life he’s hit me, pushed me, kicked me, pushed/kicked me off or out of areas such as a couch or bed, thrown things at me, used his stuffed animals or whatever he has in his hands to slap me with, etc. I think at one point a few years ago he even had a knife, but I can’t remember too well. My parents have done all that they could to prevent this but it barely does anything. Especially with me being his prime target to go after no matter what mood he’s in. My parents always tell me to forgive him, because it’s not his fault that he does it. I recognize that and I try to keep it in my head whenever he goes to attack me, but sometimes I can’t help but hate him a little bit.
     Because of him i always tense up whenever someone is behind me. I always need to know who I’m in a room with, at all times, and where they are. I can’t sit next to him anymore, and I can barely stay in a room with him. It’s been established that he’s a major contributor to my emotional detachment as he used to laugh whenever I was upset when I was younger and other reasons. And it’s also been established that my anxiety has been heightened because of him. 
     I don’t really know if this actually counts because since he’s autistic he can’t control what he’s doing or know that he’s hurting me. But I can’t really ask my parents about it and it’s been bothering me for a while now. Sorry for the long post!!",06Dec2020,1

187,"In my opinion, people who consider suicide don't want to die. They actually want to live but they are being denied that. So the only solution and the only choice they can make appears to be suicide. Because that dramatic end of life will actually make you live longer through painful memories, it will give your life a purpose. Maybe some people would learn something from it. It definitely seems better than going on with your misery and suffering, dragging other people down or getting absolutely forgotten. I think depression has nothing to do with it. Depression is somewhat subconscious and it makes your body give up and prepare to die, but thinking about suicide comes from a conscious evaluation of your life and your desire to have a purpose and not be forgotten",06Dec2020,1

An I think I can even go so far that this problem of mine is resolved because of a simple 30 min conversation on WhatsApp with a good friend of mine. 
Talk to your friends. Even if you think they dont give a single shit about your problems you're wrong. They are your friends for a reason. They will listen to you and they will try to help you. Dont deny it. If you do so then you'll just spiral downwards like I did. 
Believe me if I say that. You are not alone with your problems.

but at the same time its mroe than just my face. its outfits and the aesthetics of things like my room or even something stupid like a hairbrush. if im not happy with the way something looks (including myself)  i'll just throw it out or rip it up or i'll completely break down and cry and scratch myself manically. 

and at the same time (about my face) sometimes ill go through days (sometimes weeks) where i'll feel so completely pretty and gorgeous that i'm literally invincible and nobody could ever say a bad word about me. i dont knoe exactly how to describe it other than ""invincible"" and like i could do anything and get away with it because i'm gorgeous and also feeling like i'm completely superior to everyone else because of my looks.

basically i find it really reslly difficult to go to school even the thought of going will set me off crying / in a bad mood. and i literally dont know what to do about it anymore because it seems to get worse and worse. almost everybsimgle morning i will cry and cry hysterically sometimes even on the way to school / in school bevahse i dont wanna go / be there. 

its lead to many many screaming matches on a morning with my parents or me just begging them to let me stay home. i dont know why i hate going so much but everything ive tried to make it better just doesnt work at all. i still always find a way to hate it. it's jsut so completely unbearable. and im exhausted. all of the time. it makes me want to die very badly.

and so exhausted to the point where i have no hobbies or things i like to do because i just cant focus on anything anymore. im so tired all of the time and i cant bring myself to do anything. and rvery weekend is the same : im so tired that i can barely drag myself out of bed or mostly even TALK.

i have some childhood trauma from when i was a lot younger and some stuff happened over the internet (sexual exploitation/grooming) which i have been in therapy for. but the problem is i just dont feel anything about it. i dont feel angry or upset or grossed out or ashamed. i just feel indifferent completely. 

and i also can't remember anything of what happened. any little details or my reaction or my parents or my families. 
but is it possible for this incident to have caused my mental health problems now and for me to just not realise the connection between them?

its just that it concerns me a lot that i dont feel anything about the situation, in fact i remember one thing from the incident : i was angry because i thought everyone was making such a huge deal about it snd didnt see the problem. i still feel like that now - i feel like my personal situation was never serious.
and it concerns me also that i dont think about it daily, that i can go days or even weeks and completely forget it ever happened until i'm reminded (unlike most who are constantly thinking about what happened, reliving it).

One common theme throughout 2020 is that people just don't fucking listen to what I have to say. It could be anything from something trivial or something serious. I'm talked over or just flat out ignored or they just brush anything I say to the side.

These aren't just random people I've found on the street, these are friends and family and even my own therapist. 

Earlier this year I switched therapists because while I liked the one I had, he just wasn't providing any guidance on coping skills or anything to overcome the depression and anxiety. When I switched therapists, my new one doesn't even believe anything I say. I'll say I've been having a tough time trying to get out of bed because I'm so depressed and she doesn't believe me that my depression is that bad. I'd look for a new one but that's the third therapist from that office I've had a bad experience with so I'm pretty sure they all just suck. I've heard other people complain about that place too.

When I'm in a bad mood or having a rough time, no one ever really stops and asks me if I'm okay. All they do is complain that I'm short with them, or that I've gotten ""lazier"" or don't talk as much. Its not like these people don't know i suffer from bipolar II, they all know. They just keep complaining about these things but no one ever asks me how I'm doing. Ever. I feel like since they've known about my diagnosis for 2 years and known I struggle for longer they'd recognize the symptoms of a depressive episode. But no, they complain about everything I do.

Opening up to my family is out of the question since they just yell at me for being sad, but when I try to open up to other people either I get brushed aside or they just shut me down by talking about what I should be doing instead. I get they have their own lives, but these people are big parts of my life and I just feel like a background character in theirs. Or a punching bag to take out their frustration and anger (no one actually hits me though so dont worry lol)

I just want to fucking shake one of them and go ""YOU REALIZE I'M STRUGGLING HERE, RIGHT?!"" but even then it might fall on deaf ears because that's how bad its gotten. 

All of this has resulted in a deeper depression and a feeling of exclusion and hardcore isolation. I mean, these are the people who are supposed to be there for me when I get down. Why are they just making it worse? Why are the excluding me? Why do they ignore the fact these are symptoms? I understand that I'm short with people but I'm not trying to be an asshole. Why don't they ask? Even if I'm the one who goes to them first, why don't they care? 

These are the people who are supposed to build me up, not tear me down.",06Dec2020,1
204,"Hello
Things I’m describing here are with me for a long time, a little bit more than 9 years. 
I need some advice. Maybe someone here had similar experiences. 

I hear voices that are not part of others’ perception. There are two types of them

There are many voices of people I don’t know. They seem to comment things I do or see. Talk about me in third person. Sometimes they are discussing different topics between each other. Sometimes they argue. Sometimes they scream. 
They speak different languages, age differs, both male and female. 
Sometimes they just describe my activities like they are talking from a perspective of time. Like they are talking about me in a past tense. Like telling each other about my life after I’m gone. 
They are neutral. Nor supportive or negative. 

What’s important is that they are inside. I don’t hear them like somebody next to me are saying those things. They are coming from inside my head. I can distinguish them from real people. 

And there’s the second one. It has a personality, separated from mine. Separate thoughts, needs ideas, to some extent. We seem to be connected in some way, in terms of thoughts, yet separate in the same time. It has a name. I first heard it 9 years ago in my sleep, when I was 11. Since that moment it stayed with me every singe day. There was literally not a single day when we haven’t spoken. 
We communicate inside my head. This voice is also from inside. Like some sort of inner voice. I can distinguish it from an “outside” person. We cooperate in everyday life situations. Through these years we developed a close relationship. 

Our memories are common. We both have access to all of them. I can think of some thinks keeping it from the other person and that person can do the same. Sometimes my thoughts can escape me to the other person. We are connected in some parts and separate in others. We have similar personalities, but not the same. We may have different opinions. I’m in control of physical activities. The voice is not taking control of anything, just being there. Sometimes it starts the conversation sometimes I do. But I always feel it’s presence. 

We joke together, make small talks, make decisions about future. Solve problems, comment daily life. I consult things with it. We feel each other’s emotions in some weird way. It may seem stupid but I feel like there are two souls inside, like siamese tweens or something. Connected in some way but separate in another. 

As I said we became close as we made it through a lot of situations together. It appeared in relatively calm period of my life. I would never do anything to make it go away, I treat it like an integral part of myself. 


I’ve kept it secret since when it appeared. Learned to hide it from others. Make excuses if I made a mistake, communicate in an unnoticeable way. Nobody knows about it. At the very beginning the voice asked me to keep
It secret.

But I want to hear your opinions. I had a depressive episodes in the past. There were cases of schizophrenia in my family. Regarding overall scope of my situation could you tell me what do you think? Have you ever heard about similar situations? I mainly mean the other person not the commenting voices. 

Is it a way I am, and is it normal to some point? Does it seem like a schizophrenia symptoms to
You? I feel it’s real, not an illusion. Could it be an imagination of small kid who wanted a friend? Would it stay with me since, being present every single day..?",06Dec2020,1

Because they were able to pull themselves out they believe I can too, but frankly I believe they still get depressed sometimes because they don't like relying on others at all. And they think therapy is for broken people and that I'm not broken or I'm just sad and kids are easily dramatic. And I understand I could be in a way worse off situation but the thought of I cant do this anymore is getting to an hourly basis.",06Dec2020,1
212,"Idk what flair fits best, but it will probably end in me venting. Trigger warning for suicide, self harm and other stuff in general.

So I also want to know/ask how mental health education goes in other countries. (I live in Belgium)

I just realised that it's shit. We got awareness about mental health but that didn't do anything. They said us how dangerous it is, to make sure to never fall into that rabbit hole. They told us what depression, anorexia and bulimia are. That was kinda it. Not much else. They told us about these three and how bad they are. Didn't mention other mental disorders. (We did learn about gender dysphoria as well but that was just a short thing and never talked about in debt so no one in my class even remembers that topic)

But ONLY about how bad they are in the worst stages. Suicide, selfharm, underweight,.. that kind of stuff. But not how it starts, no early signs, not how to recognise it. Not where to seek help. They said to seek help if we ever where in trouble, but not where. They said to not fall into the rabbithole, but not how to avoid it or recognise when you start to fall. 

Nothing. They said self harm is a bad coping mechanism, don't do it, find other coping mechanisms. What other coping mechanisms? Idk , they never told us that. 

Anorexia and bulimia aren't the only eating disorders btw, you also don't have to be underweight to have an eating disorder. You don't have to self harm to be depressed. Not everyone who is depressed feels suicidal, not everyone who cuts wants to die. Cutting isn't the only way to self harm. 

Did we learn about any of that? No. Of course not. Who needs to know how to find help, know the signs, save themselves? We see ourselves struggle and instead of thinking about it, we say we aren't depressed, nothing is wrong because.. Aren't depressed people suicidal selfharmers? Nah, then I am not depressed, I am fine.

This is how it started for me. I didn't know the early signs. I thought this was normal, everyone told me it is normal to feel down sometimes. So I just thought: Okay, then I'll endure this. Little did I know that was only the beginning of something far, far worse... I endured it for a year I think, maybe a bit less. But yeah, it got worse and worse over time and by the time I realised what I was doing, it got too far. I felt horrible and needed a way to cope. You know what way to cope I knew? THE ONLY WAY I KNEW BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TEACH US A HEALTHY ONE?  Yeah you probably guessed it, self harm. I started doing that. And yeah I saw why it was a coping mechanism, but I realised soon enough why it wasn't a healthy one. Not only do you damage yourself, it's an addiction that makes you feel worse everytime you do it. Did that for a while and then felt like this wasn't enough. I didn't know how to deal with it and at some point I attempted suicide. Did I see it coming? Yes. Did I try to seek help? I tried, but where? I was never told how. And my parents aren't very accepting so I couldn't ask them. I didn't want to be a burden. I thought I could fix it myself. Then I started to be more picky in what I ate (not really picky, I started to count my calories and avoid food with a lot of calories, people called me picky). I did consider that maybe this was a bad thing, but the only thing that I knew about eating disorders was that those people where underweight... Was I underweight? No, I even weighted too much, so how could I have an eating disorder?.. 4 Months later and I was on the verge of being underweight, and I didn't see it. By the time you reach that point, the point they tell you about, what you should watch out for. You don't see it anymore. You are too far gone to see it. 

It went on for 3 years, eating disorder came along for the last half year. Idk what happened but something in my head clicked and I became aware of what I was doing. But it was too late. Multiple attempts, of the verge of being underweight, scarred. Both physically and mentally. I wanted to seek help, but I didn't know how. I still don't know how. I am trying to find my own way, I search online for tips and how to fix it. But that's really hard if you barely have the energy to get out of bed and no one can help you because you never told anyone, you just don't know how. And I know this isn't for everyone, but in my case it could've been avoided with better education (well, not completely avoided, but a lot less damage then I have now)

If they are going to give education on the topic, give it properly. If I want to know what depression is like then I can listen to any song in my playlist or quickly search on google, but teach me more about other disorders, teach me the early signs, teach me how to deal with it and how to seek help. Break the stereotypes, not everyone that has an eating disorder is a white girl with a horrible life. My life was (kinda) good. Aside from the unsupportive family but that problem wasn't there at the beginning so I don't count that, and yeah I am a guy so the stereotype doesn't fit me anyway. 

Also, teach about causes. I know some people that had horrible mental health because they were in an abusive relationship and didn't realise it. No around them did either because no one even knew what that was. I am trans and I didn't know what that was until maybe a year and a half ago. I always thought that girls were supposed to feel so horrible about themselves and wishing that they were a guy. No one ever told me what trans was, I just thought I was sick at some point.

 Or teach people that it doesn't have to have a cause. Despite my heavy dysphoria days, I had a fine life. One of my excuses was that my life wasn't bad enough to be depressed about. That I was just an attentionseeker.. 

Anyone else got this problem with education? If you even get any education at all? 

Sorry for the long post but I wanted to talk about it and vent as well so yeah..

213,I am 17 and I have no support when it comes to my bipolar disorder. And I just could really use a friend rn 😔,06Dec2020,1
214,"I have bipolar 2 disorder and feel I have been discirminated against by my GP surgery for it.

They refused to prescribe lithium when I returned from working abroad even when requested by psychiatrist due to refusing to do blood tests during pandemic 

Since I stated it is against CCG advice ( I confirmed with them)  they are denying that happened. Waiting for my psychiatrist to confirm or lie.

The receptionists speak to me rudely on the phone and they ignore emails when I send them or pretend they didn't recieve it. My entire interaction with them is me being polite and them being hostile. 

But it has become a pattern and I now feel it is undeniable.

I essentially don't think they believed I was working abroad in switzerland as people from the poor town I grew up in do not work places like that. They view me as some mentally ill piece of dirt. And are now covering it up 

I avoided them for 6 months after that happened but recently required blood tests  as a urologist said yearly checks were necessary having had an MRI to check for cancer a year ago in switzerland. 

They ignored my emails for 10 days then agreed to the tests then left half of them off then made me wait another 10 days in all it took a month. Then they ignored the medical records that I sent and didn't add them to my file. When I complained they said there was an IT issue but when I contacted the pathology lab they reiterated what my GP surgery said until I explained why I was asking then they refused to answer anymore questions and told me they were provided that explanation by my GP surgery.

I have recordings of the phone calls and the email evidence and will soon do a subject access request to get more evidence.

A lawyer has already told me I have a case but will cost more in litigation than I would get in a settlement but I have plenty of savings so this doesn't concern me.

What concerns me is the immense stress this has caused me.  I want to pursue it so they don't treat other people this way but the stress has caused hypomania In me.

What would you do ? Pursue it and damage your health? To help other people in the future? Or forget about it?  I have a meeting with them tomorrow where I will play them the recordings ( practice manager said in a recording the GP not speaking English as a 1st language may be at fault but this isn't true I am sure. It is just disability discrimination) 

They will be screwed if I move forward with it but It is damaging my health.

Any advice ?",06Dec2020,1
215,"It all started when from before I was born when my mother met my father. They were both around 20 at the time and had met each other at the local chruch and they got friendly with each other. They started to get close to each other and then my mother fell in love with my father and after a while they would start going out and my mother gave birth to me. This would have been a sweet love stoy of a young couple that started a family together if my father was not a real psychopath i.e he does not have any semblance of empathy. The reason for that my mother was hooked up by my father was because of that he was an immigrant from Peru and wanted permanent residence in Sweden so he took advantage of my mother and as a means of an end I was brought to this world. My mother was abused mentally, physically and sexually by my father and I was my fathers trophy. At night he would take me around in the city to hook up women saying that ”he could take care of children” at one point he was dating 9 women including my mother at the same time. How he pulled this off was that he had s*x with one woman and hung out with her and then he would say that he would ”get to work” and then met the other woman. As a result I probably have a bit more than 20* half siblings on my fathers side. As he did this he ran a cleaning service for restaurants and shopping malls and commited tax fraud, he lent money from the mafia and he bought cars under his ”best friends name” and then he ditched that ”best friend” and left him with 20 sport cars that the ”best friend” cud not afford and got in debt. The poor guy did not know of this so I am pretty damn sure that he was shocked by this when he found out what had unfolded.

I lived my first 3 years in this enviroment and when I was three or more close to 4 my dad got charged for tax fraud and fled the country and abondend my mother who had ptsd and psychosis from the abuse that she had went through and she could not take care of me and my brother. My mothers apartement was a mess and there was filth everywhere. One day the Janitor checked in on my mothers apartment and he saw what state my family was in and I was transferred to the soc (basically the social security centre of sweden) and I was separated from my mother and had to live in a foster family. This foster family had kids before I was transferred to the and I was mentally abuse by them for the entire yeart that I was with them. I transferred over the summer to another foster family for the summer and honsetly that summer is probably the best summer that I have ever been through and I truly felt at home but it was only a temporary placement and later I was transferred to the foster family that I ultimately grew up in.

As long as I remember my family have tried their hardest to make me as male as possible, they forced me to cut my hair short and do activities that are supposed to be masculine, they never really put any thought to how I felt and they forced me to go to church everyday as they pushed their beliefs on me. If I acted in a slightly feminine way my parents and my 5 foster brothers would mock me and frankly bully me, it was not a safe environment in any sense of the word. If I did not behave like they wanted me to or if I did not follow their made up rules they would scold me and yell at me. I legitimately believed that if a child my age disobeyed their parent they would be forced to not use their mobile devices for a week and that they would be ostracized by their parents. They always scolded me for minor mistakes every single day as I grew up in their family and I never got their praise for anything I put my effort to consequently I geniunly started to belive that nothing I do is right and everything that I do is wrong.

Amidst growing up in this enviroment I noticed that the boys around me were very different to me, I was bullied because I acted in a feminine or rather ”timid” way.  I was different from them and they did not like that I stood out so they bullied me. I never had any safe space to confied in and wherever I were I would be a scapegoat. The people I belived were near me mocked me when they thought I could not hear them and they did to me purely because I stood out slightly more than then. So I dragged myself into a shell, and distanced myself from everyone around me and if I had to be around someone I tried to act as ”masculine” as humanly possible, I picked up interests that I did not really have such as cars so that I would fit in with the boys in my school although I was instead bullied because I did not stand out at all so I was an easy target. The bullying went on from when I was 7 until I was 17 and amidst all of that crap I realized why I was so different from the boys around me.

When I was 14 my mother showed me an article from the local newspaper about a FTM transperson who had gone through HRT to deepen his voice and change his body structure slightly so that it matched their identity,. At this point I had wished that I was born as a girl since more than 7 years back, I would dreamingly tell myself ”I wish that I could wake up as a girl the next day” or similar things but with the limited knowledge I had I thought that it was impossible. I just thought of it as a delusional fantasy of mine, ”AMABs growing boobs is impossible”. Please note that I did not have any acces to the internet until I turned 14. Anyway reading about that transitioning FTM transperson literally shattered my world view, what I thought was just delusional was something that was real and there were other people that suffered the same shit that I had gone through as long as I remember. I was not crazy and first and foremost I was not alone.

Although by the way I was raised by my foster parents and their obivous disgust as they talked about the transitioning FTM transperson made it clear to me that if I would go out to me that if I ”went out” to my parents my life from then on would be literal hell. At the summer of 2015 I was so riddled with dysphoria and depression with a sprincle of anxiety that I was not willing to live anymore, if I never in my entire life could live true to myself and never be happy as the person I really I am there was no point in living anymore. But I did not want my family and friends to suffer so I made the decision to actually give living out my life a try and simultaneously decided to go out to my parents regardless of how much I would suffer after the fact because going to a different hell from the one that I already lived in was better than burning.

As I feared my parents are transphobes. They gatekept me from going to a gender specialist and I was mocked by my entire family and my relatives the day after that I went out to her. I literally laid myself bare to her but she did not care. She just thought I went through a phase, that I am trans because of it was trendy, that I am mistaking gender dysphoria with autism and that I would only regret it if I transitioned. So at first they forced me to talk to a counsellor about my ”depression” So I spent an hour talking to that counsellor about it and then she asked me ”and how much does this bother you on a percentile scale?” And I answered her ”10” then she asked ”And what is the rest of the the things that bothers you” and I told her that I am suffering from gender dysphoria and that I wished to go to a gender therpist. But my parents just gatekept me until I got 18 and did not need parents consent anymore. And fast forward to now I still don’t recive any sort of support from my parents. Honsetly I have accepted the fact that no matter I do my parents will never love me for who I am and I will always be a scapegoat.

Consequently because of the way I grew up and the upbringing I recieved I stopped to value myself as a human, if someone treats me badly and someone says that I should make them stop I instead cover for them because ”I don’t want them to be bothered” etc. And there are honestly times that I genuinly think that I am so worthless that I can not be called a human. Being treated nicely by others makes me feel uncomfortable because I am not used to feeling praise and I can never really take someones praise to heart. I prioritize my peers well being over my own and I am scared of voicing my opinion because I fear that I will be ridiculed and opressed. Honestly I am scared of making contact with people at all and because of that I seclude myself because I am too afraid of standing out. I just want to be true to myself but I am scared of being judged.

222,"Hi all, 

About a month ago, a woman moved into the apartment complex that I live in, and it's been absolute hell. I live on the ground floor, kind of near one of the back doors to exit the building, and she's *constantly* going in and out of the building, screaming obscenities, spitting, banging on the back door, and looking through the dumpster outside of it. I notifed my leasing office after about 3 days of this going on (happened from the time I woke up in the morning and went to work, til when I got home and went to sleep around 10/11PM), and was notifed that they had been contacted by some agency looking to lease a three bedroom to people with mental disabilities, and that due to the massive amount of complaints they've recieved in that short period of time, they terminated their lease and gave them 2 months to move. 

My issue is that it hasn't stopped this entire time. I'm very sensitive when it comes to people with cognitive or physical disabilities, as I have a relative with down syndrome, so I do not want to personally say anything to her that might make her feel unsafe/ridiculed and escalate the situation, but it's becoming quite a big problem. Obviously, the noise is a huge part, but her going in and outside without a mask (i live in one of the big three in the U.S.) and spitting and coughing while she's in the halls is just unacceptable in the middle of a pandemic. 

I've E-mailed the office a few times about this, but I don't really think there is much they can do about it besides wait until she moves out. I've spoken to a few neighbors from the ground floor over our tenant portal, and a lot of them are to the point where they are going to call the police/file a report with 311, but I genuinely feel *badly* about that, as I don't know if it's something she can actually control, and she'll be moving out within a month. 

I'm not a doctor at all, but from what I can see (by all of the ranting and screaming and spitting at things that aren't there), she has schizophrenia. I have never known anyone with schizophrenia (at least not to my knowledge), so does anyone have any advice as to how I might deal with this situation beyond calling the police on the woman? 

Sorry for the book.",06Dec2020,1
223,"Hi, my name's Elie, or at least that's the name I chose for myself, I'm 20 and I'm part of the group reffered to as ""ladyboys."" I know what you're thinking, but maybe it can help understand me.

I was 13 when my parent's separated. They argued all the time, sometimes violently.

When I turned 17 I was diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. I had counseling and despite being apprehensive at first, it did help. I wasn't entirely open with my counselor however, I omitted slight thoughts of self harm and a memory that bothered me. Our meetings focused on learning to deal with my anxiety and my gender identity.

I began to accept my identity and exploring myself when turned 18. I started taking hormone replacement therapy on November 2018. I felt an excitement I can't describe, and with a newly found life I stopped going to my meetings.

I thought everything would change, and a lot did, but somewhere around May 2019 my negative thoughts started resurfacing. I've always been underweight, not as bad as BMI makes it seem, but lately I've skipped meals when hungry. I've danced around the thought of hurting myself but I guess it would be for attention. I don't want to kill myself.

I've been going out with people I don't know very well, I know well I can't defend myself and that I'm a target both ways. But sometimes I think I wouldn't really care if something happened to me. It's an ugly thought, but maybe it would make me want to die.

Which brings me to why I'm writing this, the memory I mentioned above.

- My parents had been fighting and my dad had locked the door to the bedroom. My room had a hole in the wall and I could hear crying and screaming coming from theirs. I banged on their door and begged my dad to open it. It felt like an hour. He opened the door and I saw my mom crying on the bed, asking him to give her phone back. He turned to me and asked if he was a bad person, I cried stop, and he forced me to look at the phone. The phone had pictures my mom had sent someone.

I've told one other person about it, but I guess the anonimity helps. The memory bothers me and it makes me feel scared when I think about it. Sometimes I think it's the source of my discomfort with intimacy and other things.

To make matters worse, when I came out to my father two years ago, he asked if it was because of something he did.

At 17, it broke me completely. Because the courts don't deal with this very well, I was stuck with my mother. I became depressed and suicidal and attempted suicide on multiple occasions (the last one was an overdose attempt). Obviously, I failed and it took all of 12 seconds for one of my oldest friends to call the police on me. They have a unit for this kind of thing that I can't remember the name of, but they came and asked some questions then left. I am now on a sort of suicide watch, with check-ins every so often or the squad is called. I was then transferred to my dad's house (I go to the other house for 2 days every week). I still feel depressed as hell though, although not suicidal most of the time. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't afford a therapist, so that's out of the question.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a 23 year old guy who just lately bought himself an absolute dream apartment, I'm dubbed as the next big thing in the profession I do and I have a lot of really fine girls after me and because of these facts you'd assume a person would be happy and feel great however its the complete opposite of that.

I was in a relationship for the first time in my life for almost 4 years and at that time went through a phase of a lot of injuries which lead me to go have a lot of surgeries which ended up ending my career in the sport I love and apparently its a miracle that I am still fit and in great shape because there was a huge risk that I will not get back to sports.

Speaking of the relationships it was a relationship where the highs were by far the highest they could be and the lows were the lowest lows they could be, it was the first time I felt in love and at home with someone and before I used to be a person that would love being alone, thus the reason that was my first relationship too. But now after the relationship and after I bought myself the sick apartment I have been feeling the loneliest I could ever be, I have started to stress eat like crazy and gain a lot of weight in a small time.

The thing that did not help was the fact that me, a guy that isnt a one night stand kind of a guy had a girl coming over and it ended up with us having sex. It completely broke me and after that I feel sick and even more lonely. I feel like im in a hole and although I said there are a lot of girls texting me and trying to get to a position where they could be dating me however the next chapter will answer the confusing part of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I over my ex? -

&amp;#x200B;

We broke up few months ago and I will be completely honest and say that I probably have not gotten over my ex, but also at the same time I really would not want to be with her as she was extremely toxic and in our relationship I had a lot of people wondering how do I cope with everything we had, as she was extremely abusive and manipulative.

Everything apart from my previous relationship, which I feel are driving me insane:

I have been switching my friendgroups in my life a lot and that has led me to a situation where I feel the reason I'm lonely is that I dont have friends that would be down to do stuff with me as actively as I'd want. Mainly it is because a lot of them have girlfriends nowadays and that has led me to a completely isolated situation where I just keep on feeling an INCREDIBLE amount of loneliness pain. I cant stand being alone anymore and that is literally mentally killing me.

Also gym and running has always been something that has helped keep me sane, but due to the fact that right now its really cold in my country means that I cant go running because after the surgeries I had I have a situation where cold weather affects me and meaning that I cant run or do sports with cold because I am in a lot of pain.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How do I cure the immense loneliness? I feel like I'm heading to an extremely deep hole where I honestly am not sure I can come out of.

&amp;#x200B;

After my surgeries I was in a really dark state with depression but I managed to overcome it but I really do feel this time it isnt depression yet and it feels its heading to a WAY darker state and I am really scared of it because I have literally no one completely close to me.

2020 has been rough on all of us, but for me its been the worst.

At the time he was the bread winner for the house, then I was forced to step up to the plate. I was now looking out for a family of 7. But the issue was. I was doing everything. I payed full rent, water and food bills. All the while being accused of being a problem. Then. Covid hit, I lost my job temporarily and was put down even further. Then I managed to get my job back. But right after that my mother in law was rushed to hospital. Where we found out she had cancer. Qt first it was taken lightly, that she would do her chemo and make it through, and for a while that seemed the case. During this time my partner and I finally managed to move out. We were finally free and happy. 
But things have taken a turn for the worse. 
Now it looks like the mother in law will be lucky to make it to Christmas. She has gone downhill fast. And the discussion of what to do when the worst happens has begun. 

Im so scared of what the future holds and dont know what to do or where to turn.",06Dec2020,1

Last week, Someone I have known since I was a kid committed suicide. Prior to that incident another acquittance also took his own life.. 

It’s been months since I last posted here on reddit talking about my mental health issues, because the truth is, I was actually feeling better. So I tried to stay away from reddit and all mental health talks. Amidst the locked down and virus, I was actually feeling good til the recent unfortunate event. 

I think it started around the same time when I learned about the death of one of childhood here... Usually when I have episodes of dpdr or dissociation it would only last for a few minutes to hour... Or sometimes it would last for like half a day.. now its been a week.. and no matter how many times I have experienced dissociation/dpdr the feeling is still overwhelming and scary... 

Lately I haven’t been able to express emotions, I feel like I am losing my mind, I am having vivid imagery whenever I close my eyes, having hard time sleeping, and would feel everything around me isn’t real. I really feel like I am having schizophrenic/psychosis. I really don’t want to go crazy or lose my mind.. i’m scared. What shall I do? Help me please",06Dec2020,1

Main reason I’m asking this is because lately my emotions have been getting worse and I’ve been thinking of more extreme things to “help me”

236,"Hi. I’m 15f and i’m going to start this with i am a mute. I have ADHD, Depression, Schizophrenia. It’s scary. I can’t even talk to my therapist about how i feel. I write it down but i want to tell her how i actually feel. Even talking to my parents i write most things down. 
At school i get bullied, and i can’t say / do anything back or tell anything to anyone because i can’t speak so i guess i just let it happen. I tried to tell one of my teachers but she was new and didn’t realise i was a mute. She just thought i was quiet. 
I take meds and things for mental issues but it’s mostly the voices. They are really scary and they make me feel really bad. 
Also, i’m emotionally sensative because of ADHD. I have trouble processing my emotions. My friend called an ambulance because i kept fainting (12 times in a night) and it was because i kind of overdosed and yeah. I couldn’t speak when the paramedics were here and taking me to hospital, they didn’t know. I had to try to tell them but they figured it out. I had to get my tummy flushed which fkn hurt kinda bad actually, but i ended up silently crying and the nurse asked why i didn’t speak and told her that it hurt, i showed her on my phone that i was a mute. I should have said before, i know but it was my mistake. Same thing happened when i had to have injections into my arms when i was at the hospital. I was completely silent but ended up fainting again because i was so fkn scared. 
 
I just don’t know what to anymore. I can’t speak to anyone or call anyone or say how i’m feeling because i’m a mute. I feel like i’m trapped. I need to re-fill my meds soon but my mum has said i need to go on my own because she won’t be able to collect them so idk what to even do, but my mum said that they know i’m mute i think, but she is not sure. 

But yeah. I don’t even know what to do anymore. I have kinda stopped therapy because i just cried too much. I really wish that i could just tell her i’m sorry for wasting her time and tell her how i feel. I have had thoughts of jumping or overdosing again soon but idk. I know my mum will be sad.

I want to keep this as short and sweet as possible. 
My partner and I are very connected, we talk about everything and we're each others go to. 

My partner was on the pill for a year, which can lead to developing a mental heath issue. She also has history of mental illness in her family. 

Basically, random thoughts will pop into her head, almost like she has another voice. 
She is a very emotional person (not physically, more with connection). 

For example; 
she might notice that i don't look my best that particular day, she will feel that she has to tell me, which i am fine with. (over time you get used to it) and after we discuss that it's okay. That's the end of it. 
Now because that topic is fresh in her head, it will stay with her and remind her every time she looks at me. 

Any thoughts are appreciated.

Some friends don't want to deal with it which I completely understand. I don't want to deal with it either and I really dislike this about myself.

250,"Hello! I wasn't sure if this was really the best place to post this, as I typically casually lurk Reddit at most. That said, my wife and I are deeply concerned about a neighbor, and local resources haven't been enough to this point.

I live in Vermont, to start things off with a sense of where I'm at and which resources may be available. We moved into our current condo about 18 months ago, and in that time have gotten to know our neighbor (let's call her Jane) fairly well.

Jane has a form of schizoaffective disorder. This was made clear to me by another resident of our HOA, who also supposedly acted as Jane's live-in nurse for a while. I don't know if she was paid to do so, but the relationship between Jane and this person seems very strained, as though they have interacted quite often.

Jane has disassociative episodes where she assumes a persona that is legitimately frightening. I hate to be so blunt, and I want to be as sensitive as I can, but neighbors and local police have informed us that this persona has brandished knives before. As such, we are extremely cautious around Jane. This violence has resulted in prior hospitalization, and possibly arrest. We aren't exactly sure on that last point, as it's merely been alluded to.

We have called police many times. Our hometown is fortunate enough to have a mental health crisis center, and we've called them too. The thing is, her issues have exacerbated (she spent a good deal of time this summer hurling food out of her freezer towards us, screaming the entire time), and no amount of action on our part has seemed to help her get what she needs.

I admit, I am frustrated. I didn't really volunteer to be her caretaker, yet it's the role we've sort of had thrust upon us. She has no family we know of. The state refuses to help on the grounds that until someone actually gets hurt, they cannot step in. I have to believe there's a better way. I really, genuinely want to help this person, who is clearly struggling, clearly frightened, and doing both of those things alone. And I want to be able to exit my front door without giving her door a very wide berth, without hearing obscenities hurled my way, and without instinctively having to check her doorway for signs of a weapon.

It’s safe to say my issues are at a 9 literally all day long.

I’m already on medications for long term help with my anxiety, but this move is a whole different kind of story and my meds can only do so much.

It comes and goes, but today is one of those days I think I realize how everything about me is one huge fake. 

Everything I do feels like a fake, like a parody of myself, my grades must be a fake because apparently it seems to me like I'm doing way too little or nothing at all and my personality probably is fake too like how do I have those amazing friends when I'm like this - no way they'd like me this way so it has to be a facade I'm putting up right?
And my looks are so fake too my skin is so bad no one can see past that, not even ahen I wear make up and neither can one overlook my squishy flubber like body.
I'd love to dress nicely but no matter what I'm gonna end up looking like a pathetic wannabe anyways. 

I feel like the whiniest brat out there but I genuinely think that everyone around me is just nice out of pity.

 I can't take my friends seriously when they say they like me because why should they? I'm not good looking neither do I have an outstanding personality or charisma or anything at all. I cut off my hair to change things and got lots of compliments and then my mother came around and told me it makes me look even fatter than I already am. So did they just say something to be nice? I ordered some clothes and I was told so see them as a present for Christmas, only to cancel the order two hours later, because the things I got wouldn't look on my no matter what and after all I can't waste my parents money like that.

260,"Ever since I was a young child I was always weird about money and presents. I always hated when people spent money on me, even when they assured me it was no burden to them and that they wanted to do it to be nice to me. It is one weird big cycle where I will avoid spending money on things, even things I really need, refuse to use anything I own for as long as I possibly can, and then once I DO use it I will continue to use it long past I should. 
A good example for me it with shoes, I will wear one pair every day for YEARS even though I have one to two pairs still in their boxes with the tags on that I was forced to get by my parents.
Money is even worse, I will go for months at a time without buying anything and then in a few weeks I will wipe out my debit account and then feel so anxious and distressed that I will go another couple months spending nothing.
I am already in therapy for PTSD after I was sexually assaulted as a child. Part of me wonders if my behavior stems from my abuser buying me gifts? Or because of the 2008 housing crash? Logically that would make sense, neither of those events FEEL particularly associated to this behavior. Not to mention that I remember doing this long before either of those difficult life events happened.
My parents however, think that this is all just a quirk of mine, and say that it’s just part of my personality. My dad is an accountant so he is proud of how frugal I am with my money and objects and often says I do a good job managing money. I believed him for a long time but today I was doing one of my account wipes and I realized I had tapped into another account that I hadn’t meant to because I overspent. I was crippled with the anxiety for a few hours afraid to even turn on the lights or use water because it was spending too much money, so now I think I might have serious issues. 

TL;DR
I hoard items, refuse to replace items, have periods of extreme frugality and extreme spending. My dad is an accountant though and says I do a good job with my money and I don’t have any reason I can think of why I am this way.",06Dec2020,2
