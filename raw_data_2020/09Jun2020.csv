1,"**(going to provide a bit of backstory here purely for timelines sake but if you feel you can answer this question without feel free to just scroll to the bottom)** So I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder about maybe two months ago after finally speaking to a therapist because my mental health had started to become noticeably poor to the point where I couldn't put off seeking professional help for it anymore. I'd say I've been struggling with it for about a year subconsciously but it's come to the forefront of my mind around November.  


My employer is aware of it and has been somewhat supportive in as much as they informed me of the therapy service offered through work (though I am currently receiving cognitive behavioural therapy through the NHS).   


Around end of May I noticed I was really struggling to focus on work for anything longer than half an hour to 45 minutes tops. I would find myself just wanting to lie down or go for a walk. Just do something for an hour or so that wasn't work. My job is quite repetitive and monotonous so it can be hard to keep my focus on it at the best of times, never mind when my anxiety is playing with my head. I was finding that because I couldn't do what I wanted to do and had to keep working that I would get easily upset (I've cried about the fact I can't have a nap before now) or getting irritable and fidgety.   


As a result I decided to use some of my holidays, seeing as I can't use them for anything else, and booked a week off work. First few days were fine. Weather was great, I could get outside, I was having video calls with friends and the girl I've been talking to was messaging me more frequently. Then comes the rain, can no longer go outside, friends randomly stop talking to me or when they do they blunt responses so my anxiety blows up making me think everything under the sun of what I could have done wrong.  I found myself hitting rock bottom, getting suicidal thoughts, sleeping most of the day, hardly eating, etc. So great, my week off to get better actually made things worse and now I'm dreading going back to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday I had a therapy session and I explained that my mental health felt like it had deteriorated over this week rather than improved and I was concerned that on my return to work I would now find myself being unable to focus on work even more so than before. They suggested contacting my GP for a sick note and taking some extended time to really be able to work on my CBT and trying to develop new habits that might be able to push me into a better mood and improve my focus. I contacted my GP today and heard back from them within a few hours confirming they would write me a sick note and I'm also being prescribed sertraline.   


This is all well and good and I'm happy to follow the advice I've been given. However, my anxiety flares up and now I'm worried that my employer will get the hump and either refuse my sick note, or accept my sick note but tell me I have no job to return to when it is time for me to come back. I did a bit of research into this and found the following

&amp;#x200B;

* Your employer can legally refuse a sick note and your doctor will not get involved in any disputes between you and your employer about this.
* Your employer can dismiss you, but only after carrying out an investigation into your sick leave and if that investigation finds that you do not have sufficient reason for the absence then they have full right to dismiss you or try to negotiate an exit package with you.
* The only way you are protected from dismissal is if your mental health is considered a disability. Mental health is considered a disability if your mental health is not a direct result of work i.e overworked, anxiety about deadlines, etc. 

My question is, should I take the sick leave? What can I do to ensure I don't lose my job? How can I go about having my mental health registered as a disability as my anxiety is not work related, it merely affects my performance. Please note I live in the UK so would need UK law on this as I imagine UK and US law differ slightly. 

Many thanks and apologise for the long backstory.",09Jun2020,1
2,I try to present myself as someone who is not anxious but that just makes my anxiety ten times worse. I’m constantly fucking up my own shit because of my mental health and then that just amplifies it. I don’t know how to manage it in any way at all.

5,"There are a lot of things that are making me angry at the moment, both in my personal life, such as work and living situation, and in the world such as covid response and racism. So many little specific things make me angry that I find it hard to focus on all of them and just cycle through all the time. Would it help to make a list of the specific things that are causing me to feel this way or would that be  kinda like hyper focusing in on them? Thanks so much.",09Jun2020,1
6,"Hello, I'm 27F and living in England.

I was wondering if anyone here could give me advice/tips on how to approach my GP regarding my mental health and talking to my GP about any potential help to manage it as well as what I should expect from the visit. I feel I should include that I like my GP, she's very lovely I just don't know how to go about this.

I have struggled for a very long time with periods of being depressed. High anxiety which impacts quite a lot of things in my every day life from social situations, work or just to being able and let myself do things on my own without finding someone to accompany me. I also tend to have more panic attacks at night/day due to some phobias that keep being brought up by my anxiety or subjects that are mildly related to them, making me go out of my way to distance myself/avoid them which can cause problems sometimes in social situations.  


I also tend to feel most of the time like being around me for other people is a bother and would end up sleeping my free time away, because as bad as it sounds when I'm asleep nothing is there to cause me anxiety and I can quite literary pretend to have a different life than what I am actually stuck with. My living situation is also causing me a high amount of mental stress\\anxiety especially since I don't see how it can change any time soon if at all. My parents depend on me heavily financially ever since my mother fell ill and is unable to work to make ends meet. The benefits she's claiming including my father's job is not enough for them to live off which is where my financial help is needed.   
I do find myself having thoughts about suicide and how easy it could be to end it though I don't believe I would ever go through with it for various reasons.  


I did previously try counselling (provided by my university for any struggling students free of charge) while in my last year of university when I was depressed for about a month, one meeting every Wednesday but I didn't feel like it helped me much.  


Thank you for any advice/tips in advance!",09Jun2020,1

11,"I finally got prescribed this med due to being on Medicaid (after a prior authorization). I've tried all the SSRIs and SNRIs over the past decade or so, as well as a 6-week course of TMS and none have helped my depression or anxiety. I'm just curious as to whether this is actually the ""wonder drug"" it's been marketed as.

Also hoping my new doctor will be a bit more reasonable on my (phone) appointment tomorrow. The first time I spoke to him I told him I was currently taking 60mg Adderall and 3mg Klonopin/day and he said he wanted records from my ADHD testing (which are now 13 years old...) and to speak with my parents about my childhood. Regarding the Klonopin, he said ""that's a ridiculously high dose, no one should take that much!"" When I said ""my friend takes 6mg/day..."" he said ""I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FRIEND!"" I've been on Klonopin for 6 years now so suddenly discontinuing would be disastrous. If not, I guess I have to find a new doctor, which is hard because I'm on Medicaid...",09Jun2020,1
12,"I've seen 4 different mental health professionals since I got diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression 6 years ago. The second provider diagnosed me with OCD, which didn't seem unlikely because that runs in the family, but I'm still unsure if I just have all these comorbidities or if one of them is specifically the problem. Basically, whenever I make any kind of error (which feels like it happens on the daily), I start thinking about all the mistakes I've made and I feel like I'm suffocating under a pile of my own mistakes and worst-case scenarios. The second I try to tell myself it's okay, it's like there's this person inside of me that's saying ""you don't deserve to let yourself off easy, you have to suffer, you have to sit and feel the guilt and think about what you've done or else everything will fall apart."" It's sort of hard to be a functioning member of society when my guilty conscience is hyperactive. Does anyone know anything about this kind of thought process? It almost feels like a superstition.",09Jun2020,1

Hey everyone. I am a 25 year old girl who struggles to fit in and keep up with society. I have had mental health problems for as long as I can remember. Chronic depression, anxiety, social phobia. In high school I could handle it all pretty well but since I graduated I felt like I got dropped in to cold water. My anxiety was worse than it had ever been. I went to a lot of different schools to study but would eventually drop out. I just didn’t feel like I belonged. I would get panic attacks on my way to school, in the classroom, during breaks etc. My life went downhill from there. Atm I am at home and getting financial support. But I am constantly worrying about everything and I see my friends get on with there lifes. I don’t want to stay home forever but when I have to deal with this world alone, outside, I feel like I am going to collapse. Some side issues: I don’t know what I like, I don’t really know what I don’t like, I lack identity. I have grown up with a mom who would deal with every issue for me, so I wouldn’t have to do it. Also I have been a very sensitive person for as long as I can remember. Sometimes I think this has to do with some of my problems. I often wonder if they got the diagnosis right too. I would like to speak with people who deal with some of my issues too, or people who have some advice. During this time I can’t go to therapy, this makes things hard because I can’t talk to anyone about it. I hope u guys can help me in some sort of way. Lots of love.",09Jun2020,6

16,"My friend recently bought a house and invited his brother to stay there for free. His brother recently got out of 2 years in prison. For most of his life, he was homeless, addicted to meth and other drugs, stealing, and getting into messy situations (he went to prison for getting into a meth-induced fight with his girlfriend at the time). I know that his dad hit him as a kid, so I'm sure there is childhood trauma. Now, he has a safe place, but he absolutely refuses to leave the house. He doesn't come into the main part of the house (including kitchen) and therefore will go several days without food. He has extreme social anxiety and will not talk to or look at me whatsoever, however this has been a thing throughout his life. When living at home with his mom, he would not even leave his room to use the bathroom, and she would find tons of filled pee bottles in his room and always had to wonder if he was eating, if he was alive when he disappeared for a while, and so on...

Now, my friend is starting to get really stressed about the situation with his brother, because although he wanted to provide a safe place for him to be after his release from prison -- away from the streets/drugs -- he didn't sign up to be his caregiver. He feels upset that he should have to force him to do something as basic as eat food everyday. I tried to suggest some things -- his brother mentioned getting a job, so that might help with activity/getting out, requiring his brother to join weekly video game night or bonfire night, requiring therapy, medication to treat high anxiety, and so on... but none of these are viable if his brother simply refuses to participate. And of course I would not want to suggest any situation that feels like a trap to him, since I'm sure prison felt like that already. I told my friend that he probably just needs time to embody a sense of safety and privacy, but my friend says he's been like this forever and he doesn't want to ""babysit"" his older brother (who's in his 40s) who won't even be a member of the household/family. It's been 2-3 months since he got out of prison and came to stay.

TL;DR: My friend's brother has extreme social anxiety, refuses to leave his room, and will go several days without eating. He has a history of mental illness and drug abuse, and recently got out of 2 yrs in prison. My friend is at a loss and doesn't want to be responsible for basic survival things like forcing him to eat. The brother is not open to therapy, medication, or seemingly anything like that.

Any advice for this situation?",09Jun2020,2
17,"Context: 

In 2015 I (30f) moved back home to live with my parents. I grew up in this house until I was 14, went to boarding school, then college, then to Boston for a job before moving back. I lived with my sister in Boston. I had worked retail untill I got fired a couple years ago for being unreliable. 



Currently:


I am at home, in my childhood room just hanging out relaxing, smoking a little pot before dinner so I have an appetite. I hear my mom screaming at my dad about something. She sounds livid. I have no idea what's making her mad because I can't understand what she'd saying, I just heard hear her being so angry she sounds like a rabid dog.  There's a couple really big outbursts, the only statement I make out is ""I'm so angry..."" And then something to the effect of a jab at my Aunt (mom's sister). 


 I'm suddenly remembering times when my mom would be livid with me over ""cheating on a diet"" or not being upfront about a poor grade on a test. She would be so upset, she would scream at me, and then threaten to tell my dad, (who usually didn't do much but enable my mom's nonsense), and I would get the cold shoulder at dinner. My mom would be in a terrible mood, and my siblings wouldn't understand, until I or my mom inevitably explained why my mom was so upset. Usually it would be the ""horrible thing"" I did, which was usually having a half eaten box of cookies (or whatever other food I was banned from) hiding in my room somewhere. 

Regardless of the details of each time something like this happened, there was always some weird dynamic at dinner. I'd feel so badly that I ruined everything. I'd beat myself up with hateful comments to myself. I'd be so upset I'd physically just shake and cry. My whole body would hurt from how shamed and guilty I felt over ""ruining my mom's day"". I also would limit what I'd eat for dinner to compensate for eating all the cookies or ""junk food"" earlier. I'd go to bed hungry, and with a headache from crying. 


The next day after this kind of thing, she'd act like nothing happened. Never an apology, always swept under the rug. 

Is this considered abuse? I just... Don't know because technically I grew up in a really nice situation and will likely never have to worry financially. Like never. 


I have ADHD and depression already, which I'm handling so far with medications and therapy. 

I'm really just trying to make sense of this and whether or not I'm just overreacting.",09Jun2020,5

When doing tasks/in a learning environment:

tasks feel draining

under performing speed in just about any task

physical aches  

staring blankly at random objects and losing focus of what im doing at the moment.

unable to form thoughts or ideas

unable to finish projects or focus on learning new things. brain feels shut down and empty with no thoughts.

heartbeat gets slower 

eyes go out of focus

shortness of breath

head feels heavy

trying hard to pay attention but the information doesnt stay in head

get distracted easily and think about unrelated things.

I dont even think about why Im doing things in the first place. My mind goes into a comatose state that is unproductive but feels super energy wasting at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

in the morning: 

brain still feels asleep/foggy 

very difficult to get up or get motivated

feel really tired for about 4-6 hours after waking up even with meals and 8-10 hours of sleep.

eyes puffy and tired 

skin dry and sensitive to cold

bones ache and feel super stiff knees/back/neck

breathing slow but short 

groggy and mentally weak

I dont think about important tasks that i should be doing

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

in social situations/environments:

heartbeat is super fast around people and I act super nervous

negetive thoughts

no excitement or feeling of confidence.

when i try to be confident i end up overthinking it and act like a person i dont want to be so i am unable to be confident/calm/logical at the same time

anxious sweating

social anxiety

self doubt

self hate

uninvolved in any conversations

uncomfortable around everyone in public, extreme shyness i cant control or get rid of.

I ask questions but I cant remember still even when making effort to focus

stays quiet because I have no thoughts going through my head just blank even when i try to come up with ideas or

talk about a certain topic. I lose all my knowledge at that point and my brain performs slowly. cant recall things I should know

or have learned in the past. memories faded away in my brain unless im reminded or it was extremely easy to remember.

I think lowly of my self in comparison to others, if someone is confident around my area i automatically become super self conscious

I hate being in big groups and am terrified of public speaking.

I often dont know much about anything beyond basic information.

Im polite but reserved and introverted.

I cut convorsations short because my brain shuts off or im too slow to come up with something to say.

&amp;#x200B;

At night:

negetive thoughts get worse

I stay up super late because i get bad headaches and negetive thoughts rushing through my head. My eyes get teary and I feel full of guilt.

I usually watch some fictional show or play games while playing music to distract me from the negetive thoughts. 

my chest feels so tight and like its holding in a lot of pain.

&amp;#x200B;

all the time:

I dont try to impress my family like i used to. deep down i care what they think but i currently just try to feel mentally stable.

I reject any kind of help from family members. I feel unworthy.

I dont reach out and call anyone including close family. I only talk to my mom who i live with. I feel guilt whenever i talk to people who used to see a lot of potential in me.

bad long term memory, my childhood had good times and some bad but i cant remember 99% of what I did off the top of my head, even if  I hyperfocus i anger myself for not remembering things that were big parts of how i became who i am today. 

I cant even remember what I was doing 2 years ago, or the places i visited, or the relatives i visited, what interesting things i learned. Im concerned about where all these memories went because I want to be able to learn from mistakes

and remember the things I try to focus. this is why i dont see a point in putting in effort to go to college/take the time to learn complicated interesting skills. My brain goes blank when I start learning and my energy level and fatigue gets

worse. This mostly applies to any learning material beyond just the basics. I feel like my maximum effort can only let me learn basic things that anyone can with a little effort. 

This memory problem has occured for as i can remember, It makes me feel like I should hold back from attempting to learn new things, I believe id forget all the important stuff anyways. The only time I am capable of learning even the slightest

ammount of information is when I am alone and feel like myself without the overthinking.

brain fog, unsatisfaction - even when putting effort into things -, when i constantly tell myself i need to self improve it gets worse and i become overly serious and enjoy life even less than if i dont try. 

I dont see any positive results from trying to work on myself, i end up going in a cycle of putting effort in -&gt; still being lonely and unfulfilled -&gt; going back 

unable to find a true purpose

dont think about the future a lot. To me im just confused and try to find any type of happiness in the moment from small unimportant things.

things i do: In order to feel decent and keep my mind somewhat stable: coping activities such as playing videogames that are easy and dont require brain power, or watching a show, or anything that is familiar to me and takes little brain 

power. spend almost all my time alone because my mind and thoughts feel unstable and on edge around almost everyone. 

want to make friends, but dont have the social skills/stable thoughts/determination to do it. and my brain goes blank in those situations anyways and i always never beleive in my abilities based off what happens everytime i try.

i used to think that it is a sign of weakness and a really embarrasing thing to express my feelings and show any sign that i have internal/emotional pain. I often fail at faking my true emotions and end up isolating myself so no one sees it.

I gave up on trying to fake it but i still isolate myself and keep it all to myself.

Even if I get enough nutrients and have a good diet and get goood exercise, I still feel emotionally unstable and mentally slower than i should be.

22,"It's been a tough 1/2 past years to say nonetheless. So before this I used to be a pretty social person and have atleast a good amount of friends to go about and live a good life.

Anyways so I don't know when this began, but I think I started caring about myself too much, if I'm almost doing something wrong because I for the life of me couldn't ever find that ""special"" someone. And I really think it took a turn for the worst when one of my pretty much only friends I had, which I know over the internet started talking with a girl and just like completely stopped talking or even texting me, I remember asking him multiple times but always the same reply ""she doesn't want too"" as if he wasn't allowed to do what he wished for. It was at that moment I think I realized how independent I was on him as a friend, he recently blocked me and it was tough for me even when he barely wrote.

I know it's just an online friend and I should brush it off but he was really kind and I share lots of fond memories with him, we used to talk a lot in the past and play a lot of video games together. But then over the past few months he is always busy talking to her. 

Life was simpler back then, I had friends and didn't care that much and I barely cared at all about love or anything of the sort. Nowadays all that is going through my head is ""did I do something wrong?"" or just me procrastinating over the fact I'll never find that special someone, and thoose times I thought I had it ends up being nothing. Plus it doesn't help I have it very easy for my anxiety to kick in. So over the past few days it has been absolute loneliness and I as a person can't stand it. 

All I really wished for was for people to care, or for him to notice how I feelt, because he was always so busy with her. But I no one seems to care or notices me. I just don't want it to seem like I'm begging for attention. I hope everyone has some understanding so, please, any advice is welcome.

29,"I've had many issues I feel like a lot of other people dont have for as long as I can remember. It's been an issue that recently I've started to really struggle with, mostly due to my body and my looks.

I've always obsessed over my looks. I have many flaws, that's for sure, and in terms of my body, I mostly obsess over my weight and my general facial features. My entire face is messed up, half is lower than the other, and I'm also very overweight. At this point, there isn't a single thing I see that's right, anywhere. Recently, for the past year or so, I've started to obsess over it. I constantly look up plastic surgery treatments, their cost, and before and after pictures of others. I've probably googled everything from invisiline, to gastric bypass and skin removal, and even a nose job.  Its essentially become my day to day in quarantine.

As much as I've been dreaming of being skinny, I also constantly binge eat. It's become a huge problem that's had me gaining weight. I often eat til i'm uncomfortably full, and I always feel disgusting and guilty afterwards. As much as I want to I can't stop. It's as if my body is doing it and my brain can't stop it, and it's a daily occurence. 

My new permanent mood is just feeling ugly and disgusting and hating myself. I go into every day hoping that I'll be able to starve myself, and finally feel good about myself.

I don't know what to do. It's something I've never discussed in my coucelling sessions, and they've been cancelled either way. I also cant talk to a doctor because all the doctors offices are closed. I'm just afraid I wont be able to get out of this, and I'll end up disgusting and alone for the rest of my life, stuck inside because I don't want anyone to see me, like I have been off and on for a few years.

For those who don't want to read so much: I hate my body  and constantly obsess over everything that's wrong with it, but the binge eating doesn't help with that at all. I can't see a doctor, so I desperately turned to reddit.",09Jun2020,1

I am autistic so to them I was some retarded kid. They beat me up on so many occasions because they knew I couldn't fight back (I am very weak mentally and physically) even the ""weaker"" kids would beat me up and I'd be mocked relentlessly for it. 

When I talk to anyone about it they just tell me that ""ITS BEEN A YEAR! YOU SHOULD BE BETTER BY NOW!"" But I'm not better. In fact I'm worse. Every night when I try to sleep I keep thinking about all the times I've been beaten and abused and it's making me severely depressed and I've even cried myself to sleep. 

My main question is should I still be feeling this bad... It was a year ago and I know I need to move on but it's scarred me. It's starting to define me as a person because people I live with in the surrounding area whenever I leave my house just mock me for it and make my depression even worse. 

Luckily I haven't had suicide on my mind yet and I don't think I could do it. I have people who love me dearly and if I did it I'd drive them to severe depression and I really don't want to see others die just because I feel slightly depressed.",09Jun2020,2
32,"All I do is try to make others happy. I put so much effort into it. I spend so much time and energy that I am left for nothing but myself a but in the end, no one cares if I’m happy. They don’t even tell me they care. I tell a friend all the time that all I care for them and that I will always be there for them and all I want is for them to be happy, healthy, and safe. In the end all they ever say is ok thx. All I want is for the people I love to be happy, but no one seems to care ab me. They tell me to just not care but things are tough when it seems like no one cares. Why can’t people just tell me everything’s ok. That they care and want me to be happy. I’m tired of my friends hearing how much I care and not seeming to care back. I’m tired of going to bed every night and having to tell Myself to be happy, healthy and safe. Over and over I repress this to myself. But all I want is for someone to care and tell me that. Why should I be here if no one cares, because I don’t anymore.",09Jun2020,9

34,"To honest things have been so rough, that I have had to face some of the worst parts of self which I have ignored for my entire life, but some how a single comment from a women about my dick has killed my sleep and my confidence.

Everyone and their grandma knows 3.5 erect dick is small af, even I know that. I have known that for a long time, but in reality I never though about it (I had subconsciously ignored it) until the day after my first time with a women (7 months ago). It was horrible, I couldn’t even get a fuck boner, but as some who had tag line saying I am gonna die a Virgin. It was a win, she even called me back for a second Time. 

This girl was close with a close friend of mine. Like few weeks later me and this friend met up, and she wouldn’t stop laughing. Obviously I knew, she told her what happened, and I was fine with it. To be honest I taught it was funny too. But into the story she said “ she said it was okay for a first timer, but you’re dick is small and she was disappointed”.

Ever since than, that statement has been struck in my head. I have heard my female friend’s commenting about a guy having a small dick or make fun of him. It never made me uncomfortable or any (it was just something stupid they were talking about), but now it scares the living shit out of me and it pisses me off. It’s not like we change it. If you have a small tits get a boob job, if you face isn’t prefect, wear a fuck ton of make up or get plastics surgery. 

But as a man or a human, there is literally nothing that I could do add 3 extras inches to my dick or my height. And for those who would talk about the invasive surgery or pills or other bullshit based of Pseudo science, it doesn’t work because if it did they would be billionaires. 

I have read enough to know, not all women are disappointed or disgusted but a small dick. But the sheer number of women, who would say it or make fun of a man or even use it as a weapon against one is truly terrifying. I know I am not prefect by any means, and there things that I can work on, like my weight and train my body into a better shape. But how do I deal with the horror of some nobody of the street or a person I have truly loved wouldn’t destroy me by saying the same thing.",09Jun2020,1

He said that hes had to sacrifice so much during our relationship and that there was no pay off for him in theend. I'm not perfect but loved him as best as I could. Hes a perfectionist and it was exhausting trying to please him. He never saw my effort. I just moved out of our home and into a shady rental. I'm so depressed. Can barely function.

36,"Hey! I’ve been on anti depressants for a total of 4 years now, and I really want to start being able to produce serotonin naturally. I’m currently on 15 mg trintellix.

I feel zombie-like, which is such a scary thing because one of the main things that makes you a human is having emotion... anyway.. I’m in a tough spot. My anxiety is also fairly bad, but I’m trying to cope with things and still manage to get out of my comfort zone. I don’t want things to take such a toll on me anymore.

37,"For the past three days I have been having ruminating on the first time I tried to have sex. I randomly thought of how as we get older, we care less as to how many sexual partners the person we date has been with. Then my mind went back to the first time I tried to have sex. I was 16 and my ex and I were fooling around. I remember us trying different positions but it would hurt too much and I would make him stop. 

I remember being sore because I never had never had sex before. I didn’t consider this to be my first time because I don’t even remember him going all the way in, I kept stopping him. Then all these memories kept popping up. A friend telling me that he said we had sex. A year later I considered myself to have lost my virginity because the guy I was seeing, ( sorry to be graphic) was all the way in there and after awhile when I got tired of him thrusting I told him to stop. Now I’m looking back and I’m thinking wait, did I already loose my virginity? I know this sounds crazy but I keep obsessing over it. 

Parts replay in my mind, my heart races and I have some anxiety. I’m starting to not trust my own memory of the situation and as to why I didn’t consider it to be my first time. I do remember that he used the line “ just the tip.” Random things keep popping into mind. Like I think I even said “sorry” to him because I kept stopping him. 

Granted this was 15 years ago. Part of me feels that it’s warranted why I didn’t feel that was my actually my first time. Then the adult me is kinda like well maybe it was. I’m having anxiety over if I was l lying to myself all these years. This quarantine has made me pull up issues from throughout my life and analyze them countlessly. Each week for over a month I’ve been thinking of a new issue. It effects my eating and sleeping. 

Please has anyone else dealt with this? I spoke to my therapist and she stated, that that is my truth. She gave the example of a car accident happening. There can be different people who see it but our perspective will all be the different.For me it wasn’t loosing my virginity because he didn’t fully enter me and I kept making him stop. I just cannot stop ruminating over it and it’s effecting me a lot right now.",09Jun2020,1

39,"For the past few years I’ve struggled getting a set diagnosis. The one that I have gotten, though, is panic disorder. 

Recently I applied for a job and landed an interview after 4 months of not working due to COVID-19, and I have to say, I’m scared shitless.

I had pretty bad anxiety before this, I’d get frequent panic attacks at the small businesses I worked for. I had a nasty manager, was there for about 4 months until I quit and landed a job at Carvel, which I was only at for two days because I couldn’t handle how fast paced it was. It got so bad that I told my therapist I felt like I couldn’t work at all, and considered accepting “benefits.” Everything died down because I’ve been stuck at home- but it all just came back in waves again. I’m also terrified of the separation anxiety I’m going to endure, as the last time I was away from my boyfriend for a few hours was in early March (we live together). 

I had a panic attack today thinking about the interview and going back to work. I cried and cried until my boyfriend soothed me and reassured me. But this is only temporary, as I know it’s all going to come back the day of the interview and when I get hired. 

I am struggling to finds ways to calm myself down during situations like this, at the thought of work, or to just not feel this way at all. I want to have a different outlook and be able to just- simply- go to work. I can be an amazing hustler, but right now, I’m at a bad low.

40,"I'm doing online learning now (middle school) and I'm procrastinating on doing Spanish work rn because I can't bring myself to do it. I just feel so overwhelmed by the workload and it isn't even that bad. I think I'm super stressed or burnt out but I can't tell anymore. My heart is just filled with anxiety and worry and idk how to calm down. I just want to cry but the tears just won't come. So many random things are pissing me off. Like just looking at my inbox makes me want to scream sometimes. I'm scared. Of what, I don't know. 

I've been having trouble sleeping and most nights I'm just lying on the floor lost in my own thoughts for an hour. I wake up feeling drained and tired. Some days I don't even know how I'm going to make it through the day. I feel slight nausea a lot, and I've been eating a lot less. I force myself to eat more so no one will ask questions but it just makes me feel like throwing up. 

Oh great spanish just ended and I haven't done anything. I'm supposed to be a straight a student but recently my grades have been dropping. I can't really concentrate in class (or rather vid call). I'm so lost. 

The only person I can talk to sometimes doesn't sympathise with me. I mean, he's busy with his stuff, but it makes me feel like I'm bringing his mood down or bothering him. He told me to speak to the school counsellor once but I can't for various reasons (like there is a chance my parents might find out and i have trust issues). 

I don't know what to do. I've had depressive symptoms for a few days last week, and it was kinda alright during the long weekend (monday was a national holiday) but now I just feel so frustrated! I put on a mask with everyone, and try to resist the urge of snapping at them (on text especially) by sending happy emojis...

Besides that, I've been kinda counselling one of my friends who is going through some crap and I worry about her a lot. And I try to brainstorm on ways to help her and cheer her up but I end up getting frustrated and stuff. 

Please help me. I don't feel like dying but I just wanna disappear. Fade away into non existence ya get what I mean. I've thought of self harming but I never do it. I'm just scared. And lost. I can't take a break because the summer holidays only start next month for me. I don't want to talk to my teachers about it because I just can't talk to the counsellor...I'm just so tired of everything.

But now the darkness is coming back.

44,"I’m currently in my teen years, and I hate everything so much. I have no idea if I have depression or not, but every time I think of searching it up, I feel like an overreacting idiot. To start things off, I cry at least maybe 7-8 times everyday, over stupid things. I’m fairly strong in all other departments, but I cry all the time, over stupid things. I cry when I can’t do or fix something, when someone gets mad at me, when I get mad at someone, when I fail to do something, and every fucking time I look in the mirror. The thing I hate about myself the most is probably my looks. I break down in tears every time I look at myself in the mirror, to the point where I even look down when washing my hands. I’m pretty short for my age, I have hands the size of a gnome child (which has stopped me from doing card magic, something I always wanted to do, which I had to drop because of my stupid baby hands), I have a lot of belly fat (but I don’t appear chubby anywhere else for some reason, my eyes are a shitty grey baggy grocery bag looking mess, and my hair, I can’t even start with my hair, I literally have a bad hair life. Last week I was thinking of going to the park, something I enjoy doing, so I tried to fix my hair up a little bit. It ended with me snapping my comb in half, throwing it behind my mirror, crying, and going back to sleep. And the worst part is every time I cry, I feel like a stupid brat, which for some reason makes me cry more. I’m just sick of looking like a stupid crying idiot all the time and I want to be able to control my emotions. Next up, my life. I love my family to pieces, but other than that, I hate almost everyone I know, especially at school. My school is an institute of the most judgemental, annoying people ever. I don’t know what I do wrong, but everyone thinks I’m just this weak stupid ugly dumb embarrassment, and I can’t stand it. I’m not a complete loner or anything, I have about 10-15 friends, but I kind of hate all of them, and I’m pretty sure they hate me back. I feel like some stupid water Pail on everyone’s back, and I really hate myself. I’ve deleted instagram and Snapchat for almost 4 months now, and haven’t talked to anyone also for around the same amount of time. I decided to log back in and maybe talk to someone, because I was feeling down, and I had 0 messages on both socials. To make it worse, I even got kicked out of some group chats. This year also sucked for me because I got glasses, which make me look 10000000x worse than I already do. I’ve been prescribed glasses since the first grade, and had always just thrown them in the bottom of my drawer for about 8 or 9 years. This year, I decided to actually wear them. The amount of looks of disgust and laughs at me were fucking insane. I actually went in to the bathroom in the middle of the day, and silently cried for about 2 and a half minutes, and I almost snapped them in half, but I knew my parents spent $250 dollars on them and I didn’t want to make them upset. And after like 4 months of wearing them, people still treat me like it’s my first day wearing them. Every. Fucking. Day. Why doesn’t anyone understand that I’m wearing these so I don’t go blind or even risk getting lazy eye (my left eye is significantly worse than my right). I’ve also recently realized that my “friends” who copy my homework, steal my glasses and my phone all the time, randomly crush my hands/arms/fingers, made fun of me everyday for dumb things like my Spotify playlist, embarrassed me, drink from my water bottle like it’s theirs, and always make fun of me and disclude me from everything, and even drove me apart from my only female friend by bullying me endlessly, are not my real friends. And I hate myself for just submitting to all of it. I wish I can just tell everyone they’re dead to me, and I hate them, but no. I’ll always just be Mr. Lame Boring Nice Guy who everyone takes advantage of. I’ve also only had one crush in my lifetime, which I never told anyone about, including the person I liked, because I didn’t want to experience rejection, which I knew was gonna happen, because I’m extremely unattractive, even as a friend. I forgot about eventually and I don’t plan on telling anyone, because embarrassment and I get this weird feeling in my chest I don’t like when talking about my emotions, which I actually feel right now writing this post. For the past few months, I’ve done literally nothing but watch TV and play videos. I used to have so many hobbies. I liked puzzles, Rubik’s cubes to be exact, but gave it up because small hands started to become a bit of an issue. I liked card magic, but I gave that up too because small hands, and people made fun of me when they found out I did it. I recently wanted to play soccer again after I quit playing in elementary school, but again, I was made fun of. I really like playing Basketball, but again, I was made fun of (quite a bit more since I’m short). I liked to write little comedy sketches for fun, but my “friends” found it when they stole my phone once, and I was made fun of immensely. Also for whatever reason, I always have this fear that I’m being watched, like my whole life is streaming live, and anyone can tune in to see, which I can’t get over for some reason. All I know is that when I grow up, I want to work in a big hospital, in a safe place, with a huge, bright lobby, and a bunch of little coffee shops and mini fast food places within the hospital. I have a morning or afternoon shift. Near the entrance, on the 2nd or 3rd floor I work as a Sports Medicine specialist (if Sports Medicine doctors work in hospitals, I hope they do). I live in a nice house in a nice, safe neighbourhood, and I’m happy and everything is okay. I want the world to know my name eventually, and I want to be known for something. For now, I just wish I can control my emotions, get back on track, get new friends, improve my health and eyesight, and find out how I want my damn hair to be cut or set of whatever.",09Jun2020,18

I’m only doing this for him for our future but if he’s not gonna help then there’s no point. And it took me years to call them to get help.

48,"I’ve changed the phrasing/spelling of some meh worse in case people I know find this by googling them. I’m probably deleting this later to say extra safe. 

I don’t even know how to describe how I feel. All I can say is I’m either struggling with mental health or I should avoid people around me. I know people around me can be nice to me sometimes but I can’t help be think it’s all a coverup. I do suffer from SAD and depres— and tried therapy more than once. I just don’t think therapy is gonna work for me anymore. IPart of me is scared about medications. I feel like something is evil about antidepressants and I don’t think it’s a good idea to consider them although I’ve been told to do so. I just think if I feel bad about certain treatment it’s better to avoid. It’ll just make things worse. At this point I feel like people around me might just all be bad and I’ve been trying to convince myself it might be related to mental health so I can feel like there’s a solution. I’m just tired of people always tricking me and speaking to me in passive aggressive tones. I feel very lost and I might be off topic now but I don’t even know what to say. The thing that made me breakdown is that for a long time I believed that flies spied on me. I managed to control but now I’m convinced they do. I just hope there is someone who understands me. I’m tired of people dismissing my problems saying you’re probably just a little worried or have you gotten any sleep. It’s not a kid sleep or worrying. I’ve also believed for a while that I might have p@r@n0ia because it came up during my SAD CBT but also people around me telling me I’m delusional and too sensitive. I’ve done the research and although I know paranoia is common with social anxiety, my  fear of people around me is rational. I’m kinda relieved because it means I wouldn’t have to worry about something else but at the same time I know I can’t do much about what’s happening. I can see it consumes a lot of my time but I have good reasons to not stop. If I’m not extra careful, people will hurt me. People around me keep telling me it’s okay you’re just anxious and can’t see what they’re doing. I tried throwing hints in the text that they’re being insensitive towards me. I can’t start full flights because of safety reasons which I will discuss later. People keep sending me stuff that are just hateful and can’t even see it. I’m tired of people around me doing good things and pretending to like me so I can feel guilty. I’m not sure but I’m thinking maybe they know I know and they do that so I think I like them. There’s no other explanation. I’m perfectly aware of my surrounding and so I’m rational. I try and hide certain stuff about me but sometimes I tell people about past events in my life when I trust them. I always regret it later. I now regret everything although everything I’ve said isn’t too personal. because I can’t ever leave the friendships because they’ll probably use it against me. I’m now stuck with people that definitely hate and some that very likely do hate me. They probably only want me around for when they’re bored or because for some weird reason they want to be me. It’s strange to me because my self confidence is really bad and I don’t know why they want to be me. I don’t have the power to do anything now because of the consequences ( revenge).",09Jun2020,1

51,"Hey everybody, I could use some advice. 

I have always been an extremely paranoid person, as far back as I can remember. When I was a kid I would never talk to any strangers no matter what, would be constantly watching my back when I walked and would carry extra sharp pencils on me to use in matters of self defense (thankfully it has never come to that)

Rather than growing past it, like I had assumed it would, it has only gotten worse as I've gotten older. I have weapons near the door of my house and my bedside table in case anyone breaks in. I have no close friends and have ruined the romantic relationships I have had because I can never bring myself to trust them at all. There are often spans of several hours at night when I will stare at my bedroom door,ready to fight because I'm certain that the noise I thought I heard was someone trying to break in.

This came to a head when I was visiting family the other day for the first time in several months, specifically my aunt, uncle and their 3 young children. Things were going well because I get along great with kids, until my aunt asked if I wanted to go for a walk, which was strange as though I often babysit their kids, I've never been especially close with my Aunt. It wasn't long before I realized I was completely certain she was planning to kill me in the woods. All it took was something even slightly unusual for me to jump to the conclusion that my close relatives, people who trust me to look after their kids, were going to kill me. 

So this is obviously a bit of a problem at this point, but I'm really not sure what I should do. Do you guys have any helpful suggestions? 

Thanks in advance.",09Jun2020,1
52,"Hey, so as of 3-4 weeks ago I began experiencing waves of sadness weekly. It happens once or twice during the weekend and lasts for the whole day. On top of that I find no motivation to do anything during these waves. What is going on with me?",09Jun2020,0
53,"It is really difficult for me to post this for fear of being judged, but it's gotten to a point where I am afraid that I will seriously hurt myself or another person. I am planning on seeking therapy once my area is no longer in a state of emergency from Covid, but am wondering if someone here might know what is wrong with me based off of what I am about to say.

I am generally an anxious person.  I try so hard to hide it though, that I laugh or giggle during each sentence.  People have asked me before why I'm always walking on eggshells.  It's because even if I'm really happy, I am always afraid that people will think I am being rude.  So I try extremely hard to over-compensate for that by being very giggly, and really going out of my way for others, even if it leaves me in an uncomfortable situation.

I have no close friends, for the same reason.  I am terrified of being judged by others so I usually just keep the few friends that I have at a distance.  I am good at taking constructive criticism, I rarely get in arguments with friends and have never had relationship issues at work.

Here is the part that scares me though, that's been happening to me more recently (within the last year or so).  When I do get really bothered or upset by something, I have a complete inability to cope.  This happens at least once every 2 weeks now, sometimes more often.  Sometimes, something so small will set me off that I don't even really remember why I am upset.  But when I get like this, the fact that I am upset makes me more stressed and anxious.  My inability to cope with these emotions escalate very quickly, almost suddenly.  I'll go from feeling sad or hurt, to exploding in anger.  I completely cannot control it.  I scream at the top of my lungs, and punch at any object I can find (never another person, but if nothing's around I'll hit myself).  I feel so much panic and anger, but I don't want to be violent, so what ends up happening every single time is that I run away.  I leave the situation and drive off in my car to try to calm myself down.  I don't drive aggressively, but I am in such a state of distress that I am completely impaired.

When I am driving, It feels impossible to console myself and I end up having to park somewhere and I go into a complete panic, Shaking, nauseous, hyperventilating, light headed.  I am not suicidal, but during these moments I feel a huge urge to commit suicide, as I feel very strongly that it's the only way out. These episodes will last hours, sometimes I will be up all night and only calm down when it's 7 or 8 in the morning, or when I exhaust myself so much that I just fall asleep.

I am worried about one day having a complete inability to cope, and actually attempting suicide.  Another thing that scares me is the driving because I am putting others in danger. The most recent time it happened, I became an r/IdiotsInCars and ran a red light and almost T-boned someone.  I have never made a mistake like that in my life, I am usually so careful and follow the driving rules.  That made me terrified, and is ultimately why I feel the need to post this. 

I am so scared of it happening again and actually hurting someone.  I've been trying to focus on not driving anymore in my state of panic, and going on walks instead.

55,"My brother has let me know that he is moving out tomorrow. The situation is complicated with my dad since one of the conditions if my brother decided to go through with this is that his dog cannot stay at our house. 

I found out today that neither of the dogs will be living here after tomorrow. They aren't mine and I know that but for some reason I feel kinda heart broken over this. I didn't realize until today that tomorrow could be the very last day I will have with the little pups.

I have found myself quite attached to the dogs partly because almost every day for the year and a half that we have had them I have gotten up before everyone.in my house to let them outside. I taught the pups to sit and lay down. One of them knows roll over because I taught the dog to do so. The other can do a little twirl on her hind legs. I initially taught them those tricks. 

I didn't realize that today was going to be one of my last days with two cute bundles of energy running around the house and giving me a reason to get out of bed before 8am everyday. They won't be around to cuddle up to me and take naps on my lap anymore. 

I know I am being really selfish in this post but I can't say these things out loud to my family. I don't know how I am going to say goodbye tomorrow when they leave without crying. I feel like I have no right to cry because they aren't really my dogs but now I am way too attached to them.

Usually I find the posts interesting and they don’t really get to me. Today I saw a photo of a boy, younger than I am with a terrible tumour that disfigured his face, took his vision and killed him weeks later.

I push myself to maintain a healthy &amp; enjoyable life. Exercise &amp; eat healthy, seek social interaction, get interesting hobbies, work towards my future etc. Everything that makes me anxious and insecure I work on until it stops bothering me.

Don’t know if as a result of my lifestyle or not, but I am very emotionally invested in the outcome of my life. I really do care what happens to me. 

The idea that I can grow a brain tumour and not realise until it’s way too late, or develop pancreatic cancer early in life absolutely terrifies the fuck out of me, mostly because these events are completely out of my control yet royally fuck me over.

58,"Struggling to keep on. Just need to share.

WARNING - long post but would really love some responses. 

This past year (since around September 2019), I have had one of the most emotionally difficult times in my life. I believe the catalyst to it all began April 2019 and possibly even before. I fell in love with one of my roommates (female), which pushed me to find a part of myself I had been hiding for years. I came out as bisexual to my friends and her, sharing my feelings and apologizing for my past behaviour towards her. I was emotionally cruel to her, shutting her out when she did minor things that I took offence to. I came to realize later on my actions were mostly a result of me loving her and expecting her to treat me like she loved me the same, with faltering expectations of how love should be shown. She didn’t accept my apology, and our relationship ended. 

This sent me into an emotional spiral of heartbreak. Not only was I dealing with the loss of someone I loved, I had also lost one of my best friends who made me feel like I was okay and safe even when I felt my worst. Just being near her put me at ease. She could take away my worries and calm my mind just by being in the same room. Sadly I put her on too high of a pedestal and expected too much. I know I’m at fault for the breakdown of our relationship, and since then I’ve been wracked with guilt for how I treated her and for losing her. 

Fast forward to that September. We were still roommates. I was plagued with seeing her every day, creating a new and happy life for herself. All the while I was cooped up in my room. I began shutting myself out. I’ve always been good at putting on a mask for people. I can still do it to even when I’m near my worst. I started seeing a therapist but I was still suffering from an emotional turmoil inside. I felt heartbreak, I felt guilt, I felt sadness, I felt anxiety, I felt anger. I’ve always tended to the extremes, so these emotions were coming in waves and smacking me in the face every time. 

Honestly, I don’t even remember the progression of it. All I know is that there were days and sometimes multiple days where I couldn’t talk to anyone, couldn’t do anything but sleep. When it gets like that, I feel like I just don’t want to exist. I don’t want to feel the pain I feel anymore. 

Now I’m lost. It feels like under my skin there’s a layer of numbness. This feeling of not knowing what’s going on in my own head. I’m sad, I’m angry, I’m guilty...I’m everything at once. It hurts a lot. It hurts my heart, my brain, my stomach. Every part of me aches. I feel like I’m constantly masking a grief that’s set up camp inside me. I don’t know how to forgive myself, I don’t know how to feel better, I don’t know what to do. 

I’m lost. I really am lost. I’m moving forward but I don’t know towards what. I want to feel better so badly. I really do. But I don’t know how. I don’t even know how to live without feeling like this. I’m not happy any more. I have happy moments obviously. I have friends, I have family. But I’m not living a happy life. Not these past few months. And I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I have no one I can talk to. I can’t talk to my mom about it, my dad, my friends. I don’t want to. I keep it all in my head. And I wanted to get it out. I just want to talk to someone about it so that I can try to talk the pain away. But at the same time I don’t want to talk to people. I don’t want to share. I feel like I’m undeserving of having anyone tell me I’m allowed to feel better. 

I don’t know why I’m posting this now. I miss my friend. I want her in my life again so badly but I know I can’t force her into it. I want someone to else to take away my pain, but I know that that’s not possible. I know the only one who can make me feel okay again is myself, but I don’t even trust myself to do that. 

That’s all I have to say really. I just want to hear people’s responses.",09Jun2020,1

I'm student studying away from home but due covid pandemic i have to return home and being a joint family where 2-3 relative live in a house everyone is very inconsiderate. They're racist and sexist to the level that they don't realise that they've gone too far.


i have tried to tell them it's wrong and it hurts but they don't understand it. They ignore the fact that a women goes through a lot and she needs love more than criticism. Everyone needs someone. But there's no one in my life who understands me except for my mom.

My bf is total shit. Being 25 yrs of age his parents control him. And he can't do what i say. What is there to expect from him if he can't do simple things i ask. 


So I can't be at home. There's no place where i study because landlord is kicking us out and I can't find anybody trustworthy and safe place to stay.

All this goes on and on in my head. It's frustrating.

61,"So basically, I have depression, anxiety, and OCD. My mom doesn't believe in medication and she thinks my mental issues are a spiritual problem. Also, she thinks medication is evil and that it's literal magic, apparently. I asked her, ""if mental problems are spiritual, then why do medications help?"" And do you know what her reply was?!? (Paraphrasing) ""Maybe the devil lets it work so they don't think it's a spiritual problem"". LIKE HOW FREAKING DENSE DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO BE TO BELIEVE THAT?!? She thinks that plants and prayer are the only cure for anything because God made them. She thinks using medication is bad also because God didn't specifically make it and that if people use it he won't get any glory for it or some crap. Like idk mom, HAVEN'T YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT GOD ALLOWED PEOPLE TO MAKE IT BECAUSE IT HELPS PEOPLE? She also believes in spiritual healing and ""casting out spirits"" or something. She thinks if you have enough faith you can just rid yourself of mental issues by praying them away. But you have to have a ton of faith, apparently.

So, I do believe there's a God but I have such a skewed view of religion that I'm slowly backing away. I don't necessarily wanna ditch Christianity but so many of the beliefs of so called Christians are so damaging. I know that this isn't a religious help subreddit (I don't wanna post this on r/Christianity because I'm afraid people will attack me), but if there are any sane and understanding Christians on here please help me.

65,"Hey guys so I'm a junior in high school (17 years old) and for the past two years I've had on and off again moments of extreme depression and constant anxiety. During this time I've been in a complicated relationship with the same girl, we aren't currently dating or even speaking, and it always helps to have her around but after our last thing together I don't think she wants to talk to me again anytime soon. I don't get along with anyone in my family except my older brother who moved out a while ago and has a girlfriend of his own so I don't see him much and I honestly have pretty much nothing in common with my friends. The fact that none of them use social media much or like to talk on the phone at least to me really doesn't help considering I live in Seattle and the stay at home order is in effect so I haven't seen them in months. I play football but I don't like most of my teammates outside of football since all they care about is drugs and harassing girls which I don't support at all. I feel so hopeless all the time and life has honestly lost all joy or excitement for me. I just don't generally feel good most of the time and miss when I was able to just have fun without feeling so horrible. Is there anyone else that has felt like this in high school and if so what, if anything, made it better?

67,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post it but I think I might need some help. My dad and younger brother are both really big on hunting, I've never been interested in it myself but have to admit that I do get jealous sometimes that it's something that my brother and my dad bond over and I'm not a part of it.

Today they went hunting and I decided that I wanted to go with them. There's a farm next to us which has a pigeon problem so the farmer is very happy to let us do some pest control. I was hesitant about shooting but my dad and my brother just kept goading me so I started shooting too and killed a few.

When it became my turn again, I'm not used to this so I accidentally shot a pigeon in the leg. My dad explained that the pigeon would die slowly and painfully unless I dispatched it. He handed me a knife and told me to cut it's head off. 

Up until a few moments ago I was ok with killing them from afar but in that moment I just froze and couldn't do it. It's like I could see the fear in it's eyes, it was frantically trying to get away. My brother kept calling me a ""pu*sy"" and my dad kept telling me to be a man so eventually I worked up the nerve to hold it down and cut it's head off.

Since then, it's like I feel numb and keep replaying the whole thing over and over in my head. I can hear the sound of the blade cutting through flesh and I can feel the blade cutting through bone over and over. I try thinking about something else but the image just keeps coming back. The more I try not to think about it the more I keep thinking about it.

I feel like a failure. Aren't I supposed to be ""ok"" with this? Does it make me less of a man that I'm sad and feel guilty over killing a pest? If my little brother (19) is comfortable doing things like this, why aren't I? There's just so much going through my head and I don't know how to slow down.",09Jun2020,4

Does anyone else feel like they see some of their own issues, but they just don't quite care enough to do something about it? Like, you know you probably need to find a therapist, but you have this huge mental block with bold letters on it saying, ""You're fine""?  Yet, you struggle to get out of bed every morning. You question why you're still bothering to keep going. You've become annoyed by the smallest things, like your own family member asking a simple question. Or you're so bored with everything you used to find joy in doing. I think this COVID outbreak made things worse. Even with the BLM movement and the protests, all this negative stuff you see in the news is absolutely heart breaking. You want nothing more than to help where you can. So you read. Listen. Donate. Share information. But it's so overwhelming you have to stop for a while. My mood has been so low it's nearly flattened, and I get in the headspace of wanting to find a therapist, but then I just buckle up and freeze. And then it rinses and repeats.

74,"Okay so my cousin has had severe depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts and anxiety for several years, she even had hallucinations as a child but it only happened a couple times. Anyhow, she has went to several different doctors and she has been on antidepressants, bipolar medications, etc. but nothing ever worked and it actually seemed to make her a lot worse so she stopped taking her meds about 7 years ago and she surprisingly got a lot better and seemed to be doing great for years. Well, a couple weeks ago I went on a road trip to go see her and everything was great when I saw her. But later that night I accidentally found her journal and it freaked the living shit out of me. She had several pages in her journal where she wrote about how she has fantasies of covering herself in her own poop and dancing naked around the house. She even wrote about how she has fantasies of pooping on a baby (wtf?!) she also wrote about how she has fantasies about eating people and making the meat
Into hot dogs and eating it and having sex with corpses and decapitating them. oh and she talked about how she had apparently licked her own mothers underwear and sniffed it.

79,"There’s this online friend of mine that’s been going through some stuff lately. I’ve been trying to help her with her mental health. 

I used to be in a pretty dark place myself, and I understand a lot of what she’s going through. I’ve had to talk her out of suicide twice, and she has been self harming a lot.

I used to cut too, but I eventually stopped. At first her self harming wasn’t that bad and I was trying to get her to stop, but after her most recent suicide attempt, one of her other friends cut all ties with her. She freaked out and she’s even more scared and sad and angry than ever. Ever since then, her self harming has gotten a lot worse, and she doesn’t even want to stop anymore. She romanticises the act of cutting and thinks her problems aren’t valid because she isn’t doing it enough. 

I tried to talk her out of this dangerous mindset, but she wouldn’t listen. I got her to promise she wouldn’t do more than 11 cuts per day (The worst I ever did) That promise went out the fucking window, as she cut herself almost 30 fucking times because her sister said some mean things about her. Her sisters a bitch, and I know the pain she’s going through, but she lets the wrong people get to her too much. She gets so sad and so angry over nothing. I get it, I used to be like that, but if she keeps going like this, she’ll be worse than I ever was. 

When I was at my worst, the second I realised that there were people who actually cared about me, I tried to get better, not for my sake, but for there’s. She just seems too stubborn to even do that. She is just so stupid, and I know that eventually she’ll look back and hate herself even more. 

Is it wrong that I’m starting to feel angry at her? I have been so patient with her for months on end and she only seems to get worse. I never used to get angry at her, but as I’m typing this I’m literally shaking with rage. She’s a good person deep down, and I know it, but I hate that she can’t see that.

Dear Reader,                                                                                                                 06/07/2020

I’m upset. I’m depressed. I might kill myself. Don’t freak out. If I did I feel like people would care at first and then not care at all later. It would be fine. I never could really relate to my family, so I guess I have anything but a close relationship with them. I’ve had a lot of friends that really were just acquaintances, and I never was really close with. I’ve been like this a few years and I would never tell anyone until I met this one girl. She’s a lot older than me, and she always gave me good vibes. I got to know her. She treated me like family. I got to the point where I felt comfortable talking to her about my anxiety, and depression, and suicidal thoughts. She was able to relate to me. When I needed to just let my feelings out, she would sit there and tell me I’m not all the things I said I was. She didn’t want to let me think I was worthless, or stupid, or a burden. She talked to me everyday. I don’t know what it was about her. She seemed so loving and welcoming. She would call me hun, and sweetheart, and stuff like that. She meant a lot to me. And I made sure she knew it, because she would tell me the same things I told her. She thought she was worthless, or people didn’t care about her. It isn’t true. We cared about each other. I could relate to her. She had told me that she almost killed herself before. I’ve been there a few times. She’s been raped 3 times. I’m lucky that I’ve never had anything like that happen to me. She’s been through a lot, and I’m going through a lot. She was right behind me, because she cared a lot about me. Over time we stopped talking as much. I had a lot of school stuff. We were still close, just not as close. She was there for me as often as possible. But then there was this one night. I felt so alone. She had demanded for me to go to her anytime I felt really bad. But I knew she was asleep. I decided to cut myself. I told her about it the next day, and she was mad. She didn’t want to talk to me, because she had said not to harm myself. I talked to her about it a few days later. She told me that I needed to talk to someone who was nice, and at the time she didn’t have what it took to be nice. I understood. I came back a week later. Things were going smoothly. And then I got in an argument with someone, in front of her. I’m completely cool with the person I argued with now. But I was really upset about it. I said a lot of stuff about myself. She wasn’t having it that night. She was really mad at me. I figured she must’ve had a bad day. I messaged her the next day. No response. I messaged her the day after that. No response. She was ignoring me. She finally responded once. She said I had been over the top. I asked her when we could talk again. She said she would contact me when she wanted to. I didn’t sleep for a while. I still don’t know how long I went without sleep but it was at least 4 days. I was too stressed. I’m still stressed. I kept messaging her asking for answers. She responded once but basically said the same thing as before. I’m sad. The one friend that I had who I felt was safe to talk to gave up on me. I don’t even know if anyone is ever going to read this. Maybe I’ll put this up somewhere anonymously. Maybe future me is reading this. What if she’s reading. If so I want you to know that I miss you. It has put a lot of stress on me. I hope that if someone else is reading this that you’re doing better than I am. If there’s anything to learn from this, is to be more aware of mental health. It’s no joke. I just wish I didn’t cut myself. Probably everything would be fine if I didn’t cut myself. I would probably not be as sad as I am right now if I didn’t do that. Who knows, maybe I’ll write about this again sometime. It probably sounds like I’m a dumb kid who just has a crush on some girl who paid attention to me once and I’m exaggerating all this.

90,"Hi - thanks for reading. 

Background - my wife (early 40s) had a few difficult years until last year when she came off antidepressants and made some serious efforts to improve her quality of life. She changed her job, kicked my ass into shape regarding our marriage which had been struggling. She made more effort to restore her social life, saw a therapist and really started to make progress.

Things went well until the spring when the coronavirus started. We are in the UK. Although it's certainly a serious thing, we (especially her) did over time start to think that what has been done has been a total mess. Please don't judge me on what I'm about to say, I am only going to say what we feel which is that the lockdown has come at a huge cost. Our children will be effectively locked up for 6 months, with little education and no social lives. Cancer patients are not being treated, serious illnesses are going undiagnosed. The economy will be in a disastrous state for many years to come. Domestic abuse is massively on the rise. Millions will be unemployed. And all with the effect that there remains no plan for ""dealing"" with coronavirus, it's not gone away, just been delayed at an utterly vast and still largely not understood price. My wife has lost all the initiative she has gained and is now very upset indeed, seriously depressed and not in a good way. She feels no hope for the future, her life has been taken away, not in a literal sense but in a practical one. She can't imagine how she can ever go to the pub again, or meet up with friends for a weekend etc. The Govt have just announced that schools will be closed for our children til ""at least"" september.

As restrictions are slowly lifted, it feels inevitable to her that the infection rate will go back up again and we will enter another lockdown, that this nightmare will never end. 

Can I please ask for advice on how I can help her? She's quite fit naturally and doesn't take well to things like - ""Take some exercise"", or ""think positively!"", or ""meditate"", she's quite cynical and not hippy dippy. I love her dearly, and would love to be able to help more than the platitudes which are running very thin, eg ""somehow it'll be alright, you'll see"". Every day is the same. No hope, just more bad headlines and seemingly nothing positive to ever look forward to again, just masks, economic devastation, restrictions of civil liberties, kids going ever more feral, all without end. 

Thank you !",09Jun2020,1
91,"I struggle so much right now. I know its my own fault im here but I dont know who to talk to.   


I think I have always struggled with mental health but I grew up in a family where problems like these werent taken serious. It was seen as some form of weakness and mocked. Looking back I realize I needed therapy since I was a teen. My first therapy session was 2 years ago when I was 30 years old.   


I still dont know whats ""wrong"" with me. I know I struggle with anxiety but I dont know if it is more. I cant control my feelings. Sometimes it feels like I feel 1000 things at the same time. I also seem to feel or think that I feel what others think and feel. Specially about me. Which is only negative things. I also live with immense guilt and shame. I never feel I measure up.   


One of my biggest struggles is my porn addiction. I am trying to break free from it but its sometimes hard. I have hurt my wife with it and that only adds to the guilt and shame.  Last week I was seriously thinking about ending it. I chose a place and a method and started to try it out. I dont know if its just a way to cope with the guilt or shame or if I really want to take my life. I dont know if its just me seeking attention. I dont know and feel confused. All I know is that I kind of hate myself and feel like I am doing it more and more.   


Yesterday I talked to my therapist and she says she is worried. Specially because I had told her before that what stopped me from taking my life was my faith. I believe in hell and heaven. But last week when I was in a position of hurting myself that didnt matter. All I wanted was to disappear. Stop feeling anything.  She thinks I should talk to my wife. But I dont feel I can. I dont want her to stay with me because she is afraid of what I will do with myself. She has her own stuff to deal with. At the same time I am scared. Scared of what she will do when she hears that I have these thoughts and what I started to do to myself.   


I dont have any friends. Tried talking to a guy I see as a friend about almost getting burned out at work but it got very awkward for him so I let it go. I have an online accountability group to help me fight my porn addiction but I feel like I am just annoying them at this point. I just feel lost and feel all these feelings and I cant do anything about them. I am not going to hurt myself. I feel better than I did last week but its like my mind is going in unstoppable speed and I dont know what to do.

92,"Hey everyone!

**TL;DR at the end.**

My partner and I have been dating for 2.5 years. I'm in therapy for PTSD/GAD/depression and started SSRIs half a year ago. Switched to a different SSRI two weeks ago and currently struggling with the transition.

Added to that, my partner and I are trying to sort out some long-time issues that we never addressed, but now realised we'll have to work through if we want to continue being on the same team. One of them being that he wasn't really open and honest with me in the past two years, and I have now finally stood up for myself and told him I will need to ask a lot questions (and will insist on that) to be able to really trust him again. One of those questions in the past few days was whether he'd really been online on instagram for half an hour while at a small birthday party of a close friend. I'd been online chatting with a friend and was confused to see him online, because I knew he was with people, so I asked him the next day. He felt that my attention to that was toxic and noticed that he started thinking twice before going online on instagram because I might see when he was online last, and that thought makes him uncomfortable. While I understand that, I don't quite understand what's the deal with me knowing when he was online last. Usually I don't care. I did care for a while because he ignored my messages on our messaging app for hours, but would be online on instagram.

I feel like my needs and the one ""demand"" I had, namely having the freedom to hold him accountable and ask questions, are immediately met with him pushing against it because it's uncomfortable for him. I understand that it's uncomfortable, but so is being unable to trust your partner because they've hidden things and neglected you repeatedly in the past.I also feel pretty bad mentally, currently struggling with passive suicidal ideation again because of the med change. But given that I feel I can't even express very reasonable needs (""I want to feel that you care"", ""I want you to be completely open and honest"", ""I want you to prioritise talking to me over scrolling on instagram"") and have them met with disregard instead, I don't feel comfortable getting support from my partner. In a recent conversation he also talked about how I had voiced my appreciation for his patience with my mental health in the past, and how that isn't easy either, and basically that felt like he's using his explicitly stated ""i want to be there for you"" and my following acceptance of that as an argument against me.

**TL;DR:** My partner said he wants to be there for me and support me when I struggle mentally, but then went on to use it as an argument of how HE is putting in work in the relationship and dealing with things that are unpleasant. He's obviously NOT capable to deal with it without taking it personally. Am I the asshole for denying him his offer of support from now on, no matter how much he insists he wants to?",09Jun2020,1

96,"Hey everyone! I really felt the need to write a little about what I have experienced the last couple of months and how something horrible turned out to make me a lot happier than I was.

Thursday March 12th the Norwegian government decided to shut down all schools and cultural events. As someone who gets their income from playing live music and being a substitute teacher, this was a major setback for me. On top of that I was torturing myself through an education I absolutely hated (I finally got the courage to drop out though). This wasn't exactly the best time in my life you could say. But little did I know that the feeling of accomplishment and fulfillment was close by! After I came to terms with the new reality I'm living now, in which I'm really struggling to pay my rent. I gave myself time to focus on the things that truly fascinates me, and the things I love to do. I'm creating a lot more music and videos now, my production skills are improving day by day, and I'm focusing much more attention on my youtube channel. I know that social media/marketing can be rough on your mental health, and I have experienced that too, but these couple of months have made me realise that I do this simply because I love doing it. And when you have that attitude things start to work out, one step at a time (Baby steps).

I think my major point here is: Now that all other structures in my life fell, it is up to me to make a purpose of my days, weeks etc. I found this thing I truly love spending my time on, and that propells me to get out of bed in the morning and start working. Sure, my landlord hates me and might kick me out soon (I still don't have any money), but I'm feeling better than ever, I am in a state of mind where I truly enjoy my life. And to me, that's worth more than anything else.

Listen, does anyone KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?! I don't hate hurting people, but at the same, there's literally nothing I love more. Allow me to explain.

I am NOT in any way against the LGBT community, I have many friends who are a part of it and I support them with everything I have. However, you wouldn't think that'd be true when just the other day I found myself with the overwhelming urge to go around and tell them how disgusting they were, and how I hated them with every fibre of my being, even though I don't. The most confusing part? It was completely out of the blue, on a completely normal day.

I don't WANT to hurt people, and yet I do. I'm normally a very sympathetic person. It doesn't take much for me to relate to others, and care for them. Yet, sometimes it's like this weird, predatory urge just takes control of me and I can turn off that empathy like a damn light switch. Here's an example, I LOVE dogs (I always have and I own a lovely, little labrador girl myself) but I sometimes find myself with an urge to hurt them. In the most gruesome ways too, skinning them and setting them afire. Goodness me, I've never any of these, because I don't want to! I LOVE DOGS!! And yet, I do want, and I don't love dogs or anything else. Confused yet? Yeah, me too. Here's another example.

As a teenager I had a hobby of luring boys in and breaking their hearts. I was a really nice, patient girl, teacher's pet who never got along with the cool kids, and was sometimes bullied by them. But I no matter how nice I was to LITERALLY everyone, whenever a boy showed any sign of weakness, that predatory urge would kick in and I would lure them in, and give them all the hints, and act all cutesy and in love, even though I felt absolutely nothing for them. And then, as soon as they confessed their love, I would come to my senses and realise I'd been hurting them! I'd break their hearts and hate myself for misleading them, until the next boy with signs of weakness came along, I would get submerged in that urge and it would happen all over again!

It's not necessarily a split personality, but more like two ways of seeing the world that I constantly float between. Two mindsets and sets of morals that collide with one another perfectly. One where I want to work for charity, help people and strongly believe everyone should be kind. And the other, where I feel indifferent about everything, feel no empathy towards anyone and give in to an overwhelming desire to pray on other's weaknesses and manipulate them.  CAN ANYONE PLEASE HELP BEFORE I ACTUALLY HURT ONE OF MY FRIENDS???

I am 27 and I am from nepal.I am jobless.27 and I've never been in a relationship.27 and more confused than when I was 7.All I wanted was to have a normal life and I think all I have known was opposite of normal.

I was born in comparatively rich family the only son,the pampered one.Then I lost my father at the age of 8 when I was starting to understand the meaning of relationships.I saw my life turn from riches to rags within months.Though I still had house to live the boy who got whatever he asked had to stop.Then there was my overprotective mother who wouldn't let me do things she believed would do me harm.I didn't even get into a relationship when I had chance because I was afraid of her reaction.Trust me,Nepal was like the medieval europe when I was a teenager though now its changing.
Then I was told I should go to Med school.I did go.It was the best thing one could do.The job which would give you name,money and security..I tried for scholarship but didn't manage and ended up paying about 40,000$ in the fees.I was not sure about it.as  It was huge sum and about 50% of my maybe net worth,But my mother made sure that it was good sum.There in the med school,I discovered that I was gay.
I lost my mind could'nt believe it.I fell for a straight guy and then my heart was meant to break.Oh did it.That was when I first thought of suicide.But I could'nt do it.Though I tried but I didn't have enough guts.
After that phase I somehow accepted my sexuality and I met someother gay guys from the community.But after meeting certain people,I started to hate the word ""Gay"".Still today I am not sure of it.Then I graduated from med -school.I started to work then I decided I hated this field.Sleep deprivation,hatred towards the work made me feel more depressed and suicidal.Even after investing 6 years of my life,I just discovered that I had to start it all over again for now getting my residency.
And I wanted to leave this field,but I felt like I have no choice at the moment.40,000$ is too much to risk.Maybe immigrating to America is a good option.So I tried to study for it.
So,I was depressed  and feeling low and then my mother was diagnosed with signs of early depression.I guess I don't have any right to be depressed.Now chances of going foreign seems bleak.
I always wonder wouldn't life be easy if My father hadn't died,If I had siblings,If I was not gay,If I didn't go to med-school?
For me the sthethescope that is the pride of the doctors feels like a chain thats holding me back.I am not at all proud of being able to write ""Dr."" infront of my Name.It disgust me.
I don't even know what I want in life. I am also diagnosed with cervical spondylosis and am typing this on my laptop placed high upon the stack of books.I am also diagnosed with spina bifida which gives me back pain if I sit for too long.
Sometimes I wish to end my life.That would be peaceful.The only thing stopping me is Pain.If I got to end my life then it must not be painful.Atleast I deserve that.

I’ve not really confided in anyone about this other than my best friend because no one really seemed to understand. I mentioned it to my now boyfriend a few times because he asked me if I was okay and I just briefly mentioned about my panic attacks. 

Now he seems to be describing to me panic attacks too and his mindset had completely shifted to the point where he thought of dying. For reference, he was always a positive (sort of) happy-go-lucky type of guy and I find it extremely concerning. I’ve told him to tell someone and even see a counsellor because even I can’t help myself when it comes to things like that. 

We’re both having major exams this year and as the dare draws closer I understand the affects of the stress it brings, especially when he has pushed himself so hard. But I cant help but feel that me talking about my mindset to him had influenced him to feel the same way. I know it sounds kind of stupid, I just can’t help but overthink.",09Jun2020,1
122,"Basically for the last 2-3 years the uni I went to caused me to have many mental breakdowns due to lack of structure in the curriculum and backwards mentoring tactics. I was so anxious and eventually depressed because I kept making things I wasnt happy with but just couldn't figure out what to do to make it better. I worked so hard and still once the project was done i'd want nothing to do with it because I feel embarrassed by it. My grades were always average no matter how hard I tried. It got so bad I had to stop and graduate half a year later with therapy and basically auto pilot mode.

Now it's been about half a year and I see some of my friends starting to get jobs and moving foreward, and although I've started to move on as well every time I talk to them I feel so down because I feel like I'm failing again. I want to be doing what they're doing but I just feel so inadequate. And I'm trying so hard to change this mindset but I just can't. I don't want to lose my friends either, but they also bring back a lot of these horrible memories. How can I retrain my brain to feel confident in what I do again?",09Jun2020,1
123,So my brother is either having some sort of mental break or he has schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. He believes he had been talking with a famous rapper when in reality it's a bot and it's not even talking to him. It just keeps changing its name on youtube and he believes it's talking to him in code through its name changes. What can I do? He's almost 40 years old and lives a few states away. He needs help because he's been obsessing about this for weeks and barely sleeping. He also does drugs.,09Jun2020,1
124,"I’ve just felt so off lately and it’s hard to explain it. I feel so scattered, like my mind can’t even have a full thought if that makes sense. I just feel so uneasy and upset most of the time. 

Things started to go downhill for me around November of last year. I was having an overall stressful time and some minor health issues (women’s health issues which I’ve since had resolved). During this time I very suddenly remembered a traumatic incident that I had blocked out of my mind for years out of the blue one day.  I had been molested by a male classmate when I was in the sixth grade at my school’s after hours program. I told myself for years to just pretend it didn’t happen and it worked. I barely ever thought about it. And in November of last year, all those memories just came flooding back. I told my mom who was very upset but believed me however after telling her I just couldn’t shake this feeling of embarrassment. everything became scary to me. 

I have had mental health issues before (social anxiety and depression due to moving as a kid often) but I hadn’t experienced them for a few years at that point. In the months following that weird memory  I’ve felt increasingly more depressed and numb. I’ve had outbursts of anger with people where I almost feel like I’m out of my body. I get into moods where I am so sad for days- missing my childhood and simpler/ more innocent times. I feel like I’m crazy. I have no friends other than my BF and my relationship is barely hanging on. I just don’t know how to move on and get my shit together. The pandemic situation has only exacerbated these issues. 

I worry because I have heard that in some people more serious mental health issues present themselves around ages 19-23 and every week I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality. How can I start to move past this?",09Jun2020,1
125,"I often worry about my mental well being, and when doing tests online I can relate to a lot of symptoms of mental health issues, I also score pretty high on autism tests, but I don't know if these online tests can be trusted. I have always felt a bit paranoid, I don't like wearing earpieces because I think other people can hear my music and they would find me annoying, and now we have to take classes online, I make sure my house is as silent as possible, and I always turn my head around when I breathe out so other people won't hear me breathe. All for the same reason, I don't want to be annoying to other people. I also worry that people can read my mind, I don't know why but I am always deeply ashamed of my thoughts, even when they're completely normal and every time I think about something weird in my mind I think of an explanation why it would be completely normal to think that and I will say it in my mind so that people reading my mind would know why I thought that. Also when I think of something mean or offensive I always say in my mind that I heard it from someone else, and I make up a person, a place and time to describe where I was told it as precisely as possible. So other people who could read my mind wouldn't think I thought it myself. I think I am a pathological liar, but that's because I run so many scenario's through my mind that I don't know which one really happened. I am afraid of a lot of things, height, the dark and when I go to sleep I close ALL the doors and windows in the house, because if anything makes noise while I am trying to go to sleep I just can't sleep anymore because I think there's something wrong and it takes me at least 30 minutes to calm down and try to go to sleep again. When I was eight years old a friend of mine told me about Ouija boards, he had seen a YouTube video about ghosts and wanted to try it himself. So at the next sleepover we ""summoned a ghost"" in my bedroom. During our ""talking with the ghost"" I saw a shadow and the bathroom door at the end of the hallway slammed shut. As long as I've lived in that house I've lived in fear, (which was 6 years). I was afraid to go to sleep because I believed the ghost was going to kill me at night, and it took me at least an hour to go to sleep every night, and if there was any sound in my bedroom I would just stay up for another hour because I was so afraid. There have been nights that I haven't slept because there was a storm outside, (I was 10 years old) and I was afraid that it was ghosts that were attacking my house. To make things worse we lived only 50 meters away from a graveyard, and for at least 5 years I have never walked next to the graveyard. Even when I needed to cross the intersection next to the graveyard, I would take another route to avoid it, (1.2 km instead of 75 meters). Thankfully my family moved and now most of my fears are over, but we still live in the same village and I will still never go through that street because I just feel uncomfortable and I just think everything there is trying to kill me. Lately I have been thinking there is a conspiracy against me, I have always thought that people did not say to me what they actually meant, that they've been lying just to make me feel better. When I read a story about the movie the Truman show, I've become especially worried about other people not being who they really are. I think there are lots of things wrong with me mentally, but I don't know what to call it and I don't know what to do with it, because I don't have a lot of money, and neither does my family. I am not depressed and actually mostly happy on a daily basis, but I think I have some problems.  
I don't know if it can help, but I'm 16 years old, maybe that can be a factor.

TLDR: I think my mind broken up and I don't know what to do.",09Jun2020,1

137,"Hello,

My younger brother is 34 (we are in America) In a lot of ways he is normal but he has just lived at home with my mom his whole life and he does nothing. To expand on that, he has gone to a psych ward for 3 days before for suicidal thoughts, he has a bunch of beliefs and convictions that make no sense, and he is unwilling or unable to listen to anything. He just does nothing and if I say anything to him he shuts down and acts like he knows better. At one point I got him to live with me and he tried driving Uber but ended up quitting everything after a short time and going back to my mom. He has severe issues as well such as in the past he mentioned having heard voices, or that his head feels “so hot he almost thinks a demon is in it”. I’m barely successful myself and it’s hard enough to take care of myself but I feel like he’ll either kill himself or continue to waste his life. I want to help him but I don’t know how. I used to call him frequently and it would be pleasant talks  sometimes but now he’s so despondent I don’t feel like he has a lot of time left. I’m no psychiatric professional but I’ve taken like 6 or 7 psych classes in college. I feel like he might be schizoid, possibly somewhere in the autism spectrum, clinically depressed (that one is obvious) and/or I don’t know what else. How can I help him? He’s taken various medications and gone to therapists but he’s on social security so his available care seems poor and I don’t think he’s very interested in pursuing it. I don’t think a mental hospital would help, at least not a state run one. I’m willing to pay to get him help, I’m trying to convince him to live with me again (on the condition he becomes productive and doesn’t just sit around in his underwear, smoking marijuana and reading bullcrap on his computer all day. Please help me help him. I don’t want him to die or waste more of his life.",09Jun2020,1
138,"So this is my first post and was hoping to get a little insight. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and OCD. My OCD has definitely gone off the rails the past few months. I can barely function without having to do certain things over and over, or having horrible thoughts take over my mind. However, the last couple of weeks I've been experiencing something I never have and it is really freaking me out. When I am trying to sleep or if I am just sitting in a quiet room, I get these loud ""thoughts"" (or voices) that are completely random as if it were coming from a TV. It brings on this weird sensation in my brain as if it is quivering or vibrating? I am terrified that these are voices or that there is something physically wrong with my brain. It doesn't really happen if I'm thoroughly engaged in something, only when I am alone and not doing much. I do have to sleep with the tv on to drown out these thoughts/voices, otherwise I cannot sleep. I have talked to my psychiatrist and he told me he thinks it is just my OCD. I am currently taking 10mg of prozac and am supposed to slowly up my dose. He advised me if the prozac doesn't work, he would like me to try risperidone. I guess I am just seeing if anyone else out there experiences these symptoms and does not have schizophrenia. (I tried to explain this the best way I could!)",09Jun2020,1

140,"Just found out about this sub and am wanting to vent a little, so here goes.

Ever since I remember I am having struggles with myself. I am always having issues with my discipline and reaching goals. Right now I'm working on my graduation but I'm having such a hard time with finishing my internship and last big assignment. The expectations I set for myself always seem unreachable and so I constantly have things to blame myself for. And that causes me to have regular panic attacks. 

Today I heard that I failed an assignment for the 2nd time and that means that I cant graduate untill January instead of August. Another thing going terrible and that while I'm already 2 years behind schedule. Bam, panic attack. It doesnt help that I seriously dislike the field of work I chose but hey, the choices I make never work out so this shouldnt come as a surprise. I know that its better to follow your heart but damn, im so close to having a diploma and I wouldnt even know where to start. 

So a few hours I worked up the courage to discuss this with my manager at my internship and we decided that its best that I take 2 weeks off. I know in the back off my head that this is good for me and that its amazing that my manager is willing to offer me that, but still...  it feels like such a massive failure. I'm going to seek help in the coming two weeks and really focus on finding out what I need to move on and reach my goals. Im just hoping that it wont be for nothing, like so much had been already.

It's comforting to know that I'm not alone in my struggles and that Im lucky enough to have a loving gf who supports me. I hope this situation doesnt get the better of me and that I will be able to move on..

Thanks for reading these ramblings",09Jun2020,2
141,"Since I was little I have been speculated to have Autism. I've been evaluated when I was little, but was told I was not on the spectrum. My parents, my doctor, and my former teachers are all in agreement that I have some form of autism or aspergers. I dunno about that since I haven't researched too much into autism. All I know is that I get easily overwhelmed and anxious by a lot of things. For starters, having too much noise around me. I'm in a family of five and at dinner the noise and everything going on is just too much for me sometimes and it causes me to be nervous and anxious. I'll frequently need to find an excuse to walk away from the dinner table to just calm my nerves. We aren't a loud bunch, its just hearing all the noise of people talking and moving things around all at the same time. Other things that can trigger me are sounds like the rubbing of styrofoam. I know a lot of people don't like it, but for me its been really bad. Its a feeling I've only every really been able to describe as feeling as if I'm shrinking... I dunno. If my parents get anything styrofoam like cups or plates, I'll cover my ears and refuse to even go near it. Other things that can trigger me is certain patterns, like grids of hexagons. Looking at or thinking about patterns of hexagons make me really disoriented and nauseous. When I was little, I would only be able to describe feeling dizzy or nauseous as feeling ""hexagony"" because of how much I have associated hexagons with feeling disoriented. Other than that there are times I'm playing games or doing some work on my computer and all of a sudden I get this wave of anxiety from seemingly nowhere. I'll have to shut off my computer and sit back for a minute or two before turning it back on and continuing, but if its really bad I'm have to lay down for a while.

143,"so ive been depressed for years, and right now is probably the best ive felt in a really long time despite still being mentally ill and extremely stressed. even so, i still have no motivation. i recently got on pills for my adhd which i thought would help, but it doesn't seem to do too much. my attention and motivation is still a huge problem. it's so hard to even find motivation to brush my teeth every day, let alone do everything else im supposed to do. hygiene and health have taken a huge hit throughout my depression. I rarely take care of myself unless I get a random spout of motivation, which even then I don't do everything I wanted. I barely shower every few days, never wash my face, and barely brush my teeth in the morning. I also never have motivation to cook anything, so my when I say my health has taken a hit I mean all I eat is junk and food I can just prepare fast instead of actually healthy food. I enjoy eating healthy, I just can't even seem to motivate myself to prepare a salad these days. I used to dance 5 days a week, but I graduated so I had to quit. my body was so used to working out like that and it suddenly stopped. I haven't worked out or done any similar activity since July.

145,"This is very long and not written with the intent of entertaining. Also, a lot of this is thought vomit as it just happened and a filter is not there. 
A girl called me stupid to a group of people, in the next room over as the walls are paper thin. They never had a conversation with me. 
I had an interview with a man earlier we’ll name Mr. San Francisco. He was detailing to me how an aspect of the job works. He was explaining it like it was interesting and so I pretended it was interesting when it could’ve taken 2 seconds to explain then onto the next thing: a job I’m well qualified for and need only the money. I want it bc I wouldn’t have people in my face stressing me out to the point where I can’t exact the task at hand because I’m picking up and proceeding every gesture and relating it to the past and future simultaneously  and my personality wants to dig into like a mathematical equation to on but it isn’t - it’s just human interaction. As far as the pretending part and acting - I used a similar in the moment method which in this case meant removing the meaning to something higher that I truly wouldn’t understand such as quantum physics so as to create a reaction or appearance of myself - previously not knowing something and “learning” it for the first time.  Even putting the word learning in quotes caused me to hesitate as it comes across as condescending and I quickly imagined how he’d react to knowing that I wasn’t learning anything from what he was saying because it was common sense and he’d react with jealousy or think I think I’m too good for the job and not hire me. Back to Mr. San Francisco - Maybe I should be honest about how I dumb myself down for interviews. How I want the job so I can have interactions that don’t drain me to save on my real work. Which I procrastinate to the point of absolute shame but believe me, is on the forefront of my mind. I have the need to prove something, something to shield me from the world when my ego is so in another place I can no longer play their game and respect myself at the end of the day. Oh yea, so, I remember just pretending to be interested in the most basic concepts - and looking back it would appear as if I were stupid. I’m scared. Scared to be honest. Scared of backlash that could cost me my security. Which I have not much left to lose anyway. Maybe I should be honest with him and risk this position (in fear he’ll be jealous) but maybe cutting to the truth will cut out the fat, so to speak. 

Q said he was in the city and asked if was around to meet. Of course you’re in the city. But am I going to say that? I know that in my mind- I know already why you’ve said it and therefore don’t feel the need to point it out or ask. These concepts have no meaning to me and my not saying it only makes me look dumber. It reminds me of how an old coworker told me not to feel the need to prove my intelligence to a manager after she watched an interaction we had- and how since she herself didn’t. She was also called dumb by someone I considered a friend after he watched an interaction of her being berated and just taking it from the boss. And she’s not...we’ve had countless conversations and become sort of close. We have a couple things in common besides the obvious narc upbringing part. Anxiety. Overactive brains or brains so overactive I am not in touch with reality. Or not they’re (other people’s) reality. The common agreed upon views and behaviors -and I can pretend pretty well but it makes me lose respect for myself...like I’m sacrificing my personality to be called normal. Or at least not...dumb, like tonight. Maybe I am...I’m about to share a thought process that I just had: I can hear them speaking in the other room, which is how I heard them playing their game of insults, and I was laying still on my way to sleep which is how I heard it: I was relaxed and still. And then I had the urge to lay over on my other side but then I thought to myself, they’ll stop talking about me (I wanted to know what else they had to say) if they hear me roll over and subconsciously they’ll know it was me and stop without consciously recognizing why. I paused and realized this is insane but I think things like this often. Is it dumb? Maybe. Abnormal? Likely. Also, a lot of dreams I’ve been having have affected they way I live in waking life as in the past some of them have appeared to save my life. I say appeared bc I know prophecy sometimes adheres to scientific findings on the subconscious. Either way, I’m in extreme survival mode right now and any dreams I have that spell warning, I am holding onto as I have no means of certain safety right now. So this caused me to cross compare recent dreams to reality to keep myself away from danger and it may add to an appearance of being strange but idk...On some level this label of being “stupid” could be true considering my life is in shambles. But with the dream example, this woman stabbed me and two women have come around me, the first being very similar to the woman from the dream who had a very specific appearance. Then with the second one I’m like good god I must just be losing it. A thought interjected- better be safe than sorry - remember what happened to your sister...referring to a series of dreams she had about being shot for before it happening. 

I know this could be explained by the environment she was in, but my anxiety -this or that’s “you never know, better to be safe than sorry voice” won’t let me forget. So my treatment of these likely innocent women appears bizzare from the outside although no one knows on the inside, I have a perfectly good “non logic.” If you’ve read this far...

He called me talkative. I really tried to make myself better by talking less. I really thought I gave some thought before answering others recklessly. This frustration is killing me.

She has ADHD. I have BPD and many symptoms of ADHD but not officially diagnosed. 
Any time she gets a hold of a computer or phone or anything she can use to communicate with the outside world, she LIES to her friends an/or finds men to talk to and sends them pictures.
She’s LIED to police and my mom saying I punched her in the legs because she had bruises (She was 10) 
She LIED again and called 911 because I took her doorknob away and said she “didn’t feel safe”
She’s LIED to her friends through text that I let her party all night, I’m abusive, we beat her and call her names etc.
She LIED to her friends and told them she was kidnapped and didn’t know what to do etc.... ended up with 20 cops on my front lawn ready to fucking shoot me at 2am when I answered the door. 


She got around parental controls and made a Facebook with all her info like school and city etc made public, then found a man to talk to and he said he lived near us. She then told her friends he was going to kill her and started yet another shit storm with police.

Now, she’s been at her grandmas for 2 days and I thought they were bonding but nope she’s been on an old iPad on Instagram messaging a guy and exchanging nudes! Her best friend texted me this morning with a whole bunch of screen shots. 

This makes me so sick and feel like such a useless waste of skin. I can’t even keep her away from online predators and she keeps running toward the fire I’m trying to protect her from. I’m terrified she’s going to get kidnapped or raped or murdered or all fucking 3. 

She reminds me a lot of me when I was a teenager but I had really shitty parents. So that must be what’s wrong with her, I’m a shitty parent too right? I was raped, I was nearly murdered, I had friends die but still did dumb shit like hitchhiking and dangerous drugs.

I have 2 other kids, the youngest is 6 and she also has ADHD and a mood disorder. I can’t keep track of everyone... I also have a business and another part time job. It’s like I can see all this happening but I don’t know how to stop it. I just want everything to stop.",09Jun2020,1

152,"Our landlord just came over unannounced (or at least I didn't know about it, my mom might have known tho), so it completely took me by surprise. He wanted to check something on my balcony, so he had to walk through my room to get there.

My room kind of reflects my mental state.
If I'm not doing well, my room looks like shit, to put it nicely. I'm not a messy, but if I don't have the motivation and energy to do anything, I just can't clean my room and the trash piles up. I don't know if anyone else here can relate.

It was so humiliating to have him walk through piles of clothes and trash. He said it was fine, but I felt horrible.
Seeing how uncomfortable this made me really felt like a slap in the face. I don't really mind that much if my room is dirty, since I'm usually the only one who sees it. I don't have friends over and my family members don't spend much time in my room either + they're used to it by now.
But this opened my eyes. I already knew that I had to change before, but now I want to do it even more.

The sad thing is, that my mother doesn't know about my depression, like at all. There are soooo many signs, but she just doesn't see them. I don't have the guts to tell her, I just kinda wish she finds out on her own. If I told her, she probably wouldn't believe me.

And no, I'm not gonna tell her, at least not right now. I still have to come to terms with myself and it was very hard to even admit it to myself. I've also talked to my friends about it, but not in much detail. But we're slowly getting there.",09Jun2020,1
153,"My uncle tried to commit suicide for the second time and I suffer with depression too but I don't understand how a person can come back from such a thing even once never mind a second time.... Pills again. The same cousin of mine who found him the first time, found him the second time. I'm so angry that he didn't feel like he could talk to anyone... Whatever demons are getting him down clearly haven't been resolved but as a family member, how must I now trust when he says ""I feel okay"". You never know what's going on in another person's mind and if you can't rely on their word to be honest then how can there be trust? I get that when depression drags me into my hole - that from down there- it DOES look like there's no coming back... no solutions while also romanticising the past because it was 'so much better' just because it's known. And i feel like instead of this ordeal bringing us closer it's honestly just putting up more walls and creating wedges of gaps in our family. I tried reaching out to my cousins again like last time, and I got minimal replies. I so wish to be closer to them. Why can't we talk about the serious things that matter? Like ""how did you feel finding your dad again for a second time?"" I don't expect the conversations to just begin there but at least have an interest in your family members, like I do. I get that everyone has their own lives and we all busy but we MAKE TIME FOR THE THINGS THAT MATTER. Family matters to me. I feel very all over the place at the moment and this post shows that but I just gotta get it out there somewhere, not everyone can afford therapy.",09Jun2020,1
154,"I posted here two weeks ago to let folks know about a podcast I decided to start with a friend after nearly a decade of battling with anxiety. I felt like it was high time that we stopped associating battling anxiety with weakness and, in fact, it actually shows strength to publicly admit that, shockingly, we aren't perfect.

so all the guys you’ve ever talked to have treated you like shit and disregard your opinions and morals making you think that’s the only way a guy can treat you; the ‘right way’. 
you’re scared to offend any person in the slightest now, in fear they’ll leave or get mad and want nothing to do with you. you bend your morals and let their opinions have power over yours, because you’re not on their level. even if they’re being racist or sexist, you shut up. 
all they want is your body, which makes you feel desirable but not in the way you want, and even when you fold because you can’t say no to them, you feel they get tired with your body. is it not good enough? yet still u give them what they want, just wanting them to change, looking for an ounce of love and validation.  afterwards feeling lonely and sad, which you can’t talk to them about because you don’t have any kind of emotional bond with them. yet you can’t change this cuz you’re too afraid of them getting mad at you for wanting more out of the relationship. as long as they’re happy your feelings don’t matter. what’s wrong with me?",09Jun2020,1

He just started yelling at me that my depression is me and my mom's fault. Later on I told him I think I need medical help because these are serious medical conditions. I told him that I can't force myself to do anything every single day. He started shaming me and started making me out as some sort of druggie.

163,"My mental health issues have always been diagnosed differently by everyone I’ve seen throughout my decade of (on and off) professional help. I even sought out studying psychology in my honors high school and college course to help myself better understand. I’ve found several philosophies and religious knowledge to implement into my life to help provide my consciousness with better structure. Through these things, I’ve found my self-help to often be better than the professional help I’ve received. 

I have no interest in taking any pharmaceuticals, and so for the latter half of said-decade I had seen solely counselors, therapists, psychologists, etc.. Many of these people have made me feel worse rather than better and pushed me in all the wrong ways. It’s really turned me off to continuing to seek out professional help. 

I still don’t know exactly what is wrong with me though. I feel like I have a mild form of a large number of things. And that’s how I had been diagnosed in my childhood as well. I wonder if I really do need specific labels to help define what is wrong with me. 

Basically this post comes down to what the title says. Do you guys think it’s okay for me to continue to search for my own personal understanding? Or should I continue to try to find some professional help that I can feel comfortable with?",09Jun2020,2
164,"Okay so, Im 17 years old, female, havent been (or so couldnt) to a therapist. I have a hard time remembering the past, I am an introvert and couldnt do anything without the other's help. I am afraid to say what I feel to other because they would just laugh at me. I always criticize myself in everything I do and in what I am. 

Here is my story, ever since my first year in high school I felt something different about me. I used to love dancing, so I joined the dance club in our school. But for some reason, I just broke down. I just cried in the corner saying ""I couldnt do it"" over and over again. I could see schoolmates younger and older than me looking at me and whispering to each other. Though I quit the club, I was still getting called and asked to join them to perform during school events. While dancing, I was getting teased by a group of guys in my class. 

Then in my second year, I developed panic attacks but it felt like it was just an excuse to avoid speaking infront. Because I can do it voluntarily back then. I would always be afraid to speak up, talk to others (even to my classmates and teachers), and always think that Im not good enough.

Then in my third year, I began having suicidal thoughts, crying in bed, giving up on the things I loved, thinking people are judging me, lost hope, and just do whatever is there. My panic attacks became worst that it wasnt even voluntary. I didnt know how this happened to me or even when it started. I was an active student back then and now I didnt even care anymore. But I still want to have high grades so that I can show it to my parents. I didnt take care of myself (which became a habit until now), thinking that Ill die soon.

Then in my fourth year, I realized that my classmates were ""using"" me. I couldnt say no to others especially when I know that I could do it. Then one day I realized that my friends doesnt talk to me or listen to me like they used to. Because of that I had some breakdowns (or so I thought). Everything is now settled. Then one time, (I dont remember what caused it) I broke down at home infront of my family, which I avoid doing. I bit myself until it bled, scratched my skin until I got wounded and keep on saying ""I give up, I give up"". They ""tried"" to comfort me but in the end I could hear them laughing outside of the room. And the next day, they keep on teasing me. And so, the exam for our senior year, I just didnt care and failed it. I didnt care anymore. While people think about their goals and dreams for the future, here I was thinking ""it doesnt matter, Ill die before it happens"". 

After that, I switched schools and stopped dancing.

Then in my first year in senior high, we had an open forum. I told a bit of my story then the next day my teacher said, ""teenagers nowadays think they are depressed but infact, they are just sad and just use the term ""depressed"","" then looked at me. Since then I keep thinking to myself, am I just sad? Is there nothing wrong with me? Am I just fooling myself? 

Throughout highschool, I always think lowly of myself that I will never be like that and that. That whatever I do, its bad. I did what others say, yet it still feel like its not good enough.

171,"I used to dislike people that flaunt their mental or relationship issues in public but since I  don't really have anyone to talk or vent to and no one really knows me here. I don't know how to start but here goes...

I was raised up by our family maids instead of my parents since they both had full time work and the maids changed every 1-2 years. So, not a good upbringing and to top it all of, my only sister was sent off to boarding school when I was 6. I was a bit closer with my grandparents that lived with us since they were retired but my grandmother was my father's step mother and she wasn't that close with the rest of the family except me but when my grandfather died when I was 10, my grandmother moved out because her daughter (From her previous marriage) was getting remarried and that left me with no one in the house except the maids.

In terms of friends, I had  a few close ones when I was a bit younger and none in later years as we grew distant.  I went to a school where my father worked as the principal and I was given exceptional treatment from both my peers and teacher alike and the bar and standards were set so high for me that I cracked under the pressure and while my sister was doing out outstandingly good, my scores we  below average. My father was always proud of my sister but always disappointed in me, though he never showed it. I started hating school so much that I used to fake illnesses whenever I got the chance.

I was 12 when my mother and I had to move away from our town due to her getting transferred at work. The new school that I was admitted to was a fancy, high class school and since it was so foreign to me, I hated everything and my classmates didn't like me too because of differences and how shitty I was with my studies. I started daydreaming to get away from life and that worsened into maladaptive daydreaming.

My mother later invited a religious priest of sorts and she later claimed I had ""spirits"" inside me and my mother bought it up. It later lead to beatings and abuse after she also claimed that I was a ""satanic"". My relationship with my family was the worse it had ever been since they disliked me or maybe hated me at that point. The whole thing finally ended after a year but the whole ordeal was too much for my 14 year old to deal with and I'm still negatively affected. But the relationship has healed though not fully healed.

At the age of 15, we moved back to our home but I didn't like that the town of my birth anymore as it had changed so much. I learned how to smoke cigarettes from our maid as it helped with the stress and developed addiction to cigarettes. Then I later moved on to alcohol... I've had a few girls in my life but my introversion always messed things up.

Now at the age of 18 and I don't know how to deal with my past, it's effects in the present and further effects. I can't get a therapist or a psychologist as there aren't any from where I'm from. It sucks living in a sh\*thole.

173,"PRETEXT: This is a throwaway account.

When I say my family, I specifically mean my mum and sister. It’s not anything specific they do, but we are a clash of personalities (to sum it up, they’re extroverts and I’m an introvert). They don’t really understand my need for alone time, and both of them are neurotypical meaning they don’t understand how I think. I’m on the autism spectrum, but I am capable of copying how a “normal” person acts. It’s a common trait in female autism, despite the lack of studies done on it.

I don’t like being in the same room as them for long periods of time because I’m always hyper aware of how they breathe and any sounds they make (sensory overload). I feel uncomfortable as well, just generally because I don’t trust them as people. (Again, I don’t know why.) My sister doesn’t get my needs for certain things to be a certain way and absolutely no other way, because she doesn’t get that it overwhelms me despite me trying to explain it to her (she’s ten). And I don’t mean aspects controlling other people’s lives, I just mean everything has to be arranged a certain way or the thought stresses me out and I can’t focus on anything else.

What I mean by the fact they cause my anxiety, is the fact that I can’t let my thoughts run freely around them without fear of them commenting on something. I tend to lash out, and while I know I shouldn’t, I’d appreciate it if my mum tried to look deeper than “teenage hormones”. Comments like that just make it worse as I repeatedly self-harm on both my wrists and thighs. No one knows.

For some reason, my dad doesn’t annoy me in this way. I’m perfectly comfortable with him in the room and can function just fine. I suppose it’s down to the fact he hardly fidgets and is quite a quiet person, like myself. (He’s also an introvert and suffers from anxiety himself.)

My parents are divorced, and due to quarantine I’m at my mum’s semi-permanently. I see my dad about once a month for a weekend, although pre-covid I would see him every other weekend. He has to live over an hour away for work.

Being in the same household with my mother and sister overwhelms me, and I feel like I have a huge lack of privacy. I have my own room, but due to my autism I have certain needs like having to pace constantly to process my thoughts. My room isn’t big enough for that, so I usually do it in the living room as my sister watches stuff on her laptop in her bedroom and my mum is always busy elsewhere. When they do come in the lounge I try to contain my annoyance, because obviously I don’t own the room, but my sister likes to watch lots of American YouTubers. I mean this in the least offensive way possible, but the sound of certain strong American accents really get on my nerves. I wish I could help what sets off my sensory overload. I feel selfish that I just want them to let me have the lounge to myself so I can pace in silence, as I can’t focus with certain types of background noise that I haven’t specifically picked out.

SUMMARY: I didn’t really know how to word this, but I guess a summary is I live in a house with two extroverted neurotypical people and it’s hard for me to find privacy to digest my thoughts as both an introvert an autistic person, causing me to experience anxiety. 

Any advice?",09Jun2020,1
174,"Long story, TLDR: I had an episode of psychosis in front of a bunch of people I kinda knew and a girl that I admired deeply and destroyed my reputation among all of them. How do I move on? Should I try to repair things with them at all? Just cut my losses and find more people? 

I began working for a tutoring company around July 2018(the timeline is kinda important) and I worked there for about 6 months until December of the same year. I didn't realize it at the time, but I put on a very fake face for towards the people that worked there. I was never myself and I didn't really connect with anybody, but to them it seemed like I was being ""me"" the whole time. 

I left that December on amazing terms, offers to come back, all the bells and whistles. We all seemed to be friends, up until I left. 

Then the internal monologue took over and I fell down a dark path over the next 6 months. Contemplating suicide or running away from my life, not really understanding what was wrong with me and wondering all the time what was. I felt disconnected from the world and had troubles talking/connecting to anybody.

I should mention that I was a heavy pot smoker(4 years, daily) with a family history of schizophrenia.

May 2019 - It was at this point that I moved home and realized that I had even been lying to my parents about the person I was. Since we had lived apart, I could be their bright and shining son on the weekends when I visited, but this dark and depressed person back in my apartment. When I moved back they treated me in the bright way, but I hated that. 

We're now in June/July of 2019, 6 months after I left the tutoring company, I'm living at home, and I'm on the edge of control. At this point I still didn't think ANYTHING was wrong. I thought that's just how life was, shitty.

I stopped smoking pot(burn out) and things really started to get fucked up in my head. I started losing my grasp on what was real and what wasn't. 

June/July 2019 - I get a text from my old boss at the tutoring company, ""Hey! We need help to get through the summer, would you want to come and help us?? You'd get paid of course, and we'd all like to see you!"" In my head I say something like ""Cool. Money."" I didn't feel like I knew this person I worked with for 6 months or the place I was agreeing to go to. It was just ""Cool. Money."" 

When I get there, EVERYBODY gives me this wonderful greeting, ""Hey such-and-such! It's so great to see you! How've you been!? We miss you, how's life!? Remember when...?"" 

I had no idea who these people were and why they liked me so much. I felt out so of place, but they were all so nice. Some really fuzzy/faded memories came back and I could remember who they thought I was. So I tried to act out that person, it ended in catastrophe. 

A girl had begun working there in the 6 months that I was away and she seemed to be into me, but I had all this anxiety about opening up, talking and just being me in general because I had never been me. I should've seen the signs, but this was when I had my first ever episode of psychosis begin(undiagnosed but I was spot on for most, if not all, of the symptoms). It lasted about a month or so.

It's an hour drive to work there and I cried on the way one morning because I was sad, then the next day I cried because I was happy. I started having delusions, thinking that people were talking about me whenever they spoke. Secret messages were being sent to me by way of some small gesture. I lost all control of my actions and began to just say whatever. I couldn't actively tell anybody anything of substance about myself, but I couldn't stop talking/lying. Imagine manic depression, with a side of delusion. 

I started dating that girl(if you could call it that), but couldn't stop the delusions even outside of the work setting. I thought she was sending me secret messages when we were sitting across from each other just talking. We went to the same college and one day I saw her car, I waited for her to come out(stalker much?) and told her that I thought we should take the next step, whatever that step is. Mind you, I had only known her for 2 months or something ludicrous like that. She said yes that night, and the next day she sent a text saying no. She still worked at the tutoring company and I had this unsettling feeling that word was passed around about how crazy I really was, and how I put on a face at work.

Everything stopped the day she said no and I felt like I woke up all of a sudden. I looked back over the 2 months and was very confused about what had just happened. I didn't understand what I had been doing or why I had been doing it.  It was all so strange and unsettling after it all. I realized I wasn't in control and things could've been a lot worse. I read that episodes of psychosis end a lot of the times with the cops being called, and I wouldn't have blamed the girl for doing that. This happened in August of 2019. It was an ugly 2 weeks of me trying to keep things going with the girl, or start things again because I didn't understand what happened, but I stopped eventually.

I stayed in contact with one other person(one that I confided in about the girl) from the tutoring company for a few months, but I can't seem to shake the feeling that they have a very skewed perception of me and being around them makes me feel uneasy.

Outside of my insanity I really do admire the girl. She was open, honest, empathetic, and independent. She hit on a lot of things that I look for in a girl. I tried to open a dialogue with her via text in May of 2020 but to no avail. Upsetting, but understandable.

I'm doing infinitely better today. Taking care of mental health, no more drugs, meditating often, opening up to people, making friends, building relationships, being vulnerable. You know, just being me.  

It's been almost a year since it all started, but it still hurts. Is it normal to still have an event like this on my mind more than 3 times a week? Sometimes a few days in a row it'll come up.

I guess I'm asking how do I live, knowing that there's a group of people out there that has a perception of me that's so fucked up it physically hurts me to think about it? Don't think about it? Therapy? How do I consolidate this web of shitty memories and actions? I'm ashamed of it all, and quite sad I ruined so many relationships at once.

Side note, ever think the girl would give me a second chance to get to know her? 

Last thought, this might be me just writing for therapy. If you made it this far. Thanks for taking the time, this took me 2 hours to write.",09Jun2020,2

And to make sure I wouldn't chicken out, I even stated that my mood and mental state is the reason for the apt. No backing down now. Although I'm getting VERY nervous when trying to find the words and questions to bring up when I get there.

Also I sat down and had a long heart to heart with my mom. It was nice to really voice how I've been feeling and how I feel like she doesn't hear me when I try to come to her. She was very supportive for once.

Either way, I wanted to make a mini update, and to say that what's really helped is reading through other people's posts on here. I don't feel like I'm all alone in this.",09Jun2020,6

180,"I've been experiencing MH problems for as long as I can remember. First they diagnosed me with Depression at 16, then Bipolar at 17 and now at 21 I have a revised working diagnosis of BPD (which I'm really unsure about that being the sole cause of my issues) + they gave me this working diagnosis after 50 minutes on the phone, like what??.

I've always been paranoid but recently since moving to a new area the paranoia in almost everything has intensified, I've always heard white noise or intermittent voices but these are getting more frequent. 

I'm getting more and more restless and agitated by not knowing what's going on + just in general, I'll wake up agitated, it's a horrible feeling.

I know that certain behaviours would be in keeping with BPD so I'm not saying I dispute it entirely I just know I have both episodic and chronic issues with mood (and impulsivity for example) and they play out in different ways.

I'm also on two different antipsychotic meds and several PRN meds I just feel they're putting a wet paper towel on a cut.

In particular, practical steps to follow if interactions go south, how to set boundaries and deal with the fallout, how to think about mental illness and relationships you can realistically have with someone who doesn’t seek treatment, etc.

Based on what I’ve witnessed, I’m fairly certain my boyfriend’s sister (30sF) has BPD, though it’s undiagnosed because she refuses any kind of treatment. However, she often has episodes of paranoia, anger, emotional manipulation, threats, etc. Sometimes she’ll call him 15+ times in a row until he picks up, and then tell him how he can’t trust anyone or that his closes friends are narcissists and that he has to cut them out of his life. Often times she’ll just go on religious monologues for hours. This past December she was so paranoid that all men in her life were trying to hurt her that his parents (whom she lives with) asked him not to come home for the holidays, because they were afraid of what she might do if she saw him.

I really want to find ways I can support him or give him the tools to support a better, healthier relationship with her, but I know I’m out of my depth here.",09Jun2020,1

197,"Hi,

I'm currently 19 - when I was 14, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and social phobia, but I think my less than stellar mental health predates that diagnosis by a long time.

A few months ago, I was scrolling through TikTok and started coming across videos concerning childhood trauma. One of the indicators is extremely little memory of ones childhood. I got to thinking, and I have almost nothing from before I was 8. I have some little fragments, but nothing larger at all.

My mom will talk about memories that she has, things that my cousin (who is five days older than me) remembers, but I'll have no recollection. I don't remember going to the beach with my grandmother, or the yearly zoo trips with my cousins. I barely remember my brother being born when I was 8. The memory is there, but it's so foggy and so broken up that I don't even think it counts as a memory. I'll see pictures that I am in, but can't tell you anything about that day because I don't remember.

It freaks me out that I can't remember being a kid. My parents aways fought, and eventually broke up - I've always known that their fighting affected me, but I didn't know that it was bad enough for my mind to almost totally erase it.

I dunno, just wanted to vent about it I guess",09Jun2020,2

My mom called an ambulance, but I calmed down until they came and I dropped to 120 bpm. I went to hospital where it was said I only had a panic attack and I shouldn't worry about it. The doctor gave me some magnesium to take for 2 months. I barely slept that night altough I somehow falled asleep. I started to forget about it since I could sleep pretty well because of the magnesium. Altough a few months later I started having panic attacks again. Until now I got panic attacks from being scared of my bpm, chest pain and breathing. My problem is that I get them once on a few days or once in a month, altough I get them only at night when I try to sleep. I am not scared of dark, but I am simply scared when I go to sleep. My panic attacks intensify when I am tired because I am thinking I might feint, altough I never didn't. I just can't get through. I don't want to worry my parents since they only calm me down once, but doesn't help on long term. I even got a cold this period and I was very scared if I have coronavirus(altough I had no symptoms from the virus). Now I am scared if I hear of somebody having strokes or heart attacks.

I also tend to be really hard on myself if I mess something up and it completely shifts how I see myself. For example, if I mess up a recipe in the kitchen, it's really hard for me to just say ""even professionals make mistakes"" -- I tend to instantly label myself as a terrible cook instead.

Since elementary I’ve been bullied about my head and very large forehead , I played with a couple of hairstyles until probably sophomore year until I just cut it flat to see how it would look. Didn’t like it at all and showing up at high school like that was a nightmare. I have developed a somewhat anxiety or fear of showing my hair , so I started to wear durags. Since junior year I’ve been wearing a durag everywhere only really taking it off to shower sleep and sometime I get some exercise with it off. I am freshly 20 now. But I really am seeking a way to get over this problem I have because I fear that it will dig me into a very deep depression hole. I am a fit guy ,6 feet , I attract what I want but they are  are turned off by the fact that I always have something on my head. I have a lot of self love but I also have no faith in myself when it comes to removing the durag because I feel like it has become a part of me in a way. But I know it is not the way. Not professional and not attractive. 
I feel trapped by this insecurity and have even thought about ending myself because of this insecurity. Insecurities are deadly. Don’t want to talk to close ones about it because they’ll make a small deal out of it , and in fact it is the contrary.

203,"
Backstory - my husband has been difficult the last 3 years as (IMO) he hasn’t dealt with the grief from his moms illness/death and his obsession with cleanliness kind of spiked. 

Both are frankly encouraged by his very intrusive extended family. To note, NONE of the other moms in his family work full time, with hours a day spent cleaning. I don’t have the time for that or the desire. 

To note, when his mom got sick his erratic bursts of anger concerned me, and I tried to enlist family and now ex-friends to encourage him to get professional help. They quickly called him, accused me of lying and trying to “kick him while he’s down”.  They stopped their accusations after I recorded him a couple times but didn’t apologize or speak to him.

I’m the significantly higher earner in our house, which is reflected also in my work hours and stress. During this (ongoing) time WFH  my workload has spiked and not dropped; while he’s been partially furloughed. We’re both WFH; me 6 days a week and him 1-2 days a week and in the office one.  I’ve learned that a “workday” for him consists of going in late, taking a 2+ hour lunch; and leaving early. 

He’s able to dedicate about 35-40 hours a week to cleaning as a result and it’s still not enough. Based on his job, he’s able to fuck off for hours a day and clean on his employers dime but I can’t. I’m in meetings and having tight turnaround deadlines most of my day. 

I just got dinged by my boss, who tells me people have approached him bc they always hear him screaming at me to clean in the background. It’s disruptive to the meetings I’m leading (not to mention embarrassing that dozens of people hear I didn’t mop the bathroom floor; that I’m a lazy ass who doesn’t work, etc) but they’re concerned for my well-being. 

I just got a call from my kids’ principal, who tells me she got a call (presumably from my husband) demanding she move my kids out of gifted classes next year so that they have more time for housework; and that the kids’ “messy” rooms mean they’re not smart enough anyway. 

He’s freaking out about returning to the office FT in a few weeks as hell have less time to clean.  

This is not sustainable. How do I get my husband to get some help. 

TL;DR: My husbands obsession with cleaning is significantly disrupting our life and I can’t figure out how to make him get help.",09Jun2020,1

210,"In Year 1 or Grade 1 whatever you call it on your country, I had friends and a best friend. About 2 months later a new girl joined. Somehow she became best friends with my best friend, until one day, I was alone all playtime and lunchtime.

My best friend didn’t like me anymore, my friends didn’t play with me. I was alone ever since that new girl joined the school. I don’t know what happened. It had to be her. Either everyone thought she was cool, she spread rumours about me or, everyone doesn’t like me anymore.

In Year/Grade 4 my anxiety had gotten worse. Another new girl joined, and she had the same name as me. She’s the tallest in the class and she’s quite bossy too. I was replaced AGAIN. BUT WITH SOMEONE WITH THE SAME NAME AS ME.

That’s when I got a teddy bunny called Snowflake but then I changed it to ‘Angel’ because back then I watched My Little Pony a lot. Ever since I got her she’s been my stress reliever and she helps me cope with my autism somehow.. she’s magic


That’s also when I got a social media and then eventually got harassed on there and my life was ruined again but I’m not going to talk about it because the people who harassed me apologised and they would get attacked for no reason if I mentioned their names.

Not just the people at my school made my life worse, the actual school ruined it.


If you’ve been to a public school you’ve probably known somebody who’s I don’t know, autistic or disabled or something and if you have you’ve probably seen a staff member with them.. Well I’m one of those kids but the thing is. I don’t have a staff member to help me get along.

I’m not really going to talk about it because it’s nobody’s business and everyone’s gonna talk about how bad my school is so.. yeah.

So you can probably tell I’ve been living in a dumpster metaphorically and what makes it worse is the fact that I’m autistic and I’ve got nothing but my bunny Angel.


I’m 11 this year on August 1st, and yes I’m young. So does anyone have any advice? Because usually when I tell people how I feel bad things happen so the last time I told somebody was a year ago or something. Thanks",09Jun2020,2
211,"I have a radical hypothesis that runs counter to countless therapies I've encountered in my 30 years of major depression: The effective treatment for my depression would have been for my dad to stop beating me.

I was given meds for ADD when I was a kid. The pills did not have the intended effect of making me prioritize schoolwork over sitting and thinking about how I could avoid getting beaten up when I get home. It did not occur to the doctor that maybe my lack of focus on schoolwork would have been improved by my dad not beating me.

When I was 12, I tried to kill myself. Some people silently watched me in my hospital bed for a week and then they gave me a prescription for some kind of medication, I don't know what, and sent me home. The medication did not make me stop wanting to kill myself to escape getting beaten. It did not occur to any of the hospital staff that maybe my suicidal thoughts could be stopped by my dad not beating me.

As a teenager, I was given one depression med after another. None of them ever made me feel fine about being beaten. It did not occur to any of these doctors that maybe I would be less depressed if my dad stopped beating me.

Then I was sent to cognitive behavioural therapy where I learned that the reason I feel awful when my dad beats me is because I think about it negatively. I had all kinds of side-effects from the meds, but CBT was the worst thing I experienced. I come to therapy in awful pain and feeling worthless from being beaten, and then forced to sit through a semantic argument about how illogical I am to feel worthless. At no point did it occur to the therapist that I would think more positively if my dad stopped beating me.

In adulthood, I continued to be put on every anti-depressant under the sun. Nothing ever made a dent in my depression. Then one day, my boyfriend brought his friend over to my apartment. I had moved some of my furniture in my apartment. For a reason I still don't understand, he thought I should have asked him to help me move the furniture and he was furious with me that I had done it myself. He and I went into my bedroom while his friend waited in the living room. He yelled at me with a lot of ""Fuck you, Bitch!"" and made a lot of physical threats (that he did not act on). When he was done yelling, I came out of the room, wracked with guilt that I was such an awful person that I made him so upset, and ashamed that I was so stupid that I didn't even understand what I had done so wrong.

His friend was sitting there with his mouth open in shock. With his eyes wide in confusion, he asked me why I let him yell at me like that. Wait a minute, was he...was he saying that my boyfriend was wrong for treating me like that? That I wasn't the one who was wrong for making him treat me like that? This was such a radical new idea. My mind was blown. 

After that, I stopped dating men who yell at me. I stopped hanging out with friends who put me down. I also quit a job where people were yelling and blaming a lot. My depression went away for the first time in my life, at the age of 34. That was 4 years ago and it's been gone since. When I feel it start to come back, I ask a friend for a hug or talk to them about it and nowadays these are friends who care and don't put me down. It fricking works!

That one guy who I met once simply pointed out to me that I shouldn't be treated that way and he cured my depression when decades of therapy and countless medication could not. Why why why does mental health treatment work like this? When you go to a doctor with a poison knife sticking in you, they remove the knife. They don't give you Tylenol and teach you to think differently about being stabbed and then send you home with the poison knife still sticking in you.

I'm thinking so much about this with the BLM movement. I am not Black, but this makes me wonder how many Black people are being given ineffective therapies for mental health problems when the real cure they need is for racism to stop.",09Jun2020,4
212,"I apologize for making this a long story. English is not my first language. I hope people can understand my post.

I came from a typical Asian family, where ""love is what you do, not what you say"" and ""emotions are useless when you face challenges in life""

My father was never weak in my memory. He is logical and rational on EVERYTHING. I remembered he was diagnosed with stage-3 cancer, he chose not to tell the kids because ""they can't do anything about it other than being worried."" He supports me on all the things that he thought was essential, e.g. education, food, accommodation, physical health...etc. But if I wanted something more, like asking for a video game, I would have to negotiate with him through meeting certain requirements as a quid pro quo.

My mother had a tough childhood, but still managed to become the first person in her town to receive full scholarship for Uni. She majored in education and is currently a high school teacher. Although she seemed to have all the patience towards her students, whenever she was depressed or had negative feelings, she took it out on us kids unintentionally (I still believe that she did it unintentionally). I am the eldest child, ever since I could remember, she would let me know my grandma was making her life miserable, or my father was a traitor for putting his sisters' (my aunts) needs in front our family's...and so on. Sometimes when she thought she was underappreciated and tired, she would tell me that she wanted to leave this marriage/to kill herself, but was stuck here because we were her responsibility (I choose to believe that this is her way of saying that she loves us).

Don't know why I want to bring this up: I once faced a medical emergency while they were not home. I could barely stay awake, but still managed to tell the paramedics to send me to the hospital I usually go to. When my parents arrived to my bed, I first heard them telling me ""You're here because you ignore your health. You always sleep in very late. We have warned you already, you just didn't listen to us."" When they found out I need to do a surgery, my mother scolded me for not choosing the more high-end hospital that my family usually go for severe illness like this. I almost jumped off the window of my 9th-floor ward that night.

I guess, these made me feel like I'm a burden to them. Their behaviours rubbed down on me, only wired differently. I was very insecure emotionally, so I relied heavily on rationality and intellectual knowledge. Quoting famous people is way more easier for me than saying something out of my own mouth, I can even say that my words have no value if the concepts are not cited from a reliable source.  Whenever I judge people in my mind, I will later go back and hate myself on being subjective.

I don't believe in unconditional love, because ""people love you for the combination of your personality traits. These traits change throughout time, and when the changes become noticeable, that's the time people tell you that you've changed and leave you."" Which, in the case, is probably influenced by my father's ""quid pro quo"" method, I have to achieve something in exchange to make him show that he cared more than just keeping ""a daughter"" alive. Although I do have some friends who I can speak heart-to-heart, I nearly never told them any emotional burden. I cherish them really much and don't want them to dislike me for giving them too much emotional trash. Same to my siblings.

I used to have some problem accessing my negative feelings. I had insomnia for one whole year while preparing for the senior high exam (sort of like SAT, but for senior high) and had to use alcohol to put myself to sleep. During that time, my teachers told me I looked exhausted, but I couldn't feel anything and told them I'm totally fine. This problem was carried to my sophomore year in Uni. The timer ended, everything exploded, I fell into depression, struggling with suicidal thoughts and lost consciousness on the side of the road a few times for no physical reason. I was in therapy all the way until I graduated, and managed to grasp the doorknob of my negative feelings. At the time, I thought I also graduated from therapy.

Currently, I'm working abroad all alone. My life has become kind of lonely and yet in the same time, calmer and more stable. I'm not sure if I'm losing grasp of ""the doorknob"" or it's just that my life was too calm and positive to develop a negative feeling. During this period of time. I've met a bunch of new friends online by coincidence. They are entirely different from the friends that I would usually make, they always tell me word-by-word that they love me for who I am, even if I'm in a mess emotionally. I would always cry whenever I was told about this.

Last weekend, I was drunk alone in my studio. Lost all the memories during that time, but in the texts I sent to these new friends, I first had a mental breakdown, told them about my insecurity of no one loving me, told them how I planned to kill myself at 30. Then someone else used my account to speak to them, pretending to be my siblings, and then deleted all the parts that he/she said afterwards. The new friends told me that the person they've talk to didn't sound like me, knew a lot about me, and cared about me through all signs.

I suspected this person was either my other friends or myself, but I couldn't find any evidence of other people accessing my account. If this person was me, why would I do that? Am I developing multiple personalities or something? 

And I've also lost connection with some of my emotions again, just like my years with insomnia. I've talked to my sibling and friends to try to figure out who that person was, so I had to bring up my texts of emotional breakdown and insecurities. Other then telling me this person wasn't them, they all told me that they love me unconditionally, but all I feel from these words were numbness. The numbness and the unknown are terrifying. I don't know what to do other than run away from everyone I know. Every contact method was shut down by me other than this reddit post because I'm freaking myself out and had to get help.

I just don't know what to do anymore, what's going on? Can someone tell me, please?",09Jun2020,5

I’m in the process of switching medications and I could use some advice/anecdotes. 

I’m going from (Pristiq) Desvenlafaxine 100mg. To either Wellbutrin or Trintellix.

I have both anxiety and depression. The pristiq was great for the anxiety but not so much the depression. 

I’m wondering which medication option would be best for me. 
I’m concerned that a new medication would help with depression but allow for the heightened anxiety to return.

Any recommendations/anecdotes?",09Jun2020,2

218,"Two to three years ago I abused MDMA and went on a year long journey, starting with a two week comedown and the rest being a bunch of anxiety-related problems. Random things began to trigger my anxiety but all of the triggers only came into being after I'd had intrusive thoughts that they would.

The worst I had was when I would think about, watch or look at things I found ""cool"" I would get these *anxiety spikes*. This only began happening literally after I thought to myself ""wouldn't it be awful if these things that I find interesting or particularly cool triggered my anxiety?"" I think it's the idea of these things causing my anxiety that actually causes my anxiety to spike from time to time whilst interacting with them in some way.

I describe the anxiety spikes as random moments of **super-heightened anxiety** that last for less than a second, that are seemingly caused by a subconscious thought that occurs in reaction to random ""cool"" things.

They do not occur with all things that stand out as particularly cool to me, and they don't just happen automatically/immediately (sometimes it takes a second). I don't know what that subconscious thought is, neither do I know if it's actually a subconscious thought, I just know there's some kind of thoughts or brain activity I can feel going on that happen within the milliseconds before the spike occurs.

I somehow managed forget that any of the triggers even existed for a couple years, and they stopped affecting me. However, I recently suffered an anxious breakdown and the memories came back, somehow allowing for them to start affecting me again.

TW // self-harm



Recently I’ve been dealing with my own issues, I think I’m depressed right now actually. Idk anymore, but what I’m sure of is that my mental health is really fragile right now. I’m alternating between high and low moods rn. So I’m just trying really hard not to sink too much these past few days. I’ve been self-harming myself and I’m just trying to stop myself rn. 

My sister is also dealing with her own issues. She recently opened up to me about her self-harm, to which now I feel sick about. Due to me being overly dependent/ codependent on her, I tend to brush off how I feel and take on an emotional burden of being her therapist and being the reason she doesn’t kill herself. I think that this is toxic ? I’m not sure but it just feels so heavy, and I can’t risk my mental health like this anymore. I’m still dealing with past traumas from being her ‘therapist’. It’s also triggering my urge to choke myself, right now I just feel so low but I feel like I have to push this aside and make her happy. 

How can I tell her that I can’t deal with her right now? Like I don’t want her venting to me right now because of my fragile mental state.",09Jun2020,0

226,"I’m a woman in her mid-20’s who has dealt with anxiety since around 12 years old. The first time I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety was in college, about 5 years ago.
For the past 4 years, it has been getting worse and worse, to the point that I don’t know how to identify or define myself. 
I would say that up until 4 years ago I was more outgoing, a natural leader, eager to try new things, was putting effort into a social life. 

Now.... I instantly delete 90% of whatever I post on social media, having instant thoughts on the worst possible way it could be interpreted. I am quiet, and extremely hesitant to speaking to anyone. I have completely given up on caring about my appearance, mostly because I figured who cares how I look if I’m so boring. I have not taken or shared a picture of myself in over a year, and honestly I don’t want to see myself. 

Overall, I have a deep want to just disappear. For no one to think about or have opinions of me. I feel like I can never be like my peers that I admire, and would rather be basically non-existent. 

I constantly ruminate on even the smallest of social interactions. Like the other day whenI spent all night thinking about if the way I said goodbye to my boss.
It’s honestly overwhelming, and looking back on how I have changed makes me feel like even more of a failure.
I have started working with a therapist and psychiatrist, but have only had one appointment with each. I know it’ll get better, but right now is not easy.

Point of the story is until I was about 7 years old, my parents were in a toxic relationship being that by this point my dad was an abusive, alcoholic drunk, and my mom was slowing turning full lesbian. ( I don’t mean to offend anyone, I know it’s not a choice but the stories I hear from my mom and friends are iffy at best since she had 4 kids before she came out ) I would kind of get caught in the crossfire because as a child your emotions aren’t handled well since I’m only a kid and I would cry sometimes when he hit her or started arguing like any other kid my age would but in turn my father would beat the ever living shit out of me until I learned to stop like a trained animal. I remember him telling me to man up when i was getting beaten and when he told me to man up when I showed affection I put two and two together. Eventually I learned to just repress emotions so I don’t get hit to the point were my only personally traits are the lightheartedness and anger and it bled over  to the point where when my stepmom ( moms wife ) would go in to hug me my immediate instinct was to flinch. While I still have things like sympathy for people, I for the life of me just feel numb. No happiness, sadness, enjoyment.

230,"I feel that staying at home for 3 months because of COVID-19 has really messed with my mental health. I have been dealing with pretty bad anxiety for years but never in my 21 years has it been this bad. I'm a college student but had to move back with my parents because of the lockdown. My mother has bipolar disorder and yells and screams at my dad EVERYDAY so I'm stuck hearing all that noise (it doesn't help that we live in a small apartment). They have a pretty toxic relationship. I've lived in this toxic household my whole life. It was pretty normal hearing yelling as a child but as I got older it started to frustrate and annoy me because I was not able to focus on my school work at home and I wasn’t able to do well in school like other students. When I did leave to go to college I noticed I got better grades and my anxiety levels weren’t as bad. Ever since the lockdown it's been pretty tough listening to my mom screaming and yelling everyday. I think it's worse now because when I was younger, school pretty much took up the whole day and I wouldn't get home until 3pm. Since my parents are not working currently and I'm stuck at home all day I'm forced to hear yelling, sometimes for hours (as I'm typing this right now I'm hearing my mom yelling and crying in the kitchen). My mother is bipolar but she refuses to think she is so she doesn't take any medication. My mom is very hyper, get paranoid and gets mad very easily. She stresses the whole family out sometimes. Me and my siblings all deal with anxiety and my dad blames my mom for it because of all the trauma we've been through living with her. 

Currently, I don't know why but I've been having a lot of negative thoughts in my head and sometimes suicidal thoughts lately but the thing is I DO want to live, I love life, I love Jesus and I know I would never hurt myself and I feel like it's just my mind. I noticed this started happening after a health scare and I do remember freaking out for days. Now, some days I'm normal and I don't have any bad thoughts, and then the next I'm battling with my mind. I do try to ignore it and going outside helps a lot. Last week when I met with my friends for the first time in a while I noticed I didn't have any bad thoughts but I was socially awkward, I'm thinking it's because I haven't had any social interactions in awhile. I'm so confused because I've never experienced these thoughts before in my life. I'm scared of what I'm experiencing is permanent. Just reading the news or seeing things on social media about what's been going on about police brutality and coronavirus triggers my thoughts, pretty much anything that is sad or scary.

In my family, on my mother's side almost everyone have very fair skin while my father's side everyone have more typical Brown skin, I got my father's brown skin while my elder brother got my mother's light skin. All my life this has been pointed out to me, people make jokes at my expense, they praise my brother for being ""Handsome"" and ""Fair"" while people constantly call me black.

I used to drink lots of caffeine because at first, it made the anxiety come back, but now it faded and it doesn't work anymore.

It’s a weird situation that’s hard to explain and not many people I’ve explained it to fully understand what I mean. Trying is just as embarrassing as not trying and I don’t understand why. 

And even if he’s just scrolling on his phone, doing nothing productive, I feel embarrassed getting up and doing something. I have some hobbies, like bullet journaling, painting, baking, unsolved mysteries, and a couple shows that I watch, but I don’t want to do any. I am depressed and have anxiety which I think is something to keep in mind. I’ve always felt disinterested in doing things and often only do things so I can say I do things, but the embarrassment is relatively new. Has anyone experienced this before? Any advice? Thank you so much in advance!",09Jun2020,1
239,"Alot of the time, I dont feel like a real person, or like, a whole person. I spend days inside or in bed just not doing much because I dont feel real. Then I step outside because I forget that I'm a person and try to feel real by going outside but then I'm like, I still dont feel real. I've read about dissociating but I don't lose my identity I just dont feel....like a real person. 
Sorry this is messy and confusing I havent really thought alot about it just felt it...thank you and goodnight",09Jun2020,3

**Redditors: I'm trying a new format, so bear with me.**

Would you like to make a difference in the mental health community by talking about something that’s passionate to you? Send me a DM to learn more!

Hiya! My name’s CJ. I’m 21 years old. I’m a mental-health advocate and enthusiast from upstate New York. Also an aspiring writer and musician.   
I’ve been working on an informational book inspired by the American Psychological Association’s goliath of a catalog, the “DSM-5”. Both books encapsulate several known and some unknown mental health, behavioral, and other neurological disorders that affect how the mind perceives certain situations. However I wanted to essentially simplify it. 

**The book is called “Skies of Grey: Mind’s Eyes**”.

My format is designed to be concise and easy to read and understand. I personally have a short attention span so when I see a large wall of text I flinch and back away. With that in mind it should take less than 5 minutes to read each entry. 

**But CJ**, *I hear you asking,* **How can I help?**  
It’s simple! I’m looking for people who are willing to have interviews about a disorder they may be experiencing. 

* It’s 10 questions, so it shouldn't take long.
* It’s informal! No need for professionalism. 
* It’s all text based. Straight and to the point. 
* It’s anonymous. You can tweak whatever details you see fit, I will take particular quotes from the interview and throw them into each entry.

I am **NOT** accepting mental health interviews for:  
 Bipolar, Depression (Major/Minor), DID, and (C)PTSD.

All entries are available here : [https://pastebin.com/hc3UsS6y](https://pastebin.com/hc3UsS6y) 

Anything else is on the table! I look forward to hearing from you! Please stay strong and remember to take care of yourself, it’s a scary world out there and you’re not alone.   
Take care! 🖤

243,"These are more intrusive thoughts that come very randomly. I (22m) am a Burn Survivor (burnt on 75% of my body) and it's been almost a year since I got out of physical Rehab. The PTSD from the incident is definitely a struggle, but over the past 5 months I have experienced what I call flash-forwards (I have notmal flash backs of me being on fire, which is expected) which feel very real and they usually happen when I'm walking down stairs, holding/walking with a knife/scissors, when I'm walking under trees, drive a couple MPH over the speed limit, or almost anything involving even a small risk. 

I ""see"" myself falling while holding a knife and stabbing myself, falling down stairs &amp; breaking my neck, how it would feel &amp; where it would happen on my body, having a creaking tree branch fall on me, losing control of my car &amp; flipping, etc etc. These ""flash-forwards"" don't prevent me from doing things or makes me overly scared, but these are VERY invasive thoughts that fill me with anxiety right after like a normal flashback.  

Does anyone else experience anything like this? Has the PTSD or pain from being burned so badly messed up my brain receptors, making me notice &amp; play out every risk I come across? I'd love to hear you're experiences with anything similar to this, or if you've heard of this happening to anyone. Thanks and hope to hear you're opinion!",09Jun2020,1

245,"Hey all,

Obviously not asking for medical advice here, just wondering if anyone can help or provide names of some meds they think will help

I'm bipolar type 2, I'm on effexor 150mg in the morning, lamictal 100mg twice daily, and clonazepam 0.5-1.5mg at night for sleep (I have the .5mg tablets so I take what I need for that night based on my anxiety) 

Recently, I went through a hard patch so my doctor put my on a low dose (50mg) of Seroquel to balance my mood, so now it's balanced (after I told the doctor to up my effexor - I just moved to Ireland so I was suggesting the mg of effexor I was on before I moved over here which worked perfectly, and is now working perfectly again), and I've successfully come off it. However, if you know meds you know Seroquel makes you gain weight like crazy which it did for me.

Does anyone have any advice for this? I mean in terms of other medications? I've been on wellbutrin which made me lose a lot of weight but it only works for my depression for like a month then throws me off. Does anyone know of a med like it that can be added and helps with weight loss?

Ps: obv will be talking to my doctor about this in the end and seeing what she says, just thought I'd ask and see what options people have had",09Jun2020,1

247," **About me : M 22**  
 **So recently I've been having some really weird thoughts and idk if it's anxiety or fear or everything combined I'm incessantly worrying a lot  about my mother and sister whenever i try to relax or when I'm trying to  sleep i keep getting these thoughts where the people i don't like  (scums that i have encountered in my life ) are trying to have their way  with my mother and sister it's gotten so worse that this is the first  thing that comes to my mind when i wake up and i just can't stop it and i  try to be constantly busy in-order to avoid them and i never want this  to come true and I'm afraid of these thoughts and idk what to do.**  
 **I know that this would never ever happen and yet I'm haunted by these  thoughts in fear that it might somehow happen and they would get  violated or they would leave me for them .**   
 

**And I'm not a crazy person that believes in nonsensical stuff (ironic)  but the thing that makes it worse is The Law of Attraction (things you  think a lot happens whether you want it or not) and it has worked for me  so this just adds to my fear of losing them and something happening to  them and my sister is quite beautiful and she gets a lot of attention  from people and I'm just afraid for her.**  
 **I tried to introspect and confront these thoughts but it just left a bad picture in my mind so I'm here.**",09Jun2020,1

250,"there's an image i won't link here of a sketch of a man's face, the ""man in everyone's dreams"". ever since i first saw it, it makes me feel faint and panicky, to the point where i feel like if i keep looking i'll probably fall into a panic attack. 

something even more odd is that i usually have difficulty visualising things, but i can visualise the face quite clearly.

i was wondering if there's a rational explaination for this reaction? is there anyone else that has similar reactions to it?
