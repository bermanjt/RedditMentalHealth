0,"This is pretty hard to explain.

I have this thing - had it for years, I tend to mimic displayed thought patterns and characteristics of main characters in movies or TV shows I watch. I don't know why, but it just happens. I lose track of myself, I sometimes even disassociate and will firmly believe that I can think and execute actions as these characters. Be it a detective, a freedom fighter or something more sinister.

It's starting to scare me a little bit, because I don't know what this type of (assumingly abnormal) behaviour is or might be. 

I'm diagnosed bipolar and with general anxiety disorder. Could that have anything to do with it? I'm reaching out to the psychiatrists on here, pseudo or not. 

I'd appreciate any form of insight at this point. I have a psychiatrist, and I have an appointment with him in three days.

I just don't know what to make of this, and I'm terrified of whatever it is.

Thanks in advance.",20Aug2020,1
1,"I am in the US, in Florida.

My uncle lives with my grandmother and his father. Until a few months ago, he was perfectly healthy. I hadn’t visited my grandmother’s house for a while (at best I’d guess 3-5 months) and when I visited for the first time after that break, my uncle was completely different. I’d heard other family members saying that he was acting strange and wasn’t right, but I thought they were just misunderstanding him. However, when I visited for that first time, he was almost completely non verbal only groaning and making short weird grunts; what shocked me the most was as I was leaving, he turned to me from the door of his room, started tracing in the air with his finger in an incomprehensible pattern in some attempt to show me something. He nodded at me and stared me in the eyes and I just nodded back and smiled. 

Flash forward to today, I’m celebrating my little sisters birthday. He’s walking in and out of his room repeatedly, laughing at random times in silence, and making the same guttural grunts, but held out for a little longer. The only words I heard him say were “damn it.” Besides that he is completely non verbal.

I’ve still treated him the exact same during all this, but I can’t help the feeling that what I perceive as psychosis is going to lead to him hurting my grandmother and his father. I understand that’s kind of rude to imagine, but my mother feels similarly and we discussed that we no longer want my little sisters around him anymore because one of them said he bangs on their door and tries to get in their room in the middle of the night. His father owns guns as well, so this is not a good recipe at all. I’m very rarely worried or scared, but I’m very worried about him and what he could do. I’m mostly worried and upset that they haven’t seemed to put much effort into finding him help, and if he’s gone non verbal in a few months, what’s going to happen in another few months?

I have no clue how to even start looking for help for him, if this is gonna cost any money, or anything about this process. I’m looking for any help anyone can give.",20Aug2020,1

3,"Hello! I’m diagnosed with Clinical Depression - along with other diagnosis - that has brought me to a question I’d like to bring to this community.

As I write this, I am having feelings of massive euphoria. Like, I feel like I’m on top of the world, I’m having an amazing day, and almost a feeling of supremacy. It’s like nothing could ruin my mood and I’m so excited for..basically nothing. This has happened to me several, several times before between 2 times every 4-5 months. 

Then, when that euphoric state ends, I see myself at an all-time low. All of the symptoms that generally come with my disorder tend to linger within those next few periods of time until I end up on that euphoric high again.

I was wondering if this is a common thing that can happen with people who suffer from Clinical Depression, or if this is just something that happens with me. 

Thank you! Any feedback will be taken generously.",20Aug2020,1

7,"I don't know if this is the right sub. Im on hold with the samaritans but they aren't picking up. I live in the UK. I have one friend who I meet with a lot to do social distancing things with. My other friends don't bother with any of that stuff. They don't social distance, even during lockdown they were going to each others houses and having parties. I was cabin crew for years until March and so are all my friends. When I try and say that the fact that they are still flying means they need to be extra careful they laugh at me. 

One put a post on facebook earlier laughing about getting in a fight in the post office for not wearing a mask. Lots of people underneath where like ""oh so its your fault when we get a ""second spike"" lol, only joking!"" My best friend in the world keeps pushing me to come and visit (we are in different countries in the UK) but he's also not following any sort of social distancing, he's in and out of peoples houses all the time. When I said I was stressed still about covid, he laughed and said ""you must be the only person in the UK still worried about this!"" When I mentioned how upset I was over the facebook post he ignored it, and when I questioned why he was ignoring me, he said ""because I don't argue with idiots."" I have no idea if the idiot was the other girl or me, but I think it might have been me. 

I have lost contact with so many people because I am so scared that I'll learn more of my friends are treating it as a joke. But just walking back from town earlier I saw groups of people meeting up, hugging, not wearing masks. I feel like maybe I am being stupid, and maybe I'm being overly cautious when there is no need to be. 

I lost my job and my partner at the beginning of lockdown. I live by myself. I have no one to bubble with except the friend I mentioned earlier and she has a partner, and a flying job still so she is being careful. (She is also originally from a country that has handled this much better, and she is a bit confused by the reaction in this country.) I am so lonely. I want a hug more than anything else in the world. I feel completly isolated and insane. I am scared to go into shops because I just don't trust anyone anymore, but what if it is me? What if I am making myself miserable with all this social isolation and I didn't need to? What if I could have gone and seen my friend?",20Aug2020,1
8,"TLDR at Bottom of post 

So I made an appointment with a psychiatrist to discuss my mental illness. I haven't spoke with a psych for over a year.

For context: I've received mental help in the past but decided to stop seeking help because I didn't feel like I was being heard. I have a long history of abuse and mental disorder diagnoses ranging from BPD, GAD, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and Bipolar Depression (I've never gotten a clear diagnosis and every doctor i had came to a different conclusion.) I felt like receiving mental help was a lost cause and they all seemed more interested in cold prescribing me pills that exacerbated my already sensitive psyche. 

Now: So i booked an appointment a month in advance, scheduled to take time off of work so we can speak over the phone and was ready to start getting help again. I had one previous appointment OTP with a therapist 2 weeks prior to this appointment. He was very thorough and attentive and I felt like he truly cared. Fast forward to the appointment I just had. The psychiatrist called me (25 minutes late..i do understand they're busy but still) and we began speaking. I never spoke with him prior to this so he doesn't know anything about me other than what it says in his notes from my therapist. He asked me how I've been feeling, to which I told him about my anger issues and constant mood fluctuations. Not even a minute after talking with me he automatically wants to prescribe me Lithium and something else (didn't catch the name). He went on a 15 minute spiel about how he personally likes it and recommends it and how its been around for decades and yada yada yada. This immediately made me feel uncomfortable. I haven't even been properly diagnosed yet or talked with long enough to get a clear understanding of what is wrong with me and he already wants to throw drugs my way. I expressed to him after he was done that I wanted to speak with someone and get diagnosed first because I've had issues in the past with taking medication and that I take my mental health very seriously. He apologized and said that the appointment center will be contacting me about setting up a more appropriate appointment to get more into depth about my issues and go from there. 

I understand it's a psychiatrist's job to prescribe medication, but it scares me that he was so quick to prescribe me multiple medications without properly knowing anything about my condition(s). He just picked 2 meds I've never taken and said okay so take these, sound good? Even on my after visit summary he just put ""mood disorder"" in the description. Shouldn't he have a more",20Aug2020,1
9,I’ve been struggling with anxiety and overthinking a lot lately. I thought I could get through it on my own but it’s been almost two years and has only gotten worse. I want to ask for help to possibly get into therapy but I don’t know who to ask or what to say when I do.,20Aug2020,1
10,"Quarantine is probably one of the biggest wake up call for me. I never think that something isn’t right with me until I’m not distracted by the things outside my home. 

I’ve been seeing shadows since last year, but I can’t be sure when because my memory is a bit fuzzy trying to remember the first time I experienced symptoms. I always think it’s because of my eye sight, my parents thought that too. I have myopia and it has gotten a bit worse. Now I’ve experienced things like hearing my mother call my name. There is one time where I heard her call my sister name and my sister responded, I can tell it’s not them, it sounds distant or a bit far, and one time I heard my father call my name, he wasn’t home. Others like ringing in my ears, unusual nightmares, and intrusive thoughts, etc.

I’ve been researching the cause of this, not realizing they’re symptoms. I could be experiencing psychosis. But since I don’t want to self diagnose I just want to raise my awareness and get help. I told my dad about me seeing shadows and hearing things, and nothing else. To my surprise, he has it too, since he was a teen too. My research was helpful enough to notice the symptoms in him too, one of them is delusions. We both have the same symptoms but not the same delusions. So my thinking concludes that it could be an early signs of schizophrenia, it can be a genetic as well.

The only chance I got is my eye doctor, My mom made an appointment for me to get eye contacts. Like I said, I don’t want to self diagnose so I want to leave my diagnosis to a psychiatrist. 

I don’t know when I go to my eye doctor but since covid made things held back so I know I have some time. I want your thoughts on how can I tell my eye doctor of my symptoms and hope they’ll catch on and tell my mother that I need to be checked for my mental health. My mother is a bit of a karen so I don’t want her to think I’m lying",20Aug2020,1

14,"I'm under counseling and the care of a psych.  I really like them both a lot - more than any other's I've been client to.  But I suffer from issues that even after almost 5 years I don't know how to bring up.  They are astonishingly shameful for me personally, but these things keep ruining my life to the point that everyone's abandoned me but my family - and they can only handle so much of me from afar (and there's literally only two people left everyone else is dead - my mom just died last month and I cried and cried hoping she would take me with her).  I'm 49 and so unlikely to ever make any new friends.  I don't know how to talk about these things with anyone.  I totally hate myself for all my loser defects.  I'm currently diagnosed with PTSD and take quite a few meds, but I've only ever been able to talk about some of the things that go on with me.  I haven't worked in 6 years because I can't, under any circumstances, be around people.  But my psych doesn't know this because I haven't told them very much, and she keeps pushing me to find a job.  I just don't see how I could ever work again.  The last of my savings is dwindling fast and I fully expect to be homeless within a year.  This has literally ruined my excellent professional career and my life.  I suffered childhood abuses but as a young adult thought I had easily resolved them all myself.  I've spent my whole life trying to put a happy face on but over the last 20 years or so this monstrous thing has progressively grown, become stronger than me, come out and taken over my entire life.  I stay holed up in my home all day, all of my appointments are by phone and I have all my groceries and meds delivered because I can't be around people.  The days go by, I've missed the whole summer, I never know what day it is, the only thing that marks the passage of time are the various horror shows that I can't stop creating.  Even if I tried to work professionally again I could never get any references from the people I used to work with (they all hate me) if I wanted to put my resume out there.  Without references, I don't think it's possible to get a job in my profession.  But I'm nowhere close to any sort of condition to being able to be around people to work.  I've tried telling my counselor I can't be around people but many of the reasons for that remain hidden.  I just keep talking about my insane social anxiety and they think that's the biggest affect of my PTSD, but it's not by far.  I used to be a college educated professional who was good at my job today I can't organize my thoughts to even write this simple post.  I'm not married and neither have (nor ever want, children because I don't like the things).  But while I do love animals, I'm unwilling to take on a pet for my loneliness with the uncertainty I face in my future housing situation.  I'm not suicidal right now, but don't really see why I shouldn't be.  It seems like a very reasonable alternative to homelessness and loneliness.  My future is just going to get worse - there's no question about it.  I don't even support personal firearm ownership, but have been contemplating buying a gun.  It just seems like a much better option than becoming homeless, killed in a stabbing because I refused to give up a french fry to another homeless person.

20,"Title pretty much sums this all up but if you feel like reading all of this buckle up.

I've been out of work since March due to Covid. During my furlough I've realized the environment I was working in was beyond toxic and making my mental health (mainly eating disorder and anxiety) SO much worse. 2 weeks ago I decided I should finish my degree, I'm 3 semesters away from being done. With Covid everything is online. This was last minute so I didn't know if I would be able to get back in for fall semester and have financial aid/loans go through, but somehow by the grace of God they did. 

So now I'll be taking 6 classes starting next week. My job that I was already on the fence about will never work with my class hours, as well as they had cut me down $6/hour and 10 hours a week. If i went back it would be on a part time basis so that's even less hours and I would only imagine my hourly rate would get cut more too. This to me all wasn't worth it. So I put on my ""big girl"" pants and ended up getting a job at a barn (I've been riding horses 14+ years) and a hostessing job a couple nights a week. Both of these jobs start tomorrow and I'm beyond ANXIOUS and dreading them. I know it's normal to be worried but once you throw in shoddy mental health it becomes that much worse. Everyone in my waking life is like you're young, you're fine, who cares? 

Well I care. A) I'm going to be making a lot less money than pre-pandemic. B) this is all so new to me, while I've worked with horses, never at this barn and I've never worked in a restaurant before. C) Throw in 6 college classes when I've been out of school for a couple of years now. 

It sucks so bad because it's just like to them, oh if you don't like it just quit or just do this or that. Well no I can't just quit one of these jobs randomly because I do need income. And it's so not a good look to just up and leave a job. I'm beyond worried about how I'll manage my mental health in these upcoming weeks and it's like no one cares or gets it. I just look like an idiot complaining about 2 fairly simple jobs, but it's not that. It's the sheer exhaustion, the anxiety, the depression, the barely fucking eating so where is my energy coming from? It's awful and even though I have a new therapist I don't really feel supported at all anywhere. I wish people could just understand that something like this could be hard for me without making me feel like shit about being worried. That's really all. I just hope this stuff goes well because I don't know what else I'll do if it doesn't and I just wish people could be more supportive and understanding :(",20Aug2020,1

I’ve just got married. 
I love my partner, deeply. But I have been going through so much, childhood trauma and all that and we thought therapy would be a good idea for me- since I’ve also moved to be here with my partner. 

Problem is, we have been having a hard time adjusting. We have been lacking. 

I started therapy. Met my therapist, was the best one I’ve had so far. Didn’t even feel any attraction at first. She’s in her 50s. I’m in my 20s. Corona happened, been doing Telehealth. I’m quite literally alone, in another country. Started looking forward to our sessions a bit more than usual. 

Hit me like a truck about 3 weeks ago. I am attracted to this person and that’s fine. It’s normal. All good here. 

The next week, oh god. Nope, this is deeper. Don’t even know this woman. 

This week? The question am I falling in love with my therapist pops up. 

Panic before sessions, sweaty palms. 
Making sure I look snatched. 
I feel awful. I just got married. I love my partner. Always have and always will. This isn’t what that is. 

I think this is transference or whatever that thing is called. 

I am completely alone, my partner is always working- we have severe communication issues. I’m in another country. Literally not one friend. 

Am I attracted (which is normal, I’m a human being- even if I am married) or am I actually falling in love- or is my current situation making me have ‘transference’ as it was? 

Any advice here guys? What do you think? What’s the advice?

My girlfriend has been really helpful (I’m a male btw) and I decided to talk to my parents about what I’ve been feeling in hopes that they’d offer support and be willing to help me see a therapist. It was basically the most horrible, toxic conversation I’ve ever had. they just yelled at me, told me i don’t have an eating disorder because I’ve never said anything and I’m not fat (whatever that means, boomers), told me how screwed I am by writing about it on my med school applications, and accused me of fabricating my disordered eating behaviors. I was and still am so livid at them, I don’t even want to talk to them. I told them I need space but they’ve continued to text me. Today my dad sent me a text basically guilt tripping me, saying “how long will this go on, a month, 1 year, 5 years???” It’s been less than 24 hrs. He also said how hurt he is, that he wants to be able to talk, and that he thought we had a good relationship for the 23 years of my life (but I’m 24 lol). My dad and I have always been closer, my mom is basically the least empathetic person I know. The only words she’s said to me after the conversation have been rude and accusatory.

37,"CONTEXT ** We fled Afghanistan and came to Canada as a refugee almost 2 decades ago with my mom and brother. My father died in the sands of that godforsaken hellhole. We had a rough start here and were very poor. ** I can't forgive my mom for what she did to me when I was younger. She abused me and my brother for years and a few years ago, (thanks to me and my brother becoming financially and physically independent) my mom stopped abusing us. She would beat us up and mentally torture every day. I would be beaten for the stupidest things daily (e.g. getting violently beaten to the point of having a nosebleed and a black eye on the day of my 10th birthday because I asked my mom why I we weren't celebrating it, one thing I WILL NEVER FORGIVE HER FOR). We were poor and suffered immensely as children. I was violently bullied in school because I was awkward, had no social skills and looked dirty because I was poor. I still remember the other kids laughing at me because I smelled bad and had no lunch. I cry every time I remember those awful years, I would be bullied in school and come home just to be beaten and called names. I was 12 and wanted to die. All I wanted to do was fucking run away. I was so sad and the only reason I didn't kill myself was because of my older brother and a set of dirty legos my uncle gave me as a pity present that I played with all the time. My mom is now an old, frail woman that I fucking hate with every inch of my body and soul. I remember how I wanted revenge so badly when I was little on her but now I can't do it. I want revenge for those years of pain and misery. But I can't do it to her now that she's old. I still have that pain and trauma and I don't think it'll ever go away as long as I don't get vengeance for all those godforsaken years of hell. I have nightmares of my mom even to this day. I'm sorry if I sound pathetic or attention-seeking, I just want the nightmares and the pain to go away, I want closure.",20Aug2020,1

TL;DR: after surviving an abusive situation, you have two choices: use the pain to wallow, or use it to grow. You have complete control over the decisions you make. 

Sibling abuse is often referred to as the forgotten abuse, because what would in any other situation be categorized as unacceptable behavior is often explained away as a “sibling rivalry.” It’s easy to feel sorry for yourself, and let the pain wear you down until you feel like you just can’t deal with it anymore, but I’d like to share a message that I wish I had received a long, long time ago. 

Just to give you all a little context, my brother... well, let’s just say he left a lot to be desired. He tormented me throughout my childhood, and when I asked my parents for help they would once again start up the, “one day we’ll be gone and you’ll only have each other” speech. Occasionally when they were home and witnessed a diluted version of my struggles, they’d claim that I asked for it when I was just trying to stand up for myself. It felt like no one was in my corner and I spent a long time in a funk. 

As of late, I can feel myself starting to heal and grow from my experiences. The major catalyst for this was finally being able to distance myself from my brother and his toxicity. 

One day, though, while taking a shower of all things, I found myself in one of those moods again, where I was only focusing on the bad things that happened with him and the rest of my family. I sat on the floor and just let the water wash over me as I asked myself why no one believed me, why no one was in my corner, the usual. 

I don’t know what brought it on, but in the midst of my self-pity, I had a life changing realization; I had two choices. If you’re in a similar situation, these will apply to you. 

Choice 1: You can wallow in that pain forever, never find peace, and live the rest of your life knowing that they were able to drag you down and keep you there.

-or-

Choice 2: You let go of that burden, use the pain and experience to grow personally, break the cycle, and drive you toward success - however you may define it. 

You don’t have control over the past, you don’t even have control over most of your present, but the one thing you can control is how you react to a given situation. Don’t use your pain as an excuse to not grow. 

Repeating that has become somewhat of a mantra for me, and I hope that this serves as either a wake up call or a reminder for anyone going through sibling abuse. If you’re going through a similar situation and need someone to talk to, don’t hesitate to message me, even if you just need to vent. 😊",20Aug2020,1
39,"I (F34) am going bald. My sister was braiding my hair over the weekend and she said ""Whoa sis"" and I immediately heard the concern in her voice. She told me I was missing patches of hair around my scalp. 

What's crazy about this is she visited me back in June and she did the same thing, braided my hair and no comment of the sort was made. I had her take pictures and show me and instantly started to cry.f

I did a quite google search and learned it can be many things like surgery or a traumatic accident. None of which I have had. I do however have stress...lots and lots of stress.

I've scheduled an appointment with my Dr. Bought hair vitamins and am patiently waiting for Amazon to arrive with my natural hair oils.

Has anyone experienced this as a result of stress? And if so, how did you come with it? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",20Aug2020,1

42,"So I'm about to start my senior year of college and I've known I've probably had multiple mental health issues since I was in high school. I've been trying to pay more attention to my mental state, especially over the last few months due to Covid-19, and I'm pretty sure that what I've been struggling with for all these years is due to anxiety, depression, and potentially bipolar disorder. I also believe a lot of these issues stem from my family being overly controlling/trying to make it so I'm not capable of taking care of myself (joke's on them though, I moved out over a year ago and I've been doing just fine!). For example, I'm 21 but as far as my parents are concerned, I may as well still be like, 15. I haven't sought out therapy or any medical help because while I know that doctor-patient confidentiality is a thing, I also know that my parents will see any appointment I make or prescription I get due to their insurance (I learned this the hard way when I got birth control behind their backs a few years ago).  I don't want them to know that I've been struggling with all of this because they already had to deal with similar issues with my younger brother when we were little and having watched that, I can't put them through that again, plus at this point, they would see it as an excuse to try and get me to move back in with them. Covid is definitely not helping because while I still have a job (luckily I work at a grocery store), they've been treating us worse and worse as the pandemic goes on and it's getting to the point where when I have a day off I spend it being a potato on the couch alternating between watching TV and sleeping. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",20Aug2020,1
43,"For the past mont I’ve been feeling... not like myself and I really don’t know how to explain it. I’ve made posts about this before. I feel like I’m reading too deep into this but it’s kinda hard not to. I feel like everything is fake and the whole world suddenly feels foreign. My school therapist said I probably have depersonalization. It feels like I can’t emotionally connect with others outside myself in real life or in the fiction (comics, tv shows, books, etc.) that I usually get engrossed into. 

I keep having intrusive thoughts that give me the chills (like turning into a sociopath) especially since I’m feeling so emotionally disconnected from everything. I feel like I have to remind myself what my interests are, and then my mind immediately goes “why was I interested in that? Why was I not interested in this?” It feels like my opinions on things are gone. Even worse, I feel so emotionally disconnected to the point where it feels like I have to remind myself how I’m supposed to feel about things, but I still don’t actually really feel like I’m feeling that emotion. This is especially true about things involving violence or death, which is making me feel uncomfortable. I used to know when something was supposed to be funny or serious or sad or neutral, but now it feels like only the logical part of my brain recognizes how I’m supposed to feel but the emotional side doesn’t. 

Just a month ago I was depressed over not seeing my friends, (and I was beating myself up a bit for having a crush on a friend who doesn’t like me the same way back) but at least I felt like a person. I can still get frustrated at things if they concern me directly, but I have this intrusive and irrational fear about going berserk or something. 

Nothing makes logical sense, it feels as though everything is a foreign concept. Sometimes I feel like I’m afraid of myself because I have some disturbing intrusive thoughts and some gross fetishy thoughts sometimes. I know it’s nothing, but I keep remembering times in my past when I knew what I was okay with and what I wasn’t. When I knew what my boundaries were. Now it feels like those boundaries are gone.",20Aug2020,1
44,"I really need help from people. I have almost no coping skills right now due to suffering from bad depression. I really need sincere advice on how to cope with this so I don’t become even more miserable and progress downwards. 

I don’t have many friends. To be specific, I have two. One I’ve known for 18 years and one I’ve known for 6 years. 
My oldest friend got a job as a lawyer, and with a child, she became constantly busy that I only really saw her once a month or so. I completely understand though, she’s very busy. 
It was at this point 6 years ago that I met my other friend. She had lots of spare time and we became very close. I saw her through her pregnancy and basically helped her raise her child. In short, we became inseparable and did lots of things together, with our kids as well. 

I felt happy because I always had someone to talk to, to hang out with when lonely, to laugh with. I really cherished her friendship and made that obvious by being a really good friend. A year ago, she moved away with her husband and kids, but only about 20 minutes away. I knew things would change but I didn’t think majorly, I mean...it’s only 20 minutes drive. Well, almost immediately the “activities together” ended. It became just house visits. Then it became me always travelling to her house. I think she just expected that as she has two young children, so it was more convenient for me to go to her. 

Over lockdown, my mental health really deteriorated. I was crying myself to sleep every night. I also suffered physical pain due to a health condition. Honestly, I really needed a friend, just to talk to....to feel like I wasn’t completely alone. I found that with almost everyone in my life, it was always me chasing after them with texts. This fact made my depression so much worse. So I decided to stop chasing and let people come to me. I had to go through 3-4 weeks of severe depression and no one contacted me. My best friend didn’t text me once. I started going on Facebook and checking on her profile. I found that she had become close with another woman whose child was now best friends with her child. She was putting up all these “loving friend quotes” and tagging this woman in them. I looked back before lockdown and she was doing all these activities with her. 
Honestly it felt like a punch to the heart. What made it worse, is that when she eventually did text, I let her know that I wasn’t ok. We eventually met up and after that, for another 4 weeks no text. Meanwhile all her posts are now tagging this other friend and they’re obviously in constant contact. 

So, after 4 weeks no text, I decided I wouldn’t chase because I’ve been doing that for ages and I’m fed up of it. 9 days ago, she finally texted and she acted like she hadn’t just blown me off for a month. “Hey stranger, hows u? Can’t believe how hectic things have been lately! Been getting kids ready to go back to school. Have you got everything ready?”. I texted back basically saying I was “alright” but I was struggling with bad depression and pain episodes but desperately trying to keep distracted. I explained what I had been up to lately, and usual small talk. I ended it with, “how about you, what have you been up to?”. She’s not texted me back since. 

I feel totally mind f*cked by her. She doesn’t text me in a month, finally texts me, and when I reply, she’s back to not texting me again and didn’t bother to reply. Why did she bother texting me again after a month only to not reply? It’s not like she’s “sooo busy” because she’s able to be in constant contact with my replacement. It’s settled in my head that I have been ditched and replaced and I essentially have no friends now. It hurts. I cannot believe you can tell someone you thought cared about you that you’re seriously struggling and in response they screw with your head and ditch you! Now I can’t get it out my head. I’m hurt, I’m angry and it’s making my depression worse. I cannot heal until I get over this, but I cannot get over it. I’m so angry that I was always there for her in her worst times and this is how she thanks me. How can people just replace people like this? Like I’m just a piece of trash? My mum and others have said that’s just how it is with friends, but if that’s the case, what’s point in getting to know anyone if they will just hurt you in the end? Might as well live as a loner. If that’s how life is, then why live it? It’s just cruel and pain. I already have physical pain, emotional pain is so much worse. 

I’m scared and anxious of confrontation, I know deep down I would love to just text her all of this and go mad, but I just don’t have the courage to shout at people. I thought about maybe something small like....”hellooo? No text back???” Or something. Then I’m like, am I supposed to just let her go and not text ever again? I mean...She’s moved on and replaced me, so I obviously mean nothing to her. 

Please help me, I need advice on how to get over this so I can improve from this depression episode. The more I think of this, the more I think of....you know, not wanting to be here anymore. I have no one, and I don’t want my son to feel like he has to be my friend. We need to keep it a mother/son relationship not friends, but as it is, he’s my only company. I think I would go mad with cabin fever without him. Bless him.",20Aug2020,1

46,"Ive been really, really fidgety and hyperactive since a young age. I have a difficulty focusing and i get super overwhelmed really easy. Sensory overload is almost an every day thing for me unfortunately lol. Quarantine has only made this worse and more apparent to me

 When i had online therapy, my therapist asked me if i ever got screened for adhd because my trouble focusing and a few other things had led me into a deep depression. She brought this up to my mom and stepdad and they said they’d talk to me about it. but all they told me is that 1) they don’t want me taking meds, and 2) i was supposed to be talking to my therapist about my depression, not other things

After a month my parents asked me if they could take me out of therapy as it cost a lot and i wasn’t talking to my therapist about my depression as much and “seemed” better. i have a really hard time articulating what i’m thinking so i just said yeah sure so it wouldn’t turn into a big thing with them. 

The only problem is that i never really learned any coping mechanisms for my problems so everyday it’s getting harder and harder for me to stay afloat. I tried googling some adhd stuff to see but the link i clicked on was for adhd AND autism. so i also googled autism (more specifically Asperger’s) because the website i was on didn’t provide that much info on the disorder and the little info i did get on it i related to a LOT. Anyways, i googled asperger’s and i didn’t really understand the difference between that and adhd. i related to both disorders significantly. 

Can someone please explain to me the differences so i can try to find some coping mechanisms that work for me? (Also i’m sorry i ranted it’s really hard for me to collect my thoughts)",20Aug2020,1
47,"Ignoring these obvious feelings of extreme sadness or anger or anything feels extremely ignorant and naive.

I would LOVE to dive into the pit that is these emotions but I know I can’t and it makes me feel dumb as fuck. Like I’m leaving so much on the table and completely ignoring an entire piece of life.

48,"I get paranoid over every thing. If I’m downstairs and it’s dark outside I’ll think there’s someone standing in my backyard or on my deck watching me. If I’m in my room and my closet is open slightly, I have to thoroughly check it out to make sure no one is hiding in there. I turn on a light as I go downstairs because I’ll think there’s someone waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs and when I go back upstairs I’ll turn the lights off but literally trace up them because I’ll think someone will magically emerge from the darkness. I sleep with a night light at 19 years old because I’m afraid of what could be lurking in the dark. It’s this feeling of my stomach dropping but like ten times worse.
 And when I don’t hear back from someone within 15 minutes I automatically assume the worst has happened. I was talking to my boyfriend and the call ended but I didn’t realize it at first until he didn’t respond when I called his name.  When I did I called him back and got no response. I waited ten minutes and called back and did that routine at least 8 times. Every time I grew more paranoid and then I started thinking someone broke into his place and injured him. Then injured turned into killed and then I just got so anxious and worried that he wasn’t answering my calls that I burst into tears for about five minutes. 
Then I prayed, cried some more and then prayed some more and then cried once again. I don’t remember when I stopped crying but I managed to stop pull myself together so I can write this post. I still haven’t gotten a call back so I’m hoping that he fell asleep while we were on the phone.

50,"This might just be a ramble, I'm not sure what it is. But I was just thinking about someone that I fell in love with who probably doesn't think of me in that way. I love the fact that they're imperfect, I love that they lead others with guidance and not force, I love when they talk about their passions to share and not just to tell, I love their goddam smile and laugh and I love every little thing about them, whether it's a flaw or a virtue. I find beauty in their mistakes and how they take responsibility for them, their growth over time, and even in their faults they refuse to acknowledge or admit. (Not saying I'm vetter than him, lord knows I've got issues and problems myself). And I've felt this way for years, but I've never been able to tell them because I have a gut feeling that they don't even look at me that way. But my feelings have never changed. Randomly tonight, I just started thinking about what would happen if they died, and I burst out into tears, really ugly tears. I can't stand the thought of them passing not because I would miss them and I want them for myself (which is part of the reason, but not the biggest reason) but because they wouldn't be able to continue doing what they love. They wouldn't continue to share and touch lives. And most of all I can't stand the thought of them suffering, even a little bit. I never want to see them suffer, I never want them to stop feeling happy. I can't stop crying at the thought of them losing that, meanwhile he's probably at home right now not even thinking about me. I'm not expecting him to, but my point is that I'm WEEPING at the thought of him dying because he doesn't deserve it, he doesn't deserve sadness or suffering. I don't care what happens to me, as long as he's alright. I would give everything I could and I mean every damn thing if I could somehow keep anything bad from happening to him, from having a bad day to death. And I can't even tell him that I feel all this.

• I’ve also sexually violated my mom (Inappropriate touching and voyeurism type stuff), on a few occasions at an older age (around 15 to 17 years old). Which I’m still feeling really guilty for.

To make a decade’s long story short, my family is being mentally and physically abused by my sister who won’t get help. 

It’s been years since my sister was diagnosed with BPD, and my parents are constantly trying to help her. They pay for any medication she gets, any therapist/professional she needs to see, they have been nothing but patient with her. But she has been only the cruelest possible daughter to them.

Frequently, she will harass, manipulate, and verbally assault my mother and father for no reason other than she was mildly inconvenienced. My sister will frequently start a giant fight with them, threaten to leave and murder them, and then proceed to get drunk, high, and then beg to return home. 

My parents have given her second, third, fourth, fifth, infinite chances because -as a Hispanic household- family is of the utmost importance to them. But it’s high past time things change.


TODAY, my family was threatened violence by her and her equally unstable boyfriend. My mother was nearly assaulted, the boyfriend tried to get into the house, and was promised that “we were all going to fucking die,” while my little brother, 10 years of age, was on the computer in class.

• Can't stay still. I always either have to be doing something. I can ever sit still. This also used to happen when I was at my primary school. Had to pretend to be dead but couldn't stop moving. 

• I always have to be multitasking otherwise I feel uncomfortable.

• I can't follow instructions properly. I always need the teacher to show me an example of I need to see an example to understand fully. 

• Excessive amounts of energy throughout the day and night.

• Very hyperactive.

• I start doing this thing where I put excessive force into something. So if I close my fist, I start clenching harder and harder and stuff like that. Dunno if it's linked to adhd but I thought I should type it in case. 

• I can't finish big projects. Partially because I lose interest. But then when I don't lose interest, I just don't. I don't know why. ADD is my best guess.

• I start loads of projects but don't finish many.

• Dunno if this is also linked to it but I like being freezing cold? It's weird but I just like it. I don't know why. It just feels nice.

For example I’m even scared to pay in the mall or something since I’m scared of doing something stupid like swiping my card wrong, and so I try to avoid it or go with someone. I can’t even make eye contact with others.

I feel like I’m constantly scared of something, especially death. Sometimes when I do something really bad I get a subtle thought in my mind that because I did it wrong I’m going to end up dying in my sleep as retribution. Or sometimes I’ll get the thought that I’m not going to live long. I‘m often scared that something I do or don’t know about is going to result in my death. I used to not be able to go to sleep early because I’d try to stay up as I was afraid of dying in my sleep. Or whenever I eat something unhealthy and I get an ache on my body I’m scared it’s because i’m going to get a heart attack from it.

But Sometimes I’ll get a thought that it’s enjoyable to lie about this or to have people feel bad about me, but then right after I’ll try to shoot that thought down. I can’t tell if I’m just lying to myself or exaggerating for attention. Maybe I’m a bad person and I’m exaggerating about everything because I want to be unique and I want attention?

This probably makes me sound horrible

I don’t know, I feel so weird all the time for lack of a better word.",20Aug2020,1
64,My counselor she’s been trying to help me for about a year now but I feel like it’s going no where she knows I can’t really feel emotions but yet she’s tryna get me to recognize my emotions but she just doesn’t get it I’ve told her manny times that it’s not helping should I just look for someone else to help me or should I just stop going I’ve been to counseling before when I was 6 and 10 but every time it does nothing or should I just stay and let her help me,20Aug2020,1
65,"Today I had my first phone consultation with a therapist in my area who I found online. He’s also certified in psychiatry and a bunch of other shrink stuff but seems to mainly focus on the therapy part. I’ve never been to any sort of mental health specialist in any regard fwiw.

Anyways, the call was more or less him being silent to try and get me to spill the whole damn tea on everything that plagues my mind to see what I’m about - basically every reason why I’m seeking out someone to talk to in the first place. A lot of it is insane past trauma so I just kind of kept it brass tacks and told him about my history of anxiety and some recent shit I’ve been dealing with. He said “hmmm... Mhm”

Honestly I would really prefer something more guided. I’ve thought about this shit enough and talked it over in my head for years so it’s not helpful to me at this point to just “vent” like that - twitter is free lol. I’m kind of after someone who can lead a discussion and come to some conclusions on how I can help myself, not just be like “tell me why you’re fucked up - wow that sucks” you know? 

Are all therapists in the vein of “I’m just here to listen”? Should I be seeking out something different? I don’t really get the difference between psychologists, therapists, etc. Maybe it’s just this guy? I don’t know. Any help is much appreciated!",20Aug2020,1

70,"I apologize is things don't make sense! It's almost 12 and I have school tomorrow but I'm a wreck :"")

I don't have a good family situation, and I don't really feel the best rn. I want to talk to a phsyciatrist to really see if I have any real problems, but I feel like I don't and so I shouldn't. However, when I ask my dad, he just kind of scoffs and I think he has that ""all in your head"" idea (I love him, but he is a boomer and I just can't handle him sometimes). I am pretty young, but I don't see what that has to do with my mental health, especially after the things I went through when I was younger. From research, (I am NOT self diagnosing, this is just something a believe I may or may not have. I'm not saying I have it) I feel like I might have avoidant attachment and emotional detachment, I am *extremely* out of touch with my emotions to the point where I sometimes I wonder if I even have them (I have a hard time expressing them and I don't know how to show love to people. Not even my own family, and so I end up appearing mean and snotty to them. I think I might have this because my mother would put me down when I was a child whenever I wanted something, and so the lack of reciprocated love, emotion and caring from from her end made me more closed off so that I wouldn't have to be emotionally hurt by her anymore), and I may have some sort of ""social paranoia""; I don't know what to call it, but I HATE it when people look at me or sometimes even acknowledge my existence because I am extremely insecure about myself. When people look at me, I feel like they are constantly judging me and I'll wonder for days at a time why they were doing that. I just feel like everyone is against me and don't like me, or they don't care. 

Every now and then, I will get overwhelmed by horrible emotions. These are usually stemmed from when I notice people looking at me. Even if the emotions don't stem from front that, I'll go from thinking everyone doesn't like me and they think I look ugly, that leading me into thinking about how much I hate a certain part of my body (my nose, I just HATE it with a passion). That usually grows into feeling a passionate hatred to the rest of myself, and then I soon find myself spiraling and thinking about how much I don't deserve to be liked or loved by other people and how I wish people would just ignore me. That will make me wonder whether or not I will actually be a doctor, because becoming a doctor and being successful is literally the only reason I'm motivated to do anything. Because of how much I strive to be successful and do something with my life, I think I get myself overly ambitious just because I want to distract myself from the fact that I don't really have anything I can call my own. I don't think I'll ever be able to let myself love somebody or have a family. I used to want a family, but now that dream has crumbled and it won't happen, it's almost as if the possibility is so far fetched that I can't grasp it.

I digress, this spiral happened a few days ago just because, on the first day of school, we had a mask break and some dude looked at me. But the spiral felt so much worse and I couldn't even block out how I was feeling, it was so much more overwhelming and uncontrollable than they normally are. I know one thing that bothered me was that it wasn't just a glace, either, he looked from my legs to my face and did that a few times and I feel like he was doing that because there was something wrong with me. What really set my mind off, though, was that he looked at me face and I didn't have a mask on, so he could see my nose. I literally ended up crying silently while trying to go to sleep that night. I have to go to school and see the same kid tomorrow, I'm not sure if I can.

I know I should probably go to my school counselors, but I can't. Because of my situation (the whole custody thing we went through, the fact that we have DHR on us, and my overall living situation), I don't trust them for help. If I went to them, we would probably get in trouble. Also, I think if I told them and my dad found out, he would think of me as a traitor to our family (we only have me, my two brothers, and him. We can't trust anyone else with our problems)

I don't like venting or telling people how I feel because 1. It feels like my whole body shuts down and my brain crashes the moment I try to talk about how I feel 2. Because I know a lot of people my age are saying they have mental illnesses just because they listen to Billie and want attention. I don't want people to think about me that way. As I've said, I don't like it when people acknowledge me or try to show me they care because I feel like I'm undeserving of it 3. I feel like most people don't care and I don't want to burden them. 4. I cry when I do open up (I'm opening up here and I've already felt the urge to cry so many times) 5. When people do show me kindness, such as giving me compliments or just being nice, I usually don't believe them. I only believed one compliment I've ever gotten, and even then I'm left to wonder. When people are nice to me, I feel like they want something.

Even though I don't like venting or talking about how I feel, I'm afraid of this progress into something worse. And that's why I want to see someone so I can see if this really is a problem or is just some teenage hormonal thing.

I don't really know what I should do. I've got a few more years until I graduate and be able to make my own decisions, but it feels like my mental health is crumbling down at a constant rate at which I don't know how to stop.",20Aug2020,1

75,"Note 0: sorry for bad English, French is my first language.
Note 1: In Canada our social distancing is of 2 meters
Note 2: We live in a region where there is NO active Covid case

Since the start of the pandemic, my dad has a extreme Covid anxiety. At the start it was fine, tolerable. But now he crossed the red line which will maybe cause my parents to separate.

Since the start of the pandemic in my country (Canada) my dad refuses to eat anything made in a  restaurant, not even food pick up or delivery. He religiously wash his grocery shopping every weeks. He refuses to enter in  people homes and when he go out of the house he vigorously keep his 2 meters physical distancing. My grandmother (his mother) invites us at the end of July to eat a cake outside of her house for my grandfather’s birthday and he refused the invitation even if we could keep our 2 meters social distancing. He watcha everything we do and tell us if he thinks that it’s  insecured (ex: one weeks ago he asked me to wash my hands because I touched a tree in the middle of a forest) My mother, my little brother and I were happy at the begging that he has such a exemplary behavior, but now that our country and our family is deconfining itself ,except him, we are starting to think he is crazy.

I think that the redline had been crossed this evening, when one of my mother’s cousin (she resides in the same region where there is NO active case since end of June) decide to do a surprise visit to see us. The two (my mother and her cousin) were talking outside of the house at a distance of 1-1.5 meters when suddenly my dad open a window and ask them to keep a distance of 2 meters (remember that they were outside).

After her cousin leaving my mother comes back in the house and after a moment went cries in her room. I asked her what’s going one and she said that she can no longer tolerate my father watching us all the time and telling us what to do about coronavirus and that we accept all the choices he made about Covid (not seeing anyone, not eating anything made in restaurant, etc...) but that he must accept that we (the rest of my family) are starting to deconfining ourselves and having contents with people outside of our near family. She even said that she is thinking of getting a apartment without him. 

Note 3: my father is a teacher at a secondary school and will go back to school in two weeks where he will have to manage a group of 30 students and mask and social distancing will NOT be mandatory.

All that to say that I’m really scared for my family and my dad. He never had problems of watching or telling us what to do before. I don’t see how he will be able to return in a school with thousands of teenagers , no mask and no social distancing mandatory, if he can’t even stand that my mother is talking so someone at 1.5 meters outside of the house. 

I’m really scared for him, his mental health and I don’t want my family to break up. So do you have any advice? Thing we could do to sensibilise him to the fact the the world start to spinning again ? Is there a name of something for a illness like that ?

Thank you very much.",20Aug2020,1
76,"It’s really nothing compared to what most people with mental health issues go through. I think it began just under 2 years ago, half way through the school year. I started to feel unusually anxious and it got to the point where I’d feel sick from it a few times a week, even causing me to be sick in the middle of the day and have to go home on one occasion. Some days I wouldn’t eat unless my friends convinced me to cause I either felt too sick to or I just didn’t want to gain weight.

Fast forward to quarantine and things generally started to go downhill. I would feel constantly anxious if I had any upcoming assignments or needed to do anything within a timeframe and it would pretty regularly end with me getting angry and giving up on the assignments which inevitably caused me a lot of trouble down the line. Once school ended I stopped feeling anxious really, instead I began to feel a sort of empty feeling where I found it much more difficult to feel and express emotions besides generally things like anger and sadness. Little things have started to really get to me and I either start off angry and become sad in the end or vice versa. Some days I wake up feeling incapable of acting happy and others have begun to notice it as well,

Last week I got into a small argument with my girlfriend which wasn’t very significant but it ended up having heavy affects on me and that’s when I started to get concerned. For about 30 minutes I sat there feeling really down and upset for some reason and then, for a brief moment I felt an overwhelming sense of dread and confusion it’s hard to put it into words but it was like I was going through every negative thought I could conjure up as quickly as possible and it left me feeling terrible for a few seconds and then, suddenly I just felt completely neutral again.

I’m not trying to say I have any serious mental health issues, it could just be something everyone goes through and I just want something to complain about, I don’t know. My life isn’t that bad either, I’m in a happy relationship and have good relations with all of my family so I see no reason why I feel like this, nothing has ever happened that would cause this. I’m not interested in therapy really, I don’t want to put the burden on my family really and I don’t have an open enough mindset to actually listen to a therapist either. I’m not sure why I made this post, there’s not much I’m  willing to do to help myself besides things I can do on my own. I’m just worried it’ll get worse instead of getting better. Or maybe it’s just a normal thing everyone feels at some point and I should get over it.",20Aug2020,1
77,"Hello,

Recently, I (M25) have anxiety and leads to rage especially while driving. I never get mad at my gf as she is the sweetest and most understanding person. But yesterday, i was driving my gf to get jamba juice. When we are heading home, there was traffic and I got extremely annoyed and my heart beat shot up. Next thing i knew, i was in furious rage and was driving erratically. Speeding red light to red light, turning fast, braking late, etc. My gf was so confused and scared. Asking me “whats wrong? Whats wrong?” I could not control my anger and was completely taken over. After we got home, my gf was speechless. This same rage has also happened the few days before and she seem sadder and sadder. 
After i cooled down, i began realizing the dangers than i put my gf in. I could not bear the thought of her being hurt. I broke down and kept apologizing. She told me to not feel guilty as long as i seek help.

Has anyone felt such sudden rage before? I feel really bad for putting people in such situation, and i want to be more calm.

Thank you",20Aug2020,1

82,"I just needed to get this off my chest to someone. I know i am privileged and that there are many people in much worse shape than i. I haven’t lost anyone to covid but god damn has this year sucked. I lost my grandma when the pandemic was starting (old age, peacefully) and the same day i learned that my university was going all online the next week. I have adhd and online learning is hoRRIBLE for me i have no external pressures to get classes done but nonetheless i suffered through and even took two summer classes. I applied to grad school for spring semester and I’m so scared that i won’t get in. I don’t have a plan b for my life. 

I lost what was going to be one of my best semesters in school yet, my friends and i were are beginning to turn 21 and the weather was going to warm up soon and then i lost it all. I went home and thankfully i had my bf who i was able to see and we’ve spent a lot of time together these several months. But i fucking miss my apartment and my friends. My friends dislike my bf for made up reasons that i gave them evidence weren’t even true. They took it out on me and i lost the people who i thought i was closest to as they told me i was toxic and horrible. I have a few other friends but i couldn’t see any of them bc covid of course. I’m an extrovert and i live to hang out with friends in person. I’m so fucking lonely all the time and no, Skyping or zoom meetings with friends isn’t the same and frankly i just cancel a lot on people bc I’m losing my will to do anything. 

I lay in bed all day and do fucking nothing. I spent almost all my summer doing classes but otherwise i just lay here and sleep all day. I’ve never been so out of shape i used to love group exercise classes bc it forced me to workout with everyone around me. Watching a YouTube video isn’t the same at all. I picked up crochet as a hobby and that’s helped some but i would trade it in a heartbeat for some fucking human interaction other than my parents and bf. 

Schools starting again next week. I graduate in December. It’s my last semester of college and it’s a sham. Online classes are a sorry excuse for what they used to be and my school is charging full tuition and fees for things that are functionally cancelled like rec sports or the library. The only thing that has me holding on is my one in person class/lab and being back in my apartment. It’s a second home to me and i miss it so much it hurts i haven’t been since April. My class is extremely low risk as there are 6 students and it’s a very large classroom where we can sit far apart and everyone will wear masks. But this is too high risk according to my bf. He is adamant that me wanting to go back to school is immature and selfish. I’m not going to parties or bars or even hanging out with large groups of people. It’s not fucking fair i want my life back or whatever i can get and he wants me to throw it away. I miss my apartment i miss my roommates i miss my college town. I’m losing my college graduation I don’t want to lose my bf in this too. I love him and with all my friends ditching me he’s pretty much all i have. I can’t do this. 

If you didn’t read all this that’s fine but I’m falling apart and I’m losing everything it’s not fair i know life isn’t fair but fuck. I’m so sad i don’t even want to be alive there’s nothing good coming. This pandemic is ruining my life and there’s no end in sight bc Americans are idiots and a vaccine is months if not years away",20Aug2020,1

85,"I’m just going to vent because I don’t know where to start. Back a while ago I was dating a girl who I was absolutely in love with. She was my everything and my best friend. During this time I was in this small group of friends, about 8 people or so and my girlfriend and some of her closer friends in that group had a falling out with someone else so that person was removed. As a result, 2 people who didn’t have a say in what happened argued that they didn’t actually have say in anything and I had to stay neutral on that issue since I they were very close friends but in the end I got pulled to my gfs side by presumption. After that the group was essentially just my gfs closer friends and one other person. I would have tried to stay close with them but one of them who is my best friend dated her back earlier in that year and still had a thing for her and was upset that I was dating her despite the fact that he didn’t tell me anything about it. Going into Juneish I started having really bad anxiety and I started getting into some bad habits which I am not going to specify. She ended up breaking up with me during this time which didn’t help very much for what I was going through and I started getting super aggressive in the group chat we had and I had a bad mental breakdown that everyone found out about. 

To get to modern date after that until about a week ago I was doing a summer program that kind of kept me distracted but I still thought about it. Now I only have free time and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been extremely irritable and I can’t stop thinking that I’ve lost every friend I’ve had. I talk to some people on a regular basis but I don’t actually have conversations with people individually. In that old chat I had they added someone new and then made a completely new group chat with them and everyone except me.

86,It all began when I was in the epicenter of a 7.2 during Easter Sunday years ago. I was in the middle of nowhere in the desert and I thought the world was ending.

87,"I'm a bad person. Let's talk about it. I deal with depression, anxiety, anger issues, body dysmorphia, all the fun stuff. And all it has done is make me miserable and push everyone away from me. My anxiety is fucking awful. Whenever I get into intense situations like arguements, or things in a relationship that I'm not okay with, I back down. I'm so afraid of what they'll say or do that I just back down. And coupling this with my anger issues, it causes me to bottle up my emotions until they all explode and I turn into a complete asshole. I remember when my ex and I had the fights where my anger issues came through. Every angry thought about my life would be thrown at her. I would lash out. I was so angry at the world that I would often forget what the argument was even about. I called her names. I would cuss her out. And eventually I began to take out my anger on her in every argument. She became like a punching bag. Over the quarantine we couldn't see each other and I stopped looking at her like a person, she was just a vessel for me to take my anger out on. I believe that's why she quote, ""Fell out of love."" And I don't blame her. But even now I get so fucking pissed off and I think awful things about this girl. And that makes me a bad person. People will often use the excuse that it's, ""just their emotions,"" when they are toxic. I know this, because I did that. The truth is that I was toxic. I hate myself for it. I hate myself. And I'm such a fucking pussy. I just sit and wallow in my own self pity. My anger and my anxiety go hand in hand. My anxiety causes my anger. It causes me to irrationally hate people who I shouldn't. But I can't seem to help it. It's like a switch flips in my head and I don't care anymore. I don't even have an outlet anymore.

88,"I have recently started meditating and am figuring out all these emotions that I go through. One of the biggest emotion that is present in my body is when my brain suddenly feels really dark and foggy. It then starts thinking of something nostalgic or gets jealous of somebody.  Finally, it finishes off with me feeling as if I am very unfulfilled in my life. 

The last feeling - unfulffilement - lasts the longest and is often accompanied by a mild increase in my heart rate and me feeling miserable. I have tried everything to fill this up (sports, study, video games, parties, drugs, etc.).  While doing those activities the emotion fades away but it returns the next day and the cycle repeats itself. 

Some times I can break the cycle by doing something but sometimes it paralyzes me. I end up procrastinating and wasting my time rather than doing something productive. 

Ergo, my question to you is what kind of emotions/feeling/problem is this?

**Note:** I am 17 Male. I have had a very good childhood and I perform quite well in school.  I am decently popular with a solid group of friends.

However, a minor issue is that I have nobody with whom I can confide my sad emotions. I will gladly give them all my passwords and stuff but I just cannot open up to anybody emotionally (like crying, stating my worries or saying I am sad). 

This is mainly due to the fact that many will just tell me to be to stop being such a sissy. Also that I hate feeling weak as is what I have often been seen as - only jokes from family members and friends and stuff, however, I have never been bullied about it. 

I have tried to do that in front of my parents - express my worries -  but I get a bit judged and feel very vulnerable, so I stopped.

**PS: I know all of it this is just a simple chemical reaction in my brain but I just a bit more definite answer into a problem. and I will delete this post if it breaks a rule.**

93,"Let me preface this by saying I have anxiety linked with my bipolar disorder.

Personally, I’ve always been afraid that my subconscious thoughts while under stress come out of my mouth without me knowing it. Never when I’m alone (typically talk to myself when alone so nothing out of the ordinary there), but when I’m in public. I’ve never thought myself to have social anxiety, but that could be the case.

Recently I started a new job working in a kitchen. All and all the job has been fine, but in some moments I feel a lot of stress. I’ve developed skills to help me manage that stress to let go of it, but in those moments of stress I worry I might be saying things (mumbling) that I believe I am just thinking to myself. I’ve caught conversations that have arises between the kitchen staff (there’s three of us in total) that lead me to believe I might have said something aloud, because that conversation the other party is having would not arise unless something was said to bring up said conversation.

Another part of me questions if it’s my own anxiety fueling a fear that I have. I’ve never been a part of these conversations that lead me to believe I could have said something, and when I ask my sister (she also works with me) if I said anything to provoke a statement she has said out of nowhere in relation to something I was thinking (possibly mumbling aloud due to stress the stress I was currently under) she declines (she’s also an empath so she could just be picking up on things).

I’m sure this is all hard to follow, especially with the parenthetical statements. My biggest question here is has anyone else ever experience something like this? Where something they think comes out of their mouths unknowingly? I’ve tried doing some research on cognitive studies about the topic, but I’ve been unable to find anything. This, for me, feels like a shot in the dark. I truthfully could be over-analyzing the whole situation I’m facing, but something in my gut tells me I’m on the right track here.

This is hopefully something I can work through upon understanding it more, but right now I’m grasping at straws. Any information about this topic would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time reading this.",20Aug2020,1
94,I was venting to my girlfriend earlier when I realized something. I really do feel like I have multiple conflicting like...l personalities. Not like DID but more like I feel like i just have so many days where I wake up and feel like God and others where I'm so weak if someone looks at me dirty id collapse. Sometimes I wake up and love everyone and every thing I see and others I despise the world and everything in it. Sometimes I want peace and calm constantly and other days I'll snap at anyone for the chance at a fight. Some days I'm passive and others I'm aggressive. And the problem is... none of these feelings feel wrong they all feel like me. I've always just assumed I've had depression and nothing else so I don't know what this may be. I'm not too sure about bipolar cause I have friends with bipolar and they don't seem to act like me. If you have any idea as to what this may be please leave me a comment. Thanks.,20Aug2020,1
95,"Hello,

I'm kinda rampantly posting due to the distress I'm feeling. I call numerous hotlines and centers to no avail of my worries. To preface before continuing this; I'm twenty, my family abused me and I ran away at 15 to my half-brother's place, he held me in contempt and kicked me out at 18, I was homeless for a month and stumbled into the comfort of an air mattress of my best friend's mom's apartment. I've been in a never ending bout, a wrestling of melancholic thoughts incessantly pervades my mind. Do I continue to fight, lose time and soul for a dream which is locked behind the assumption that the light I've provided my tunnel is both attainable and not complicit with my faults, or do I just give it up? 

I want to move on to my prospective four year from my two year, to provide service to my country (mostly bc the economic incentive to afford college), and to fulfill the career goals I've posted to my life. 
I'm tired of dreamers and want doers, I'm tired of pinhole lights in tunnels and want stellar masses of hope, I want restitution not destitution, I want Lazarus like resurrection not death.

98,"So, my homelife... I grew up in a cult as a bisexual man. 

The cult is Jehovahs Witnesses; I dont mean to shade them... I just dont enjoy the feelings of loneliness, sadness, depression, anxiety, and detachment from everything. 

I recently decided to end my attendance at the meetings, but that choice has consequences; I lose my social web. To be frank, if you dont know, you’re only encouraged to talk and make friends with people inside the cult, nobody else. 

So, I feel empty. I feel sad. Relieved to be free— but a piece of my identity is just— gone? I dont know who I am anymore and im trying to figure it out. I still try to avoid any contact with them or any action that ties me to them. I just— dont feel right.

I keep zoning out, cant connect to people, have a fear that people are against me... hard to make friends. I have a huge gap in my life and I no longer feel adequate, to say the least. 

I have a boyfriend, he has been an amazing coping partner and amazing person all together. I wouldnt trade the world for him. lol, im just in my room crying like a baby!! He’s amazing and I know he’s the one ill marry. I dont see nobody else that fits perfectly like he does. 

Back on track— I never feel enough tbh. Even though, deep down, I know I am. I just feel I need to put forth more effort into things because I never meet my status quo; essentially, I’m being hard on myself. 

I’ve always been like this. I also experience no feeling of emotion, then an extensive flux of emotion... mostly sadness. I do feel happy, trust me.. I just cant exactly pin point the feeling properly unless im with my boyfriend. 

I also have dealt with a lot of the negative things by disassociating myself from the situation; I turn into a completely different person??! I just dont think— my mind is completely blank and I become a robot. 

I’ve noticed some things at work; when my boss yells at me or accuses me of things that I have no control over.. I either take it and apologize profusely or i’ll give it to him about how he is in the wrong and I had nothing to do with the situation at hand. 

My mood also changes at work depending on the day; im extremely social or ill be quiet and appear to be mad. Depends on context. 

Anyhow, I’m confused and looking for examples or experience?? It’s quite confusing to me and I cant grasp the situation. 

TL;DR - I basically was born into a cult, grew up as a gay man where I was oppressed. Felt all sorts of emotions and negative consequences. I have left the cult since and lost my social web. I have a boyfriend thats a good aid in my healing. Leaving the cult has left me empty and hurt. No clue what im dealing with. Any help?",20Aug2020,1
99,"So, first things first: I'm a paranoid Schizophrenic.

101,"If it’s even a real thing? I don’t know, there are times where I don’t hear voices. Almost a whole day and I go “see it’s not real, I’m not Ill I’m ok.” And then a vision or nightmare will pull me back into a psychotic episode and it’s just so confusing. I’ll try to explain as best I can. Please let me know if you experience something similar so I don’t feel completely lost and hopeless.

So I don’t really remember much of what happened but about a month ago I was in a very bad spot. I was hearing things every day and it would last a majority of the day. I would often stare blankly and just listen and experience an onslaught of emotions and memories and thoughts. It was rather difficult to articulate as I would just think and thinking was mentally draining so my speech suffered I guess. Then about 2? Maybe 3? Days ago I put myself in the ER and talked to people just fine. Was not hearing anything I was very lucid. This lasted until yesterday afternoon. 

I was taking a short nap before I had to go to work and I put in my headphones. I was dreaming and a song I never heard before was playing. It was Purity by asap Rocky and frank ocean. In my dream I was back home with friends listening to the song. I wanted to stop listening to music so I took my headphones out. Uhhhh there’s still music playing? I tried to turn down my volume. I see it go down but the music is still playing. I speak but there’s no noise. Just the song playing, crystal clear and loud. I scream and I still can’t hear myself. Everyone looks at me. I start to google, “why can I still hear music if my phone is off” and I scroll through and there’s nothing of use. I tried restarting my phone while crying because I want the song to stop so bad. Nothing is working. I scream so hard that my through starts to burn but still nothing. I’m crying harder and I lie down on the floor hoping for the song to end. It does. 

And then another song plays and I realize I’m trapped. I want to get out of this hell, I’m being tortured. I run outside and it’s night time. I look and see an old friend outside and to my right is a gas station. This makes no sense, you’re not real. And I wake up to the song that’s playing. I think, “fuck I’m still dreaming” but my air pod fell out Of my right ear. It always falls out so now I know I’m real, this is real life I’m not dreaming. And I sit down just broken.

I cried. That dream felt too real it was really scary. And the whole day that same song is playing in my head. Even right now. It’s like a joke. It’s taunting me. I’ve been drifting all day and just staring, thinking about the dream as the song plays over and over in my head. It makes me rather sad. People asked me today about 50 times “Hey, are you ok?” I just say I’m fine. I don’t know if the schizophrenia is playing off the depression but it’s been really making me sad. The song that gave me a very real vivid nightmare is almost sadistic but welcoming. Like it’s saying it’s ok to let go. Don’t fight. Give up. 

I don’t know if I just had a bad nightmare or if this is confirming my illness. I’m having a hard time dealing with the diagnosis. I want to think they’re wrong but these dreams and visions and voices pieced together from music and tv just taunt me. I’ve been internally suffering for quite sometime now. I can’t really speak to anyone. I try to explain and they just don’t get it. I can talk to a therapist but they don’t comfort me, they just make sure I’m not a danger to myself or others.

108,"(tw: mentions of suicidal thoughts and self harm!)

Hello! I've been trying to discuss this topic with my counselor my past 3 sessions but they keep brushing it off??? So I'm gonna talk about it here lol.

SO, I'm currently attending my local art college for a degree in character design and animation (I'm going into my 4th year this fall). And despite having a fair amount of success, like honour roll, consistant As, and having an animated short play at film festivals, I am still ridiculously hard on my self, to the point that I am afraid to try anything new with my art because of what I might do. I noticed this started in my first year (which is notoriously tough for everyone interested in character design and or animation because of the insane workload and second application process to even get in), where I would get so critical of myself to the point of self harm or suicidal thoughts. For example: multiple times I cut an art board a quarter of an inch off of what the measurement was supposed to be and I would point the x-acto knife at my wrists, debating if I should kill myself right then and there, or hitting myself for getting a drawing slightly wrong, or blaring really loud static noise in my ears to the point where I'd get a headache just to make myself work faster. I constantly felt like I needed to be punished for my mistakes and these """"techniques"""" would help me be a better artist. My mom told me a couple years later that she didn't recognize me for almost that entire school year because of how much my personality changed. I never use to use self punishment before that year. And I honestly did feel like a different person? I remember thinking of myself in the third person sometimes, like ""NAME needs to be punished because she did this wrong"". And as I got into my second year of my program, I started to get better with allowing myself to make mistakes, but it's really hard to judge if and when I'll slip into that old mindset - it seems almost random what will trigger the cycle of self punishment. I am currently on anti depressants, which have helped, and I haven't had a episode like this since November, but I've been paralyzed ever since my first year of art school from trying new things with my art and actually enjoying the process. I haven't drawn in months because I'm scared that other side of me will emerge, but drawing is really all I have and is what I'm trying to get a career in so... idk what to do. It honestly does feel like that mindset is a different person in my head and I'm kinda scared of her lol!

110,"I've been getting bullied online for the past few days, obviously, I blocked them, but they kept making new accounts to call me things, to the point where I just had a continuous stream of ""faggot"" if I looked through.

111,"It took a very long time for me to be able to get any kind of professional help with my mental illness. In fact, it took one of the worst breakdowns of my life for my mother to even consider letting me see anyone. I'm grateful she did, and I know this is something I need, but damn it I can never say out loud anything that I know needs to be said.

Everytime I'm in therapy, I can never speak first. And even at the end, when the therapist asks if there is anything I want to talk about and discuss or any other concerns, I freeze and end up just shaking my head even if I desperately want to say something. Same thing with my psychiatrist. I'm fine with telling them I have a horrible sleep schedule, I'm fine with telling them what I've been doing the entire week, and I'm fine with saying ""yes"" when they ask if I've been feeling down lately. But that's it, and it frustrates me so much. I physically cannot bring myself to tell them the reason for the horrible sleep schedule, and times when I break down during the week and end up harming myself, and I can't even elaborate on ""feeling down"". I know this shit that I fail to say screws up the treatment they give me, but I've tried time and time again and I can never tell them.

I hate it so much. I do have some kind of social anxiety, talking to professors and other people with authority makes me want to jump out of my skin, but I can talk to other people just fine. I can be friendly with strangers, I know how to make friends, I can order my own food and call to make my own appointments and I can call the bank when I'm having problems with my debit card but god forbid I tell my therapist and psychiatrist any of the important shit. I know I can't get better if I don't tell them what's wrong but I can't tell them what's wrong.

I feel like I just can't be honest about these kinds of things. I could be so depressed that my chest hurts but I would still join my family for dinner and have a ""pleasant"" conversation with them even when my face feels numb and my voice feels faraway. I could be furious, but I would still play video games with my friends, laughing and smiling and joking even when I can feel myself bristling in anger. 

The online sessions with my psychiatrist are expensive and I feel like I'm just wasting money when I don't tell them what's wrong, and I'm having second thoughts about scheduling another one this Saturday. I could just type it, which is so much easier, but I can't do it when the other person can see my face via webcam, or if I can hear their voice and see their face. 

Just. Needed to get this out. If I can't talk about this with other people I might as well vent on the internet lol. Have a great day.

Fires, airplane turbulence, serial killer, earthquakes, shark attack, cancer, nuclear war... and those were all just tonight.

It makes it really hard to enjoy ANYTHING when I have this voice in my head constantly telling me that I’m going to die and it could happen at any moment.

I finally stopped having panic attacks when I think of how death is inevitable, but my brain is still hyper-focused on all the ways I could die and that I have no control over when I die. And it’s like that all day, everyday. There isn’t an activity that gives me respite from these thoughts- if I read a book or watch a show/movie, I just think about how everyone in the book/show is going to die and so am I. Social media is the worst because it’s all just bad news that makes me think the world is going to end. Doing things like painting or puzzles just gives me more time to think about my mortality. If I hang out with friends or family, again, I’m just thinking how we’re all going to die.

To put it simply, I cannot have a single thought without relating it back to death. It is mentally exhausting. I want to experience and enjoy life without the constant negative voice in my head. I’ve basically accepted my mortality, but the thing that keeps the mental cogs rolling is that I don’t know when so I try to figure out how much time I probably have left and all the ways that that time could be cut short.

120,"I (25yoM) am looking for any resources, ideas, or insight that this community may have for my mother (46yoF). She is currently in a manic state, having visual hallucinations, and extreme paranoia. We are from a lower income area in the Southeast (Etowah County, Alabama). I feel as if a lack of education and the stigma of mental illness in our rural hometown have contributed to her decline. I am a nurse, so I have a general knowledge of some of her conditions but I have never spoke with her psychiatrist or general doctor so I do not know her exact diagnoses. Here is what I do know. She has a past medical history of anxiety, obesity, smoker, poor oral health, polysubstance abuse (marijuana, acid, meth, cocaine), childbirth (me), bipolar disorder (apparently old MD told her this so she changed MDs). As far as I know, she hasn’t used illicit drugs since 2003 or 2004, but she has abused painkillers and anxiety medications consistently through my childhood until now. She has two suicide attempts. One was an intentional overdose (2000ish) and the other was an anger driven, unintentional wrist cutting (2013ish). I do not remember the first, but I know she was committed to a psych hospital the second attempt for a few months. Her and my father are currently jobless/without insurance and live with my grandparents (her parents). From January-May of this year she seemed to be functioning better than she had in the past 5+ years. Her med list then was 10mg Methadone QID, 1000mg Metformin BID, 30mg adderall BID, 15mg Abilify daily, maybe an antidepressant as well. In June, she decided she did not need the abilify (a reoccurring thing the past few years) so she stopped taking it without telling her psychiatrist. At her next visit she told him she was fine being off the abilify and he changed her to keppra unknown mg and 30mg time release adderall. After ~ a week she stated she didn’t like the way keppra made her feel so she called her MD back, and he changed her to abilify 2mg daily. Since then (approximately 3 weeks ago) she has had visual and tactile hallucinations (believes there are bot flies in her skin and scalp), heightened paranoia, mania (didn’t sleep for 48hoursx2), and as of today she has shaved her head completely. My father has tried reaching out to her psychiatrist for a week as of today and heard nothing back from his office. I was hoping to have her medications reconciled to what they were before and try other therapies to help the medication too (something she has never tried). I’m hoping for that to happen instead of her being admitted to the hospital, but I feel as if that is becoming less likely daily. Also, any educational resources for family members would be appreciated. I’d like to attempt educate my father and grandparents because they have a poor understanding/outlook of mental health.

Immediately Darcy marches off retuning moments later with a hammer. I explained that he should check his priorities if he's not going to help. Darcy laughs in response while slamming the hammer into a ruler before going off to the teacher saying ""he needs help because the ruler he was using is f#cked"".

Teacher takes one look at the crying kid and the bent ruler before yelling ""WHY DOES THE SCHOOL THINK THIS IS ACCEPTABLE EQUIPMENT FOR A WORKSHOP!?!?"". He then takes the ruler away and spends the lesson comforting him and helping him with his project.

124,"I hadn't cried almost all summer, I just found it easier not to. I just cried for probably 20-30 minutes. . .  and punched myself. . . in the face. . .. I'm gonna be honest, I'm fucked up in the head. Not depression wise, but. . . for some reason, I'm just. . . fucked up. . .. I have a significant other, a long with some anger issues. . . *and* I'm learning how to box, the last two; not a good combination. I usually get mad when either playing games, but I don't rage at those. Regardless, I spend a lot of time at my computer, it's summer break, why not relax a bit? But I also have a lot of friends who come to *me* for support. . . so I give it to them. One friend in particular, she has a lot of problems at home and is stuck at home with her family for quarantine, so she has a lot of problems. Because of her and co. I have my phone by me at all times, or I'm at my computer. My computer is next to a window, a window means a solid wall, you know the corners on the sides of the windows? I punch that. See, I used to be a *terrible* human being. I would bully my ""best friend"" and just be a total asshole to others. So when I moved to where I live now, I thought ""I need to be a better person"" somewhere along the way. And so I did.  


. . . Well. . . I tried. . ..  


See when I moved, I had met this girl (The one who had the home life problems) and she's nice, and pretty. But I wasn't (nice (or pretty, but I was mainly focusing on the 'nice' aspect of this part)) and this was before I decided to be a good human being. See, this girl had been manipulated and abused by her family. She was neglected a normal life of a normal girl and had become the ""slave"" of the family. Her bratty younger brother was her ""king"" of sorts. He hits her, yells at her, and her family yells at her too. But they also manipulated her to being nice to them, to not fight back. They had taught her that people were the boss of *her* (I italicized 'her' cause I was pointing out the fact that they told her she had no power over anyone. She didn't have any power whatsoever other than to do others bidding.) So she was nice to everyone. I remember when I first met her in english, I would throw a pencil at her, at her forehead, now she didn't show any signs of pain, so I kept doing it. I don't know if I already knew this or had figured out, but they always hit lead first. Now I like my pencils sharp, so that must've hurt like hell! A year or so later I realized she had a bad minscus (part of your knee, a very important one at that) and that she would need a transplant, which are *extremely* expensive, or just get it removed. Now this was a while ago so I don't remember exeactly, but I think this was the point I was like ""damn, this sucks!"" and (a few months before actually) I had decided to try to be a better person. And also, one *very* importnant detail: I was a perve. I had originally approached this girl cause like I said she was nice and pretty (Still is, but I prefer the term cute, and also, at this point she's more of a little sister, both my words and hers. I have *no* interest in dating her.) and also, because she was *too* nice. I thought ""Well, maybe this girl is so nice I can. . ."" Idk, but it was some pervy, horny, teen shit. Fast foward a bit, I picked up boxing. To make sure that no one can hurt my friends again, I tell myself that cause. . . I want to be a better person. I tell myself that I wouldn't defend myself, only my friends. I wouldn't raise my fists unless it's to help my friends. That girl I mentioned earlier; as fucked up as this sounds, I'm dating her childhood friend. Not cause. . . well, just cause I like her. We've been dating for more than half a year (The longest relationship I've had considering I'm in highschool) And things are getting to a point. And I keep thinking everytime we kiss. . . everytime we kiss I get the fucked up thoughts in my head. Basically my own hormone moster to reference *Big Mouth.* Not two months ago she was *convinced* she was ace. And now I get my old thoughts back. I'm pissed at myself while writing this. Now I don't know if I'm old enough to know what love is, but I am *damn* positive I love this girl. . . which is where the title comes in. . . I want to break up with her. . .. Now I bet I know what your thinking ""You just said that you are almost positive you love her, you went even as far as to commit a sin in saying so!"" Now first of all, don't mention the ""sin"" it's just how I talk. Second, It's not cause I don't like her. . .  in fact, it's the opposite. Remember how I said I took up boxing to protect my friends. I lied, I didn't just take up boxing, I told myself, that if something ever happens to my friends that I could prevent. It would be *my* fault. Now I know that seems extreme, but gladly, I have gained a strong sense of justice. . . for my friends. . . and the friends of my friends. . . and people I find annoying. . . **but mostly my friends!** My point being, that's just how I've lived. And so when I see my old self. . . coming through. . . around her? I freak out. I think ""If I can provent her from getting hurt, shouldn't I?"". Cause I have told her about almost all of this plus more about me being a terrible human being. Hell, she hates basically everyone cause of what we do, we pollute the planet, plus so much more! Hell, I'm the exact thing she hates! just. . . me. . .. So I thought ""If it weren't me."" If any of the stuff I had done, someone else had just done 1-5 of, would she hate them? the answer was yes. She would. So if she hates everyone like me. . . but me. . .. Doesn't that mean that she should hate me too? That she realizes that I'm a bad person and just. . .. My point is, is that I think I should break up with her so that I don't hurt her, but she has said before that she'd be fucked up without me. . . so I don't know what to do. . . I want to protect her. . . but to protect her one way. . . I have to put her in ""danger"" the other. . .. HELP!!!

Can't say all this to my parents back home as they will be worried. I am super tensed all the time. My research is severely affected, productivity all time low as I can't concentrate. Can't apply for other jobs in Canada without work permit. No chance of moving to another country.

126,"I've had depression for almost a decade now, since I was about 12ish. It came after years of bullying about my weight and my general quiet, 'weird' mannerisms. Since then I managed it okayish during high school, had  a girlfriend and some friends but still dealt a lot with anxiety, self image issues, etc. As I got into adulthood, now been single for a long time, went to university, it got really bad with loneliness especially.

But now, I've got medication, I have a gym membership, I've got a job. Still no girlfriend, but a good circle of friends including women. I think I'm making good progress. Still lonely, but generally getting my life together and feeling okay. But that's what scares me. After being the sad fat weirdo for so many years, it's become such a strong part of me, it's who I feel I am. What do I do when I get 'better'? What if I don't like the ""happy"" me?

My temperature was also normal even thought I felt very cold

1-   22:30 while I was in my room I started feeling cold (I was in a very hot place) and I am almost never cold, I also started to feel ""scared"", I don't know how to describe it, but I couldn't just do anything and all bad thoughts came to my mind

2-   23:00 went downstairs to look for ""emotional support"" from a friend, bad thoughts worsened, I started crying

3-   23:00-23:30 I was freezing (literally trembling from the cold in a place with 30+ Celsius, while wearing a hoody)

4-   23:30-23:45 Decided to get back to my room, I almost fell on the floor a few times, loosing my balance for no apparent reason, I continued crying, then I calmed a bit

130,"Hello, this is my first time here. Sorry for Format, I'm on my phone!
So, I've had low self esteem and been feeling down for a lot of the past two years, as I've interrupted my studies, felt completely lost and was unable to seek out a job due to anxiety. This eventually led to such an extreme form of anxiety that I developed depersonalization/derealization which got me feeling so bad I had suicidal thoughts.

This was in January, and I've been progressively getting better since. However, I still experience a lot of days where I feel down, sad, nostalgic, very philosophical/existential, and just don't feel great.
 And when I get like that, I tend to get selfish. I want to be left alone, I don't feel like I really care about anyone or anything so I don't reach out to people and tend to be irritable.
It usually affects everyone I know and I end up feeling bad for saying something that wasn't nice, or for not being grateful enough but at the same time I also feel like I don't really care. 
However the main problem I face with this is with someone who's a little more than a friend but we're not together. It's a long distance thing, so we talk through texts mostly. The past two weeks I haven't been feeling the best, and he approached me saying he'd been feeling neglected, as I haven't really sent him cute messages (I didn't feel like it), that I didn't care about his interests (which was kind of true, I couldn't get myself to care) and he just generally felt like I didn't care about him that much I guess (which is somewhat true when I feel like that?)
This ended up with me getting defensive and starting a fight, which got to a pont where I thought I messed everything up and was going to lose him, which I think might've cause a panic attack? I'm not quite sure if that's what it was, but it was an intense feel of panic and nothing calmed me down or could really distract me.

So anyway. My question I guess is : How can I get myself to care about others when I'm not feeling great myself? Because I know I have to take care of myself first , but I don't want to hurt anyone or risk losing someone for how I behave when I'm like that. It's gotten to à point where I felt like I'm the worst friend/daughter/person ever and that I don't even care about anyone, that I'm just selfish and pretend I like them, which I know isn't true.

I have big problems with feeling loved or wanted. I can only feel loved in a relationship or from dogs. So naturally I want a dog, so that I can get the mental support that I need. Many say it would a good thing others say when I get a dog I would just run from my problems. In my eyes a dog can give me the support that I miss to keep going. 

Now my father comes into play, he also has depression and some other mental health problems. He owns a second house with an empty flat and has more money he could spent and is not working. That flat was planned for me (while I write this down I feel like a snop). When I said I would like a dog because it would benefit my mental health he said he could understand me but no because he don't want a dog in the flat, he also had no dog when he was young and I don't know what I will do when I get older.

136,"Hi there, this might not be the best sub to post this in but everyone here has been so nice and helpful in the past. I’m an 18 year old boy and I recently got into my second ever relationship. The problem is that I feel less of a drive to pursue my dreams of becoming an athlete. I feel like my focus has massively shifted away from my sport and onto my new relationship. I have been dedicated to my sport for the last four years, and it is fundamental to my identity, my self esteem and my happiness. It’s been my main purpose for a very long time. I’ve also been very lonely for a very long time. At first the loneliness was unbearable and I thought I needed a relationship to help me and that once I was in one everything would be much easier. But over the last few months I started to like the loneliness a bit. It felt noble to keep my head up and work hard despite the loneliness. I felt strong and capable and like a fighter. Pushing on in spite of my mental pain became a part of my identity as well. 

I entered my relationship about three weeks ago, and that part of my identity has now disappeared. I’m comfortable. There’s no loneliness, no doubt, no fear to push through. I feel like I’m withering. I don’t feel the drive that I used to, and my ambition seems to have diminished. I don’t feel the need to put my all into my sport in order to build a good life and get good feelings, because I know I can just fall into the comfort and good feelings of being with my girlfriend. I wonder whether I’m not emotionally mature enough for a relationship, and maybe I still have work to do on myself. I’m not sure how to balance this, and I want my old passion for my sport back, but at the same time I really care about my girlfriend and I want to stay with her and I don’t want to break her heart and mine for the sake of my potential addiction to struggle. I’m hoping that it’s just because being in a relationship is new to me, so it’s temporarily grabbed my primary focus, and that once I get used to it I will go back to being primarily focused on my sport. This may not sound like snug deal, but it’s really stressing me out and making me anxious about who I am.

I can't focus for too much time even if I like what I'm doing in that moment, it happens to me in class, reading any book (at most 2 pages without getting distracted), trying to do any assignments, homework or even playing the guitar, not more than 10 minutes even if I enjoy doing it, I start thinking about any other thing, day dreaming or just don't want to do it anymore for some reason. I also forget to do my homework or an important assignment but again, if I remember it and what I need to do forces me to put effort, I just can't do it and if I try I end up doing a lot of dumb mistakes.

I told her that I fantasise about my death (suicide or accidental death but thankful it happened by then end) nearly every hour of every day in vivid detail. I told her I’d planned how I’d commit suicide. Her response was telling me that was normal, that everyone does that, everyone thinks about their suicide and sent me to a load of websites explaining that it’s nothing to worry about.

143,"This is frankly ground breaking. I have dealt with anxiety for the past five years, spent thousands on therapy, but this book is a revelation:

I have high levels of anxiety related to my work which stems from traumatic past experiences when I was a teenager. On top of that, I have other traumas that often make me feel like a loser and disrupt my daily routine and productivity. So in short, my past traumas have impaired my self-regulation abilities.

Now, I am reading this book 'The Body Keeps the Score' which explains why fixing your thinking doesn't work because thoughts are just the tip of the iceberg. The iceberg is the deep inner experience stored in your body in the form of emotion. So whenever you try to move forward, the trauma, that still lives in your body, pulls you back - makes you afraid, anxious, depressed, feel like a loser.

It is not a ""cognitive distortion"" as mainstream psychologists would call it. It is deeper than that. The trauma is still living in your body. Your job is to befriend your body and heal it through practices like yoga that transform the body on a cellular level.

My problem is self-regulation - being able to do the things that I actually want as opposed to self-medicating through distractions or engaging in destructive activities. I often numb my emotional pain with porn or internet stimulation. I turn into victim mode often when I can't be productive. 

The one thing that I picked from the book is that when you're constantly aware of your physical sensations as well as your emotions - only then can you mobilize your energies (act in a harmonious way). When we suppress the awareness, stop listening to our bodies and distract ourselves with internet, porn or other stuff, we lose awareness and hide from ourselves. 

Here are the best excerpts from the book 'The Body Keeps the Score' so far: 

**Self-Regulation**

***The more people try to push away and ignore internal warning signs, the more likely they are to take over and leave them bewildered, confused, and ashamed. People who cannot comfortably notice what is going on inside become vulnerable to respond to any sensory shift either by shutting down or by going into a panic—they develop a fear of fear itself.***

***The price for ignoring or distorting the body’s messages is being unable to detect what is truly dangerous or harmful for you and, just as bad, what is safe or nourishing. Self-regulation depends on having a friendly relationship with your body. Without it you have to rely on external regulation—from medication, drugs like alcohol, constant reassurance, or compulsive compliance with the wishes of others.*** 

***The price for ignoring or distorting the body’s messages is being unable to detect what is truly dangerous or harmful for you and, just as bad, what is safe or nourishing. Self-regulation depends on having a friendly relationship with your body. Without it you have to rely on external regulation—from medication, drugs like alcohol, constant reassurance, or compulsive compliance with the wishes of others.*** 

***However, traumatized people chronically feel unsafe inside their bodies: The past is alive in the form of gnawing interior discomfort. Their bodies are constantly bombarded by visceral warning signs, and, in an attempt to control these processes, they often become expert at ignoring their gut feelings and in numbing awareness of what is played out inside. They learn to hide from their selves.*** 

***“Agency” is the technical term for the feeling of being in charge of your life: knowing where you stand, knowing that you have a say in what happens to you, knowing that you have some ability to shape your circumstances.***

***Agency starts with what scientists call interoception, our awareness of our subtle sensory, body-based feelings: the greater that awareness, the greater our potential to control our lives. Knowing what we feel is the first step to knowing why we feel that way. If we are aware of the constant changes in our inner and outer environment, we can mobilize to manage them.  But we can’t do this unless our watchtower, the MPFC, learns to observe what is going on inside us. This is why mindfulness practice, which strengthens the MPFC, is a cornerstone of recovery from trauma.***  

**Why Fixing Cognitive Thinking Doesn't Always Work:**

***Psychologists usually try to help people use insight and understanding to manage their behavior. However, neuroscience research shows that very few psychological problems are the result of defects in understanding; most originate in pressures from deeper regions in the brain that drive our perception and attention. When the alarm bell of the emotional brain keeps signaling that you are indanger, no amount of insight will silence it. I am reminded of the comedy in which a seven-time recidivist in an anger-management program extols the virtue of the techniques he’s learned: “They are great and work terrific—as long as you are not really angry.*** 

 ***Yet another pitfall of language is the illusion that our thinking can easily be corrected if it doesn’t “make sense.” The “cognitive” part of cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on changing such “dysfunctional thinking.” This is a top-down approach to change in which the therapist challenges or“reframes” negative cognitions, as in “Let’s compare your feelings that you are to blame for your rape with the actual facts of the matter” or “Let’s compare your terror of driving with the statistics about road safety today.”*** 

***Sadly, our educational system, as well as many of the methods that profess to treat trauma, tend to bypass this emotional-engagement system and focus instead on recruiting the cognitive capacities of the mind. Despite the well-documented effects of anger, fear, and anxiety on the ability to reason,many programs continue to ignore the need to engage the safety system of the brain before trying to promote new ways of thinking.***

It's been years, but I after getting out of an abusive relationship (that only lasted 6 months) and being raped by the same guy after, I still have horrible dreams. I'm finally in a place where I can be happy during most days. No more intrusive thoughts, no more anger, rarely sadness. But sometimes during the night I relive being raped, or physically attacked/held down. Sometimes by the guy who actually raped me, sometimes by others but somehow he's always conceptually present when these violent dreams occur. I usually wake up with tears streaming down my face and not wanting to get up.

&amp;#x200B;

I know one tip would be to avoid triggers. Some of my friends are still in the same social circle as him, possibly as I never told them (he told me they liked him more than me, so wouldn't believe me - as you might notice that still floats around in my head). So sometimes I still see a picture of him on facebook, looking horrible, honestly like a monster. I'm thinking I should probably hide all posts from my friends who still hang out with him to avoid seeing any representation of him, but somehow that feels like another defeat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another trigger is probably stress but that's unavoidable with my job. But really, these dreams don't really seem to need a trigger. They can come at any time, ruining the next morning and making me reluctant to fall asleep again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips anyone can give would be appreciated. I've heard weed, but I have a bad physical reaction to that. But other things I can take - pills, supplements - or journalling/not journalling/avoiding the subject at all costs/analysing the dreams, anything. Thank you so much!",20Aug2020,1

149,"Hello! I (21F) keep getting weird deja-vu feelings. My brain is thinking of a memory but the problem is that i don't think that what it's thinking about is something that has happened to me before? And while this happens i feel like my body is going numb and i'm running short of breath and also feel like i am either cold or extremely hot. 

The first time it happened to me was 2 months ago when i was playing a game. I brushed it off, i figured it was because i was concentrating too hard on the game and i was also stressed because i was about to find out soon if i'll get accepted to the uni i wanted to go. So i kinda thought it was an one time thing and it'll stop after i find out the result. Plot twist! It didn't really stop. It actually stopped for a while but the feeling came back about a week ago, and it's already happened 3 times this week. 

I am genuinely scared and i talked to my mum about it and she just brushed it off and said it is because i'm scared because of the Corona. I think part of it is true, i feel like the reason why it happened in the first place is because i stayed too much at home.And i kinda lost myself .

I am so worried. I don't understand what it is and i don't have the means to go to the doctor rn. I am scared this will continue all my life and it is going to get worse and worse and worse and i don't know the severe consequences it might have in my life...

On top of that, I was living like a slob. Horribly depressed, no goal, no aim or direction, basically just waiting until I had nothing left to live for. 

I still have depression obviously, and it’s a daily struggle, but one thing I’ve noticed is that certain things in your life can give you a real sense of meaning and purpose. Thankfully I’ve found a company to work for that does just that and more. Being somewhere that actually cares about their employees is very encouraging both financially and mentally. 

Since I’ve been carrying this load, my mood has increased, my libido has returned, my hygienic has picked up drastically, and I feel actually kind of confident in myself. I’m doing something I’ve never done before and actually making lists for my future self to check off. That’s a big one right there, I’m giving myself less to do later, and once I’ve accomplished everything on my “daily list”, it’s a huge rush of dopamine to know that I can kick back and relax without the constant nagging voice of “you’re such a lazy piece of shit, you can’t do anything,” etc. because then I have EVIDENCE! 

I can take my brain and say “No no, look at this. I did x y and z today and that is more than enough. The house is clean, dinner is cooked, clothes are laid out for work tomorrow, so you don’t get to bully me anymore!”

156,"I (F23) had to move back in with my mom, stepdad, and younger sister in April when lockdown started. My family aren't bad people, but I just can't handle living with them. My mom has awful mood swings and likes provoking political discussions so she can get attention and play the victim because nobody agrees with her. My sister and I can sometimes be best friends, but she can also be incredibly mean and thoughtless in what she says. To give an example, she likes to remind me what a ""bitch"" I was last year (I was suffering severe PTSD due to leaving an abusive relationship, which she is aware of). She also likes telling me how annoying I am, which really hurts because I have ADHD and struggle with social cues. 

I've been living on my own since I was 18. My life got SO MUCH better when I moved out. Now I'm back in and it feels like this is destroying me. The existence of the pandemic alone and the horrific response to it is stressful enough. I work in a grocery store, so that's even more stress. On top of that, I still suffer from PTSD and OCD. 

There is one silver lining, which is that I'm supposed to be moving to Spain in October to work as an English teaching assistant. I agonized over whether or not I should go through with it, but, because I have friends in Spain that I can quarantine with, and because it's a long-term move for work, not a vacation, I decided to do it. I have a plan for safe travels and everything (I'm going to try and get tested a few days before I leave, then self-quarantine upon arrival, then get tested again  three days later). But the situation is so unstable right now, and it's not looking good in Spain, I'm just not sure if it'll happen. Obviously, I totally understand (and support) them locking down again, I was there when the virus first started spreading, I want them to put the health of Spanish citizens first. But I can't help being scared of what happens if I can't get out of my family's house. I can't drive (severe ADHD/anxiety about being in cars, I'm super embarrassed about it), so I wouldn't be able to stay at my grocery store job, which pays really well. Also, all my money is saved up for Spain; I can always reapply next year, but having to pay rent, use public transportation, and buy my own groceries would put a serious dent in that. Plus, I just don't think I can find a job better than the one I have now. 

So I'm basically trapped with my family. I hate it. I feel like I'm suffocating. I've seriously considered suicide multiple times, but there's no way in hell I'm telling anyone in my family. They don't respond well when I tell them about my mental health problems. I just can't imagine spending another year in this awful place.",20Aug2020,1

Note 0: sorry for bad English, French is my first language.
Note 1: In Canada our social distancing is of 2 meters
Note 2: We live in a region where there is NO active Covid case

Since the start of the pandemic, my dad has a extreme Covid anxiety. At the start it was fine, tolerable. But now he crossed the red line which will maybe cause my parents to separate.

Since the start of the pandemic in my country (Canada) my dad refuses to eat anything made in a  restaurant, not even food pick up or delivery. He religiously wash his grocery shopping every weeks. He refuses to enter in  people homes and when he go out of the house he vigorously keep his 2 meters physical distancing. My grandmother (his mother) invites us at the end of July to eat a cake outside of her house for my grandfather’s birthday and he refused the invitation even if we could keep our 2 meters social distancing. He wash everything that will enter in the house. He received wood to build a shed, he washed it.He watcha everything we do and tell us if he thinks that it’s  insecured (ex: one weeks ago he asked me to wash my hands because I touched a tree in the middle of a forest) My mother, my little brother and I were happy at the begging that he has such a exemplary behavior, but now that our country and our family is deconfining itself ,except him, we are starting to think he is crazy.

I think that the redline had been crossed this evening, when one of my mother’s cousin (she resides in the same region where there is NO active case since end of June) decide to do a surprise visit to see us. The two (my mother and her cousin) were talking outside of the house at a distance of 1-1.5 meters when suddenly my dad open a window and ask them to keep a distance of 2 meters (remember that they were outside).

After her cousin leaving my mother comes back in the house and after a moment went cries in her room. I asked her what’s going one and she said that she can no longer tolerate my father watching us all the time and telling us what to do about coronavirus and that we accept all the choices he made about Covid (not seeing anyone, not eating anything made in restaurant, etc...) but that he must accept that we (the rest of my family) are starting to deconfining ourselves and having contents with people outside of our near family. She even said that she is thinking of getting a apartment without him. 

Note 3: my father is a teacher at a secondary school and will go back to school in two weeks where he will have to manage a group of 30 students and mask and social distancing will NOT be mandatory.

All that to say that I’m really scared for my family and my dad. He never had problems of watching or telling us what to do before. I don’t see how he will be able to return in a school with thousands of teenagers , no mask and no social distancing mandatory, if he can’t even stand that my mother is talking so someone at 1.5 meters outside of the house. 

I’m really scared for him, his mental health and I don’t want my family to break up. So do you have any advice? Thing we could do to sensibilise him to the fact the the world start to spinning again ? Is there a name of something for a illness like that ?

Thank you very much.",20Aug2020,1

I’m wondering could a doctor prescribe a patient a stimulant in low or starters dose for studying, motivation, concentration, for mood swings etc?

171,"Teenagers are always predisposed to experiencing stress and anxiety owing to the amount of changes that they endure during their teenage years. Teenagers are always struggling to balance a myriad of responsibilities that fall upon them as they juggle the many roles they play at once during those crucial years. Anxiety can present itself in many different ways to a teenager. Teenagers may describe this feeling as a sudden sense of fear, may experience difficulties at school pertaining to academics or peers or have recurring anxious thoughts. Anxiety is often an unspoken problem that most teenagers keep locked up within them. Apart from considering [child therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) for your teen, as a parent, you can help your teenager with four easy techniques to significantly reduce the anxiety your teenager may feel. 

**Help them get some good sleep -**Teenagers may often find it very difficult to get good sleep owing to their constant worrying and stress. This may significantly affect their sleeping patterns and contribute to the problem at hand. Teenagers, on an average, need at least 8-9 hours of sound sleep. Encourage your teenagers to get a good amount of sleep on school nights, to not cram before exams into the wee hours of the night and get some relaxing sleep over the weekends too. This may significantly reduce the amount of stress a teenager may feel and help them cope. 

**Eat right, live right -**Teenagers are most often seen binging on anything that comes out of a wrapper, snacking on unhealthy snacks and guzzling down an unhealthy amount of soda. It is true that you are what you eat and so as parents, you can encourage your child to develop a healthy relationship with food that is good for them. Try to integrate fruits and vegetables into their diet and avoid unhealthy eating habits like consumption of junk food more than once a week and worst of all - skipping meals. A healthy body fosters a healthy mind and a healthy mind is stress free. 

**Move around, move a lot  -** Any [therapist for teens](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) recommends at least one hour of physical activity a day for growing adolescents and teenagers. Teenagers who don’t enjoy mainstream sports barely get any kind of physical activity. You must encourage your child to get moving and exercise regularly the way they like. Motivate them to find a sport or any physical activity they like and make it a habit. It could be just walking too. These activities release endorphins in the body which serve as a natural stress reliever and can boost mood. 

**Let it go, vent it out -** Most teenagers believe that adults don’t understand them and therefore hesitate to share their thoughts with their parents or their siblings. This is where a therapist can help. A therapist can help your teenager understand where the anxiety they feel is stemming from and then target that part of their life to nip the problem in the bud. Apart from the technical aspects of therapy, it can give your child a safe environment to express themselves freely, without the fear of judgement. Venting, expressing, emoting and sharing can significantly reduce anxiety and relieve your teenager of the stress of keeping it all in. If you are wondering where you can find a suitable [therapist for teens Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) offers many experienced and trusted professionals.",20Aug2020,1

174,"I have no clue what’s wrong with me and that’s probably the worst part. My whole life my mom and dad never really takes to my sister and I about emotions or feelings. My dad only exhibited stress about bills and work, weekly, and would always talk about how easily we could just lose everything. Now, fast forward through 22 years of that and I’m a grown woman, paying all my own bills, living with my boyfriend and two dogs. Today my disaster relief assistance was dropped drastically and I can’t live off of it, and my original job is still closed. which means I’ll be needing a job. I’ve been looking for a tattoo apprenticeship, which if you don’t know, takes a lot of time and they aren’t usually paid. But now, that’ll have to be put on the back burner so I can get a job and pay bills. This scares me. I went to college and got a job when I was 18 because it’s what my parents told me to do, but I was extremely depressed and suicidal, and I always thought it was because I simply didn’t ACTUALLY want to be at college and I didn’t enjoy my job. So i quit both, and started a new job that I really enjoyed the next week, and my life was great, went from being the saddest I’ve ever been to the happiest I’ve ever been in a week just because I took out the things that were making me unhappy. I’m scared if I start working a job I hate again just to pay bills, I’ll go back to that dark place and I don’t know if I can make it out again. I told my boyfriend this and he says I should just choose to be happy. I explained that that doesn’t make any sense in my mind. What even is “happy” truly? I have happy days yes, but when I think “choose happy” in my head, nothing happens. What am I choosing? Do I smile? Am I supposed to ignore these issues, pushing back the apprenticeship again, getting a job I don’t like again, figuring out bills? I hear the words, but for me I don’t understand how you get your MIND to “choose happy”. He says it’s just as easy as the way I choose to be unhappy. He says that there’s no point in it, the world doesn’t care how I feel. Which is true, and that somewhat connected some dots in my head. I explained to him that in my mind, I’d rather stress, and worry and then something good happen and I be super happy, than just “choose happy” expect happy, and then something happen and I be crushed. He said that’s my problem, he said I need to learn to just be happy, he said if everything was taken away from him, he’d still be happy, cause he’s happy with himself. If he had nothing, and was homeless, he’d be happy. (He actually says he wishes he could just be homeless all the time and I believe him.) This got me thinking, he’d like to be homeless because then he wouldn’t have to have a job, or any responsibilities really. He would have complete freedom from society...but isn’t that the REASON for your “happiness”?? My point is, is there such a thing as just “being happy” or is there always a reason? He argues that you can just BE happy which blows my mind and do can’t imagine that. But I think it’s more like the whole “there’s no such thing as a selfless act” kind of argument. Sure as a homeless person you’d have no material items, but you’d still have a lifestyle that makes you happy. Then he kind of got frustrated cause he said it feels like I’m just arguing him because I WANT to be sad. That’s not true, I WANT to be happy you guys. So bad. It kills me. I’m only explaining my mental dilemmas here. Sometimes I think I’ve got depression, doctors have tried putting me on meds before, I don’t accept for fear of becoming dependent on them, I’d like to overcome this on my own, but it is becoming harder and harder. My boyfriend is amazing, and has open my eyes to so much, but I feel like my issues are ruining his love for me or pushing him away. Someone just tell me what to do please. I don’t want medicine. I do best when I’m being productive. For some reason I get like this the most when I’m in a relationship. But I don’t know why because I’m READY to be in a relationship and settle down, and he is what I want. I over analyze EVERYTHING, I over stress, I have really really REALLY bad social anxiety too which I forgot to mention. I guess I don’t know what my question is here. I’m scared to “just get a job” because I’m scared to fall down the hole again like I did in college. In a way I think he’s right, I do wake up and choose to be stressed and worried all day everyday. But I don’t know how to not. And when I have nothing to worry about, I feel I have no purpose in life and panic and change everything around me or create a problem. It’s true. How do I stop it?

176,"Spent about an hour writing the longest paragraphs and just realized maybe Im spilling too much so here goes round two.

I want to share my shitty quarantine thoughts incase someone else is going through the same shit

I (M 18) sometimes hate myself.
I absolutely despise social media sometimes because it reminds me of how imperfect I am. Its what triggered me to vent. I just opened instagram, saw someone really beautiful and thought god damn, far out of my league. And that thought alone just really got to me. It feels like I lost confidence and self control, never used to let these tiny thoughts get to me, but these past few weeks in quarantine have really got to me. Pretty pathetic but it is what it is.

I sometimes tell myself I’m too young, I shouldn’t give a shit about anything besides my studies, which is true but what the fuck can I do about these emotions? 

Quarantine made me remember bad experiences, and its made me remember them to be worse than they actually were. I ended up remembering bad choices that I made, and immediately began to overthink of how I could’ve handled the situation better. It gets worse and worse and sometimes I feel like my mind races at fucking light speed with thoughts like “oh you could’ve done this” “you could’ve done that” is it even self reflection at this point or is it more of me just living in the past idek but whatever it is its fucking me up.

I noticed that I have this crazy goal of becoming “perfect” by achieving many things, but I keep trying to tackle my goals all together. Clearly that isn’t working. 

Idk. I feel really angry about the way that I am, and sometimes I feel like I already know what to do in order to improve, but there’s always one part of me that just gives in and I end up slacking off like a fucking sloth.

I’m not worried about college, nor am I worried about getting a job. I can do all of that just fine.

Im just worried about the fact that I can’t deal with myself regarding my emotions, my lack of discipline when it comes to fitness / nutrition, and 
the whole “self reflecting” or “living in the past” habit.

if whoever is reading this is going through something similar, good luck to you too.

180,"For the first 17 years of my life I have been feeling empty and useless: I didn't have friends, I had bad grades, I was fat and ugly, I was sleeping during the day and stay up at night. Then after High school I moved abroad (alone) to work and then study. Since then, I lived the best 4/5 years of my life. I finally had a lot of girls, friends, parties, I had 5/6 jobs to be economically independent, I am fit and I graduated last month. However, one month ago my father had a stroke. 

I want to emphasize that all my life my main goal has been to earn enough money to make my parents stop working and live a good life. I come from a relatively poor region, my parents helped me during my studies although we don't have much so I didn't have to work too much and I could also study and have fun. Now I finally graduated and I was planning to start a food truck business later this year beside my Master's degree, and then this happened. 

I think it is worth mentioning that his cognitive abilities are still perfect, but he does have a hoarse voice, trouble walking unaided, dizziness, some double vision and fatigue. He is a very active person, the day before his storke we went spearfishing, we fixed cars together, etc.  Now I see him sad and I feel like whatever I will do and whatever amount of money I will earn won't be enough to make him happy again. I just don't see any way of me being happy without him being happy too. I don't think I can find happiness in another person ever again, after going through one year of toxic relationship living together  with my ex at the age of 20. Probably it was a mistake to do it so early because now I really just don't believe in anything anymore. On the other hand, I don't feel pain for losing friends or girlfriends anymore.

I cannot find happiness in myself because my only goal was to give my parents the life they deserve, and now this seems impossible, as he will probably have to deal with health issues for the rest of his life.

I just don't know how to feel. I am doing my best to help him, but of course all the money of this world will not solve some health issues. I would just like to see him happy again but I have no control over this, and as a consequence I do not have control over my own emotions.",20Aug2020,1

184,"I’ve been struggling with depression and mental health issues since I was a child due to a lot of different traumas. My biggest problems are social situations. I’m either very clingy or push people away as much as I can, and I know that that makes me a bad person, so I almost tolerate every bad behavior towards me. But this person that I once called my best friend has been abusing me so much mentally that I just couldn’t take it anymore. So for the first time in my life I agreed to seeing a mental health professional and my first appointment will be in two weeks. Now here’s the problem:

My “best friend” is still in my friend group and my first appointment is *during school* so I don’t know what to tell them. I don’t want to make up a lie but I also don’t want them to ask questions like “You’re going to therapy?! But you’re always acting fine! So what’s the reason??”. Plus I don’t really want my whole class to know. It makes me really uncomfortable thinking about it. The last girl that publicly went to therapy in my class was a girl with anorexia, BPD and PTSD who had her whole arm cut open whenever she went to class. So I don’t want them all to think that I am that unstable as well. I am already the “weird” kid. Plus therapy isn’t as normalized in my country (Germany) as it is in America. 

(And a little bonus question: My mom told me the therapist said to her (on the phone) that she had to be with me for the first half of the session [I’m sixteen by the way] but I have an awful relationship with my mom and I always become a very ugly person when she is around me and I don’t want that to be the first impression that the therapist gets of me. So can I tell the therapist when the session starts that I don’t feel comfortable with my mom being there or will she think that I am rude or weird if I do so or simply say that that’s not even possible?",20Aug2020,1
185,"In this blog, I’ll be sharing with you how to stop jealousy in relationships. If you have asked me maybe four years back, I would have looked at my life and said that I was somebody who would feel jealous quite often. I was in a relationship and if the girl that I was dating, at the time, was maybe talking to other guy or I felt threatened if she would go out to a club or she leaves her house for girl’s night out or may be some other reasons, I was someone, that in the back of my mind, would worry what if she talks to somebody else. 

4years ago she left me for this reason. I learned this hard way. I understand the pain. If you feel the same, I am here to solve the problem. Trust me, It’s a big issue if you seriously want a long term serious relationship.

I am going to share with you some ideas that changed my past relationships forever and help you to overcome jealousy in a relationship

Study in the United States found that one-third of couples who attended counseling cited Jealousy as the primary cause of their relationship.

Before you jump into the tips, I want to explain the difference between standard, healthy Jealousy- that kind of Jealousy that’s present in almost every romantic relationship.

And unhealthy Jealousy, which is often irrational and highly toxic to a relationship. 

Healthy Jealousy stands from genuine care and commitment to a relationship. This is the completely natural Jealousy that we all suffer occasionally. And it’s not something you should be worried about. 

Recognize that it’s perfectly normal to feel Jealousy’s jolt when you see your partner laughing and enjoying a conversation with someone of the opposite sex. I think these kinds of emotions because we’re invested in this relationship with our partner, and we are mostly ‘guarding our territory.’ 

It’s when people begin to act on these emotions, or when Jealousy becomes irrational, that thing moves into the ‘unhealthy’ sphere. 

Irrational Jealousy is more serious and tends to be a chronic issue that can erode the fabric of a relationship. 

Irrational Jealousy can have many different causes, usually related to the insecurity of low self-esteem. According to relationship psychology, the people who develop jealousy issues often have underlying insecurities resulting from past experiences. 

Whatever the cause, maybe, if you are the person who struggles with jealousy issues, then you can make changes to your behavior that will put these problems to rest. 

## ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR JEALOUSY IN RELATIONSHIP

Acknowledge your jealousy issues and their damage to your relationship. If you do not acknowledge this issue, then you can not solve your problem. If you are reading this hope, that’s mean you understand the importance. This first step to overcome jealousy in a relationship.

## JEALOUSY IS IRRATIONAL

Understand that your feelings of Jealousy are irrational. They’re merely unwanted. Unless your girlfriend or boyfriend has actually admitted to infidelity, or you’ve caught them, then your Jealousy is irrational. Recognize that your jealous feelings aren’t based on reality… they’re stemming from underlying insecurities and not from your spouse’s actual behaviors.

Once you’ve accepted that you’re feeling jealous for no good reason, then it can be easier to control those feelings and stop yourself from acting on them. Every time you feel jealous about something — for instance, when your spouse is texting someone of the opposite sex you haven’t met — remind yourself that your Jealousy is baseless and irrational.

You’ve probably texted someone of the opposite sex recently too, right? And I’m guessing it wasn’t because you were secretly having an affair with that person. The same is almost certainly true for your spouse, so there’s absolutely no reason to think that they’re doing anything shady or cheating on you.

Until you have clear evidence that proves otherwise, you must remind yourself that all feelings of Jealousy are irrational and unwarranted. If you remember this it will help you to overcome jealousy in a relationship

## LIST DOWN ALL YOUR INSECURITIES

Feelings of insecurity are nothing more than messages from our brain letting us know that we need to improve something. Write down why you are insecure ? are you comparing yourself with others ?? Do you think your girlfriend’s male friends are extremely successful ??[ Did your ex-girlfriend cheat on you?](https://www.mindspeace.com/overcome-breakup/) Remember, you are making a list for yourself because this is your relationship. If he/she leaves you, it is your loss. This is the most important thing to Overcome Jealousy in a Relationship.

Example: My insecurities were

1. I am an average looking guy.
2. I don’t have enough money.
3. Mine was ex cheat on me.
4. My girlfriend had so many male friends, and they had enough money. 

## IMPROVE YOUR SELF-IMAGE

Do you know that you have an image of yourself inside? When you stand in front of a mirror, you see a real reflection, but that’s not the real you. Self-image is one of the most significant investigations in modern psychology. Dr. Maxwell Maltz, who coined the term, told us, who have two images. One of our physical images and mental or inner image. Our mental image controls our daily lives. The people who changed their self-image, they changed everything in their life, relationship, income, friend circle everything. 

If you want to improve your self-image.. Start to study your mind, thoughts. Start to find out more about you. Understand your insecurities at a deep level.. Where do those insecurities come from ?? Who is responsible? If you can’t change them, then forgive them. Forgiveness doesn’t mean you are weak. Forgiveness means you care about your mental health.

189,"My partner and I have been together 10 years. We've never said the L word. We don't talk about feelings. In general I don't mind and think it's just a result of cultural upbringing. I imagine most couples (our demographics) are much closer because they can share feelings and sometimes feel like I'm ""missing out"" and this really upsets me.

I've tried to talk with my partner but they become argumentative. However I've never been clear or upfront with my feelings, I raise the topic indirectly. I'm sure they know where I'm trying to take the conversation and start an argument just to deflect the conversation. We've never have a deep conversation.

My partner's uncle and wife stayed at our house for a holiday the other year. The wife expressed how she was concerned about the health of my partner's dad. My partner and his uncle weren't in the room at the time.
I had no idea anything was wrong with my partner's dad and pretended I knew the story as I was too embarrassed to confess this was the first I heard of it. The wife mentioned my partner's sister (a Dr) wasn't sure if anything more could be done for my partner's dad.

Several months later we stopped by his parents house while in town for a wedding. The mum said the dad was upstairs in bed and I got the impression he may have either something like Alzheimer's and/or a physical condition that inhibits his mobility.  I wonder if my partner would tell me if his dad died. To be clear, it's not that he would keep it a secret, it's more that he just wouldn't mention it. I do think that should the worst happen my partner wouldn't tell me and attend the funeral without telling me. It's possible this has already occurred.

My partner has never made any comment about his dad being unwell. I don't feel comfortable to ask and I don't want to make him uncomfortable.

My partner has a strange spiteful streak and I wonder if they're not s actually reserved with their feelings as I am, but it's their spiteful streak and hence the argumentative reactions rather than checking to more subtly or just shutting down.

For example early into our relationship he told me about personal issue his brother had which I think would be a more sensitive topic than his father's health.

Early into our relationship I told him I didn't speak to my dad and I wasn't close with my mum and I had no desire of introducing him to her. My mum has met my siblings partners and has been horrible to them so I didn't want to go through that. Not long after we were in my partner's brothers car, the brother was driving and he expressed his strong opinions about how wrong it was that I wasn't going to introduce my partner to my parents. I wasn't offended but the conversation stands out in my mind cause I'm pretty sure the conversation didn't come up organically and I hadn't spoke to the brother about my views so it was like my partner confided in his brother and his brother wanted to call me out on it cause it was an issue for my partner.

195,"I am a Manchester United fan. We’re on the up performance-wise so if we get a few good players in, we can challenge for the title.

The last few windows, the board didn’t back us completely because of which we didn’t perform as well as we could. The main thing is, every transfer is a fucking saga because our CEO Ed Woodward is terrible at closing deals and very good at creating drama for publicity. The window is open till the 5th of October but the season starts on the 12th of September(although it might start a week later for us).

196,"This is literally just a big dump of everything I’m thinking. I don’t have time/motivation to really put it into well articulated and complete thoughts. Idk maybe it is. I just want help. 

For the first time in my life I’m realizing my mental health is all out of whack and I don’t know what to do. This post might be a sign to talk about it but I’ve never been good at or sometime even able to talk about it. 

I had an abusive father growing up until he got more abusive and phased out of my life at about 17 years old. I’m now 23 and my wife and I just had our first baby and him and my wife are my whole entire world. However in the month leading up to his birth and then especially since then, my mental state has just taken a beating. 

I’m constantly filled with thoughts of being replaced in the eyes of my family and friends (no  resentment toward the baby or shade to them. He’s cuter and I totally understand they wanna see him). I feel more like I have become a disposable to my wife. Someone to fetch the diapers and bring in a paycheck and then if there’s time after the baby’s good, we’ll have a relationship. Which I get that the baby is taking a lot out of her. I’m trying to be understanding but my mind goes to bad places. 

More so, I have lots of feelings of inadequacy and falling short of what I should be and the things I should be doing. I’m working a full time job. Construction. New homes. 50+ hours a week. I honestly love what I do. It’s tiring and it’s hard work but I really love what I do and until recently I’ve always found a real satisfaction in the job. But lately there is a feeling that I’ve never felt before of absolutely falling short of what other expect of me. Most of all my mom. I love her so much but she is a bit of a scorned woman after two divorces. She has turned into a pretty hardcore feminist, which there’s nothing wrong with, but my mental state has me seeing things in a way where she totally disapproves of my job as a husband and a father. It’s been that way for our whole marriage but it’s become glaringly present in my mind since the baby came. She has sent my wife numerous texts and notes of how proud she is of her and the woman she is and how great she’s doing and in the same thread will tell me that I need to be better. My mental state reminds me of how scarcely she’s offered praise to me, causing me to think “why should I be deserving of that?” 

My wife through it all has heard a small portion of this. I’ve tried to give her a watered down version of this but I’m terrible with words especially in person. Typing this out has actually been incredibly therapeutic I guess. As I’ve told her she’s been sympathetic. She’s told me herself she’s never really had mental or emotional struggles to a certain degree in her life. She’s lived a relatively cookie cutter/picture perfect life and knows it. So she tries hard to he sympathetic and offers consolations that, with my mental state, feels like scripted lines in response to my venting. I appreciate and I think she loves me. But the expressions of love and appreciation and the reassurances have always been reactive. Never at least in the last 6 months have they been proactive. I love her so much and I do appreciate her consolations but my mental state causes me to question even that. 

It’s harder when about once a week, my wife has what seems like a snapping point where at a certain point she will burst out and say things to me about how selfish I am and call me stupid. This last time after her outburst she left for her parents house and continued to text me afterwards, as I tried to apologize for whatever might have provoked her, about how I don’t love her or our baby. It’s been the closest I’ve ever been to harming myself.  

TL;DR: Most of all my mental state causes me to believe I’m just a man who provides. And sometime I don’t even do that well enough. It causes me to believe and see evidence that I’m a bad father and sends me into a downward spiral that’s getting harder and harder to stop.

I don’t really know if this is a mental health problem or a me problem. But I find I get very fatigued even if I haven’t really done much in the day. It takes a huge amount of effort to do anything. 

I went to the town to get my eyes tested, grabbed some presents for my nieces’ birthday then immediately went home and fell into a nap. After when I was reminded I also have swimming this afternoon, I had an ‘oh god’ moment.

I’ve been told by a few people recently, including my partner, that I may be going overboard with my drug use. I usually just nod and agree, or tell them that no one would care if I was on or off anyways, which is a belief I hold. I really don’t want to take any recovery step so far as to go to rehab, but I absolutely loathe the days that I am sober and w/o K, and think about it non-stop. I believe the state that K puts me in helps alleviate my Bipolar symptoms and makes me less crazy and irrational, which is what psychiatrist prescribed medication has done for me in the past. I want to stop one day, so I can be healthy, keep more of my money and have a family one day but I’m not sure where to start. If anyone has any advice or relatable stories I would really appreciate to hear from you. Also if this is not the correct group to post this in, I apologize.",20Aug2020,1

213,"Everyday I hear about all the pain and injustices of the world. Climate change, racism, poverty and the growing financial gap. I hear about how all the billionaires and world leaders are basically screwing the world up the rest of the world and honestly I don’t think I can watch it get any worse. 

Society angers me and I feel like I can no longer live in a world full of greed and destruction. I honestly wish I was never born into such an ignorant society. I just can’t take it anymore. I can’t watch the world fall apart, and I certainly can’t watch the suffering continue and get worse. 

I just feel so infuriated by society and it’s actions. I can’t stand it. Everyday I constantly think of all the things I need to do to fix this world, but honestly I feel like it’s too far gone and I should just die before I have to feel even more of this anger and sorrow towards society. I feel like I need to escape from it all. From all of society’s conditionings and expectations, from all of the greed and ignorance and carelessness. But I can’t escape and I probably never will.

It’s strange because I have a pretty good life compared to so many others. I have a loving family, a good education and financial stability, yet I feel none of these things matter if I have to wake up in the morning and stand witness to the atrocities of mankind. People being massacred for their beliefs, billionaires taking money out of the pockets of those with barely anything, world leaders letting innocent animals die in the thousands for the sake of money.

It’s all too much. I know I could never bring myself to bring a child into this world and put it through such misery. I’ve had enough and I feel like the only worthwhile thing I can do is end my life.",20Aug2020,1

216,"So this might just sound like a whole bunch of whining and I'm sorry. I just couldn't figure out where else to go to vent. 

I'm not in a state of depression (yet) and have an overall healthy mind (according to some of the tests I took). My problems have more to do with my physical illness (psoriasis) and the much uncertainty of this pandemic.

I am not even sure where to start.

I am married to a very loving but also troubled husband. He is currently in counseling for his mental health issues (anxiety) that were especially bad a year ago due to his high stress job. He quit his job after many years of struggling with it and found something that is better suited for him, even though his real dream is finishing writing and publishing his book that he has worked on for many years now. Problem is just finding time for it which I try to give him as much as I can. 

We also have a 4 year old that stays with me most of the week due to my husband's work and I am also trying to run a photography business that I started out just shortly before the pandemic hit. I have a hard time working a normal job due to my psoriasis as especially now most jobs require handwashing multiple times a day or wearing gloves (all that is killing my skin on my hands). 

I have tried a number of things to make all of this work, care for my son and making sure my husband is getting the time and space he needs and also working while not really making any money from it which is making me feel quite anxious. We are ok for now but our money will run out and the longer I go without making a dime the more worried it gets me and the less likely I'm able to stay organized (if at all).

Maybe this isn't as bad as it could be but it is something that has plagued me for the last 6 months since all of this chaos started to happen and I know what to do to get my business on the right track, I just can't seem to make it work.

I feel overwhelmed and I just can't stay focused on the task. I have all these projects in my head that I wanna do but I can't seem to finish any of them. I have trouble most days just keeping the house clean. It's starting to all come crashing down on me and I just have no idea where to go or what to do to keep moving.",20Aug2020,1
217,"So a bit of background: I’m currently in the city that my university is in because I have one in person class and no way to cancel the lease I signed last January. I spent the summer and most of spring with my sister and brother-in-law, so I wasn’t alone. Now I am and I cannot deal with it.

I thought I was continuing with my job from last year, but they changed my place of work on me so I need to learn everything all over again. I was talking to someone I met on Bumble and we were going to meet next week, but he just left me on read. Another friend stopped responding after 3 messages. My closest friend isn’t here because she had surgery and isn’t able to talk either (I still snap her but it isn’t the same). I talk to my family but they don’t really understand and are as helpful as they know how to be. I just feel terribly alone and like no one in the world would care if I ceased to exist tomorrow (I know that this isn’t true but it’s how I feel). I feel so isolated, like all the strings connecting me to someone else have become longer and longer, or disappeared completely.

Classes start next Monday but I’m in no mental space to be studying. I have been put on the list for therapy at my university but I haven’t heard back yet.

I feel betrayed because of my job change and the resulting absolute lack of familiarity. I was about to quit but then my supervisor talked to me and asked me to take 2 weeks off. I cried in her office and she was incredibly understanding, but I still don’t want my life anymore.

I’m incredibly awkward and socially anxious so dealing with people after 5 months of isolation makes me over analyze everything and decide that no one likes me. 

I honestly just want to stay in bed forever.

I have experienced nearly 40 years on this beautiful planet of ours and recently, with all of the crap that has gone on in the world in the last few months I find myself absolutely disgusted with the human race. I want to make it clear that I am neither suicidal nor homicidal, but fuck, I am having one hell of a time finding one redeeming quality in anyone who aligns themself with the right nowadays. I keep looking at the state of the world and I wonder what is the fucking point anymore? The air on my city is thick with smoke from a wildfire burning in the next county over.

229,"I am not officially diagnosed with any mental illnesses, but this pandemic has taken a toll on my mental health.

I often feel very anxious when I think about the future or even my short term future even a month from now. I try to manage this feeling by trying to be productive during the day or exercising, but this only works every two days or so, and in between, I’m down again. When I ask my friends what they do to cope, they seem to be doing fine or they just splurge on online shopping. I don’t have a lot of money, so this isn’t an option for me.

It’s not exactly to the point where it’s debilitating I guess, but there are days when I just sleep an entire day away and still not feel rested, or days when I can’t sleep at all. And then I feel so guilty for wasting a fay not doing anything productive.

Therapy is out of the question since we don’t have a lot of money, free mental healthcare in my country is for the most severe cases, and we can barely afford my sister’s psychiatrist. (She’s bipolar and depressed) Everything is so uncertain right now and I hate it. I hate this feeling.

The last 10 years has been strictly dedicated to teaching struggling children in one specific subject across several grades. (Think the Title-type classes for struggling math or reading students).

With virtual school taking over, that specialty position was temporarily done away with and the relative was told with only 2 weeks notice that they'd need to quickly get familiar with curriculum for an entire traditional teaching job of a specific grade (all subjects). In addition, they would need to learn how to create and use a virtual classroom with live meets for students, something they'd never done before. There was little support provided (the school system mostly sent everyone several YouTube videos with little other help)  and the teacher became so overwhelmed and stressed and just unable to figure it all out in such short notice. They left/retired a few days before school started and are now deeply depressed, crying, staying in bed in pajamas. There was no option to temporarily step aside until school resumed as normal.

234,"My father is always controlling the things I can do to the point of not letting me do exercise if he considers it's not time for it or that I should not do it. He's always complaining about anything I do. Did you not put this the way I told you? 5 to 10 minutes explanation of how it should be done his way and why even though I already heard it a thousand times. He wants me to do many things that when I fail at one he feels the right to scold me.

He tells me how to do the dinner when I'm in charge of doing it even though he has explained me how to do it every single time I have to. I feel dumb because he won't stop explaining even the most basic things like how to boil pasta or how much time do I have to leave the plate in the fucking microwave.

He is constantly controlling what I do and I can't do this fucking anymore. He always made sure I wouldn't go out at extraescolars (not English native so I'm not sure if this is how it's written). 
He first says no, then he will accept and say yes to make me shut up, and then he will say he doesn't allow me to go at the very least second. I've lost illusion. Now I'm not excited about anything.

He also has this way of thinking that people deserves to be scolded or even insulted because they don't understand by the good path. He used to hit me when I was young if I did not understand a thing. When he was teaching  me how to do maths for example he would do that. Now he doesn't do that anymore.

He's not a bad person but damn he is hurting me.

My mother is other case. She is oblivious and won't be there for you when you need it. I got very ill for a long period of time. Doctors did not see anything wrong with me so in place of looking more deeply she literally dumped me and assumed that all was psycologic. I am still scarred by that. The only one there was my father.

Sincerely I don't want to kill myself, I can't do that to my family, but I would love to have never existed. That would be so fucking fantastic. I'm tired, I'm so tired it's funny.

235,"I recently moved back to my childhood home after graduating from my Master's program. I just had my last supervision Zoom with my supervisor from my internship this summer and when the call ended, a wave of sadness came over me. Throughout COVID, I have been consumed with my studies and then my internship, so I have not had any downtime to reflect on what I am doing next with my life until now. 

I feel so alone at the moment, back in my hometown. I have no friends here and my friends from university are scattered throughout the world. I feel like my life is empty. While my family loves me, I am not particularly close to them so being at home does not feel comfortable and I feel like my growth has stagnated. 

I miss college, being surrounded by my group of friends and always being in a group chat or having some little drama going on and being able to make plans with people everyday and having people to cheer me on when I would take risks. I miss brunch and concerts and gossiping and trying to get into parties and random loitering. 

Now, I feel like I am completely on my own and it is time to build a new life. My friends from college have built new lives for themselves in different cities and most of them are in long-term relationships, where they are intertwining their lives with their partners. They have their new friend groups and ""pods"" of people they hang out with. They'll answer my texts and we'll occasionally do Facetimes or movie nights, but I feel like I'm relying on them for social contact while they also have their new lives to attend to. 

I don't know what's next for me, especially in the world of COVID. I don't know how to create new relationships and connections or ""have a life"" again. I don't connect with anyone in my hometown because of my leftist politics and values so I feel even further isolated. I have no money to move because I just graduated and moved across the country to my hometown. 

I am worried that I will spend the next few months just binge watching Netflix while applying to jobs and ""wasting"" my 20s. There is nothing I feel excited about or that I am looking forward to at the moment and I feel like a child while watching my friends continue on their adult trajectories, while I hang out in my childhood bedroom.

240,"Hello, I admit that I find myself in need of some advice on how to help a friend of mine whose behavior is weird, tiresome and honestly, quite dangerous. This is going to be a long post but I need genuine help so thanks if you read through to the end. I will try to provide as many information as I can so that you will have a more complete idea of what is going on, so that you can make a better judgement of the situation and by extension give me more useful advice. Thank you so much for your help.

Let me provide some background information first about myself. First things first, I am a psychology student, so I am not entirely in the dark about the basics of psychology, but the thing is that I am not knowledgeable enough so that I can provide actual help for my friend. However, I think that with some advice from here, I could be able to make some kind of progress or at least be able to convince him to seek professional help. I don’t want to give off the impression that I am trying to play the therapist, but I do want to actually try and provide psychological support for my friend, even with my limited knowledge on the actual subject.

I don’t know were to begin to be honest, because this story is so confused in my head, and I have been shocked multiple times because of the things that I learned about the person I am trying to help and there are so many details that slip my mind as I write this but I will try my best to give the best account I can on this situation.

Firstly, I want to provide some general information about my group of friends, because this story involves most of them:

So, my group of friends consists of about 10 people and all of us are between 21 and 23 years of age, among them my girlfriend. I mention that because she is the reason I know most of the details about this problem since her best friend, whom I will refer to as Lisa, is in the epicenter of this story. If my girlfriend wasn’t my girlfriend I would know a lot less about this situation, but anyway.

Most of us smoke marijuana, and I mention that because I believe that it has played some kind of role, even a minute one, in creating this problem.

The person I am trying to help, whom I will call John, belongs to our group, but in the past couple of years has been slowly drifting apart from the rest of the group. I believe the reason for that is that we have different interests. Whereas most in the group are content with staying inside, or going to someone’s house and smoke joints and whatnot, John prefers to go out and have a drink, or eat at a restaurant, or go to a club. These are activities that he follows on a daily basis, and although very costly for us, he has the money and the energy to do these things every day. John has complained in the past that he is angry at us and feels that he does not fit in with the rest of the group anymore, because we would rather smoke inside than go out with him. We have explained to him multiple times, that there is no need for him to feel excluded since there are others in the group, like Lisa, who also do not smoke marijuana, yet hang out with us whenever we meet at one of our homes to which he has responded that he finds it very boring to stay inside. Additionally, we have also explained that most of us do not have the money to follow him on his preferred activities on a daily basis, but we would be happy to meet his “demands” halfway through. To be honest, we did not keep that promise, and we rarely went out with him, although that is also kind of his fault because he also rarely communicated with us after a point. This only helped though to create a chasm between him and the rest of the group.

Some additional information on John are that he would rarely be out of a relationship. Usually, he would get with someone else before he would break up with his current girlfriend. He is also known to have cheated on his girlfriends in the past, something that rubbed off very negatively on me. Additionally, something that seems weird to me, is that he has almost a nonexistent sense of humor, and rarely gets our jokes, and gets really awkward when someone makes a joke about him, almost as if he takes it personally. This to me indicates that he lacks some kind of social skills and is unable to distinguish between a joke or an irony and an actual insult.

Another thing I should mention is that John does not believe in psychologists. In other words, he believes that they are not efficient and that psychology is bullshit.

On to the actual unfolding of the event that culminated in my current situation:

Everything began about two years ago, when Lisa started having a crush on John. For about a year or so, they would find themselves in that awkward situation, were they would not openly admit they liked each other, yet they would exchange flirty and ambiguous messages, and would hang out by themselves without telling the rest of the group. It is also important to note, that throughout that year, John was in a relationship with another girl, with whom they were not doing very well as a couple for at least the latter half of that year. Anyway, about a year ago, most in our group went on a vacation, including me, Lisa and John. It was during that vacation that they got together, and for a couple of months afterwards, they were both very happy to be with each other, and they seemed to fit very well with one another, since both had very similar interests. However, after the honey moon phase started to fade out, some problems started arising. Lisa would often complain to us that her and John would fight and argue a lot, mostly about how to spend their time. Whereas Lisa would like to stay inside her home and just relax from time to time, John would prefer if they were together and hang out at all times. These fights became very common and occasionally very intense. The fights would usually conclude with Lisa backing down so as to calm the situation, but that meant of course, that John would get his way. That started becoming a problem for Lisa after a point, but the sad thing is that John was unable to realize that, and would consider things to be perfect, and that their relationship had no problems.

Things would go on like that for several months, with no new “developments” until that point in time when covid-19 started appearing and reaping throughout Europe. So, one day, John sent me a link for an online meeting since we were quarantined, that would take place through Zoom. That meeting, was a presentation that was part of a series of interactive seminars, which’s purpose was to “better one’s life” or “teach you how to be happy”. I immediately considered this to be a scam, and my worries were realized when I took part in the presentation. The main presenter was a fucking charlatan and every last one of his arguments and philosophies were utter and total bullshit. It seemed to me, that that guy prayed on people’s desperation and almost brain washed them with his stupid ideas, all so that his audience would reach a point where they would falsely believe their lives were bettered, so that they would invite more “victims” to pay for that bullshit. Every one in the audience, who had taken part in the previous presentations, spoke highly of that idiot’s life lessons and gave examples of how their lives got better yada yada yada. John was one of those stupid enough people to buy into that joker’s bullshit unfortunately. And after those seminars were concluded, Lisa complained that John had become worse. Demanding more from Lisa, not allowing her to spend time alone, or with her friends, and basically going against her every time she wanted to do something without him. He would go on to belittle her and make her feel bad for pointless things, like uploading photos on Instagram, which he considered slutty (they were not, I saw them). All this has resulted in breaking Lisa’s confidence and self-esteem, and she is now basically more akin to his slave rather than his girlfriend since she rarely goes against his wishes and actually does something without him. Of course, when John is in front of the rest of the group he behaves normally, most of the time, and shows little signs of that behavior, so anything I know about her situation is mostly because she has told my girlfriend and in turn she told me, or Lisa has told me herself.

A couple more months go by, the quarantine ended, and one day, my girlfriend comes to me shocked after a night out with the girls. It was one of the rare occasions where Lisa had managed to join them for a drink. They caught up with each other, and Lisa mentioned something to them that actually haunts me until now. She was very reluctant about talking about that event with the rest of her friends. Basically, Lisa and John were in his car, returning from a weekend they spend in John’s secondary residence. They would have a fight while they were on the road, and even though Lisa, and possibly also John, cannot remember what they were arguing about, their fight got so fierce and intense, that John got so angry, which caused him to speed up reaching almost 125 mph/200 kph in a road with a 55 mph/90 kph speed limit, knowingly and purposefully pass a red light and aiming to hit a truck, only to stop mere inched before hitting it, all the while screaming that if they were to die they would die then and there and that they should die together because he loves her and other such bullshit. Lisa also mentioned that it was not the first time that he had done something like that. John explained that he only intended to scare Lisa (I don’t believe that), but he could have easily lost control of the car. And even if that was his purpose and had complete control over his car at that speed, nobody should do that to their girlfriends for a stupid argument. Jesus fucking Christ, I drive like a pussy whenever I have as a passenger one of my friends or my girlfriend so as to not endanger them, and that fucking asshole almost killed Lisa for no reason at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think this is the cherry on top of the icing on the shitty things John has done to his girlfriend, and is obviously a display of very dangerous behavior. This is basically the reason I feel I have to seek as much help as I can, because he could easily kill someone. 

Again, a couple more months go by, and the time comes when we go on vacation. There were six of us this time, compared to the eleven that were last year. Early June we created a group chat, consisting of those of us available for vacation. This group consisted of me, my girlfriend, Lisa, John, a couple others. Late June we finally agree to go to Amorgos, an island in the Cyclades. As we are in the process of searching for a place to stay and a way to get there, John, suddenly realized that he did not want to go to Amorgos, because the ship to get there took 9 hours, and he did not want to risk getting infected from covid because of the long exposure to the ship’s other passengers. Acceptable as that reason was, John had already made plans to go with Lisa on vacation on their own, and they would anyway get into a ship, and they would stay on it for approximately 4-5 hours. Anyway, we agreed to change the destination to something approachable by car. We settled that we would go there from the 4th of August until the 8th. John didn’t like that, because he wanted to stay more but none of us could do that. Anyway, after we explained why we couldn’t stay more, we moved on and found a place to stay, no thanks to John, who was expecting everything to be organized by the rest of us, while he did nothing and ultimately constantly had complaints about how we organized the trip. He would bring up the matter of how long we would stay multiple times, as if we could do anything, demanding we stay more days on vacation. We explained multiple times why we couldn’t and although he seemed to get it, after a couple days, he would again demand that we stay longer. This continued until four days before we left, and even four days before our vacation he would get angry at us and would demand we find a way to stay more days. He was unable to understand that we could not do that four days before we left, and wanted five people to conform to his demands even though we had backed down multiple times. He was also restrained by his work, and wanted us to wait for him so that he could join us, and didn’t leave us to organize our vacations the way we wanted.

I mention our vacations because we spend more time with John during those four days, than we had for the whole year. It opened our eyes to the severity of the problem even though this trip was the worst of my life because of him. So, when the four of us got there, John was on the way with Lisa, and he would try to control which places we would visit until he got there, so as to not miss anything. The second day he would demand we go on a certain beach, which the rest of us did not want to go to, but we went anyway. He would be unable to make decisions on where to eat etc. and was a pain in the ass for all the five days we were there. On the third day, we rented a boat, which was what John wanted. Nobody else wanted that damn boat. Anyway, we took the boat, and he would not let anyone else drive it because he was the only one with an appropriate license, even though the boat did not require one to drive it. Basically, he made 5 people pay 20 euros each, so that he could fulfill his captain fantasies. The purpose of the boat was to visit as many beaches in the island as we could, which of course we didn’t do, because John was hungry and stopped the tour in the middle so that we would go and eat. Of course, afterwards no one was able to get in the water because we had eaten a shit ton of food, and so we just turned back. Throughout the tour, John did a lot of mean and stupid things. We almost hit another boat out of his seer desire to display his sailing skills, he would on occasion yell at us things like “shut up” out of anger and because “we didn’t know any better” even though we also almost crushed the boat on some rocks because John is an idiot. He got in a fight with Lisa in front of everyone for no reason, and you get the gist. After we got off the boat, he didn’t even speak to us, even though we went and grabbed another bite at a cafeteria on the port which of course was what he wanted to do. He was also late for that “bite”, as he went with Lisa to talk and argue about their fight in the boat. After we got back at our room, the four of us decided to stay in, because it was already too late for us to bathe and go out. John however, wanted to go out, and of course he dragged Lisa with him, even though she wanted to stay. They left, and came back around three hours later. When they came back, he could not find a parking spot, so John called us to move our car so that he could park his. Of course, we didn’t do that, and he went on to find a place to leave his car. He was obviously very irritated in general and very angry for some reason, which we never learned. As he was searching for parking, he would pump the gas so that the engine would rev and roar and mind you, our hotel was in the middle of a very old-fashioned village, in which lived only old people with very little sound proofing. So, it must have been around 3 am, and he would make as much noise as possible. At one point, he would try to fit his car through a gap so that he could make a U-turn. Because he couldn’t fit his car, he got out, started shouting and cursing and he took a lantern he found in front of him, smashed it and through it with force, and I think he hit another car with it. All that for a damn parking spot. Of course, the rest four of us had enough, and ganged him. We forced him into a conversation so that we could understand what was wrong. He was in a defensive stance at all times, and would spout bullshit like “I don’t care about your opinions” and he would yell at the girls specifically, even his girlfriend, to shut up and not talk. We got nothing out of this conversation, and even though he seemed to soften after a point and understand what we were telling him, the next day, Lisa told us that he understood nothing of what we had told him. In general, he displayed an inability to get himself hypothetically into other people’s situations and could not see things from others’ perspectives. 

There are two more days left on our trip but this is getting too long (3000 words, sheesh) even though there are many more details I skipped so as to not make this post a whole book. Thanks for reading what could easily be a master’s thesis, and if there is any inconsistency or question please point it out or ask me in the comments. This person obviously has anger issues, and seems reluctant to seek psychological help because he does not believe in it. So what I want, is to get advice on how to proceed from here. I believe that the best course of action is to convince him to seek professional help obviously, since I am not qualified in any way to help him but I don't know how to do that. Thank you so much!!!",20Aug2020,1

I'm a 17 year old girl and have been thinking and reading about ADD for one and a half year now with the concerns about having it. I really want to go to the doctor to talk about it when I turn 18. I really have no interest in telling my parents, because I don't think they will take me seriously.

Ofcourse I don't just think I have it. I have been thinking about things in my childhood and my behaviour in which I see a lot of 'symptoms' such as no concentration and being easily distracted by my own thoughts (I have always got in trouble for it). Now ofcourse I think every kid probably has the same experience, but it never really went away with me and am still very much struggling with it.

He's now 24 and i'm 22, that made it even harder because at such a young age (14) I had no clue what depression was or feels like. My brother has really gotten to a point where he doesn't seem like a human being anymore, he's very disconnected from reality. He has mentioned suïcide and death a couple of times to my mom when they are talking. My mother is in complete distress and can barely function anymore. I get along very well with my mom and I need to support her constantly, which also has a toll on me ofc. Because I don't have a connection with my brother, I suffer less from his situation. Yes I'd like for him to get better ofc but still almost never talking to your brother for 8 years, makes you forget that you have a brother sometimes. I also have two retake exams and somehow i'm supposed to be focussed on studying, I think is studied for about 2 hours today. I feel mentally ok for a person that is in this kind of situation. Ps.

This was a quote I read today and I came back to reality of what I was. I am regretting something.

I don't know if it's the new me or if it's losing the old me.

All I can see is that I was emotion less before but now my emotionlessness has formed into regret which is making me compulsive to bear things.

I've been trying to self harm by making my finger joints reach a particular point where the tendons would start stretching.

It feels bad but in comparison to the regrets I am having it is pretty normal.

I might also start using sharp objects if my mind doesn't stay focused.

Anyway; enough rambling. I'm here to vent my frustrations, desperate that in doing so I will be provided with some clarity and relief, even it is to be only temporary. The title encapsulates my daily mindspace; I'm never really at peace with myself and I couldn't recognise true relaxation if my life depended on it. I've struggled with OCD/OCPD for years now and, to me, the distinction matters little because they're both conditions that can and do make life a living torment.

My OCD is never static, and if I manage to oust one compulsion from my life, another will surely follow in its wake. Currently, I'm waging a war against an intrusive thought that seeks to undermine my intelligence to such a degree that life itself for me threatens to grind to a very sudden and messy halt. A couple of weeks ago, I lost my temper with OCD and flew into a vicious rage. Demented, I felt like harming myself in some way was a sensible course of action, so I picked up the closest item to me and smashed my head into it. Once I'd calmed down, I sought medical advice and had sustained only a superficial wound. However, that stupid action sent me into a tailspin, and now I can't shake the idea that I've ruined what level of intelligence I had, despite a qualified medical professional assuring me that there was no damage beyond the skin of my forehead. On top of that, my mind keeps stressing to me that ""headbanging"", a way in which a metalhead such as myself expresses enjoyment of music has also impacted the capabilities of my hateful pink Hell-generator.

Hi, okay so I've been struggling with this for years now and I never talked about this with anyone but my mom and she expressed how horrible I was bc of it so I refrained to talk about it with the few friends I have or anyone online. I recently saw a tiktok about a girl with bipolar disorder talking about the exact thing I've struggled with and it not only shocks me that someone else feels the same way I do but it also makes me wonder if it might be that I have the same mental illness?  


I struggle with making and keeping friends, I only have a handful of true friends that remain my friends no matter what but over the years, I've met a lot of people and I have this thing where I attract people for some reason? people like me and wanna be my friends and sometimes, some people get suuuper attached to me and for some reason, I get attached to them as well, we start talking a lot, hanging out a lot until for some reason, all of a sudden, I start getting tired of them. Like I get really suffocated by them and even repulsed by them and can't stand even being in the same room as them so I just cut off all contact with them and start ghosting them until they get the message and leave me alone? and I feel like such an asshole for it, but I can't help it so I've been refraining from making new friends with the fear of that happening and not wanting to hurt anyone.   


It's weird because it doesn't happen with everyone, I have 4 good friends and even 1 best friend that I adore and never get tired of them but somehow, anyone that's not them, I like them for a couple of weeks or months and then suddenly hate them, like i can't stand them, anything they do annoys me and I have no clue why this happens, I wish it didn't bc I don't want to hurt people and these people really cared for me and I know it's horrible and shitty to just ghost people and cut off all contact when we used to be close but I really can't help it bc talking to them just makes me feel uncomfortable and annoyed.

I haven't been diagnosed with any mental illness aside from severe depression and anxiety over the course of 2 sessions I had with a psychotherapist but once they recommended me medication, my mom stopped paying for therapy because she's 100% against medication and even though it's been a couple of years and I'm not a minor anymore, I'm recently getting a job and don't have money to pay for a therapist. I know I must have some mental illness, or illnesses, I've known since I was a child that someone's not quite right with me but my parents always dismissed any attempt I had of trying to get some help for my mental health. I think I might have adhd or autism? I relate to every things I've read about adhd and a lot of things about autsim but again, it's just an assumption, as I haven't been diagnosed with anything since I haven't gone enough times to a professional to get the help I need. but anyway, this is only one of the problems I've been facing and I wonder if maybe someone else relates to my experience or if someone knows why I act this way?",20Aug2020,1

To get started, I (18M) have dealt with this sort of thing for the past few years. I’d say since the beginning of high school. It mainly shows itself in relationships, only to myself however. I don’t like to talk about it with others out of fear of them thinking I’m a paranoid control freak or something. 

In let’s say romantic relationships for example, it always starts out fine, but over time I get this constant feeling of nervousness/anxiety that at any moment they’re gonna drop me essentially. I don’t really know where it stems from but I always feel like I’m a day away from receiving the “Dear John” letter. On top of this I’m extremely perceptive, which only serves to exacerbate the issue, as I worry that everything is a sign that they’re going to leave me soon.

268,"The thing with fear is that it looms over you like a dark cloud. You are afraid of scenarios that you know that will 9 out of 10 times not happen. even if it ends up being so bad like you imagined, you still can come home to a space that accepts you and all your faults. It's a curse that prevents the talented and smart from achieving their full potential purely because of the fear to fail. It prevents people from making mistakes or rather seeing their mistakes as nothing more than what it is, a mistake, and not the end of the whole world.

Fear is the inability to do tasks your age group has no problem doing. The inability to just get over yourself and do what you're supposed to do. Not because you don't want to do it, but the fact that you feel like you will explode if the task at hand isn't over fast!

Fear is feeling like your whole life will be tainted if you say the wrong thing to the wrong person. Or just plainly feeling you're not doing your job good enough. It's worrying about money, careers, family, friends. But it's also worrying if the thing you bought for fun wasn't too expensive. It's worrying if you're dressing right and if it's not much (or is it too plain?)

Fear is laughing and having fun with your friends, but afterwards worrying if some of what you said made you less likeable. It's doubting if the present you got for a friend was good enough and wondering if they even liked it. It is hard to get and keep friends and feeling like a bad one yourself for not being a good one.

Fear is panicking over the small stuff and wondering why you panicked after the thing has already happened. It's fearing that you will be late and showing up way too early even though you could've have gotten half an hour more sleep easily.  


Fear is regretting that you didn't make mistakes when you were younger so you could know how to handle it better. It's doing well in class and trying to be the perfect student even though you struggle with your studies. It's saying yes to every favor and then stressing that you don't actually want it.  


Fear is being incredibly happy that you got your degree but scared to practice your art because you think that you're not in the slightest bit qualified. It's having almost a decade of practice and still thinking this.

Fear is thinking you are garbage in comparison to your peers and being embarrassed how much farther they are in life that you are. It's also being a role model for people that think that you are such a good student and while they are depending on you, you're still thinking that you are doing a bad job and trying to mask this.

Fear is being so focused on your thoughts and fears that you do not hear what the others are saying, it's focussing on your heartbeat so much it starts beating so fast you break out in sweats and start crying seemingly without reason. 

Fear is sticking to what you know and staying home because going out and doing stuff requires your brain to work overtime and sometimes it's just too much to handle. It's lashing out when people ask too much because explaining how your brain works is so much work.

Fear is not being able to get to sleep fast because you wonder about the thing bad thing you said last year to someone still sits in the back of your mind. And even though you met with this person a lot after that and they probably already forgot it. Your brain just likes to focus on it.

Fear is getting incredibly angry at people asking you to ''just take it easy'' and ''chill out'' and ''not worry about it'' because you just don't work that way, but you don't want to tell what's going on.

Fear is still trying to function like a normal person and trying to mask how you really actually feel and a lot of the time succeeding without fail, but coming home and having a complete meltdown because of the stress you're under.",20Aug2020,1
269,"I know I can always work on myself and improve, and that everyone feels pain and struggles, but for me it's just almost non stop emotional pain. No matter how cognitively aware I am of my biases and overreactions I can't seem to shut off the part of my brain that keeps flooding me with ""emotional pain chemicals.""

I wonder sometimes whether, when thinkers give advice to feelers like me, they understand that even if I KNOW that my reaction or hurt is totally irrational (and I'm talking about when I really *am* crying over nothing) that that knowledge doesn't lessen the intensity of the feeling, or really make me feel better in any way. And that usually I am already very aware on a cognitive level that my feelings are irrational, but the feeling itself is intense, primal, even infantile.

Despite knowing I am overreacting, I feel *physical pain* in my head, which begins to throb any time I feel intense embarrassment, rejection or other hurt. I also feel unable to hold back tears. My face gets red and hot and my heart begins to race and there is a distinct but hard to describe aching/clenching sensation.

I don't really know how to describe it other than that I feel this sudden and intense burst of shame or longing and on top of that there is my brain and the people around me saying ""you are thinking to much about it, there's nothing to cry about, you are imagining things, people love you."" But it doesn't do anything to help me feel less bad. I already know all of that stuff.

I can detach and ""observe"" my thoughts and feelings all I want. I can choose not to identify with them, but I don't know of any way to stop the physical sensations, the intense psychic pain, or the need for some kind of release, like crying.",20Aug2020,1

And yet every time I try to do research on Imposter Syndrome it brings up work or success or accomplishment, which I don't have this struggle with.

272,"Okay, so about half-way through lockdown I was confronted with a complete shift in mind-set and sudden decrease in my mental health. I went from having a good mental health (let’s say good to the point that if I went to a Dr I would not get a diagnosis), but I was at an anxious disposition then and have always been - to just plummeting and having absolutely no control over my emotions. My anxiety’s manifested through intense, practically debilitating hypochondria. If I was to give a complete, comprehensive explanation of everything that happened, this could be a novel - so let’s just say that I went through my ups and downs but finally got to a stable place very recently where I was feeling amazing! I had done everything to help myself; I changed my diet to be much more healthy, I practised a lot more self-care, I read lots of things. Everything that I had done to benefit myself had all cane to fruition and I was feeling incredible as a result... almost euphoric. 

But then, of course, I got a tummy bug, and to someone with health anxiety a tummy bug is not just a tummy bug, it’s 7 different types of cancers and a ruptured colon - figuratively speaking. I’m sorry to the sensitive stomachs out there, but it’s gonna be hard for me to explain my experience without getting into the graphics and TMI’s of a stomach bug (gastroenteritis). So, I began having that horrible yucky feeling you get when somethings going on in your stomach, that unsettled cold-sweat if anyone knows what I’m talking about. I had improved my mental health so much, this didn’t even worry me, I just accepted that that was how I felt for a second and moved on! But then, the following morning I was up at 4:30AM with pretty intense waves of stomach cramps and diarrhoea. No vomit thank god! I hate vomit. But yeah, that carried on for the following morning, but suddenly - I found blood. I had had tomatoes that morning so I was begging for reassurance from my nurse mother that this was just tomatoes (AH, I’m cringing at the TMI) and she was incessantly telling me that that was all it was and that I was fine. I’m pretty convinced in retrospect that it was blood, but I don’t think it’s terribly serious as this can sometimes happen with repeated diarrhoea - contrary to the hundreds of medical websites that told me to seek urgent medical advice. I cried most of that day because of this. Just overwhelmed with stress. My mind was racing with all the different scenarios that could play out - a Dr giving me a colonoscopy, finding some sort of cancer, or me being in excruciating pain and doubling over and dying. Yeah. THANK THE LORDS ABOVE, the blood stopped. 

The following morning I woke up in the same fashion, woken by stomach cramps but this time a little later. Day went out fine, I just ate bland foods that the internet recommended, but very little (I.e the BRAT diet: Bananas, Rice, Apple sauce and toast) and this decreased the stomach cramps and made me feel generally better. Fast forward to today. I woke up fine, still early, then 5 minutes later I got some tummy pains, not as intense as before, but there. Went to the toilet, all was good... yeah. But all day I’ve had constipation and it’s just made my mind go crazy! I haven’t been able to relax whatsoever. I convinced myself multiple times that I can’t touch a piece of food because it will clog up my guts and I’ll have to go to hospital and have a really unpleasant experience. I was talking to my mum about all the things that were crossing my mind and I just began to cry because of how overwhelmed I’ve made myself. And on top of all this, GCSE results today - did good! All Bs, so that was fine. Something about constipation doesn’t sit well WHATSOEVER with my health anxiety. It gives me this intense trapped feeling and makes me feel like I’m about to go into a panic attack. I’ve convinced myself I have a plethora of different abdominal diseases, even cervical cancer. I’m laying in bed now, I feel fine, just feel constipated and have lower back pain but dear god have I terrified myself. I just feel like I’m gonna throw up from anxiety and like my throat is closing. I feel physically completely fine but I’m just so mentally trained that I’m telling myself all these horrible things and the weird feeling in my tummy isn’t helping. I feel like crying.",20Aug2020,1
273,"I'm a woman in my early 20s and I've felt very misunderstood countless times throughout my life.
A summary of every single situation:
I'm speaking to someone or I'm in a group, everything is normal and I'm having a blast, later on someone tells me that I was being rude/aggressive/making someone uncomfortable/too loud etc. I end up hating myself and cry.
This has happened so many times, over years and with all sorts of people that I know that they're right. 
When I ask what exactly it was that I've said the answer is usually that it was just my tone or overall vibe. 
I've developed depression, social anxiety and I used to whisper because of this. 
I don't understand how I can perceive myself so differently.",20Aug2020,1
274,"I have a real issue with myself, which is that I never want to ""do my own thing"" if my mom is around. I consider her to be judgmental so I don't like doing things around her. Now, when she leaves, I STILL don't end up doing my own thing. I feel like when she leaves I want to spend that precious time relaxing and laying down on my phone rather than doing something productive. So I feel like I just never do my own thing or enjoy my time and I don't know how? 

I woke up at 11am and my mom isn't working today so I've done nothing except idly go on the internet all day, waiting for her to leave. It's 2pm now. I need to go to the pharmacy and also update my resume today and have no desire to do either. I don't want her to ask me about either of those things so I don't want to do it when she's here (even tho I don't even have to tell her I'm doing those things) which is resulting in me sitting around waiting for the possibility of her to leave. I've been doing nothing for 3 hours and I could've done both of my errands by now without ""wasting"" any alone time cause she hasn't left. 

I don't know. I don't really know what my problem is. I want to be productive but I have high anxiety about doing things and about enjoying the things I do.",20Aug2020,1
275,"I lived a pretty normal life with no acknowledged mental issues to speak of up until rather recently. (a few years ago)  
when i messed up my studies by not attending them however; my parents quickly sent me to a psychiatrist. By this time i was 20 years old. This was my first real experience with a psychiatrist, i'd gone to school therapists before due to often being alone during school hours but that was more a ""Are you being bullied?"" type of deal.  
This time however I was really talking about my mental state with this psychiatrist.   
I tried to explain how i dont have any motivation to do.. anything really. The Psychiatrist came to the conclusion that she couldnt help me. But she also had me take a test. This test revealed that i'm on the Autism-spectrum and have Aspergers. Most likely also depression, which i was given medicine for. It didnt appear to have any effect however and before i could try another type i went back to university for another attempt. this time with supposed 'aid' for my aspergers diagnosis.

Didnt quite work out that time either. Aid for aspergers or not.. The main issue was my extreme lack of motivation. An issue that didnt just extend to university or work. But to most if not all spectrums of my life.   
The First time i went to university i already dropped every single one of my old classmates from my social circle. i wasnt exactly much in contact with them in the first place however so that wasnt too large a change. But i also dropped many of my online friends. I simply could not think of a reason to talk to those friends.  
Now the second time i went up i started to find i could no longer motivate myself to do other things i used to enjoy. Even playing videogames or reading books, the only two interests i'd had most of my life, just didnt seem all that interesting anymore.  
By this point i'm also aware of how much i've messed up my education, I couldnt even work up the motivation to apply for a loan to pay my studies and was instead using up my savings. Months passed and i grew less and less interested in the future, often wondering if life would really be worth living? after all i had no interests to keep me happy. I was not interested in a family, and i saw no point in living on only to pay back society. I wasnt exactly sad or discontent. I was really just extremely bored and couldnt quite see a purpouse to continue living. But i was certainly scared of dying.  
I also started watching Isekai anime at around this time. I dont believe in the afterlife or anything as such.   
This made the idea of suicide easier as even if i didnt truly believe it; i could atleast lie to myself that maybe, just maybe there'll be a next life where I can actually enjoy life.  
Before i really managed to work up the courage all the way i got caught by my parents. They found out i hadnt been going to University. I then went to a University specializing in people on the autism spectrum but.. ran out of savings and couldnt continue. I also could no longer apply for a study-loan as i had technically failed studying twice now.  


This brings us to the present. I've gone to a new psychiatrist. But the only thing she's ever told me is to get more excercise and daylight. I've done both, multiple times over many years. they make it worse. She refuses to accept that idea so we've never gotten anywhere.  
Currently i have i have depression that comes and goes once or twice a month, during this time nothing i can imagine can interest me in any way, but at the same time i'm itching to do \*something\* and have a hard time to sit still.   
usually i end up moving between my desk, bed, bathroom and living room staring at nothing and trying to figure out what to do. It likely doesnt sound very serious. I'm not entirely sure how to describe it after all. But these are the moments i seriously consider suicide. during these times nothing feels right.  
Outside of those periods i do nothing but read books. Alot of books. Anywhere between 100 and 250 chapters a day, of webnovels that is. I've run out of books on multiple sites i've used to visit. I only really read Fantasy as a genre so there's a somewhat limited quantity. I barely do anything else, and even when i try; i never enjoy them for more than an hour or two.  
I Only have one friend/social contact i talk to semi-regularly as i lost interest even in talking to people.  
I'm well aware at this point that i'm only reading to keep myself occupied. I cant see anything i want to do in the future as far as my life goes. The only real reason i'm not killing myself is because i quite frankly dont have the courage to.  
If my life situation gets worse; i might manage to work up the courage. But what i'm here to ask; is there a way to solve this? a way to re-awaken motivation?  
Even making a post like this on reddit is a decision i made 2 years ago. it took until today before i finally actually did it, and i've been thinking about it pretty much daily for the past few weeks. 

It's really difficult to even ask for help as i'm often not even sure i want help.",20Aug2020,1

281,"""The meaning of life is to find your gift.

The purpose of life is to give it away.""

\-Pablo Picasso

&amp;#x200B;

In that spirit, I shall take this leap of faith.

While I hope to make enough money to pay the bills, to help me get by, and to allow me to support causes I believe in;

First and foremost:

I hope to improve quality of life, and change the world for the better, as much as I am able.

&amp;#x200B;

To lean this world we share toward balance, and away from intolerable extremism;

Away from hate, ignorance, malevolence, and cycles of violence and abuse.

I hope to help people see more, to understand their own weakness, to find their own inner strength to confront insufficiency, and their own inner brilliance to find wisdom.

I hope to speak at great length, and in whatever detail necessary, about uncomfortable subjects that deserve speaking about; to make life more comprehensible and more bearable for people who have felt left behind or made less, whatever the original cause.

&amp;#x200B;

I come from a broken home, born into turmoil, and am quite familiar with the sense of being left behind.

My father gone without proper explanation before I was three, to prison for the the critically unhealthy and wounding things he did.

My four older siblings before I was a teenager, all much older and off to start their own lives, to escape from the ugliness of their shared history, our broken family.

My mother did the best she knew how to do, and did much of it quite well, but much damage was already done, and the world is difficult for single parents with ugly pasts.

Her own insufficiencies, all quite understandable and human, took their own additional toll.

&amp;#x200B;

I have bullied and been bullied, I have broken and been broken.

I have had to put my body between the vulnerable and the harmful more times than I care to remember, since I was two years old.

I have, in loneliness and ignorance, embraced predatory sexual abuse from another, while not yet a teenager.

I would not understand the damage already done, and to be undone, until much later.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not the first of my siblings to suggest that we are lucky to have all made it so far without one of us turning to the finality of suicide.

I do not know with certainty, but at this point, I assume we've all considered it.

I have, since I was six years old.

&amp;#x200B;

I would not be truly able to begin working on rebuilding myself for more than twenty years, but it is never too late to grow.

It only matters that you try, again and again and again.

It is my responsibility to put in the time and effort to do the mending, to understand the pain, the damage.

I am human, and have paved my path with many mistakes, many of them inherited from people who came before me.

Learning them intimately is what allows me to move on from them, and become stronger.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to learn my mental and sexual health from the ground up, and hope to pass on whatever useful things I may excavate, so that they may serve You and push your life closer to Ultimate Meaning and humility and strength and passion.

The light at the end of the tunnel, not a goal, but a guide.

A lighthouse beacon in the storm to remind you: the night is dark and the crushing waves are terrible, but all hope is not lost from the world.

Fight onward.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

My gift is to see from a different perspective,

my purpose, to articulate the things I see.

To illustrate as much as I can,

to create new worlds, filled with old ideas.

To build many a looking-glass around complex subjects, so that things may be seen from new angles, in the hope of bringing understanding.

To step forward through the tall grass and look further, and tell those who come after what may lie ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

I am working on a Story, many intimately interlinked stories.

I hope it can cover vitally important ideas and communicate them, in their multi-varied depth and complexity, to as many people as have interest to immerse themselves.

I do not know when it will see the light of day, but I promise You, whoever you are:

As much of it that can be seen wholly, will be seen.

I will no longer hold back what is worth expressing.

As vast and overwhelming as it is to me now, bare and skeletal, I know that I have a great deal left to add.

&amp;#x200B;

Until then,

I will speak when I have something to say, interact when I am able, and will continue to post my artwork publicly, in the hope that the world may see something they do not yet understand, but have the patience to look closely and think, and learn.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot promise I will post all of my artwork, but I hope to have the courage to do so.

I cannot promise I will post often, or regularly, but I hope to always have something worth sharing.

I cannot promise I will not offend, offense is a belligerent and cheaply-borne thing, so I shall endeavor to care for it little or not at all.

I cannot promise I will not change my mind, on any subject, as I have every right to do so.

I embrace change as inevitable and bursting with limitless potential, and encourage You do as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish strength and meaning and passion and peace for You, but remind you that these precious commodities are only found with Your own time and effort.

I am a mental health sufferer and have been for nearly a decade now. I suffer with anxiety and depression and I have been to the edge a couple of times, but have been self harm free for the last 9 months so very happy about that.

My mental health stems from a lot of negativity and toxicity surrounding relationships with my family - most of which I have cut ties with. I have tried lots of different treatments and tried different medications to help me through, but the one that works for me is escapism, and I achieve this through gaming.

As part of my university degree, I studied the effects of digital technologies on helping to treat mental health patients, and I found the results to be quite amazing. So amazing that I have decided to follow up on it nearly a year later and being to try to create a mental health support community via Twitch. At the moment, I am streaming games and inviting people in to chat, relax, vent, and help create a support network, whilst employing the use of escapism. So far, the support and growth has been small but steady, and people are slowly getting on bored. In time, I hope to do streams where a percentage of the donations will be going straight to a mental health charity, to help fund further support to help those in need.

I am reaching out to people to get my community to grow and create this vision that I have - a community of people all trying to help out their fellow man get through their life struggles.

284,"Hi everyone,

I'm an 18 year old male. Our family has no history of cancer, its just recently that a 60 year old uncle of mine got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Ever since I've developed a fear of cancer.

Recently I've started developing/probably imagining symptoms. 

I used to get headaches and start panicking thinking i have a brain tumor, but the headaches got solved when i got prescribed some typer of glasses turns out i was just sensitive to bright lights.

Now, i have some gastrointestinal problems. Constipation, excess gas and feeling of fullness having lasted me for almost a month now. I'm starting to think i have some cancer/tumour somewhere in my digestive tract. I also had haemorrhoids a week ago (this was genuine and not part of my health anxiety) That thought has made me really depressed and I've developed anxiety

I can't sleep well, eat without worry, I don't laugh anymore. Every time i go to the toilet i expect to see blood or some weird stuff in my stool that may indicate a sign of cancer but so far its just constipation. I am going crazy i dont enjoy anything anymore. I find myself sometimes fidgeting unknowingly. I'm trying to cope by playing excess video games to get my mind distracted.

Part of me tells me I dont have cancer cause im too young and there's no family history of it, but part of me leans to cancer affects anyone at anytime.

 I've told my parents of my symptoms and they just brushed me off. I've seen a doctor who just gave me anti acidity medicine for 2 weeks but I've not seen much change. 

I believe it could be psychological because when i got the haemorrhoid episode the bowel syndromes kind of disappeared for that week due to the pain the haemorrhoid caused made my mind distracted. Now the haemorrhoids are gone and I'm even worse. 

I live in a third world country so therapy is out of my options. Its hard to find a therapist let alone a good one. Should i push my parents for a specialist review and an endoscopy/colonoscopy?

287,"I am 17, and I still haven't solved my issue of self deprecation and self loathing. It is so tiring, because I truly try to discern between what is rational and irrational. I try to push myself towards a state of self awareness, but even with being self aware I am unable to make myself truly believe the rationale. And at night, especially, I recall all of the reasons that lead me to hate myself. The reasons are cemented, and I truly don't know if I will ever be able to walk the path of self acceptance. 

Sometimes I go through such intense phases of sadness and just overall self hatred that my body just shakes. I can feel my anxiety rising, and my entire body begins to itch. I start to sweat and my body begins to feel like a furnace. It lasts throughout the day in varying degrees. When I am in school, my anxiety skyrockets, and I get this tingling and crawling sensation all over my body. I am just so tired of feeling this way. 

I have no friends, and it used to not bother me but now it has just become a source of added self loathing. I just truly hate myself, and it is hard to explain to others. When I confide in a family member they brush off the severity, and maybe it's because they simply can't recognize deep self hatred because they have never dealt with it. They aren't accustomed to that level, and so they identify it as a normal adolescent reaction to growing up. 

But, I know it is just not that. I genuinely hate myself, and it has stopped me from making friends. I feel so uneasy with myself in almost every situation, and it feels as though I can't trust myself. I feel shallow, because it seems that I just spend my time trying to reflect the projections of others. I just want to please every ones subjective ideas of what a good person is. And that is the worst part of it all. I truly don't know who I really am at times. What do I want? I don't know, and it's terrifying to walk around aimlessly just trying to fulfill what others want. It has hinder my own growth in so many areas.

And I also just feel so disgusted with myself, because of my same sex attraction.  I wasn't raised in a homophobic family, and yet I still have this yearning to be heterosexual. I was sexually abused as a child, and sometimes I think that maybe that caused me to have a same sex attraction. I don't know. To this day I am still disgusted with myself for being sexually abused. I feel so deeply sick just thinking about everything that happened, and I can't get over it. I just feel like the nastiest person on Earth, and I just wish it never would have happened. Some days I can't stop thinking about it, and my mind just forces me to recall everything. 

I just don't want to do this anymore, but I am too scared to kill myself. If I killed myself I don't think my mother would be able to recover. Her life has been messed up in so many ways, and I don't want to add on to that. I truly think that if I killed myself that would be the last straw. And as much as I do hate myself I know that she would truly break.",20Aug2020,1
288,"Small recap on my situation: 25yo male, 180 cm (~6'0), 160kg (~342 lbs). Been slightly depressed from 16 yo onward, then it hit me like a truck at 18. Decided to seek help 2.5 years ago, have been on fluoxetine for 1.5 years, now on duloxetine ~1 year rn. Done psychotherapy, didn't help on the long term. Studying engineering, about halfway there after 6 years (it's a 3 year course).
  
I started dieting a lot of times, always have given up. It takes next to nothing for me to give up whatever goal I have in mind and I set myself back. 
  
Example: I've been doing paleo keto (followed by a medic) and I try my hardest. Already lost 6kg (12 lbs), but whenever I get a bad day (i.e. I try to study and don't understand, or something doesn't go the way I planned or literally anything, even stupid shit, that upsets me happen, I give up. I find myself laying on bed, thinking of all my failures and such (you know the drill). I eat outside of my dieting plan, which stalls my weight loss. Then I see I didn't lose any more weight and the cycle continues.
  
How can I stop all of this? As I said, I tried medicines and  psychotherapy, but am still here. How do you guys manage to stick to a goal (like dieting or studying for an exam) without losing the will to do it (giving up or procrastinating)?

I feel like I should not be in this world. It is not my place, people do not understand me. I have a great family and 5 wonderful best friends, I love them. So theoretically I should be a happy person. I have family, friends, hobby, I am able to study aboard, I was traveling a lot, people say that I am a nice person with good hearth. But it does not work. I know that they will help me, I kniw that they care about me. But they cannot understand of what I feel. I know it because I was talking with them about my feelings, my problems and so on and they really do not understand me. Or I cannot explain that, it is also possible. To be honest, I was thinking about suicide, sometimes I am still doing it. But I believe one day I will be stronger, healthier and ""full of beans"". And I do not want to make my mum sad. She (and the rest of my wonderful humans) are more important than me. I am living for them. Making them sad will be the worst. I am trying to live for them and for myself but I cannot yet. One day probably I will do it, but not tonight and not tomorrow. 
Actually my biggest dream is to say totally honest with myself I AM HAPPY IN THIS MOMENT. 
You know... I just needed to say it. (I am in touch with therapist so do not worry about that).

294,"My neighbor sexually abused me when I was 7 (he was 12 then). Only recently I started telling people I trust about this. I thought about telling my mother about it, then I thought she might feel guilty in a way, because she didn't protect me.

I’ve done this once before when I was on the toilet and rammed my head into my knee cap today I was sitting in bed crying after a horrible day I’ve had feeling helpless,angry, sad etc... and leaned my head forward to then swing it back and bang it on my head board. 

Tbh it was kind of therapeutic and helped me not be so upset. 

I guess I just want to know if these urges are normal or if I should be concerned. I’ve had them more recently in the past year (my parents got divorced a little over a year ago) but have only acted on them twice now.",20Aug2020,1

There are two elements to an effective recovery program for ‘mental’ disorders: the core work and the implementation. Replacing your maladaptive thoughts and behaviors with positivity and empowerment holds the key to your future wellbeing and happiness. Rather than focusing on what is wrong with you, the wellness program emphasizes your character strengths and abilities that facilitate your recovery. You have always had the power to change; you need to embrace it and make it work for you. 

The COVID19 crisis makes it impossible for us to go into the community and implement all the hard work we do together, but that should not discourage your recovery efforts. Every client works within a customized platform of integrated approaches best suited for their problem and situation. Since COVID19 impedes effective implementation, we will spend more time on the core-work in preparation for the implementation phase post COVID19. 

Every challenge presents opportunity, and the platform for recovery that we prepare together will be even more durable. I urge you to resist the temptation to procrastinate your recovery during this crisis. The comprehensive, personalized attention I provide to my clients severely limits the number of persons I can help. If your condition is affecting your emotional wellbeing and quality of life, now is the best opportunity to do something about it. Get in touch with me as soon as possible, so we can create your individualized program and begin your recovery process. You deserve the best life possible, and nothing should hold you back. For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these, “It might have been.”",20Aug2020,1

302,"TW// suicide, self harm

First, Some background about me. I’ve (19f) been diagnosed with depression and been struggling with it for six years now. It’s been a tough journey of rocking from stability to relapsing—I’ve even relapsed twice this year alone. The relapses have been getting worse, to the point where I learned how to cut myself last February before my friends had an intervention and I stopped self-harming since then. It scares me that I have the ability to go to the lowest of lows, that I can be numb enough to go through with a plan. I’ve never self-harmed ever before then, so it really terrified me of what I’m capable of. I was fine until June 2020, where I ended up in another relapse (with the pandemic and financial stress and all), and I was getting real suicidal real fast.

This is where my friend comes in. They’ve been a good college friend and we met our freshman year through a cultural club—getting closer to each other after the pandemic happened and we were forced to quarantine. They’ve become one of my closest friends and we’d spend a lot of time together. I’ve learned a lot about them and they inspire me so much as an artist (we’re both in art-related majors). I’ve basically watched them grow in their newfound relationship with their boyfriend and we’ve been each other’s supporters ever since that year.
We clicked not only because of our interests, but I felt like we grew closer because we understood each other too. They have depression, like me, as well as bipolar II. There was a sense of solidarity and a safe space, because there was no judgment whatsoever. I guess the same can be said in joining groups or communities like these, you feel like you’re not alone in your emotions.
Because of that strong bond, they’ve actually helped push me to that step I needed to finally seek professional help. I have a therapist now, and I’ve gone through a month and a half of group therapy. I’m a bit more stable than I was in February or June, but it just makes my stress tolerable. I’ve just learned better coping mechanisms that can keep me safe, but those suicidal and depressing thoughts aren’t completely gone.

Anyways, Here’s my dilemma.

They’re going into a bad relapse at this moment as well. They live in an unhealthy home environment, and our university basically went fully remote last minute. We have both planned to be roommates at off-campus housing but after the school’s announcement, we have to stay at home. I guess it’s accumulative from the stress from an abusive family, as well as financial stress from unable to terminate our leases (fuck landlords by the way). There must be a lot more that they haven’t told me as well, so I can’t assume that’s the entire story—it may be the tip of the iceberg.
Every passing day, I get so worried over them. I care so much about their well-being, but every time I try to console them, I feel like it falls on empty ears. I know this from experience too...sometimes when my friends or family talk to me it goes over my head and my mind takes over, distorting their words. I don’t know how else to get them the help they need, and it seems like they’re getting increasingly suicidal by the hour.
I’m also one of the only people they talk to, besides their boyfriend. They only trust the two of us, and they don’t want or have the energy to talk to anyone else or meet new people. 
So I usually listen to them vent their feelings bc I always offer that support. I want them to feel safe with me, to know that I’ll be there for them. 
Though it’s been like this for a month now and I’m afraid it’s taking an emotional toll on me. I feel guilty and powerless that I feel this way, because I love them and I want them to be okay. But I have to admit, sometimes it does get a little triggering? When they vent their frustrations, it sounds so familiar to how I talk to myself when I’m suicidal as well. It kinda transports me back to that dark place. After listening to them vent, I kinda get back into my own depressive thoughts and I grow a bit numb. I could relate to them a little too well sometimes, and other times I can’t relate at all. 
I only have depression, so I don’t know much about Bipolar II. I did look it up and researched it to get a better sense of the disorder, but yet again, everyone’s experience is different and unique that I really can’t judge it by some internet sources. 
And while I do want to help lift their burden, I can’t help but feel like they’re becoming a bit emotionally dependent on me? I know it’s a really bad thing to think about but I feel like it’s building up bit by bit. They constantly need reassurance, and while I have no problem supporting them, it gets a lil emotionally draining at times. To the point where they’d only eat when I’m eating (asking me if I’m eating dinner so they can eat dinner, or if it’s okay for them to take a snack), if they’d ask me if their family hates them, if their boyfriend is going to leave, etc. I’d give compliments and reaffirmations and support, but it’s always met with a “do you really think so?” Or “are you lying?”. I really really have to convince them.
Sometimes, I feel like they only talk to me when they’re venting or distressed as well..
They turn to me immediately when they’re dealing with family problems or relapsing or relationship problems. That kinda takes over 90% of our conversations now. One situation stuck with me I guess: I was really passionate about a film idea I had so I wanted to share it with them. In response I just got one message like “yeah I guess you can do more research about the topic” before they immediately went to venting about their father and I had to comfort them afterwards.
I fear that our friendship may be turning to an unhealthy route. I want to help them feel better, but at the same time, I want to look after my own mental health as well. I don’t want to be selfish. Though, I’m really lost and I don’t know what to do at this point. I want to help but I feel like I’m being stretched thin. 
They’re in crisis all of the time and are basically over the edge, so I don’t want to leave them alone because I want them safe. I most certainly do not want to say the wrong thing—usually I have to take caution in how I write messages or how I word things, in case it feeds to their depression or makes them feel even worse.
Has anyone had a situation like this? Any advice/resources is greatly appreciated. I live in California in the United States, if there are any local services in my area that I can turn to.

I apologize if this sounds selfish or arrogant of me, I am genuinely wanting to learn better and want to learn how to be a better friend in their time of need. Maybe this is a sign that I still need more therapy and that I need to recover a bit more myself?",20Aug2020,1
303,"ever since i was a little kid i’ve been on the bigger side, and i’ve always been extremely insecure about it. in the past, i used to think “oh hey by the time im sixteen ill probably have lost the weight!”, but now that i have turned sixteen and still look the same i’ve been extremely worried and stressed about it. i feel like i’m losing time and that i’m never going to ever feel confident about my body. this has plagued me my entire life, filled it with so much self-doubt and no self-confidence at all, and i just hate myself so so so much. i feel like i rely on what other people think about me and feel like crap when i know i can’t meet their standards. the small things get to me too, like when my friends talk about all the pretty clothes they wanna buy while i sit there knowing ill never be able to fit in those clothes and look good, or when i need an extra shirt and my skinny friend tells me i can borrow her shirt when obviously i wouldnt fit into it. i dont know... sometimes i feel like im so dramatic. i can’t even say that im fat out loud because i like to try and pretend i’m not. i recently asked my mom for a therapist, because i have never told anyone about how i feel towards my body. i had a few therapy sessions these past few weeks and i’ve cried so hard in every single one because it just feels so different telling a real life person about my feelings. 

now, here’s my question. are my problems valid? sometimes, i feel like im wasting my therapist’s time because i know a lot of other people struggle with this too so is it just how the human brain works? my mom told me that she doesn’t take my “depression” seriously because she said i’ll grow out of it. she also talked about how hard other people have it right now especially because of the pandemic which is causing people to lose their jobs and all. and i know im privileged, i do. i know that i’m able to have an education, buy the things i want, eat good food, travel to places, and all those things... so are my body insecurities stupid? is it dumb that i just want to look at myself in the mirror for once and see someone that looks pretty? is it so bad i want to be able to take pictures and feel like hey i should post this on instagram i look good! is it so bad i want to be able to take goofy selfies and send them to my friends? am i an idiot for wanting to go clothes shopping and not having to worry and feel embarrassed about clothes not fitting me and wear cute fits like any other teenage girl instead of wearing the same 5 outfits? i just want to know what you guys think because im at a loss. thank you.",20Aug2020,1

305,"If you don’t have time for these next few paragraphs then that’s okay, don’t feel like you *have* to read this or anything. I just felt it would be good for my mental health to at least vent to somebody that can give me advice on how I’ve been feeling lately.

First, I suppose I should give a bit of background as to why I’ve been feeling so down. All my life I’ve been dealing with an emotionally and mentally abusive mother who manipulated my step-father and all my half-siblings into treating me the same that she does. I have my real father and step-mother who lived close by, accompanied by two other half-siblings, but I didn’t live with them because my biological mother claimed custody of me from a young age. Let me begin with recent events.

Eventually, I moved out back in either late February or early March of 2020 and am currently living with what I consider the “good” of my two families. It was a nice start at first, but then things felt like they were slowly falling apart. This side of my family has always had a habit of starting terrible verbal fights over the littlest of things, and I never got used to that, and it even got to the point where I felt as if I should be the “family therapist” and try and resolve any problems that arise. This usually isn’t appreciated, as I am consistently told that “Arguing is a healthy part of any relationship” which I really just don’t see. I’ve been in a happy relationship with my girlfriend for 2 years now and we have never fought once. We prefer to very calmly discuss any differences we may have in a very civil manner. I should also mention that I think I may have bipolar depression and anxiety (I am very unsure, however, as I have never received any sort of official diagnosis. This has caused many problems within this household for the past 6 or 7 months.

My dad disregards any claims I make about anxiety or depression, and constantly blames me for not telling him about mental health issues I may be having. I have grown distant and reclusive as a result, because I really don’t know where to go, other than constant venting with my girlfriend. She says she’s okay with the amount of venting I do, as she reciprocates just as much. Though, I know that I need some sort of actual therapist or counselor or something. Until then, though, I kinda just feel stuck and hollow. My emotions seem to be dwindling and everything is spiraling out of control. I can’t talk to family because they seem to just forget about the heart-to-heart moments I’m desperately trying to have, though they’re always open to an argument.

Another thing I would like to add is the fact that every year my dad, brother and I take these personal camping trips that range from a week to a week and a half in total nothingness. I am not a big camper, but I typically accompany him because I know that’s what he would want. This year, however, I told him two weeks prior that I would prefer to opt-out of the trip. Although he said he respects my decision, him and my step-mom have been holding it over my head and guilt-tripping me to go, and get upset when I continuously tell them I would prefer to stay home and focus on important things, like getting a license and preparing for college. Things that my last two parents failed to help me with. I am 18 now, and should have all the freedom in the world. But it really feels like I’m super boxed in as of late and I’m really not in a happy place.

I really don’t feel like I’ve been intentionally hurting anyone, I just really am struggling to connect with my family, and it feels like they’re almost tired of trying to figure out what’s wrong with me mentally while I’m struggling to do the same. Either that or they don’t want to confront the issues I’m having, which seems more likely because they’ve mocked my anxiety by telling me I’ve never had it and have mocked my depression by blatantly ignoring it.

I’m not going to commit suicide or hurt myself or anything, I have more self-awareness than that. I just really hate feeling so tired and useless all the time. I desperately want to be happy again but it seems like all my efforts are in vain. Even now, my family barely even looks at me because my parents are offended I’m in my room so much taking time to myself. They don’t say “Hi” after work anymore and conversations are brief if they’re not about what I could be doing better.

This is the most lost and unsure I’ve ever felt in my life and would like some opinions or advice that might help if anyone has the time, I’m desperate.",20Aug2020,1

It didn't really hit me until today that ever since I found cooking it's been easier to be productive, I'm in a good mood most of the time, my kids notice that I'm happier and my relationship is absolutely benefitting from it.
