0,"Hear me out.
I've always known there's something seriously wrong with me. I used to tell my mom all the time, for years, sine the age of 10. She pacified me, and she still does. 
I've been dating a man for almost three years. He was my first love, my first heartbreak (which was horrendous, btw) and the only man I've ever been capable of feeling anything with. He's always told me the same. 
I'm mentioning this because I (23F) and he (25M) have a relationship full of problems. One of them is how I operate. 
I have to have a clean house. 
I HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAN HOUSE. 
I have to live in a museum, basically. 
This has caused so many problems. I cant tell yall the kind of problems this has caused. 
We've been living together for almost 3 years now. Not once have I accomplished getting all my cleaning done in a day. 
This is vital, because if I don't, I fucking.loathe.my.self. 
More so than I already do. 
He's been pushing me to do self care shit for God knows how long now. He always says it's an excuse, which is a horrible thin to say to me, in my opinion, because I've worked my ass off to get out of a lifelong depression (no exaggeration) before and succeeded. 
I succeeded until he broke my heart. I watched the soul i pulled out of the deepest depths of hell fly out of my bedroom window that day. 
Also not an exaggeration. 
I was always yearning for a clean home. I grew up in filth and I always felt it played a role in depression- even when I was too young to know that, I knew that. 
Once I had moved out, and had a place of my own, you can bet your ass it was spotless. However, it wasn't to the extent it is now. 
I'm getting off topic. 
My point was: I cannot do self care shit in an environment that isn't clean. 
I've tried explaining it to him for years and it's nothing less than an argument each time. 
I'm not avoiding self care. I beg, plead, work my ass off until I feel as though I'm worthy enough of a bubble bath. That's how I operate. 3 years, and I have taken a bubble bath living here yet. 
I've been relentlessly researching all over the place, trying to figure out why I'm miserably, painfully, cripplingly depressed. Why i can't control my thoughts. Why I have to be the ways I am.
I began taking certified online tests for different shit. 
I tested a 38/40 for OCD, and just as high for ADHD. Didn't expect either, but certainly not the ADHD. That was a surprise on top of the surprise OCD; the OCD clicked immediately. 

I was nervous to tell my partner. 
Depression and anxiety talks go horribly, and i always always always always regret ever talking, or expressing any of it- whether that's in body language, behavior, or verbally. 

I was nervous to tell him because I knew how much it would explain. I was nervous because I knew he wouldn't realize that all his critics, judgements, harsh words and so on would be brought up, and i know he isn't going to even think about any of that. 

I was nervous because I'm scared to explain to him how I came to find out. 

I was nervous because meds can help, and he's completely against them, and has fought me on my want to be on meds.

He was nothing close to comforting. 
I've been aching over this for four days (since I found out) and he's aware of it. 

""I'm confused. There's a ton of people with it. I have people in my family who have it. I don't understand why you're so worked up"" 
... I just found out that I have to relearn how to live my life. I literally clean every fucking day, relentlessly, and always have. Nonetheless, why? Why did I do it? What else am I doing that isn't me? Or is it me? Am I really that into cleaning or am I doing it because of ...(?) Who knows. 
Not me. 
Of course I'm ""worked up"" and upset. I just found out I'm basically living in a lie, like, to myself. 
I kept calm and gave him an answer of ""I just found something out about myself that I had no idea about"". Which is when he asked the following:
""Well what're you going to do now? When are you going to see a doctor?"" 
I reminded him that I don't have an extra cent to my name, no insurance, and i actually have less than a cent to my name. Like literally. Healso knows I cannot, will not, ever feel safe or okay with him paying for more than what he does already. I didnt say any of this angrily, though he says I did. But, that's another story. 

He wasn't sweet. 
He wasn't cheerful. 
He made me feel like shit for taking online tests (CERTIFIED, by med professionals). 
He didn't hold me, touch me, whatever. Nothing. Even though he can see I'm clearly upset, AND knowing I was scared shitless to tell him. 
He gave me so much shit for those two things alone, and kept saying how ""confused"" he was. He told me he'd drop it until I were to bring it up again. 

He didn't say anything about how I did all this work, trying to figure out what it is that's wrong with me. He didn't give me any credit for doing any of this, especially with the house not being up to my standards. He didn't congratulate me for being one step closer to finding out. He didn't say a thing that was positive, sweet, helpful, or hopeful. Nothing. 

I'm bitter as fucking fuck right now. 
I'm hurt. I am so hurt. 
I've had two, hyperventilating type of anxiety attacks today. 
In one day. 
Which, again, he was aware of. 

I dont know what to do. I don't know how to behave around him now, and I'm super stressed, super anxious about the weekend (his kid will be here and that amps up my anxiety times approx 1billion) and I really just want to not leave the bed. 
But, that's not acceptable and therefore I am lost. 

I'm sorry the post was so long, but if you read it until here, thank you. Sincerely.",28May2020,1
1," My Dad has been mentally unwell after suffering a breakdown in January 2019. He's spent a considerable amount of time in hospital but since being discharged refuses to engage with any form of help offered to him. He barely takes care of himself and pushes all his basic care needs onto me, I also handle all his financial matters and everything to do with his housing, bills, groceries etc. Besides basic hygiene he's done nothing for himself in the last year, yet he still complains when I do anything for him and also complains that his life is awful. He shows no intention of making any changes to this, it seems like this is how he plans on staying for the rest of his life. I'm beyond frustrated at this point. I'm heavily pregnant, I've had to take on his entire life when I'm only in my 20s myself, I was in the middle of building my own life. The situation he puts me in is I can choose being spread way too thin trying to improve things for him and make him comfortable only to be berated for it or I can do only the basics for him and feel all the guilt that comes with knowing he sits around living a miserable life (he'll remind me of that too). He's like a child, nothing is good enough e.g. When he got out of hospital he refused to go back to his house, I sold the house and got him a different house, he doesnt like that house either says it's a ""shit hole"", I start decorating and furnishing to improve the house, he doesn't want it decorated and tells me I make everything worse, the furniture is still in the boxes it came in, he says the house is cold, I set his heating to come on and he turns it off everytime I leave, I tried to fill his fuel tank so he doesnt worry about having the heating on, again he tells me I make everything worse because he doesn't want his fuel tank filled yet rest assured when it's completely empty it will be my responsibility to get it filled immediately regardless of what I'm doing at that time or how much it costs. 

I resent him for his selfishness. Particularly that he sees no merit in trying to improve or take the help he's being offered, i think if not for himself surely to relieve me of having to be a carer for my parent while also becoming a parent myself for the first time. He appreciates nothing I've done for him, I sacrificed a well paid job and dropped out of University but yet he says I've left him. He's never asked me about my pregnancy, never asked about his soon to be first grandchild and when I tell him things I get the vibe that he's jealous or anxious like an older sibling would be about not getting the same attention anymore. I was severely ill at the start of pregnancy and he'd respond to the news of this with ""...whos going to get my groceries?"" 

I don't want to be part of his life anymore. I'm sick of the intense guilt I feel, no matter how hard I try I know he still feels lonely and abandoned and miserable. I'm so happy in my life and when I get those moments where I feel so accomplished and thankful for my life the thoughts of my Dad take that away and I feel selfish for enjoying what I have when my Dad feels like he has nothing and no one. But I can't change that for him, I've tried so hard to. I don't want this taking me away from my son or my partner. Caring for my Dad consumes a lot of me and takes away my ability to feel happiness without guilt. I drive away from his house crying and worn out. I dont want this to impact my child.

There's no one else that will take over and care for him if I stop, if I hadn't managed all this for him he'd be homeless or possibly dead. I dont feel like i have a way out and he's certainly never going to change. Do I just accept its his choice to live this life? To wallow in self pity and wait for others to do everything? I don't know what to do anymore.",28May2020,1
2,"I’m really trying my best to stay away from my bad coping mechanisms, but I’m really THIS CLOSE to self harm. I have not been diagnosed by any medical doctor but I really want to talk to one now because I’m starting to lose it. I have long suspected that I do have a mental health problem but I never reached out to anyone because I am not comfortable of my family knowing about it.

5,"When I was younger, I suffered quite a bit from selective mutism. It’s difficult to pinpoint where it started, but my pre-k teachers were fairly abusive, and made it seem as though it was wrong for me to speak. And they’d scream at me a lot. So I began to talk less in school, and then not at all except for when I was at home with my Mom. I guess the teachers just told my Mom I was shy or something, or that I was fine, because I hadn’t been placed into therapy until three years later in kindergarten. I didn’t like it much as they treated me more like I was autistic, talking to me in simple ways, made me participate in stupid coordination activities, and actually told my Mom I showed signs of autism. So I went to a psychiatrist after a little while of in-school therapy, and they said I had selective mutism. Despite having trouble relating to my peers and having to receive intensive therapy in which I was being convinced to talk — I still didn’t want to. I think part of the reason I look back to my childhood with such fondness is because there was no expectation put in place for me. It’s not like I had any goals to fulfill as a 6 year old, so me not talking couldn’t really hurt me. But as time went on, I became more involved in my fantasy world, and since I couldn’t relate to others, I believed everything in my head was real. Like the person that narrated my inner monologue actually lived somewhere, and people could control all the ways I functioned. I still have intensely abstract thoughts like this, but usually some crap like homework being brought up will take me back to reality. It wasn’t until 11 when I had received tons of speech therapy, and O.T. (to correct my pencil grip,) that I actually started making an effort to talk to others. And when I did, a lot of people found me to be really entertaining (and I guess witty as I’m still referred to these days.) I had more time to think about my actions, and the way I would make people laugh, and realized it brought me a lot of joy. So I continued on with it for a while, making friends I’d carry into middle school. I was still a very quiet kid, but with all the good first impressions I made, I had some friends to guide me through the world. Yet when middle school hit, I found myself more concerned with social norms and the ways we relate to others. I was rejected by all my crushes, and my teachers would yell at me for talking too much with my friends, and grades became something to be concerned about. Yet, I coped with these things despite not being used to them, and the pain they caused me. I desperately wanted to revert back to my original state of living in my head, and never talking, never being criticized for my actions — because I barely had any. Yet my friends helped me get through it, and so did the joy I garnered from making others laugh. When it came time to apply to high schools, I was rejected by all, and thus had to go to the “second round” of applications (it’s a nyc thing.) I was accepted to a relatively bad school, where fights happen, and where I became a drug user. This is when I became extremely sad, as my efforts to leave my inner world were futile, and I figured I might as well have stayed in my shell. But I had friends then, and hobbies, like basketball and producing music — I couldn’t give up on that. Either way, I made it through high school just fine and have some cool friends now, I’m 17 now. Yet, after having dealt with a lot of upsetting things lately, and not having to talk to others (especially since it’s quarantine,) I find myself yearning to revert back. I miss my old self that didn’t give a fuck what others thought of me, even if I was intensely weird. I guess I just wanted to rant, and ask how you guys deal with wanting to revert back to negative pasts? I miss my childhood and dream world, that I find hard to maintain as it clashes too much with reality — even if it was unhealthy for me. What do I do?",28May2020,1
6,"Someone posted a funny thing on twitter like, “was 7th grade your worst middle school year or are you normal.” And it just made me think back to show truly miserable middle school was for me.

My mom suffered from alcoholism for YEARS. Probably 14 years (she no longer drinks) and that led to years of neglect and verbal abuse, although she wouldn’t call it that.

I remember 7th and 8th grade being the best/ worst years ever; probably because our lives were soo unstable. My mom and dad are separated and have been since I was in the 7th grade. This was a long time coming, and our dad lived very close so I didn’t take it hard.

The same day (yes, same day. Literally hours later) my dad moved out, my mom took in her terrible boyfriend. My parents had been separated long before he actually moved out, so I was aware they’d both moved on romantically.

My mom’s boyfriend was nothing but an alcoholic, he didn’t work, my mom didn’t either. They spent child support on liquor and she would throw a fit when I asked to use it to buy something for me. 

My dad although he had a place of his own, paid for our cable, phones, rent, and gave my mom money when she chewed his head off about him owing her everything. Her one job was to keep up with the electric bill. Could she do that? No.

I remember our electricity and hot water turning off several times throughout the years (spring, summer, and early fall since it is illegal to cut it off during winter). And I remember having to do my homework while it was still light outside, because once it got dark out, I wouldn’t get a chance to. I showered in cold water, and would get hives each time (a skin disorder) and it would get so bad that I opted to shower 2 times a week only.

My mom never showed me how to properly care for myself, so it took being bullied in 8th grade for being dirty and smelling bad for me to start looking up “how to hand wash my clothes properly” and “how to not sweat so much so I don’t stink” turns out- no amount of body spray and can hide a bad odor LOL (kidding... now)

I had to endure loud arguments between my mom and her boyfriend, and quite literally had to stop my mom from doing serious physical damage so she wouldn’t get in legal trouble. In two years alone she had several abort*ons (I am sorry if that is triggering, it hurts my heart too) She has done more name calling than I can recount. Made terrible decisions. And left me to fend for myself.

But since she always cooked, always hugged me, and told me she loved me- all the above was almost ‘normal’ to me. She told me stories about her childhood, and she had it bad; sexual, physical and verbal abuse. So I always felt too guilty to say anything about the way she raised us. And how it has affected me in my adulthood. How I suffer from an olfactory disorder, bipolar disorder, OCD, and I will admit: I always feel like I need to be in control of... everything.

I should point out: My family and I have a great stable relationship now. My mom was later diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder. Middle school and high school were rocky times, but now that my mom no longer drinks- we have been able to talk about the past (including hers) and lingering effects it had on us all while moving forward. I know this is not the case for everyone; what was your middle school life like?",28May2020,1
7,"I'm 25 turning 26 soon. I've had depression for a very long time due to some difficulties I face in my life. I'm very used to repressing my feelings because of the environment I live in. To cut it short, I've been through some stuff that isn't mentally healthy. 2018 was the hardest to me and probably the turning point for me. I've seen the worst from so many people at once and it really changed me. I noticed that since then, I became much less empathetic towards many things. There are things that I never thought I'd do, I did. I became a very harsh person. There are things I imagine myself doing and I don't feel bad even though I used to. I just care less and don't feel sorry for anyone unless rarely. It's like I've accepted the harsh reality of this world to where it does not bother me. However realizing that I'm less righteous than I used to be makes me feel uneasy about myself.

10,"Hey guys, I’m a 15 year old girl and I’m almost 100% sure I have some sort of eating disorder or body dysmorphia. I’ve taken countless tests on it, and nearly all of them say I should seek professional help. HOWEVER, I have never made myself throw up, and I do eat two balanced meals every day. I’m an athlete, so I also eat tons of protein to keep on my muscles when I’m trying to loose weight. I am an average weight for my height, but it’s mostly muscle and I have little body fat. I’m just never happy with my weight or how my body looks. I always feel like I need to be skinner, like I look fat in clothes, and I feel like people judge me in a swimsuit. I count every single calorie I eat, and am currently doing 16/8 fasting while being in a caloric deficit to loose 2 pounds each week. 

I also sometimes binge eat, but I’d really rather not talk about that, and it’s not often. 

Even with all this, none of my family and friends know what going on. I’ve always been naturally slimmer, and play it off as healthy eating. My disorder is not hurting anyone, and I’m not hurting myself by doing this. Nothing I’m doing to myself is physically harmful, and I really want to be skinner. I just want to look like all those girls I see on social media. If I continue like this, I know I will get there.

12,"Background: I was abused as a child by my dads side of the family, my dad left because i was gay. Ive struggled with my weight my whole life so i've been bullied mercilessly. I never really had any friends because nobody wanted to be seen with the weird fat kid, yadda yadda yadda. A real sob story. the thing is that I could handled all that. But the worst thing, is that my mother hates me. Honestly i dont think she ever really loved me..I try my best to be a good kid but nothing i do was ever enough. i was always a worthless piece of shit. I cant remember a tike in my childhood that i was really truly happy.  So moving on, When our house burned down when i was 16 (we lost everything) i felt nothing. I was just numb. I wouldn't eat, wouldn’t smile or talk. I was a zombie. I was given a dog, to keep me alive, as my doctor said, because i told him i had no reason to be alive. What was the point? Well He became my everything. In all of my 16 years i had never loved anything as much as i love him. We did everything together. He helped me come out of my shell and be a better person. He gave me reason. He helped me when i had a rough day at work, he helped me through panic attacks and depressive episodes. Hes been through it all with me. I almost lost him twice and each time i felt my world collapse. I couldn’t breath and all i could think about is how i cant live without him. He’s gonna be 6 in november and while thats young, i know that some dogs die at that age. Every time i even think about him dying my heart breaks and i start sobbing. as much as i want to not think about it i knew that it would happen regardless of if i want it to happen or not. So i decided that second time i almost lost him, that when he goes i go. And that was the calmest ive ever been about him dying. I was at peace with it. I never told anyone because nobody would really care, so why waste my breath yaknow? 

The problem with this is that the fates threw a curveball at me and i met my best friend. She is everything to me. I honestly think shes my soulmate and i love her so much. I was able to be an even better person because of her.  She looks past my episodes and attacks. She drove to my house in the middle of the night when i was on the phone with the suicide hotline. She was with me when i had some of the best times in my life. I was finally happy with her in my life. 


But as happy as i am, i still plan on ending everything when My baby goes, that plan never changed for me and now i feel like shit because i know shes gonna be sad when i’m gone. I don’t want her to be sad but i don’t see any other option. I don’t want to live in a world without my baby. As an added bonus, One of us would have to bury the other and i wouldn’t be able to handle that. 

Im really at a loss here so any advice would be appreciated

The title alone honestly might be good enough but I can elaborate a little bit. I have some really gargantuan ambitions for things I wanna make, but I just don't ever do them at all.

And for the past year or so, it's kinda just been like.... I don't wanna do anything that even takes the least amount of effort. Sometimes it gets so bad that I don't even wanna play video games anymore because I feel like those take some effort - as in, what do I do if I get to a spot where it's really unfair and shitty and difficult? And so I end up just watching movies or browsing the internet.

16,"I speak to somebody on the odd occasion over the Internet who has a feeder fetish (if you don't know what this is, it is a fetish where one person ""the feeder"" fattens up the other who is ""the feedee"" often to the point of immobility, where they cannot move from bed, shower, take care of themselves, and they also derive pleasure from health problems associated with obesity and some of them ultimately even want death to be the end goal, that is the case for the person who I know who has this fetish. I am not sure if he is currently in one of these relationship dynamics himself. 

I know that for munchausen by proxy, it's usually a parent and child relationship where the parent exagerrates or fakes the child's symptoms, right? But for a feeder fetish the feeder is actually directly causing and enabling extreme obesity and associated physical illness. 

I think these relationships are more often than not consensual, which makes me think its perhaps not munchausen by proxy but I also did read that ""feeder"" people tend to prey on those with existing mental health issues, eg. those more suspectible to vulnerability. 

Surely this must fit into a mental illness within the DSM-5? Where one makes another ill for their own gratification, with the goal sometimes being as extreme as death. Or if its not classed as a mental illness in itself, mabye it could be caused by one? Any thoughts?

19,"In mid-April, I started talking (as in the stage before dating) to this guy that I met online. We got along fine and FaceTimed a lot the first two weeks. Then he told me he was dealing with some stuff and wanted to take it slow, which was fine with me. We kept in contact though, having the occasional text conversation every few days (and we still flirted sometimes). Every so often, he would post concerning stuff on his Snapchat story, things like “I don’t think anyone will miss me” or “I’m tired of everything, fuck this”. I never said anything because I thought it was part of some personal drama in his life. At the beginning of May one night, he posted a similar thing but it was more concerning, something like a farewell. I asked him if he was okay and he said no, he was thinking of killing himself. I was so scared he was going to act on his thoughts that I tried to keep him in a conversation and get him to talk about what was wrong. He opened up a little bit but then insisted he was fine and wouldn’t do anything to himself. The following days, he didn’t show any concerning signs again. I still felt like I had to keep a close watch on him on though. This was hard because he lives several states away and I don’t have any way to contact his family or anyone else around him. 

But by mid-May, it seemed like he was feeling better, with an occasional slow day here and there. However, keeping up with him has taken an emotional and mental toll on me. I’ve always struggled with anxiety and mild depression and this situation has made things worse. I’ve spent hours worrying about him and waiting for him to text back to make sure he was still alive. Prior to meeting him, I’d made a lot of progress with dealing with my anxiety but I felt like I reverted a little because of him. I have a history of suicidal thoughts too and I became re-obsessed with them (though I don’t want to act on them anymore thanks to therapy). 

To add to that, I knew that he wasn’t interested in me anymore and was only really keeping me around as a sexual resource. If this was any other guy, I would’ve already picked up on the signs and moved on. Yet, I feel obligated to keep talking to him because it’s the only way I can check up on him.

I don’t know what to do. I’m tired of being emotionally invested in him only for him to be emotionally unavailable, to use me for sexual favors, and to be a source of constant anxiety. But I also feel incredibly selfish because I don’t think he has many other people in his life checking on him and I would be devastated to find out he’s hurt himself or worse. If I pull away and distance myself, I think he might blame himself. 

I’m looking for advice, some reassurance would be nice too. I know not everything’s as black and white as I’ve made it seem but I feel really trapped right now.",28May2020,1

22,"True story. Due to COVID ive been taking online classes in college where the professor posts videos of the lectures and all i have to do is watch them and take notes. The videos are small (&lt;15 minutes each) which i would think would be perfect for staying focused and getting through them. Nope. 

Since 6pm (it’s 10pm as I’m writing this) all i have needed to do was watch two 12ish minute videos and take notes. I usually start watching, then a random thought will pop into my head about a minute in, i try to ignore it and continue watching the video, but i almost always succumb to the thought and get distracted and find myself on social media/researching irrelevant things/youtube rabbit hole etc. 

I still have 8 minutes left in the second video, meaning i can’t focus long enough to watch 24 minutes of content in a span of 4 hours. I used to think nothing of this, but now im genuinely worried. 

Is this something that requires special attention (no pun intended) or do i just lack discipline?",28May2020,1

32,"Sooooo,

I was discharged from inpatient in 2018. After a 5 month admission, with multiple attempts and SH episodes. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Previously I’ve been diagnosed with bulimia, depression and anxiety

Since, I’ve been at uni, and moved on with life. 

But this tiny part of me really really misses it. I often think about things I could’ve done if I was still there. Since leaving, I’ve had to hide my mental illness. I’ve got no therapy for the first time in 5 years, and my GP want to stop my medication for no reason (despite me telling them I cannot function without it, so I’m changing GP’s)

But, I’m always stuck with this kind of ideal world where I’m still there, and I can act on my impulses and I could tell people how I feel. My time in a mental hospital was horrific, but it kind of felt freeing to be able to be open about how I feel, and act on my impulses.

35,"I've done a lot of therapy, but today I had my very first psychiatry appointment. I didn't know what to expect, so I don't know if what happened is how it usually happens or not, but I feel put-off by it.

She asked me a series of basic questions about why I was seeking help, what symptoms I've experienced, my history, etc. To be expected.

Then she gave me a few different options of meds to try. She didn't explain what my diagnosis was. She said she was putting Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but she made it a point to tell me that was just for insurance purposes and didn't mean that I had that. Then she just listed off a couple different mood stabilizers and asked me to pick one, and then listed off some different anxiety meds and asked me to pick one of those too. It kind of felt like I was just ordering drugs off of a menu and it was weird. I expected her to be the expert and to guide me and advise me and instead she was asking me to pick what prescription I wanted.

I don't know, I made the appointment because I wanted answers mostly. A diagnosis, an explanation. I don't know how she landed on the types of medications she chose. Why am I on anxiety meds if I ""don't actually have anxiety."" And why am I on a mood stabilizer?

47,"Right now, I'm a 23 year old guy who's living with my parents for the summer. At this age, my older brother got a high paying, well respected job and moved into a very nice apartment with no college debt. So I'm the unsuccessful little brother. That already makes me feel like crap but that's not the problem.

I'm going into my fifth year of a degree I think I would love if I had the will to do anything, but even getting a shower before noon is a miracle for me anymore. I've gotten this far because I'm good at figuring out how professors grade and do well enough to pass. Just like I did in high school. But now I'm starting to fail major classes because I actually have to know how to do things in my major, but I don't because like I said, I was good at BSing my way through everything before. Theoretically, I could graduate in two semesters. But I won't, because those classes require an accumulation of knowledge I don't have.

Right now, I'm feeling the pressure to get a full-time summer job to help pay for yet another semester. But because of the whole virus situation, the only thing around that will pay well is the same seasonal job that I've had for 5 years. Last year, I nearly had a breakdown at that job. It's grueling, and feels like it's been draining me for years. I promised myself I'd never make myself go back to it last year. But now it's looking like I have to, and I don't know if I can endure it again without completely loosing my mind.

I know the obvious answer to go to my parents. Surely they care for me and would want to help? Well my dad basically thinks any mental issue can be solved by ignoring it and ""powering through"" and is adamantly against medication for that kind of thing. My mother got medication for depression when I was a kid and hid it from him because she knew he'd freak out. She got some strange symptoms from it I can't remember, ended up telling him what she took, and lo and behold, he freaks out. Not about the symptoms and her well-being oh no, but about her taking the medication and hiding it from him. You know, because she was justly afraid of him reacting exactly how he did?

Sorry for getting a bit sidetracked, but I just wanted to get the point across that my parents aren't a stable set of arms to fall into for emotional support. The fact that I rely on them at all right now is killing me. Honestly the point here is I'm stuck. I don't see myself graduating soon if ever. Even if I did, I can't do interviews to get a job, because my anxiety will flair up so bad I can't think when I'm in one. The job I mentioned before doesn't require an interview for me anymore. I just email them and I'm in. But like I mentioned, I hate that job and I'd honestly rather pull out my own teeth. But I need money for college that I'm probably not going to finish anyway but I'm too far into the degree to just stop because then I can't get a job to pay off all this debt I'm in and... you see the problem. I'm stuck at this point in my life, and I don't see a clear way forward. My support structure is non-existent, my entire life is ruled by escapism and ignoring the problem for years thanks to the ingrained teachings of my dear old dad, and I could write a book about all the other crap influencing my current situation. I have no idea where to even start.",28May2020,1

51,"I don't really use this account, but I just need to vent and I don't want to talk to my family about this. It's not that I don't trust them, It's just that I don't want to burden them with my existence.

I don't want to wake up anymore. I've been struggling with a lot of negative emotions since I was about 12, so 6 years now. My home life was fine as a child, my parents argued a lot but it never got physical and they still loved each other.  We never really had enough money to buy nice things or pay rent for that matter so we moved often, but I didn't mind. One day though my father didn't come back from work and my siblings and I didn't understand why. We found out that he had a major accident at work where he fell 3 stories off a ladder onto a pile of jagged rubble. Needless to say, he was put on a lot of pain medication.

Life moved on though; he got better, we moved, everything was normal. Until one day he didn't come home again. This time my mom knew why though and wouldn't tell us. Turns out he was arrested for theft. He pleads guilty in court because if he fought the case he knew he would lose and get an extended sentence. So my father is gone from my life at the most crucial time for a young man. This is when my mental health took a decline.

I won't bother explaining what else happened during the time unless someone asks me, but I do need to explain something; my father hadn't gotten better after the fall, he got worse. He became addicted to pain killers and my mother found out. Instead of helping him, she abused this. Sending my father to stores to steal high value electronics, while he was high on pain killers, like T.V.'s or computers and sell them to the pawn shop near our house. Obviously he still loved my mother and didn't want her to take the fall so he confessed to being the only one involved.

During that time the moving, unstable relationships my mother was in, and having to look after my siblings that weren't sent to live with relatives really took a toll on me. I had to be the man of the house, the emotionally stable one, and get good enough grades to ensure I would make it into a good school to secure a well paying job to save my siblings from the situation we lived in. But in 2016, my mom passed away. She did everything she could for us but it wasn't easy for her considering that I found out she was an alcoholic. I guess that explains what she did to my father and why he covered for her. She had her own demons she was fighting through. Anyway, after her brother gave her laced cocaine, she fell asleep and never woke up.

After that my siblings and I moved in with my grandma, uprooting our lives again. To shorten things from this point up until now, my father is out of jail and owns a successful business. My siblings are doing well in school, aside from the online classes, and we live in a decent house. The thing is, I no longer have any goals. No motivation. For years I was fueled by rage and spite, my desire to succeed in a world that said I couldn't. Now that I have everything I need I have no joy for the struggle. I'm burnt out from years of bottling up my emotions and ignoring the hardships I endured. All I feel now is the burning desire to get revenge against the man who got my mother addicted to cocaine, to the man that killed her, and at the world for letting any of this happen in the first place. 

Every day I feel like I'm getting closer to lashing out on the world and I'm afraid of what I'll do if that ever happens. I'm known to bigger and bigger outbursts the longer I harbor resentment. Imagine what could happen if I let the resentment I've been bottling up for 6 years could do? I shudder to think about it.",28May2020,1

55,"I speak to somebody on the odd occasion over the Internet who has a feeder fetish (if you don't know what this it is a fetish where one person ""the feeder"" fattens up the other who is ""the feedee"" often to the point of immobility, where they cannot move from bed, shower, take care of themselves, and they also derive pleasure from health problems associated with obesity and some of them ultimately even want death to be the end goal, that is the case for the person who I know who has this fetish. I am not sure if he is currently in one of these relationship dynamics himself. 

I know that for munchausen by proxy, it's usually a parent and child relationship where the parent exagerrates or fakes the child's symptoms, right? But for a feeder fetish the feeder is actually directly causing and enabling obesity and associated physical illness. 

I think these relationships are more often than not consensual, which makes me think its perhaps not munchausen by proxy but I also did read that ""feeder"" people sometimes prey on those with existing mental health issues, eg. those more suspectible to vulnerability, much like a child. 

Surely this must fit into a mental illness within the DSM-5? Where one makes another ill for their own gratification, with the goal sometimes being as extreme as death. Or if its not classed as a mental illness in itself, mabye it could be caused by one? Any thoughts? Just curious as I am honestly quite shocked after reading into this fetish.",28May2020,1

58,"Recently I noticed I don't want things like other people. I noticed this when my boyfriend keeps asking me what I want, and I genuinely don't know how to respond. I just want whatever he wants, and it's like that for everyone. I'm just so impartial to everything. I feel like I only want things for other people. I want to eat where whoever I'm with wants, I want to do things that people want me to do, or listen to music that the people around me want. Or it's like I only want something until I see/hear it. When people ask me what I want to do, I literally can't think of things to do until I see/hear it as an option. It's like I can't think or choose for myself anymore and I don't know what to do about it. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this but I don't know where else to go or what to do and I just feel like I lost myself completely. I've noticed this for months now and the longer it goes the more I hate myself and the more pointless I feel. If I don't want things, make decisions, have good ideas, then why would anyone want me around anymore....I'm just a sheep following everyone else with no mind of its own.",28May2020,1

Hiya!  My name's CJ. I'm an aspiring writer and have a huge interest in mental  health. I've been working on an informational book (yet to be named)  that more or less encapsulates dozens of known and some unknown mental  health/behavioral or otherwise relevant disorders and disabilities that  affect how the mind perceives things. *Not gonna lie the scope of the book is still a little fuzzy, but I digress.*

I  need people who are willing to have interviews about  disorders/conditions that they may be experiencing. It's a simple  10-question text interview. The purpose of the interview is to provide a  first-person perspective on whatever topic the consumer/reader may be  looking at. Elect anyone you want for it, just shoot me a DM if you're  interested! Topics available for interview are here. Some topics are  taken but I'm always open to more interviewees : [https://pastebin.com/MGMMkeDh](https://pastebin.com/MGMMkeDh)

63,"I'm 30 years old and live in Arizona, my wife is 24. She has a plethora of medical conditions, including Hashimotos disease, asthma, Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome and overwhelming general anxiety and depression.

Her seizures are the primary disruption in her life and always have been. She will drop to the floor, eyes roll back, arms and hands shaking, neck and head shaking. Sometimes they are little, like if she has one in her sleep, other times they are so bad that I'm terrified. If she has a bad enough one, when she wakes up, she's like a different person for the next 15-30 minutes. Shes gets very lethargic and emotional, sometimes she can't form simple words and you can tell she's aware of it. She looks frustrated that she can't talk. Sometimes after enough seizures in a row, she'll just stare at you exhausted like an empty shell and unresponsive.

She's goes to the hospital more times in a year than I ever have in my entire life. I'm a tough guy, I handle the situation, she can hear and feel things with the lighter seizures and I just try to let her know that she's not alone and that she's okay and that our 9 month old son is okay. Sometimes when she gets really out of it after 6 or 7 really bad seizures, she just repeats mine and my sons name in a monotone way. The first time this happened i cried, i felt so helpless for her, i tried to put myself in her shoes and i just couldn't imagine what she was experiencing. It tears me apart.

These seizures are almost always dismissed in an emergency room or doctors office, they say ""pseudo seizure"" and give her some adivan and send her home. I understand there isn't much they can do, but the overall dismissive of medical staff has created a stigma for her with doctors. She feels ashamed to seek medical help.

EEG shows normal brain activity, she's had two so far. One when she was first diagnosed and another recently to confirm. We were told to follow up with Neuro from the ER. Her heart rate spikes and she becomes tachy, usually about 120 to 160.

She eventually got a medical marijuana card and started using marijuana daily. She's used it before heavily and it wasn't new to her. It was a god send. Her seizures stopped, she had healthy appetite, her depression and anxiety none existent.... Until she got sick. She began vomiting early in the mornings like morning sickness. This occurred for weeks until she couldn't stop vomiting for 2 days. She became dehydrated and malnourished, she couldn't sleep, it caused a spike in her seizures which made things worse.

This is a result of the Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome i mentioned earlier. Basically her body fights off the THC stored in her body from past use. It could take 2 weeks to a month of this vomiting and nausea to finally get over it. There is NOTHING they can do aside from anti-nausea medications, which she usually vomits up within 5 minutes. Her seizure activity spikes so high, that she's basically restricted to the couch for days until we see progress. She can't smoke to stop them like she used to.

She obviously can't hold a job, she eventually ends up having a seizure at work or has such bad seizures the night before work that she's physically unable to go to work the next day. I work 3 nights a week, overnight 12 hour shifts and we have a 9 month old son.

This week I've had to just stay home from work because I can't leave her alone. She could fall, she could hit her head, she could drop our son. We've taken so many precautions. She showers sitting down, while i stand in the bathroom, we've removed the box spring from the bed so that it's lower to the ground, if I leave the room I have to remind her to sit back, so that she falls into a chair and not out of it. She cries. She cries a lot. Imagine being so terrified of dropping your son, that you don't want to hold him. Imagine pissing your pants during a seizure and having to have your husband shower you and change you. Imagine not ever being able to drive or ride a bike or walk to the store alone ever again.

My heart breaks for this woman and I don't know what to do, for her, for myself. My bills are stacking up, my work is getting fed up with me not showing up, her family and friends have no idea what either of us are experiencing.

I just... Need advice on which way to turn. Right now, as we speak, my wife has seizures back to back anywhere from every 5 minutes to every hour, lasting 1 to 5 minutes each. She hasn't eaten anything in two days, she vomits every hour, ranging from 5 to 10 minutes each time (usually dry retching)",28May2020,1
64,"Before I give the full explanation I want to also to say that I have OCD so I have lived with a lot of anxiety  for quite awhile now, but this doesn’t have to do with my OCD I’m just mentioning it as background information. Please be kind if you chose to comment. 

Few years ago there was an event that I was convinced to go to the police to report sexual assault for. I didn’t know what I was getting myself into, I was convinced by my friends that I have to. And i felt helpless and pressured while I was at the station. I wish I had someone around who knew better. It’s one of the most scary moments of my life. 

I couldn’t handle the anxiety, the pain, the doubt and guilt. I had to tell my mother because there was no way I’d be able to hide it and she spent awhile blaming me for what happened but she also hired a lawyer. 

I told the lawyer I can’t handle it and I want it to be over that I wanted to drop the charges. I couldn’t take it, it felt like the anxiety I face with OCD but this was real it wasn’t like my OCD, this was happening in my life for real. 

I was scared of going to court I was scared of people finding out(my dad especially) I was scared of how much this would cost(my mom guilt tripped me a lot about this) and even though people say I was right I was scared that I was wrong. 

Living with OCD means I always have a lot of doubt and guilt and since I have harm OCD I am also always doubting whether I’m a good person. 

A bit over a year later the charges were dropped, I spent all that time in between struggling with the uncertainty that they wouldn’t drop them. Terrified of the uncertainty. 

Now I struggle with the idea that this could come back again to haunt me. Once every few months I get a lot of anxiety thinking what if that guy sued me back or what if my dad found out. I always get a bit anxious being back in my home country and also every time we get mail I get this pang of fear. I just can’t handle all this anxiety and I can’t put it behind me.

I’ve spoken to my lawyer again and he asked me why I’m still worried, that it’s done and if it came back we’d “win” but firstly i find it hard to trust something I don’t know and secondly I don’t want it to come back at all. 

Does anyone have any kind advice or anything that could help.",28May2020,1
65,"My grammar aint that good so bare with it. I have anxiety issues and stress out a lot. It's giving me problems over time such as horrible memory, that I most likely can't get back. This probably stems from kindergarten when my teacher would scream at the top of her lungs and call me stupid, dumb for not knowing how to do something. She would also have me stand in the closet for a period of time. The people that worked in the office would not believe me until other students told them otherwise, which didn't happen until it was to late. That teacher pretty much broke me as a child and i'm stil broken. Overtime I became the quiet kid scared of other people cause they are nothing but psychopaths. This world will ruin you as a child, then act like it didn't even happen. As a result from kindergarten I have never been able to do good in school. It haunts me till this very day.

67,"I never really like myself in my life(17M), I was alone for the most part I never really hung out with many people or got close to others. I never really tried to get close with myself either. I was silent with everyone in my life about what I felt, my family and friends never really heard me talk about my emotions. When I began to try to with my parents I was always shut down by them, they told me I shouldn’t feel sad or upset, like my emotions weren’t justified. I never really tried to break out of my shell because I was always scared of things going wrong and me getting hurt. I always tried avoiding getting hurt by keeping my emotions in, and only broke down in private. I worried too much about other than myself. I remember once I went with my family to Chicago to help clean a show room for kitchens, I began to breakdown, my eyes got watery and I just wanted to cry and be left alone but I did I kept working and felt embarrassed to be next to people while I was sad.

68,My girlfriend has been diagnosed with manic depression and bipolar disorder. A few months ago we took in a puppy who had been abused at a very young age from a friend of mine who was physically unable to care for him. He’s almost 1 now so he has a lot of energy and struggles with impulse control and separation anxiety. He is extremely attached to both of us. He has some behavioral problems which I am trying to work through but find it difficult as I work almost 12 hours a day 5-6 days a week. My girlfriend is currently out of work to the the coronavirus and at home every day. Her symptoms act up and she begins to have anxiety about leaving him hone alone because he will bark and ocassionaly relive himself in his crate. He is also scared or other people and any dog bigger than him in which he starts to get aggressive. I love my girlfriend and our dog but she has reached a point where she doesn’t want to deal with it anymore and has decided I need to find him a new home bc she can’t handle woth the shedding and his behavioral issues. These talks turn into arguments as I eventually lose the large amount of patience I have and she begins raising her voice and yelling the same points she’s trying to make over and over again. I really want us to work out and keep our dog. She does not have interest in helping train him and hasn’t from the jump.

71,"I’m 27f and I have had depression and anxiety, the usual suspects, for many years now. I have a lot of friends and I’ve experienced ups and downs in my friendships all the time, but this particular friendship is really fucking me up.

Some background: we’ll call her Anna, she’s a few years older than me, she’s my husband’s sister in law and very close with him as well (so we’re also tied by familial ties) and she’s also my next door neighbor.

When my husband (boyfriend at the time) introduced us and our friendship started, we lived in different states. I used to see her only a few times a year, and it was great; she’s very extroverted and “wild” so the few times we met up, it was always fun. And there was this unspoken boundary since we lived far away from each other, so she didn’t expect daily or even weekly interaction from me.

Fast forward a few years, I’m getting married to my boyfriend (her brother in law) and we both were moving back to his home state, where Anna also lives. I didn’t really think about how that would change our friendship dynamic, it just didn’t occur to me. when we were looking for apartments she was looking to move as well, and we both loved the building we live in now (it was brand new, most of the flats were vacant and the rent is relatively cheap). So we became neighbors. I also didn’t worry about how this would change our dynamic.

Until we did LSD together and I had a bad trip. Actually, me and Anna had done LSD together a couple of times prior to that “bad trip” but it was always in an outdoors setting or on vacation. Anyway, we did LSD together indoors, in her apartment, for the first time. Initially it wasn’t a bad trip at all, she was playing music videos on the TV and I was enjoying the music but also super engrossed in my drawing at the same time. I guess that annoyed her bc she snapped at me a couple of hours into the trip, saying something along the lines of “stop ignoring us and watch the music videos with us” in a very annoyed tone. I didn’t realize I was “ignoring” them, so I put away my drawing and tried to engage with them but I was stuck in a thought loop of “do they think I was ignoring them deliberately?” This thought loop lasted for hours... I was trying to fight back the anxiety so I suggested a song. Anna’s husband then quips “oh she finally speaks”. Making me even more anxious. Then Anna, who was sitting next to me, moved away from me, making me even MORE anxious. Then Anna’s friend who was tripping with us commented about how I’ve been glued to the same spot the whole trip, didn’t I need to use the bathroom or something? Making me even MORE AND MORE anxious. I think the cherry on top was them laughing at me when I was stuttering while trying to speak...

It’s stupid, but that trip changed me forever. I was never the same around them ever since. This happened 3 years ago. And it happened RIGHT before we moved in to the new building, to become neighbors.

THIS is when it occurred to me, oh shit, not only do we have to be close friends now that we live in the same state (and we’re tied by our familial ties) but we also have to be neighbors...

Anna is now my best friend, but it’s still weird between us. We have a lot of common interests, so we spend a lot of time together, and I feel kinda obligated to spend time with her. She expects me to interact with her on the daily, to do stuff together on the daily, to chill together on the daily. She wants me to be her gym buddy (and we were, for a while) and she wants me to be her traveling buddy.

I like that she keeps me occupied; it keeps my depression at bay. But my anxiety? My anxiety is spiraling out of control the more i spend time with her. She has a huge heart and she loves me a lot, but she’s very intense for me, an introvert. She likes brand name clothes and luxury living, and I’m not interested in that at all, but she keeps pressuring me to be on the same materialistic page. She’s obsessed with her image and she thinks I’m stupid for not giving a shit about my image. She also loves to take drugs very very frequently and spontaneously, and while I like to dabble in drugs here and there I absolutely hate abusing them and just popping a tab of LSD out of nowhere. I’ve done LSD with her even since the bad trip many times but it was always because she brings it up SO SUDDENLY and I feel bad about saying no and “being a buzzkill” so I end up taking the tab with her with absolutely no mental preparation...

And it’s all taken a toll on my self esteem. We’ve been “best friends” for 3 years and I feel like a complete phony because I’m literally always masking in front of her, faking my enthusiasm for whatever it is she’s excited about, faking my laughter... I’m a quintessential “yes man” with her because her reaction when I say no or disagree with her is just too much. 

Every year I told myself “it’s gonna get easier now that we know each other better” and I thought that the more time we spend together, the less I’ll mask in front of her and the more true to myself I’ll be. BUT ITS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE!!! The more time I spend with her, the more I know about what ticks her off and hence the less REAL I am with her.

It doesn’t help that she’s had delusions (she has drug-induced psychosis) about me betraying her. She’s had two psychotic breaks and in both of them I apparently played a pivotal role in being someone that’s out to get her and someone she can’t trust!!!! This makes me 100000 times more anxious. 

What gets me the most though is when she calls me out for masking. She can tell I’m not being myself around her. I think she can tell now more than ever because as I said, the more time I spend with her the less I am myself. She calls me out for being a “yes man”. She calls out my anxious behavior. I think she wants me to open up about my anxiety around her but the thing is, the few times I’ve gotten close to do that, she reacted SO BADLY. She takes it as criticism towards her. She say I’m weak for thinking that way. 

I don’t know what to do now. I wish I could go back to being just casual friends. I’ve never been so anxious and insecure as I am now due to this friendship. I resent her. I daydream about blowing up all these repressed feelings on her. I’m so relieved when she goes out of town and I can get a break from her. She’s driving me insane. 

I’m gonna see a psychiatrist this month, and my #1 goal for therapy is to be open about how I feel with her. But I’m so scared. It’s 3 years worth of repressed feelings and bad experiences. I’d rather just put distance between us, because even if I’m more open with her and all that, I just don’t think I can handle being close friends with her. She’s just too narcissistic and extroverted for me. We don’t mesh unless I put on a facade. 

Tl;dr: my “best friend” of 3 years is causing me so much anxiety and the closer we become, the worst it gets. I can’t cut her off completely because we have family ties and we’re neighbors, and also it’s not 100% her fault our friendship causes me anxiety",28May2020,1
72,"Hi everybody! I just found this community and I hope this is a good place to vent about this problem of mine. Sorry if it's too long.

 Well, the title says it all, really. It has been over a year now that every time I have a dream, which is not really often, but every single time I have had a dream, it is a nightmare. Sometimes they start normal, but they always turn into something horrible.

They also have degrees to how horrible they are. The one that has been definitely the worst and most vivid was me being in a party in an open field. Suddenly my mom stands in front of  me and someone beheads her... I then see her head roll in the ground. The rest of the nightmares are usually something chasing me, dead people, several stressful situations, etc. 

Last night I had one where a friend and I found a child looking for his mother, only to find her dead and open body down some stairs and then some paranormal stuff happening.

I honestly don't even wake up scared anymore, it's really annoying. I just wake up suddenly and I am like ""Well, there goes another one to the list"" and go back to sleep.

I have been away from my family and friends for 3 years since I left my country with my boyfriend due to a crisis in said country.

My partner and I have been together since 2014, we've been living together for over 2 years, and we are getting married in August of this year. 

My feelings for him haven't changed at all, He's wonderful and supportive and I love him very much. 
I know he isn't cheating on me, and I had a talk with him to make sure he didn't have any adverse feelings towards me. 
It just recently has become a thing, where if he initiates the touch, It'll be fine for a minute, but suddenly I get very uncomfortable and angry with him touching me.

78,"Hey,

So.. My family has a history of mental health issues on both sides of our family. My sister was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, I'll call her Ann. A little bit of backstory- my  mother married a British man, who eventually forced us for multiple reasons to move from the USA to the UK (he is no longer in our life). There was a lot that happened in the UK that traumatized both Ann and myself. 5 years ago, I made the decision to move back to the US by myself, with help from my then boyfriend. After a couple of years, I helped my mom get the courage to move back, and before COVID happened I was slowly working on getting my sister here. It's important to know this, because as of right now she is there by herself- all our family is American. The trauma seems to be centered on sexual assault, verbal and physical abuse.

I have recently found out that during COVID, something has happened to her. I will add pictures of the conversation for people to get a better grasp, but... Basically what it feels like to me, after hours of being on the phone to her, that something has triggered her, and badly. **Whilst talking, she would forget things, and talk to herself like she was reliving memories. But they seemed scattered as she was asking me questions whilst processing them bit by bit; she had to ask my mom that I really existed** because one night I was so drained and exhausted from trying to talk with her and direct her through cooking and getting to bed, I missed her calls by sleeping through them.

**She also is calling people by their full names, even family members.** The last thing to note is that she has been cycling through asking who Sovet is. After some digging and helping her sort through the memory, I discovered that he is some guy on an app called Fandid. I am researching that- he seems to be renown for being an.. a\*\*. I have no idea if this is reality or confusion, but it seems he sent her something to do with child pornography- possibly even of us. That is something she cycled back on a lot, too, which... Yeah. 

Anyway, after having no contact with her for an agonizing 4 days, I found out after a wellness check that she had admitted herself to A&amp;E as we (my Mom, Dad and me) were begging her to do. **She is admitted and sanctioned for 28 days. During these 4 days, she has had violent outbursts, throwing plates at people and asking my mom when she is going to come and visit her at the ward. We have to keep reminding her that COVID has closed the airports and that is impossible right now.** 

Nurses have said they have used heavy sedatives on her during outbursts, but the anti-psychotics aren't having any effect yet.

*TLDR; My sister is alone and dealing with some messed up stuff. Please read the bold parts for symptoms- I really wanna know what the heck is going on, and if anyone else has ever experienced something like this. I am terrified she won't recover. The thought of losing my sister whilst she still lives... It's agonizing.*

I am really sorry if this is scattered. I am having an extremely difficult time processing everything, especially as I stopped self care when I was trying to be there for her as much as I could be. I want to be strong for her, but I have no idea how to do that.",28May2020,1

80,"Idk its kinda weird, people always ask me why I even bother hanging out with them because ""it doesn't look like I'm having fun"" when really I am, I just don't express it. My mom also called me heartless because I didn't appear to be hurt by the fact that my grandpa passed away. Is this normal? Like I still show emotion, its just toned down a lot compared to other people I guess. I'd like to think its related to anxiety, like me being afraid of people judging me if I let my emotions out, but it doesn't feel like I'm purposely suppressing them. It usually results in me not being able to maintain close relationships, people just stop talking to me.

82,"Is life worth living?

(I know this is going to seem like I’m attention seeking, please don’t take it like that). I’m 16 and I feel like I’ve already screwed up everything. I used to have such a passion for everything in life, I loved everything and everyone, now everything seems dull and irritating. I can’t even go outside anymore without feeling like someone is going to kill me or take me, I’ve always been a paranoid person and I’ve always been extremely scared of being killed by another person (sounds generic I know) but it’s like every day that I feel like someone is going to kill me, I can’t even sleep anymore without thinking I’m going to be killed in a home robbery. I’ve been in therapy for 3 years of my life and not a single thing has changed, I’m still depressed and feel numb and dead inside. Every little thing I do makes me feel like a failure and I know that my family is disappointed in me. I’ve failed everything in life, I used to be smart getting straight A’s but now I can barely get C’s and that makes me feel so worried that I’m not going to amount to anything in life. I’ve never had a father in my life so I’ve never gotten much parental love as a child, no one ever cared for me, the only friend I had would abuse me and beat me for fun. I’ve been self harming since I was 13 and I can’t stop it, the most I can go without doing it is a couple of weeks but then my brain thinks it’s a funny idea to do it again. I’m never happy anymore, but I never cry about it, it’s like I’m unable to cry or feel the sad to the point of tears, I just feel empty. Everyone who has ever seen my scars call me an attention seeker and then leave me and call me names like “freak” or “pussy”. I have no one anymore and all I can think about is ending my life. I wanna be a good person but I know I will never be that, I’m such a horrible person, I’ve almost killed a person and that dwells On my mind every day. I’m a monster that needs to be put down like an animal. (Anyway, sorry if it seems like I’m trying to attention seek, I just wanted to vent because I’ve got no one else to talk to because of my therapy place being closed, sorry).

Basically I have depression and I’ve always gotten sad and had breakdowns but nothing quite like this. I was getting in my feelings again and started crying then I stopped and started again and stopped and started again. But this time it was different. It felt more severe, I started shaking and getting numb all over my body and almost involuntarily started typing (disclaimer: I was already in notes because sometimes I write my issues down in there and copy and paste them when I’m done to someone who’s close to me and they help me out) And well I typed all of this is what feels like a vague memory to me now:
Here we go...

I can’t do this anymore. My whole body is shaking and I feel completely numb. I feel I can’t remember what I wrote I wrote down down 30 seconds ago. I’m lost I feel like there’s nothing else for me to do. I feel like I’m gonna puke, my head has so many thoughts but also none at the same time, I don’t even know if this makes sense, my heart rate rapidly increasing, I can feel anything, if I stand up I’m gonna fall immediately, I feel completely weak, everything is blurry, I don’t know if this is the end but I’m sorry, I don’t know what is happening with me right now, I need help, the numbness is getting worse, I feel like I’m being compressed now, it’s hard for me to hone, it feels like I’m about to be paralyzed. If anyone every sees this I don’t know if there gonna believe me, this feels unreal I can’t y’all for help or get up to sign for it, I feel completely stuck I’m still shaking, it feels like some of the pressure was lifted, but I’m still shaking and feel really numb, what have I done, stop stop stop stop calm down please it feels like it’s stopping, my hands still feel numb but I’m regaining feeling

I think I’ve managed to calm down, I’m still a little numb and shaky and now I’m really scared about what just happened.  What the fuck just happened. 
I have been up for 35+ hours and was getting really depressed and started crying, then all this shit started to happen and I started to type it all down. And now I’m here.

Its a fantastic way to visualise how and why you struggle to so 'normal' everyday things. For some people it takes more songs than others to even get out of bed.

And that's OK. It doesn't make you bad, or lazy, or a failiure, or wrong. All of our brains are wired differently from each other and all of our life experiences and coping mechanisms are unique.

You Matter. Even when it feels like you don't. Don't be ashamed of your mental health struggles. Tell someone. Tell a friend. Tell one of us strangers online. Even writing your feelings down can massively help get your worries and pain off of your shoulders.

You CAN get through this. Together, or alone.

89,"I struggled with really bad depression for the past few years, and I had issues with self harm and suicide attempts. I gradually got better over the years, and I’m blessed not to be in that state of mind anymore. But because I was depressed for so many formative years, I feel like I just have old habits that I can’t let go of. I really thought I wouldn’t live this long, and I thought my existence was super temporary. I couldn’t think about the future; I would distance myself from my friends for a few weeks every once in a while to make sure they could live without me and don’t need me; I just thought I’d never have a permanent role in anyone’s life, so I kept my distance and tried not to be important to anyone. Now, I’m a lot better and not planning on committing suicide anymore, but I still avoid having close relationships with people. I run away from friendships once I think we’re getting too close, and it’s hard for me to see myself committing to a relationship. I’m naturally an independent and unemotional person, so it’s fitting, I guess. I never went to therapy, and I kinda don’t know how to cope with this. I don’t like it though. I wanna have meaningful relationships with people. I guess this might’ve been just a rant. Thanks if you made it this far.",28May2020,1
90,"Hi I (F19) have been on social media a lot lately because of everything going on and there’s not much to do. I have depression and anxiety and I’ve noticed how horrible and helpless I’ve been feeling lately. When on TikTok I see all the hateful comments on people just being themselves and having fun and it’s stupid but I feel like crying and sometimes I do cry. I try not to get involved. Stupidity I lost my temper on a TikTok post and they posted my comments and I felt so helpless and hurt and I know it’s my fault for getting involved but I was just trying to bring awareness to something. A lot of people came to my support but it was still hard and I kinda regretted it. I did the same on here, Reddit. I was just trying to spread the truth about what happened on a video since my friend was there and I replied to a lot of the comments and someone told me I should just shut the f up and I lost it. I love being on social media but sometimes I can’t help but go through comments. I don’t know. Maybe I’m too sensitive but lately it’s just bringing me down so much. I’ve been clean from self harm for 3 months but now more than ever I want to go back to it. I can’t explain it, with all the hate going on it’s just filling myself with hatred for myself. Deep deep down I love myself but with everything I just feel helpless. I finally got up the confidence to comment and talk to people and I feel like it backfired on me. I don’t have friends like everyone else does. I’m not outgoing. I’m awkward and have a lot of anxiety with people. My only friend is my boyfriend. I can’t really hold up conversations with people especially when it’s the next day. I don’t know if this is the place to post this and I’m so sorry if it’s not. I just feel so alone.

I started questioning other things. Like this time my boyfriend asked me why I ate all the bananas, and I answered that he told me he hated them. He answered that he didn't know what I was talking about, he always loved them. Or the time I asked my mother if she was ready to drop me off to my friend's house, and she told me I never asked her. Yet I remember telling her multiple times.

There were multiple accidents like that, and I always assumed other people were the problem, that I had a good memory and they didn't. But with time it happened with multiple people.

He was on a tangent about killing him self. I told him to come over, because I always was able to help him with that. Always. He never hurt himself when he was with me. He was belligerent, crying and yelling at his new s/o and I kept trying to tell him to please relax and just talk to me. He was so upset at her. Her hung up.

It's hard to draw the line between what's valid and what's me being an ass. I'm not confrontational, so it's not like I'm getting into flights with people, I just get distant. 

This problem is more relevant in romantic relationships. I pretty quickly become uninterested and unattracted to people when I start to pursue a relationship. 

Maybe I'm I just bring the wrong people into my life, or maybe theres something really wrong with me.

In high school I was top of my class, involved with sports blah blah. But In college (I’m gonna be a junior) I can’t focus on ANYthing, am completely disorganized, have trouble memorizing things, have distanced myself from my friends, etc. 
I have never had a diagnoses for anything, as I hate to come to terms with my emotions, and therefore suppress the urge to talk abt them/ seek help until...
I fricken failed TWO of my engineering classes this semester which is completely unlike me. Well, in comparison to high school at least. I feel awful about myself for this happening, but yet wonder if something that I can’t help is going on with me. I feel as though my brain is failing me. I try to do well, but it feels like the fricken Great Wall of China has implemented itself in my brain cells. 
Since the start of college, I have been doing exponentially worse as far as mental health, grades, socialization, procrastination, organization, and pretty much everything.  I am just not well overall. 
But the thing is, although I was on top of my shit (for the most part) up until college, I can remember having suicidal thoughts even before then. Again, I can’t see myself ever acting on them but like I remember even in middle school I would always cross the street without looking with the thought of hoping a car would just hit me.  
As I said before, I have a good family. I am home w them rn bc of covid. My mom keeps trying to get me to talk abt what’s going on bc apparently she can tell what’s up, but also constantly makes me feel like a piece of shit for the resultant a of my state of mind (aka failing my classes)

I should add at this time i was also smoking siggnificantly more, money was low as it was, using at least 2-3g of weed a day at least and getting other drugs was harder with a lack of such connections but i did so whenever i could, after a 2nd episode i decided to try drug and alcohol counselling but i did not end up doing this for very long, i didnt feel it would help and was afraid of what i would be like without the drugs since i started at a young age, so i continued to use.
After meeting my current gf who is a mental health nurse i am finally taking steps to free myself of this addictive personality i have, i have just started takinglexapro and in 3 weeks i will start a short course of valium and be monitored by my doctor, i believe i can stop but im still worried about how i will be after, i used weed to stop feeling a certain way or to ignore it and with my families history of mental health, drug abuse and suicide i am getting very worried.

105,"I'm a sophomore living in Oklahoma, and I've had thoughts of simply just running away or offing myself for the past few months now. I don't know if I can handle it any more. My parents aren't horrible people, don't get me wrong, but I feel like they just don't care about me or believe that everything I'm dealing with is in my head.

Lemme break down my situation at home the best i can. Number one, my parents seem to treat me very differently from my older sister and younger brother, and I don't just mean different privileges. For example, My mom will always find something to complain about with me, whether it's because i didn't comb my hair right or i wore a shirt that had one tiny paint stain that could never be washed out. She jumps straight to calling me a slob and a hobo, while with my siblings she doesn't care at all or she actually helps them. I feel like I can't even leave my room without getting yelled at for something I did wrong or something i didn't do. It doesn't really help that my dad always takes her side and it always ends up being my fault. It's getting harder and harder for me to get motivated to actually get up and take care of my body anymore. I haven't brushed my teeth in a month. It makes me feel awful, but i don't have the motivation to do anything about it anymore. I feel insecure and judged around my family,especially my mother. It doesn't help that we're all stuck at home. 

Second, they always tell me to suck my problems up or that everything is in my head. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and have been taking medicine for about 2 years now. But I've just resorted to lying and tricking myself into thinking that I'm fine because they don't even bother to let me explain my problems. I can only really talk to my therapist, and even then it isn't often. My next appointment with her is in a year. But it's not like it matters anyway because I've started lying to her too. I can't tell you guys how much I hate lying, it makes me feel awful everytime I do it. But right now it just seems better than opening up and telling the truth about it. Y'all know that one image with the cabinet of plates, and there's one that's leaning against the glass and if you open the cabinet all of the plates will fall out and shatter? That's pretty much how i feel. My therapist thinks I'm doing better and so does my whole family.   It took me forever to open up about my suicidal thoughts, and I feel like I'm going through that process again. I just feel like any second now I'm going to snap. 

Third and finally, privacy here is basically nonexistent. It feels like they always expect me to be out of my room and do something with them no matter how I'm feeling. What they don't realize is that i just feel safer and more comfortable when I'm on my own. They expect me to even leave my door open at all times, but it terrifies me to leave it open because my paranoia makes me think something might attack me or whatever. I don't think my family realizes what it's like to be introverted. I just don't like to be around people all the time. 

Anyway, this post has dragged on way longer than i wanted it to (and is extremely messy oof), but i just needed to get some things off my chest. I just don't feel safe at home anymore. How am I supposed to get help when 1. I'm not even an adult and 2. My parents don't believe I need it?",28May2020,1

110,"Hi everyone,

I've been experiencing really different emotions that sway back and forth. This is usually what happens with me but is now really pronounced (most likely due to lockdown). For example, I don't really text people in my life, for no reason. Even if I do, I'll text someone once in a month or once a fortnight.

So, there are two emotions associated with this small thing. First one is, no one has messaged me for such a long time so it seems like they surely don't want to be bothered by me. The second way my brain processors it is that everyone is busy in their lives and it can't hurt to shoot a text. And my mind keeps going over these two cases again and again.

Sometimes, a third emotion (resignation) creeps in, which makes me feel worse. It's basically when I think, fuck this. I don't need to text anyone if no one is texting me cause they don't care enough.

What's more messed up is that I don't feel like texting anyone. I don't really miss anyone. There are few people in my life who know me as I am and don't judge me for being myself. Others feel like I do this on purpose.

I don't really know how to maintain positivity on this front. Any help will be appreciated.",28May2020,1

I did everything to try to get it back but it got worse and worse.Now you have to spend a little money, but for my current situation things are great.  and I have no way out, I don't know what to do or how to face it.  my brothers-in-law must pay a mortgage and I must give them approx 300 usd I don't have them.  I don't know how to get them.  and I can no longer find a way out.  in my head it will only disappear to end this.  my life was shattered and dragged more people.

113,"Hi, I'm 16 and it's like 4 in the morning, I was just watching a show when all of the sudden my breath picked up and I just started looking around and freaking out. My legs just started to curl up,( they were in a normal position, I was sitting on my bed laying down with my back against the wall). I just kept breathing very heavy and I got light headed, then my whole body felt like it was shaking.

114,"My sleep schedule has been really messed up because of quarantine. I get sleepy, but as soon as I get in bed I go on my phone and then I can’t tear myself off.

I don’t even wanna be on my phone, but I feel like I can’t face the world right now so I just cannot put it down 24/7. When I run out of things to do on my phone I will always find more.

115,"Hello! Not sure if this is the right place for this or if there is even any advice to be given, but anyways i just wanted to get it off my chest. Hope that is ok

I tend to have an all or nothing sort of mindset. I don’t think it is too healthy and i try to avoid it. Anyways that extends to food. I’ll either binge and eat everything i find for no reason (i know it sounds ridiculous and that i should just not do that but I can’t? Or i can sometimes but then relapse) or eat very little.

I used not to eat a lot when i was a kid and i was perfectly healthy and fine, it was just what my body needed. My parents however (who used to be just as skinny) were not happy about it and would force me to eat/make me take syrups and whatever to increase my appetite. Idk if this could have anything to do with it but i guess so and also i wanted to vent ahaha

Anyway, when i stop eating like a mad person i obviously lose weight (no joke, in two or three weeks i dropped 10kg lol). I feel way better about myself, I’m not thinking about food all the time and just eat healthy when i have to. But then somehow i always get back to binging.

I’ve kinda accepted I’ll always be this way and established a minimum and maximum weight i should allow myself to get to lol. But it’d improve my self-esteem  greatly and probably my physical health as well if i could stop this nonsense, i just find myself back into it every time",28May2020,1
116,"I broke my one year record clean of self harm yesterday

I had a really rough childhood... my dad was on a lot of drugs and would beat my mother. He is sober now and we are still with him, however I don’t think his brain ever returned to normal. He’s depressed and has very bad anger issues. 


He has been clean almost 10 years and I am 22 now. My whole life I never thought that never really affected me but since high school I would say I suffer from depression. I’ve never been diagnosed officially as I come from a very traditional family that doesn’t discuss such issues   so I never went to therapy to actually be diagnosed as I didn’t have the resources and I guess I’ve been so used to dealing with it myself I never went to seek help as I grew older. 

In 11th grade I woke up from a depressive/panic episode in my bathroom covered in cuts, not remembering much of it but my family kind of just brushed it off and never talked about it. 

I don’t blame them as both of my parents suffer from mental illness as well but I feel frustrated sometimes because I’m not sure if everyone feels this way and I just can’t handle the same emotions? 

I’ve never thought of committing suicide but I did prepare a letter for my loved ones when it was really bad last year. My boyfriend tells me that I’m not alone and plenty people feel like this but this somehow makes me feel worst? It makes me feel weak I guess. He has no history or experience with anyone who’s had such issues so I don’t blame him and because I’ve never been to therapy I don’t know how to handle these feelings  properly (if they even are what people with depression feel?). I feel so alone as I don’t even know what these feelings I’m feeling are what I think they are. I’ve only ever told 2 people I suffer from depression because I feel guilty for “self-diagnosing”.


I’ve been a year clean of self harm, however I caved in tonight and Im ashamed to say it made me feel better. It makes me feel so abnormal and sick that I find comfort in hurting myself. I was uncontrollably crying, there was no trigger. Im really sick of feeling like this. I’m also not able to explain how my depression feels to people so I just tend to not talk about it at all. I just can’t find the right words to describe the sadness without feeling like people will think I’m being over dramatic so I just try to stay away from that in general. I tend to be codependent on distractions to not feel as much (weed, alcohol, pills,etc.). I’m not addicted but I will do it whenever I have the opportunity (I smoke everyday tho). I’m not even really sure exactly what the point of this post is but I’m just in a dark place and wanted to do something different, something more positive to try to relieve myself a little. 

I feel ashamed that I broke my one year clean of self harm. I hate that I can’t be as productive as the people around me as it’s hard for me to get out of bed most days. It makes me feel lazy and I know others think that too. 

Whenever I do confide in my boyfriend, he’s always supportive but I’m sick of dragging people down with me. I don’t want to ruin their happiness with my darkness. I look at my dad and it scares me to think that like him, I could feel like this for the rest of my life. Idk I just really want to be progressive with my mental health but whenever I do, episodes like this hit and it seems to set me back to the beginning. 

I guess this was more of a safe place for me to vent but feel free to leave any advice as well. I hope everyone is well and staying safe during these difficult times. 

I would also like to say I’m here for anyone else who feels like they’re alone and have no one to talk to... I’m here for everyone  &lt;3",28May2020,1

118,"I started this because you might not have them one day to ask this. And its always good to ask them how they are doing. One day they might have had a bad day but ask them if they want to talk about it. Not everyone has that person who wants to listen to  their problems or talk to them about their day. 
But if they have had a good day say that's good and make them look forward to asking how their day was.

I just need to do this to keep myself positive and happy. It is honestly a venting mechanism for me. Because if they have had a good day I'm happy for them but if they have had a bad day I want to talk to them about it (if they want) and make them in a better mood. I care for my friends because without them I dont think I'd be here even my family if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be here too. Stay safe and positive people:)",28May2020,1

Twitter highlights the worst in the world and I can’t bear to feel the pain of realities that don’t directly affect me. I know it sounds selfish, and if doesn’t mean I don’t care about what’s going on. It’s just, I can’t even take care of myself right now. I can’t take on more negativity when I’m battling with a heavy weight of my own, so I’ve decided to delete it and surround myself with positivity and happiness.

Uncontrollable tears well in my eyes and sometimes fall. And then everything feels like it’s just swirling around me to and I’m helpless to stop any of it so it just gets worse. It hits in waves a lot. These intense flare ups happen 2-3 times a day. Sometimes at night before bed and it makes it impossible to sleep There’s never a second that it’s not bad and eating away at me though, even when it isn’t flaring. I wake up angry and irritable with a huge feeling of dread, and can’t help but to go off on everyone. I can’t focus on a single thing to where it effects my tasks. It messes with my memory. The racing thoughts are endless and vivid like flashbacks or sensations. I don’t feel like I have interest in anything at all even things I would typically find fun or enjoy.

131,"I was initially going to ask if there was anything wrong with me. I was going to list out everything I feel and ask if in some way all of those feeling and behaviors formulaically added up to mean something. I realised near the end that that shouldn't be what I ask. I should ask how to change so here I go.

I'm 17 and about to go into my second sem of preU. I started this sem with pretty good grades after working really hard last year to get good at all the courses i was going to take. Then quarantine came around and slowly everything I'd worked hard to bring up suddenly came crashing down. My grades dropped by around 20% on average and I didn't do anything to stop it.

I was used to leaving home at 8 in the morning, coming home at four, studying and doing work until 7 and going to bed at 11. Now that I spend all my time at home, the system that I was used to and that worked for me disappeared. I knew all my grades were declining. I told myself that. My friends, my teachers and my parents were all telling me the same thing. But I just stood there, preferring to play games all day (which I really don't normally do) and waste time, procrastinating when I should've been putting in work. My body fely like it was a school break and went into comeplete vacation mode while my mind kept telling it to buck up and get some work done.

The semester is about to finish and I don't wanna let the same thing happen next sem. What can I do to not let myself get into the same behavior when it starts.

133,"My mother has always been a candidate of nervous breakdowns And has been treated accordingly. I haven't seen her this way since my childhood when her mental condition was severe. Recently she has been acting weird , looking down at the alleys repeatedly as if she's expecting someone, Making weird gestures , always pondering and murmuring to herself,Her eyes don't stay fixated onto a position,inattentive towards others. the only thing that freaks me out the most is that she copies my actions every now and then. when i am around her she'd start copying me , when i cough she coughs, when i lay my hand on my head she does the same , i do akimbo she'd pose that way too. Being the youngest among my siblings she loved me the most. Now i see her checking up on me all the time, i see her standing outside my room as if she's analyzing me. These things are freaking me out real bad ,my family members are taking note of these things too but don't take it as a serious issue.

P.S - She started acting this way since the lockdown due to covid-19 as she barely gets any chance to socialize nowadays. She's always been an extrovert. This transition from an overt person to an isolated and indolent individual is my guess for her morbidity. Recently i have been encouraging her to go out a little bit which i think improved her condition a little bit or could be a placebo feeling of mine.

I’ve never had a panic attack before, or at least not how I’ve heard it described. I used to (and still do occasionally) have ‘break downs’ where extremely small things (like someone touching my hand or chest) make me start uncontrollably crying and I have an uncontrollable urge to be completely alone. This is normally occupied with the good old voice in my head constantly listing off all the things I hate about myself, although that never really leaves. My dads side of the family also has a history of depression which makes me think I might have it also. But I’m not sure because I’ve never had the urge to self harm, other then to see why others have, but I’ve never brought myself to doing it. I often wish I was dead, never born, or more commonly, wishing that I had an excuse to finally kill my self although again, I’ve never been able to bring myself to do it out of fear for what it would do to my family (you can check my post history if you want more information). But then that makes me feel like I’m just being arrogant/narcissistic, because I know that they would obviously be fine after a while.

*Disclaimer: Below mentioned are the opinions and questions of a curious human, who would like to stimulate an open conversation about sexual mental health.*

I would like to ask any professionals with qualifications, or for that matter, equally valid, personal opinions of average-joe's to explore the phenomenon of addiction as well as preventative methods and measures to manage them. 

By now the term 'addictive personality' has become more commonplace, and by definition addiction is a compulsive physiological need for something. Can people with addictive personalities still redirect their addictions to be more healthy? Is abstinence the only way?

One theory is that addictions can be harnessed and the energy directed towards an intention which enhances overall well-being, mentally and physically.

When I am very stressed and overwhelmed I take some deep breaths and I remind myself of all I do have that I’m grateful for not what I don’t have. When you do this you will feel a large sense of relief and relaxation and the stress you were experiencing will no longer feel so unmanageable. Another time a positive perspective can be useful is waking up on days when your exhausted or just don’t feel like getting out of bed. Everyone has those days and
that’s ok because we’re human, but the concept that helps me out of bed is knowing if someone offered me all the money in the world tomorrow but I couldn’t wake up the next day I would take waking up the next day. Meaning that every morning when I wake up I just received something more valuable than all the money in the world and I got it for free! This helps me feel grateful and energized and often gets me out of my bed on those tough days. I hope reading this helped you to see the power of a positive perspective and if you want more information regarding these topics I have a podcast where I share my story more in depth and cover mental health topics like this one!

I havent self harmed in over a year and a half, I have a better relationship with my family, I have an amazing relationship with my girlfriend, I have a lot of real supportive loving friends, I have a job that I am performing very well in, I’m in the best shape of my life, and most importantly I have a fantastic relationship with myself now. What do I attribute this change too? The power of a positive perspective! There is a lot that helped me to where I am now but having a positive perspective has helped me more than anything else, I would not be where I am today without it.

154,"Everytime I think my life is going great and my mood is stable and positive, that's because I can be all by myself and don't have any responsibilities to accept.

But once someone confronts me with something or I have to look after something, I'm overstrained really really quick.
 Negative thoughts and an uncomfortable feeling just floods me. And I don't even wanna start talking about it how it ends if I fail those tasks.

155,"When I'm having a particularly bad time dealing with depression my head forces me to imagine horrible things, mostly mangled bodies or people getting tortured in unspeakable ways; sometimes it's me that's being tortured, sometimes just a random faceless person. No matter how hard I try I can't push them out of my head, and it's traumatizing. It just seems that at random intervals my brain makes up these images and staples them to my vision, I don't even feel safe inside my own head anymore.",28May2020,1
156,"Just to give you a bit of back story about my journey I’ll outline a few important moments of my life. I was dating this girl, let’s call her Cate, for 2 years from the age of 15 to 17. She was my first real girlfriend and first girl i had slept with, I was her first as well. She had mental health issues and would self harm. I managed to pull her out of that dark hole in the 2 years I was with her and transform her life and it was such an amazing experience to be able to be that for her. That was until I started getting mentally abused at home, I was torn down by an unhappy father with unrealistic expectations he was heavily religious and used religion as a tool to Condemn me and manipulate me into being a pushover. I was starting to become a man, started flexing my muscles a bit biting back at authority a little and having my own opinion but instead of nurturing that he would shut me down and make me think I was small and weak. I eventually became insecure and started taking it out on my girlfriend with ridiculous accusations that she was cheating on me and she wasn’t loyal etc but deep down i was hurting and too proud to tell her what was going on or ask for help so eventually I lost her. 
After all those sleepless nights where I would convince her not to cut into her wrists anymore all the tears and hardship I endured to be abandoned at my lowest point I had no reason to be happy anymore. 

She was the last remaining piece of jenga holding up my entire tower! My life came crashing down. I went on a 3 year bender i was Hooked to meth amphetamine at 17 stealing, robbing people, burglary and car theft whatever I could do to get drugs I’d do it. This is how I finally got back at my dad for all The times I was shutdown and made to feel small, I was the big guy now I had no empathy left in me.. I was a broken man just masking his pure sadness and pain with anger. That is until I said enough enough I was tired of running away.. I went back to my parents and asked for help they put me on the phone with a rehab called teen challenge where I spent a year rediscovered my faith and changed my entire life. My father also saw a psychologist and got help and I’ve forgiven him were friends now.

I’m 23 years old now I had my 21st birthday in rehab. I’ve got a clean record now as my offences where committed before I was 18 and in Australia they offer something so you can get your record cleaned.
Fresh start new life with no criminal record i was pumped. Found af girlfriend dated for a year.. worst year of my life and I dont want to go into details but i came into that relationship with a year of knowledge on how to communicate, conflict resolution etc I was ready for a serious relationship and she wasn’t. She broke me down made me feel worthless but I didn’t want to leave because I remember the pain it caused me. Eventually I got the fuck out of there and I feel like I’m back at square one. There has been several relationships between these two time lines but none worth mentioning. Until I was contacted by my ex from the very beginning 5 years later. We took off and have been talking none stop for the last 3 days and I have never felt so happy. we’ve both come so far and talked about everything that’s happened in our lives and she genuinely cared and was interested in everything I said. I got got some things off my chest and apologised for the way I treated her all those years ago she apologised too and i felt this immediate release. I was exited for her messages and felt like a little kid again I’ve never felt this way about anyone accept her 5 years ago. Just for a bit of perspective she made me feel happier in 3 days then I did in my entire relationship. She helped me grow as a person encouraged me and allowed me to talk about some hard times in rehab which turned out had been effecting me but I quickly woke up to myself.. what the fuck Was I doing, you shouldn’t feel like this she’s just being nice you can’t seriously be attached already, we had been too engrossed in conversation for relationships to come up. Well today she said she was seeing someone and I felt really hurt, But I really shouldn’t. People are allowed to be nice and genuine people without wanting to pursue a relationship. what the hell is wrong with me why cant I ever get over this girl?",28May2020,1
157,"So it may seem weird but just listen 

Am 19 and I’ve struggled all through school with concentration and keeping on task and finishing tasks and all that stuff, I fidget and get hyper and kinda feel like I lost control 

I went through quite a lot of trauma in primary school and secondary school so it was put down to depression and anxiety, in secondary school a teacher suggested I may have ADHD but my family just said it was just depression 

Since lockdown everything’s closed but it continued so I went on anti depressants/ anti anxiety medication and it’s not worked I’m still not concentrating and fidgeting and stuff... the medication has made me feel emotionally numb but all the things I described are still there.


Is it possible to go so long without knowing?? 

And how would I go about getting this looked into after lockdown?",28May2020,1

Social anxiety is not an enemy but a friend, Join Didi, and I in this insightful conversation where you’ll be able to receive powerful insight that will help you in realizing social freedom in any situation and much more!

Personally, a big part of my journey has been as Didi said the ability to be able to “see ourselves in everyone”, what I’m experiencing is that the more I connect and become intimate with my most authentic Self the more I’ll be able to be of service and connect in a natural and charismatic way with others.

This journey is really simple and it starts with knowing more of who you really are, by going beyond any and all illusions✨

Not sure if it has to do anything with drug use, but I’ve been smoking weed every since the beginning of this year and these feelings kind of just came right after the last time I did. The last time I did was around 2 weeks ago. I have been feeling extremely weird during the day, like people’s voices just are too loud and I’m not really the same. It’s hard to explain but I feel like I’m totally unconcentrated and my mind is racing insanely. My mind races through the craziest most random shit and in my mind I like have mini dreams sort of, like it’s hard to explain. And when this occurs I feel like I need to go to sleep, even if it’s during the day. Like I’m always tired. When I go to sleep at night it gets even worse as I literally cant tell if I sleep or not because my mind is just racing with these things.

165,"I know I can’t self diagnose, but just curious if y’all can help with your own experience. 

I’ve been thinking for a couple of years that I’ve had anxiety, but it hasn’t really gotten worse until quarantine life. I’m constantly worrying about losing my job (I don’t have a reason too), my upcoming wedding (which might have to be postponed), money (who doesn’t, though), my fiancé getting his job back or finding a new job, my dogs getting sick or injured where we couldn’t take care of them, and my parents are getting a divorce now so I’m worried about what they’re going through. I don’t think a lot of this needs to be worried about...my fiancé and I are financially stable, we have a back up plan for our wedding already, my dogs are healthy, and both my parents are strong people who have supportive family and friends. 

I’ve started crying in the middle of driving to work and at work, I can’t stay asleep in the middle of the night, I’ve always chewed my fingers, and now I’ve started getting more irritated with people at work and at my fiancé. 

I will say, I don’t like my job. I did in the beginning but now I honestly don’t give a shit about what I do. I used to enjoy talking to our residents and guests, but now I find them annoying and I just want to be left alone. I do miss my alone time at home, but my fiancé is always at home since he got furloughed due to COVID so I can’t even get time there. 

I do think I should see someone. Should I go to a regular doctor first or look for a therapist? I’ve never been to a therapist, but always felt like I needed to go. My parents asked if I wanted to see one when I was in high school, but I said no because I’m stubborn and don’t want to ask for help. I’m working on getting better at that though.",28May2020,1
166,"I hope this is ok to post here, not posted before on reddit!  On phone so sorry for typos! ^-^

My boyfriend (23M) of 7 months and I (23F) have been living together during the lockdown so we both have some company, and most of the time it's wonderful!

I know he has pretty major depression and has never has it treated and has only just even began to open up to the idea of talking to someone about it.  He uses weed to manage the irritation and frustration associated with his low mood and self loathing, but as soon as he runs out we have an episode like last night.

Yesterday he didn't get up all day (not unusual due to hypersomnia) and asking what's up just resulted in grunts or ""nothing"".  I did the usual of asking if he'd like a snack in bed, tea, the curtains open, nothing.  Ok, so a bad depression day I guessed, usually he'll just sleep through them and get up late evening for a smoke and some caffeine.

Nope.  He left without even letting me know he was up and came back with a bunch of cider and the notorious rum and coke.  He then proceeds to get drunk and angrier and angrier, culminating in him loudly swearing at himself in the bathroom mirror while cutting up his arms at 2am.  

He's never hurt me and I can see how much he's sick and tired of feeling like this.  I have PTSD and shouting, swearing and door slamming all trigger flashbacks so I really struggle to deal with the whole situation.  I don't want to make him feel worse by telling him he triggers the hell out of me when he's pissed off but I also don't want to take this kind of behaviour lying down.  It's my home and I should feel safe and I love the socks off of him and honestly I just don't know how to even begin.",28May2020,1

169,"I've been spiraling since last night. At 22 years old I pretend my moms actions don't bother me (So she doesn't get the satisfaction of hurting me) but last night I had to admit to myself that it did bother me, deeply. Then I cried. I couldn't sleep so i just cried, I cried about everything, I cried about how much I hate it here, about how crappy the world is, I cried about being black and how scary it is sometimes, over lost lives , how much I hate how my mom has this hold over me and how much I wish she would just get over it so I can have my mom back, how much I hate my anxiety, how much I hate feeling like this, how much I want to move out, how tired I am of corona, how lonely I feel. 

My biggest thing right now is that I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to about it. I don't want to burden my friends with it and generally I never really talk to them much about this kind of deep thing. I have one friend i could open up to but I know shes going through her own stuff right now so it's not fair of me to load this on her. And I just feel so alone. No one to cry to, no one to go to for comfort (Besides my therapist but I pay her to listen to me so it's really not the same). I always crave such a deep connection with people and I never feel like I find that with anyone. I hate feeling so alone and I want to change that, i was trying to go to more classes and things in person but now with corona is seems impossible. Any online friendships I try to form seem to crumple.

I just feel down and alone. I know it's not forever and I fully believe in the universe and LOA and stuff. But I just needed to vent and let it out so I can move past these negative thoughts, get them out of my head.",28May2020,1
170,"Hi. I (27M) have learnt through self observation that i am what they call a 'vulnerable narcissist', The more i read about this the more accept this condition within me. I am emotionally weak and ill disciplined person, who has shown a lack of control when expressing anger, dissapointment or mere show of love. I have always overdone things, i have done things which i have regretted alot later, a tad on the dramatic side (knowing quite well while i behaved that way that i am over doing this to get a certain kinda response that i am expecting from the other person) i have blamed my anger on others provocation (sometimes true). So now, what i have realised is that i am always anxious, always wanting appreciation and never taking rejection or criticism well. Almost everytime i am criticized at work i have come an inch close to quitting. 

If i predicted rejection to an action i never went ahead with doing that thing. This has led me to be a very calculative person who worries everytime i say Hi because i am bothered it wont be said back. It takes a long time for me to get comfortable in an environment among new people, and even then years later i spend most of my time putting every response and reaction towards me under the microscope. 

I do want to change, i want a healthy mental state, a confident personality not determined by other persons actions. I have spent most of my life trying to please others and then trying to control their reactions towards me by doing so. Shutting off to every criticism, thriving when around constant appreciation. 

I had a wierd childhood, kinda abusive but at that time almost every kid got a good beating from their parents (not cool but yet normal in India i guess) I love parents, they have done a lot for me and i could die for them. but then when i look back i keep questioning if that is the reason i was like this, to get beaten when behaving in a certain way, when getting bad grades, etc. Or was it my college days when my elder brother (who paid for most of my college and cars and what not) used to put me down in front of people, friends and claim how much i lacked i life. Or is it just me finding such reasons to blame things on. In recent days, i spend most of my time thinking about all these things. I have also recently had a break up (toxic controlling partner). But what is happening now is that i fee its me who is at fault for everything probably, because the way i am, and the way i behave, and the way i try to please people and burst when things dont go my way. I work in waves now, certain part of the day is way too good (specially when i have my black coffee) and certain times are too low, this is when i dont wanna do anything. I know i have a lot of potential, i was always bright, i was praised in my gradute college and mba college (probably why i was bright and happy, the appreciation) i feel i am not living upto the life i should have had by now. I earn less than the same people who used to praise me, i struggle more than the people i felt i was better than. I have made bad choices with career, relationships, and everything else. I know 27 is not too late. I need to move ahead in life, but things need to change. And idk how to do that. Any suggestions are appreciated.",28May2020,1

I am now 22 and doing all I can to break through it. I have done so from a mental health perspective, giving myself therapy without requiring the presence of others, but this translates to almost everywhere in my life.

Hello,

 Im A 27 year old male and I've been struggling horrendously with my mental health over the last few years. I'm now in year 5 of a 3 year degree due to the effects this having on me

Doctors have diagnosed me with Mixed Anxiety and Depression, I've been on sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram and Mirtazapine none of which have helped.

I feel that I go through regular cycles of emotions, I'll be normal for me and then over the period of several weeks I'll see a increase in positivity, but then it feels like it goes too far, in my mind it feels like my thoughts are Racing and clashing, like two different feelings trying to battle it out if that make sense, this ends up in frustration, iritabillity and anger, before I drop into a dark period of depression which can last for a few days to 2 weeks before returning back to a relatively normal state.

My GP recently referred me to a psychiatrist, hiwver with the current pandemic all I got was a 5 minute phone call, no interest in my history etc, said he agreed with my Dr, and prescribed dual therapy with mirtazapine and quetiapine which I have been on for 2.5 months now with no improvements.

I just need to get help now, it's destroyed my relationship and its destroying my degree. Can any body help with tips or no of any other support I can find.

TIA.",28May2020,1

176,"Is it possible to tell your therapist that you have bulimia and she keeps it a secret from your parents since they are not your “Bezugsperson” (Word only exists in German, it refers to an attachment figure, friend or family, someone you can trust and your ally.) 

So I’ve started to go to therapy recently due to certain circumstances. (In short, I kind of lost my drive to live, which makes me have to force myself every day to wake up and not think about death while staring at the ceiling for hours. It’s tough, let’s say that.) Before entering her room, I was asked to fill a formula which asked for the contact address of my “Bezugsperson” but since I didn’t have anyone, I wrote: “That’s why I’m here, lol. I don’t have one.” I still wonder if it was okay to write “Lol” in such a formula. It was just so bizarre for me to be there, so I just kind of did it out of habit, since the question was that strange to me. Who is the one you trust? Uh, no one? I entered room...

...And noticed that it’s really, really exhausting to talk to her since she asked me first: “I want you to explain me why you decided to come.” and I kind of exploded, just revealed about everything. She then asked me, why I had such a great desire to “grow up.”, why was I pushing myself so much to reach that goal?

**Here’s why, again:** 

What will your therapist do, if you reveal to her that you have bulimia?

You see, I have bulimia and I’ve had it now for three or four years. Nobody figured it out and it slowly developed into something else, that might not even qualify under bulimia anymore, maybe. So here a short description of my day.

I wake up, take three pills (vitamin supplements) take a shower, fry myself an egg and eat it usually with Blevita. (Blevita contains folic acid, that’s why.) I used to be able to eat it and keep it in my stomach but in the recent days, especially during Covid-19, I end up puking it out again. The reason being, I’m not going to school and can’t distract myself from the weird feeling in my stomach. Usually, I can just go to school, go to the bus, walk up the stairs and focus on my studies but with Online schooling these days, I usually just walk back into my room after eating breakfast, start feel weird and puke it out. 

After that, I diligently brush my teeth, go back to my room, start to finish all assignments teachers have sent me per mail (that’s how Online schooling works here) and also work on my own project. (I’m studying Japanese, so I learn Kanji in my free time.) Around 12 am, my mom calls me and I eat lunch. I drink a lot of water while eating lunch. This is actually normal. After finishing the meal, I go straight to the toilet, tell my parents I have to brush my teeth (since I’m wearing braces) and puke the food out until the water leaving my stomach is transparent or yellow. (The yellow fluid is probably the acid of my stomach, it tastes bitter and tends to have after effects on me sometimes, such as confusion and disorientation.) I try to stop myself immediately if the fluid gets yellow though. If you wonder how I vomit, I either can do it by just pressing my stomach (not with my hands, I just pull it in and puke, it works effortlessly since I’ve drank a lot of water.) or I use my hand if I have the feeling it wasn’t “clean enough.”

\-Interlude-

Incidentally, during school days, I usually receive a sandwich from my mother she had made in the morning, worked pretty hard on it probably, I throw it away right after entering the school building. I used to feel guilty but you’d be surprised how that disappears when continue to do it for a while. 

\-Continue-

After that, I go back to my room, study until afternoon, 15-16 pm, eat an in-between snack. (Switzerland calls it “Zvieri”, vier = 4, the meal you eat at 4.) It’s yet again an egg and Blevita. Although this time, as usual, I puke it out because my stomach doesn't’ feel comfortable. During school days, this is the meal I’d eat around 17 pm, when I return from school and my mom forces me to make myself a meal. I usually end puking that right after. 

After that, I play some video games or study Kanji until my mother calls me again for dinner, 19 pm, I eat dinner, puke it out and return to my room. Then the interesting thing happens, I pull out a 400g bar  chocolate out of my shelf and eat it. I usually buy them in many packs or used to buy a bar per day. (Here’s why it’s interesting. Chocolate 100g = 500 kcal, 400g = 2000kcal, happens to be the amount I need to neither decrease nor increase in weight per day,)

So yeah, that’s how my day went for about three years, granted, during the first year, I still had to figure out what I eat in order to prevent another weight loss. The routine-like breakfast with Blevita and eggs comes from my doctor telling me to look after my body. The start of this happened 2014-5-ish, where I managed to get a weight of 45kg with my height of 173 cm. I was underweight, my mom realized that, I realized that too because I had a lot more weak states where I just felt so weak and floaty, losing my senses. This was the true bulimia or you might call it anorexia. I vomited everything, had binge attacks but still vomited everything. 

Therefore my weight decreased. Since the body doesn’t want to give up that quickly when you do a “diet”, it tries to decrease energy usage and those were my “weak states” In short, I had starved myself until I went to the doctor.

We went to our family doctor and then I basically had to go to her each month so she could check my weight. She found out that I had a deficit of folic acid, magnesium and Vitamin D3 and I had to visit her until my weight and deficits were stable again. That’s from where the habit comes. My doctor just assuming I had anorexia or an obsession to a diet that is. 

**Here’s what I figured out:**

\-The weird feeling: It’s a feeling that makes any kind of food feel like a rock inside my stomach and this desperate desire to just “get it out” appears. An extreme example but imagine you getting impregnated by an alien and you feeling that in your stomach. In my worst days, I feel like that and I try to vomit every last bit out of my stomach, if my hand in my throat isn’t enough, then I punch. 

\-I can eat and digest stuff if I have the feeling that “I am in control.” The 400g chocolate is pretty cheap and I could buy six per week for 20 CHF. In other words, if I had an income of 20 CHF per week, I might be able to take care of all my “nutritional” needs. I’m completely aware that this is crap but it makes me feel satisfied somehow. It’s “control”, it’s something “I can do.” As an opposition to the things “I can’t do.”

\-Bulimia works as method of “venting”, I have a lot of bad things appearing in my head, so whenever I feel really shitty, I just binge eat again and vomit it out, because I just can do it now. No consequences, just a clearer head. The binge attacks or bulimia attacks don’t happen that frequently, so usually, I vomit only 2-3 times per day. 

\-Chocolate can be eaten easily since I know from first-hand experience that it’s a bitch to vomit. Nothing will hurt you more than chocolate when you have bulimia, because it’s sticky and likes to stay at your stomach walls. Because I was very familiar with the pain chocolate can cause, the pain being me who punched his stomach in despair in order to get rid of it, my brain somehow accepted it and now I can eat chocolate as long as I know how much I’ve ate. I.e, I measured chocolate can be taken in. That’s how I prevented my weight from falling and how I got released from my doctor visits. My weight stayed stable for a long time and my vitamin deficit got cured thanks to the Blevita, eggs and vitamin pills, which I still use today. I still wonder how it’s possible that I only have vitamin deficits with these three. As if chocolate has so many vitamins. I assume that it’s because vitamins don’t get digested but absorbed, i.e., I still receive the vitamins from the food I vomit. (Just guessing though.)

**Segway into depression I think. It’s somewhat related to bulimia but also not really.** 

Technically, I want to get cured of it but I want to get cured of it without telling it my parents. You might argue that this is just Karma. I vomited their food for three, four years and now it’s catching up to me. I would have accepted this Karma if it was them who caught me in the deed, then yes, no argument. But it’s not them who is trying to save me. It’s me who trying to save me. You see? I always knew it had to be over at some point, that I maybe get caught by my parents or heck by a teacher but nobody caught me. And of course I’ll continue doing it if no one is there to prevent me. It made me wonder, maybe people just really don’t care enough about these things. I’m not sure if teenager these days consider vomiting frequently as a normal occurence of puberty. Recently, my vomiting count per day is 4-7 and I lose time, sleep and my sanity bit by bit. Why? I want to reveal it but I want to reveal it when I have at least someone behind my back. You see, when you tell your parents you’ve vomited all their food for the last three-four years, then you’ll face your sins. At the same time, the thing which will attack you is your own home. If my own home attacks me, where can I run after getting beaten up? I’m a sinner, since I chose to waste food, I knew perfectly well what I was doing, yet kept doing it. People are starving out there and I waste food. I know that someone with bulimia think differently but for me, this is a clear. The moment you decide to do it, you basically accepted the fact that this food, this food that makes you live at your place, could have potentially saved the life of some other person in a poor country. Yeah, food waste is a big topic and you can moralize yourself by saying there are a lot of cases where we just waste food, so what’s the problem with vomiting it? It’s still wrong. I don’t know why to be honest but I know it’s wrong. Something called human morality or something. Maybe it’s just the thing you need in argument to make people convince you and that’s one of the forbidden things. I can’t ask people to emphasize with me if I do that, that’s why I see myself a sinner. (Not religious but that’s how I see it. You do something bad but you still do it. So you’re evil.)

Yet, bulimia is a disorder and it is also treatable and there are other people who have it as well. And usually people with disorders are kind of… eh… victims. That’s why I decided to ask for help on my own. Well, while I knew that I had bulimia, I had several other things in my mind as well concluding into one goal. “I need a friend.” Or to be more precise: “I need a true home.”

My family situation is not the best and I don’t want to talk about it too much but let’s say, I’m a son of an immigrant born in Switzerland. This other culture, I view as disgusting because it basically tells me that introverted people are insane. I get told by my mother many times that I am “insane”, for not talking much with others, for liking silence, for laughing on my own when reading something funny, for being rather calm, for having no desires.

The last one is more me who stopped asking my parents for things since I don’t see the point in getting more. You should try to get as happy as you want with the thing you already have in my opinion. That’s why I still use my old phones and laptops. They work and I can repair them. I like them, got attached to them.

Furthermore, I hear my parents arguing in the night. Arguing about so many things, so loud and noisy, I stay awake and sometimes listen to them, curse myself for being blood-related to them because that’s the only reason why I understand their rotten language. You see, I am really racist but only towards my own culture because I got treated that way because for who I was. It just hurts to get rejected when you start to find yourself. They complain about me not playing with the other kids anymore or talking with the other relatives like I used to. I stopped doing that because I wanted to figure out stuff on my own instead of continuing being a “follower”, since I was just that as a child. Didn’t know what to do, so follow some cool kid and pretend to live a childhood. The fond memories of my childhood my parents might have it in reality tainted by my dark truth I guess. What they perceived as happy, I remember as me lying and having no idea what to do. And when I finally found something I could grasp, it gets taken away from me or gets cursed. My PC? I became anti-social. For me, I worked on multiple things, learned that the world was far bigger than just my weird family and my school life in Switzerland, that anyone can find friends, who are more like kindred spirits, as you try… That you can make yourself feel good whenever you want by “asking for help.” Yeah, what a funny segway. 

**What I want:**

Rather than a help call, I want to be criticized here. I know perfectly well that I can cry somewhere on the internet, like a depression or emotional help discord or forum, and get there all the support I want, get kind words I want to hear but in my case, I’m kind of out of ideas and want to have some neutral opinions I can work with. My plan was to continue my chocolate-eating-lifestyle until I graduate from school, get a job and then move into an apartment to start my cure. Since the moment I live alone, I only have food “controlled” by me and thus I can slowly try to get rid of bulimia. With the current predicament, I have my parents giving me food every day and me refusing to eat it, therefore making both happy by eating it and then vomiting it later. They stop complaining and awaking dark emotions inside of me that make me feel unwell and I can continue to have my “control.”",28May2020,2

182,"When the pandemic imprisoned me for the foreseeable future, I did not resist, caved in immediately, and buried myself in my room, hoping for the world to recover soon. My parents (both of whom are employed at a job that normally keeps them away from 10 in the morning to about 4 in the afternoon) were *also* stuck at home with me, and for a while, the change was good. Soon, however, our differences in opinions (my liberal views and their conservative ones) made it impossible for me to spend time with them without quarreling like mad squirrels. This was at a time when I had one test left to complete the final exam of my school life (which I thoroughly despised), and the entire country (India) descended into an indefinite curfew that barred any and all forms of non-essential outing. 

That by itself wouldn't have made me the slightest bit incensed. What made the problem arise was that our Joint Entrance exams (think the SATs or the APs, but *significantly* harder) were supposed to be on April 3rd and May 17th, both of which were cancelled and rescheduled to July and August respectively. These exams are tough, but primarily because the syllabus is needlessly huge. We have a little over 90 separate chapters, ranging from a few chapters in Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Ray &amp; Wave Optics, Atomic Physics, Electromagnetism, to speak only of physics. I am not bad at studies, and I scored decently on the first test, on January, but here, pretty much nobody below the 99.5th percentile gets to take up Computer Science for their majors in college, which is insane, since they're deciding how good we are supposed to be at Computer Science by how good we are at memorizing a hundred Organic Chemistry reagents, and a thousand random Inorganic Chemistry facts. 

I'm sorry for ranting. But I can't take this anymore. The stress is too great, my head hurts, I want to sleep, and I'm regularly sleeping at the oddest hours, from 5 in the morning to 11 in the morning. I don't have any social media since our culture assumes social media distracts too much, I don't have friends to communicate with because it's impossible to talk to friends normally when you know their parents or your parents may be eavesdropping. How am I supposed to curse? I cry sometimes, I've developed this bad (since it's excessive) habit of masturbating all the time (four to five times a day), my sleep quality is generally shitty, and I absolutely can't concentrate without getting crumpled by the anxiety that comes from people pinning their fucking hopes on my feeble back. I think I have ADHD and anxiety, but we have no psychologists in my city, and online stores in India need prescriptions to sell Adderall or Ritalin or whatever-the-fuck the drug is called. 

But the most *irritating fucking thing* is my parents watching the television all the time. My father runs this stupid alternative theater troupe alongside his day-job that he thinks is the best thing in the world, and since Indians are generally dead to the outside world, he gets awards and shit for his productions too. He thinks he's this Picasso, and everyone around him is a non-creative nobody, and I think that attitude is rubbing on me. Both of my parents are what I call *culture-turds,* surrounding themselves with singing contest syndications they've already watched just to see eighteen-year-old people (my age) singing in front of an audience and randomly cry out about how talented this *eighteen-year* old girl is. I'm not interested in that shit, and I realize that my labeling of music as ""shit"" reveals that I'm biased. Well, I am. I hate music of the like my parents hear precisely because they hear it, and because I know, or at least I think they'd much prefer to have a child that sings those unoriginal meaningless songs than one who scored a 98.92 fucking percentile on their Joint Entrance test (in Physics, Chemistry and Math), one who read a *shit* load of stuff that other Indians my age wouldn't dream of reading, including parts of Plato's *Republic,* the entirety of both *1984* and *Animal Farm,* as well as *One Hundred Years of Solitude, Thinking: Fast and Slow,* and  one who has a weak-yet-fundamental understanding of how statistics, capitalism, communism, inflation, and the economy function. 

Am I bragging? Yes, yes of course I am! But I wanted to say that I matter more than they think I do. They say they're happy their son knows a lot of things, but that I shouldn't *say* that out loud since I'd sound like an upstart, but then they go on to praise these people who're the same age as me, and call them geniuses and shit. What the fuck do I do? You're going to say that praise isn't a zero-sum game. You're going to say that I am an arrogant prick that deserves what I have, that others don't even possess what I do, and I should be grateful. Well, guess what? Grief isn't a zero-sum game either. Just because someone is terribly sad doesn't mean I must be less so. Remember when Saoirse Ronan is angry at Timothee Chalamet in *Lady Bird* for not disclosing that he's not a virgin and he reminds her of people dying in the Iraq war? You're doing that.

I want to shout out into the night without anyone noticing me, I want to talk to my friends like I normally talk to them, I want to tell my crush I like her even though she doesn't even remember me at this point since I moved to a non-coed school after 10th grade so I could get more holidays to study at home, and I want to scream at my father and tell him that his art sucks, and scream at my mother to lower her expectations of me, even though he loves me, and even though she loves me, and I love them.

185,"I've been going through a difficult time in my relationship. My wife and I got married last December at the courthouse. I married her ahead of our planned wedding date due to a number of issues we had regarding agreeing where to live. We had bought a house together a year ago that she hated and she never sold her old house.

Fast forward to March and she moved out back to her old house. She thought I should move with her. I told her I needed to stay to sell it. Then pandemic happened so selling it become even more difficult. My rental house came off lease and I ended up having to sell that one too. During a pandemic. Then she lost her job.

Selling the house I'm in has been brutal and I've been dealing with contractors and repairs constantly. My wife has done zero to help and wants nothing to do with it. I've been here on and off for 2 months trying to get it all done. I still don't want to move back to her old house and I've been resisting. She now wants me to help pay her bills at her old house. Due to house sales I've lost almost $80,000 in realtor fees and repair costs to make the sales happen.

I ended up in the ER twice in the last week due to stress. Thought I was having a heart attack. Wife still insists I move in with her instead of getting an apartment for a short while to get my mental health sorted. Been crying and my stomach hurts all the time and I constantly feel shaky. I still have my job and I'm fighting through anxiety and stress to keep going. I know I need treatment but I have a job that I have to keep and I don't have time to deal with appointments and finding someone right now.

Had another blowout fight with wife last night because I want to get an apartment for a while and not live with her full time. Need to have time to get a therapist and deal with my mental health but she wants her husband to live with her full time and will hear none of it. Lately I've been considering living in my car or moving back with my mom. I'm just exhausted from trying.

I should feel grateful I still have a job and I haven't lost everything but my mental health has been so severely impacted that I sat in a ball and cried again this morning. I'm hoping I don't end up in the ER a third time. I had to answer a battery of mental health questions about the ER about whether I was going to harm myself and didn't have a great answer. Yes, I've thought about driving into a wall recently, do I really want to say that out loud? Do I want to be on a mental health hold? No. I need to keep going to get stuff done. The house sale closes in a week and it needs to get done. I can't back out. 

Do I actually have a plan to do anything to myself? No, but the hypothetical has been there. 

The strength to keep pushing on is hard and I don't see a light at the end of this tunnel that doesn't end up in a horrible divorce. If I try and talk to her she's relentless and will keep pushing and pushing until she gets her way. I don't even know if the relationship can be salvaged at this point but I'm past the point of having the energy to try.",28May2020,1

Things have escalated when he started receiving calls from these trolls. My partner is very stubborn and has a lot of pride so instead of ignoring, he responded and started provoking them. I am so scared of how he is mentally and would like for him to receive mental help via Inpatient. I asked him to re-consider Inpatient but he was traumatised from a previous incident that involved him being taken by authorities to the hospital Behavioral Ward for suicidal thoughts.

I was lucky enough to get to interview a brilliant teacher on how the mental health in schools will look post Lockdown. We talk in a calm and friendly way.

203,"I've had two big events that I believe might be related to the issue: covid 19 and first job after studies (I do enjoy my job although it is quite a change from my life as a student). I would say my current relatuonship has taken quite a toll on my mental health from time to time due to some unresoveld issues we are working on. I used to meet a lot of friends each week even though I worked a lot during my studies, and was allways eager to do so. My job is quite social (so was my old job), so I was aware that I might be more socially tired than before when I started working. Yet with the pandemic in addition the the gradual time of me focusing on my job and beeing less social I feel extremly less interested in the people already in my life, my friends, s.o., and family. I really don't see why, and I don't feel like myself atm.",28May2020,1
204,"I have got OCD and OCPD but I suspect I've got other conditions also.

Is it quite likely that other characteristics are due to mental health conditions rather than just personality traits?

Whilst  I'm being diagnosed and treated for OCD and OCPD I'm examining all the  other types of aspects of my life and personality that I feel are just  not normal and have somehow made me feel different.

Does anybody else have this feeling?",28May2020,1
205,"I don't know how to process what I'm going through right now.   
Over the course of my life, I've been described as incredibly cold and emotionless, something that always kinda pissed me off, but true to the things they said I'd never speak up about it. I never spoke up about anything, actually. I was a huge doormat, and didn't ever have an identity of my own. I've had a lot of relationship issues over the years, and my family-- while supportive, tiptoes around me and generally says I'm hard to be close to. I didn't really ever understand why or what was going on that made things like this. There has been trauma, but compared to what most people generally think, the things I went through as a kid are a little unorthodox and difficult to find common ground with. All things considered though, I never felt particularly burdened by what happened, just that others said I've changed somehow.  


A few months ago, I had my very first panic attack, though I didn't know that's what it was. It was intense, I thought I was going to die, but I didn't go to the hospital for it. I was under the influence of pot, so I tied the issue to being that I was just not handling pot very well lately. It happened a few more times while I smoked, until one night I experienced the attack completely sober. At that point, I caved and went to the ER thinking I was going to die. I came back just fine, even felt myself getting better literally on the way to the ER, and nurses said all my vitals were just fine and that it was likely related to anxiety. A few more trips to the ER later and eventually I concluded that it was all in my head, and just like that all the physical symptoms like racing heart and tremors disappeared entirely. 

The emotional overflow is still there though. In fact, it's been just bordering the edge of my mind until a few days ago when I tried to journal my thoughts for the first time-- to write down an objective line of thought regarding my issues and what I felt about it. Since then, the well of emotions started boiling over, and two days ago after finishing this really cute romance show I had been streaming, I woke up that next morning in utter turmoil, crying relentlessly and being totally overrun with emotions that I can't describe or identify. I can't say what it feels like because I don't really know how to describe it, but ""attempting to stand on your two feet as an avalanche plows through you"" is the best I've been able to manage so far. I hate reality, I hate how I am. So many missed opportunities that, now that I look back, all went by in a blur like the rest of my life. I can't help but feel like I'm facing the reality that I let 12 years-- half my life --blow by in an effort to hide from my emotions.   


This is the only thing that really makes any sense. I've been historically avoidant of anything that suggests negative emotions like music and dark themes, and I have a habit of addictive behavior. Suicide is terrifying to me now. The trauma that other's have experienced and confided to me with are suddenly hitting me like a truck. Honestly, I want to hear someone definitively tell me that the facade I've put up is falling apart and the water's all rushing in at once, because I'm also worried I'm just going insane. Something inside me feels like I need to keep feeling this though. I've always been frustrated with how everything feels so disconnected and that I feel like an alien, but this wave of emotions are honestly the most human I've ever felt in my life.  


Any thoughts on all of this would be great. Thanks, and have a great day.",28May2020,1
206,"I’m not sure how to explain my situation but I really do need some advice. 

Recently I’ve developed a rather concerning habit due to my insecurities. I’m a 19-year-old girl currently going through an intense depressive episode so no doubt I’m impulsive and handling things the wrong way. 

When it comes to eating I feel less guilty and better about myself when I throw it up. Before I used to restrict what I ate an awful lot, but it’s been harder to control myself. The reason I felt the need to post this was because I vomited blood for the first time and I’m a little frightened as to what I’ve done to my body, and if I should/shouldn’t tell someone? Why did I vomit blood? I’ve only been eating and purging for about 5 days. 

I haven’t told anyone about this. Reason being I don’t even understand it fully myself. Should I tell my family? I fear what my mother would think of this. I just can’t tell her, but what if she finds out? What if something serious happens to me? But what really frightens me is if I’m forced to stop what I’m doing. Purging is the best method I have come across, yet it’s a dangerous one.

207,"I'm 23F and lived in a place where Mental Health is not really something to talk about.

For the past few years, I've been suicidal from time to time. I started feeling 'sad' when I was in highschool, I used to write suicidal notes and just hide them somewhere in the house.

&amp;#x200B;

\------- Paragraph from here is a backstory of my childhood. If you wanna know my struggle right now you can skip this-----

A backstory, When I was a baby my mom and dad broke up. My mom didn't have the chance to take care of us (me and my brother which is older than me) but she had the chance to meet us every weekend, we slept at her house.

We were taken care by our aunt (our mom's sister) until I was and eventually left, after she got married. Afterwards, we were taken care by our uncle (my dad's brother) until I was 12 I think? He was already old, but he had an affair when I was 10 or 11 I think. I couldn't even imagine how, he was already old and stuff? I think he was gambling, and saw the girl on the night club or whatever.

We were told not to say a thing about it, not even to my father (who's working abroad and only go home once a year for 1 week or so) but eventually his wife found out.

While we were taken care by our uncle, I used to get bullied by my cousin, they used to say that I were ugly, even my physical appearance, they said nasty things about it, like I have a dark armpit, I have a very hairy legs and such things. So I never had confidence about myself or anything even though people kept saying that Im beautiful and stuff, It felt like an insult for me.

So after they found out the affair, we were slightly taken care by our other uncle (who also lives in the compound and also my dad's brother) it was until I was 13, our mom already took over and took care of us.

My mom was very young when she gave birth to my older brother.

I also had an experience where I saw my mom getting beat up by her boyfriend which I approved off when he was courting, and I felt guilty until now.

Back when I have a boyfriend, I used to think that he's gonna leave me eventually, Im not gonna get married and stuff. I used to think of every bad thing he can think of to leave me and its like Im already preparing for it. Our relationship was intense, it was toxic, he could not even hear my feelings out. Whenever I address my feelings he was like ""Problem? Again? When will this end?"" I used to push him away, but I also beg him to stay. I was really confusing, but at the same time I was sad. I used to had breakdowns and cut myself whenever we have arguments, I used to get mad at him full blown on a slightest thing he do. I used to say mean things, but also beg him to stay because I am so scared.

\------- end of childhood-----

One day, I am so sad. Like really sad, and got really mad that my 'comfy' was eaten by one of my family member, I was so sad and angry at the same time it felt like I dissociated from my body. It felt like I've gone maniac. I took a knife and shouted out that Im gonna kill myself, I'm tired and stuff and dont try to stop me or else Im gonna kill them. I locked myself in the room. My brother kept knocking my door and I didnt open it until they destroyed my window and found that I have lots of scars in my body after that incident, I couldn't remember what happened. I also remembered my mom told me that my sadness is just all in the mind which also causes me to snap.

Since that day, I never told my family about my experiences. I kept it all inside me, and I could not even express it to my ex, we've been together for 3 years and it wasn't really good. I kept saying that he's gonna leave me, we're not gonna get married but I also loved him.

After we broke up, he went to military on the other country. After 1 month, I begged him for us to get back together but he cant. I waited for him for a year, and was really not stable but we didnt really click.

for the past 3 years, I'm single. I had a few  suitor for the years, it was always going well when Im getting attached, Im getting tense and overthink a lot which caused me to push them away. My friends always tell me to give them a chance but theres something inside me that I cant and I dont know whats that. It just felt uneasy.

And from time to time while I was on my way to school or work, theres always someone who asks why am I talking to myself and laughing on my own, wherein I cant remember that it happened? One of my workmates thought that I'm with someone while stalling at the mall because I were talking to myself and my face was serious, but they noticed that I dont. They were slightly scared, and I dont also remember that!

And now, I have a suitor who knows my struggles because they were there when I was breaking down, because he's in my circle of friend. He was reallllyy nice, He's really do his best to understand me and really supportive to my struggles and really considerate, always here's me out. He was almost perfect! He triest his best to understand me, how do I know that? On his first courtship, it was a total disaster, he was so naive to mental health, was really inconsiderate and all. After 3 months, we still kinda talk cause he's in my circle of friends, he tried to court me again. AND HE WAS A REALLY DIFFERENT PERSON I WAS SO OVERWHELMED NA I COULDNT EVEN TAKE IT. Like, this one is really gonna hurt so bad when he lives WHICH I KNOW HE WILL!

He told me that, he changed because he wanna know me better and he learned from his past mistake.  He told me that he regret doing that to me and he made himself a better derserving person for me, AND HE WAS LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON, I was so happy back then but I could not stop thinking of reason why he'll leave me. Like he deserves a better person not me and stuff, after 3 months of courting I told him to stop. It's not gonna work out, OH MY GOODNESS WHY DID I EVEN SAY THAT. I was so devastated, I cutted myself and told him Im sorry and I didnt even meant that!

I tried saying sorry for him for 3months, started january until april. I told him that I'll try to change and not push him away. BUT I CANT AND I REALLY NEED HELP WHY I KEPT DOING THAT AND I AM FRUSTATED, He eventually courted me AGAIN this april. (he had reasons why it took that long and it was valid, and im not gonna tell it. It was work related)

During the first 3 months, IT WAS REALLY INTENSE. WE HAD A HUGE FIGHT EVERY WEEK. He always hears me out, he was calm and I WAS REALLY THANKFUL FOR THAT BUT MY FEAR JUST GOT INTENSE BECAUSE HE'S SO KIND! And I never experienced anything in my life. We always resolved our problem but I have unlimited worries and fear.  I used to cut myself whenever we had arguments and felt like he's getting tired of me, wherein he just wanted to rest and calm his mind before we talk because its not good to make decision on this situation. I WAS SO SCARED THAT HE'S GONNA REALIZE THAT HE'S BETTER OFF WITHOUT ME AND I CUT MYSELF, and that happened often. And Im sad that he's getting sad that I used to cut myself, he always tell that I can always talk to him about what I am feeling and we're always gonna find ways how to solve it. But I'm scared that he'll eventually get tired so things just when like this on and off, on and off. Very unstable.

He used to say why I always decide 0 or 100% I told him that have a hard time between those choices. Its like, if I saw something that's gonna hurt me, I Immediatly shut them down. 

I often have anxiety attack from time to time, the last one was awful, I had 148bpm, everythings numb. I cant breath, felt like collapsing and stuff and yes I cut myself again, I was getting out of my mind. I couldnt sleep, only had 1 to 3 hrs for the whole day. 

I had this serious panic attack cause we had a huge argument, and he told me that he realized things, he felt like we're not progressing about the problem we have encountered. And he felt uneasy about it, it so intense that the moment I heard the he 'realized' something, my mind just turned off. there, panic attack

and for the 3rd time, I told him to stop. AGAIN! I. CANT. STOP. DOING. THAT.

And I cant get diagnosed due to coronavirus. I need help, Im getting out of my mind.",28May2020,1

210,"Every time I undergo what I deem as a massive breakthrough it just makes me disconnected and confused. The more I look inwards the more dissociative I become. My thoughts are directly in response to my emotions, but my emotions most of the times don’t seem to be coming from projections outward. Because of this, my world view and self imagine change so frequently that my platform of reality keeps tearing itself down everything I try to build it up. I can go from on top of the world to suicidally depressed in a matter of hours when nothing objectively changed. The lows are so intense and happen way more often than the highs could ever make up for. Not to mention the feeling of having my highs ripped away from me and watch as it crashes to what I deem as my personal hell for the better part of two decades has taken a tole of my psych. I assume it’s my thoughts that are the problem naturally so I’m constantly observant of my own mind and which thoughts I allow go through. As my mind cycles it’s like my thoughts that once lived there no longer find it homely. If I force what I thought on the highs when I’m anywhere else it feels so unnatural and uncomfortable that the anxiety alone causes me to resort to disconnecting myself or go along with the lows. Everything I try to do in life slips though my hands and my perception of the world is reflecting of that. At every crash, things get more grey and blue. My ambition has been shattered and I’m constantly holding on that something will change. The instability is the only true feature of the world and myself that remains constant.

I've never had a very strong body. I've been through a few operations, but none of them were life-threatening.

I've seen lots and lots of news about the pandemic, I have a few friends who got it and the numbers don't get out of my head. Plus the political situation around the world is making things a lot worse. I was very interested in the global economy before all this, but now it's the least of my worries. I just don't want to die. My mom is the only person living with me and she's turned 60 last year. I also blame myself a lot for not being able to be strong enough to protect her.

This being said I've always wanted to help people with mental health, as I've got the kind of backstory that'd make me op in an anime as my friends say, one option I was thinking is starting a Kik group up, I was thinking Kik as unlike WhatsApp there less personal data to it etc. More so as to give people somewhere they can go to rant or just have a laugh, somewhere without any weight but also without any responsibility towards it. Unlike therapy you won't have to feel bad not speaking etc.

My other us some advice, this one qoute has kept me going throughout everything, it was pushed me to learn to bandage and possibly sew a wound up if needed 


""Decide to be fine until the end of the week. Make yourself smile because youre alive and that's your job. Then do it again the next week""

It's simple but it sticks to me, the way I see it people with mental health are stronger than the average person, we win wars everyday, sure we lose the war and relapse and sure we seek help through therapy and medication but in the end, we managed to survive against the scariest thing, ourselves.


If anybody's interested in the Kik group, please comment and stuff and I'll sort one out alternatively if anybody needs advice and or just to chat, please just message me, I hate to be the guy who's ""been through it all"" but at 21 I've been experienced more than most, or so I'm told.

215,"I'm in my 30's and after trying ECT, CBT, Gestalt Therapy, meditation, journaling, exercise, light boxes, self micro dosing with MDMA and Ketamine (my therapist knew - I'd be open to trying these in a professional setting if I could find resources on how) - I am ready to try traditional psychiatric medications again. I am also interested in EMDR, but have Medicaid and can't find a provider that takes it in NYC. For the sake of this thread, I am focusing on medication, but of course feel free to DM if you have a provider you know of. 

From puberty to about 23 years old I've tried Wellbutrin, Seroquel, Paxil, Elavil, Effexor, Cymbalta, Zoloft, Respiradol, Prozac, and probably a few more that I'm forgetting. Medications never worked and gave me horrible side effects, but I'm a different person now, older, and I want to give this another shot. The ONLY drugs that touched my symptoms are Xanax/Valium and it's become a problem getting Xanax prescribed even with my therapists support (I'm not here to debate about Benzos, so I won't). 

I've been physically abused, sexually abused, abandoned, starved, admitted to psychiatric facilities. It's worse than it sounds but I don't want to go into detail, I just want to be clear that my problems are severe, both genetic and environmental.  

Every time I see a new doctor they give me a new diagnosis. I've been labeled at one time or another with the following: BPD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Bi Polar Mixed, PTSD, CPTSD, GAD, and MDD. All I know for sure is I have trauma, constant anxiety, crippling brain fog, little control over my thoughts or feelings, and a depression that I don't remember ever living without. 

But I have dealt with some truly unethical, sadistic, and inept psychiatrists. Unless I'm an active participant in my treatment, I have no interest with working with a close minded pill pusher whose going to cycle me through multiple medications rapidly, and create complex cocktails to treat side effects while dismissing me as a person (and a woman). I won't work with someone who isn't willing to make a collaborative effort and incorporate life style changes. 

I know I need to do research but I don't know where to start, and I don't have a brain for science. But I need to be my own advocate if I'm going to get anywhere. 

Here are what I think my questions are, but I don't even know if I'm asking the right ones:

1. What are reliable sources of information that a layperson would have access to?
2. How is it determined which medications are right for which person?
3. How is dosage determined?
4. How long should one stay on a single medication before switching or adding a new one? 
5. Does diagnosis really effect medication choice? Are there real differences in the brain that back up why certain meds are chosen over others? 
6. How does the replicability crisis factor into all this and is there even data I can trust? 

Lastly, if there is another subreddit or forum you think might be beneficial to me I would be grateful for the suggestion, or any resources. Thanks in advance, this is just another step in an already long journey for me. ",28May2020,1
216,"Hi everyone! I'll try to keep this short. My current problem is that I had a full-blown mental breakdown in February and I haven't recovered. Harm &amp; narcissism OCD, possible BPD traits just going crazy, and benzo withdrawal with indescribable rage.

So basically, I just broke down in February. I've been having a very hard time since November 2015 when I had an adverse reaction to an antidepressant and I feel like I never recovered. Every day is filled with terror and very dark thoughts. Also, I lost connection to every living being. I can look at my family members, SO or friends and they seem like strangers. I feel like something burned out in me and I'm just not there. I'm familiar with DP/DR but this seems like something more. This is also the reason why I got the idea fix that I'm a narcissist. I've been tested based on the DSM manual and the therapist didn't diagnose me with any personality disorders but there are strong OCD tendencies.

Anywho, sometime at the end of February, I went to a psych hospital, I was there for approx a month altogether. After that, I've been staying at my parents' place. I've had terrible harm OCD thoughts directed at my loved ones but I also have genuine rage from the constant state of terror my mind is in. Everything is made worse by the fact that even though my mom wants to take care of me, she's my trigger person. She was always emotionally distant and I'm constantly in the fear that I will be abandoned or scrutinized. However, I'm also afraid of going back to my SO because my breakdown entailed feeling like I love absolutely no one and telling him (I've told him before) that I absolutely don't want children.

So the situation right now is that I'm with my parents 160 miles away from my home which I shared with my SO. For the past 2 months, I've only talked to my SO of almost 5 years over Messenger, not even calls. He's becoming depressed because he's worried about me and he's now actually considering what it would be like to live life without having children. I'm feeling like everything is collapsing on me and I can only feel terror and rage for some reason.

Aside from freaking out about absolutely everything in the world (I'm literally frozen with fear, I can't even decide whether to eat or not), I will have to decide whether I will go to a friend's birthday party. My SO will be attending, and so will be many other friends. I've been in complete social isolation since March. I don't know what to do. This is not normal anymore but when I think about going, I want to puke my guts out. For context, my tolerance for performing with anxiety is pretty high but I feel like I'm not even human anymore. On the other hand, I'm deathly afraid that if I do recover, I will have lost everything in my life.",28May2020,1
217,"Hi, I'm Mathis Kremer and I'm the salutatorian of Smithfield High School. I'm calling all c/o 2020 student body presidents, salutatorians, and valedictorians to promote the hashtag #MHE4ME as a means to send the message to the education system that Mental Health Education is NEEDED, NOW. 

I believe that mental health education would solve an exceptional amount of problems in today's world that are becoming more prevalent than ever. Even causing protests...

First: school shootings. If students are mentally stable and more compassionate toward each other as a result of being taught the consequences of their words, then they'll be less likely to hold enough hate in themselves to shoot other children. 
Second: anxiety in the students that don't know how to deal with the stress that comes with an abundant course load. Mental health education should teach students how to practice habits of both THINKING and DOING in order to stabilize one's mind. 
Third: hostile division across the country. Whether it be over politics or whatever, I've noticed a rising amount of hostility between people of differing ideas. Mental health education should educate people on how to control their emotions, keep calm, and look at things in a positive light. In this case, the positive light would be seeing the other person as an opportunity to become educated on differing views. 
Fourth: unhappiness. The rising depression and suicide rate. 
Fifth: lack of motivation. Teaching students their road to happiness by providing methods of self care will make them more efficient in school and in the long run (at their jobs) by establishing an internal locus of control and a strong mental foundation in students. 

During my senior year, my school was threatened to be shot up on social media. Luckily, police were able to raid the suspect's house and confiscate his guns and ammo. What did my school do in case we're not so lucky in the future? Nothing. Simply hope it doesn't happen again.

This is wrong. Giving kids work only to have them become anxious about it is wrong. This country's hostile division is wrong.

Gun laws, giving teachers guns, implementing metal detectors, pasting hopeful quotes on school walls, etc, are simply bandaids to this problem that stems from unhappiness. 

I'm proposing a solution, not a bandaid.

220,"I'll start by noting that i have abandonment related PTSD, and some pretty awful panic attacks.

I started seeing this guy at the end of February, as soon as we met I felt the bubble.  When all the covid craziness started we ended up quarantined together (not the greatest thing for a new relationship).
We ended up breaking up, I came back home and we didnt talk at all for 3 weeks.

Yesterday we decided to take a day trip together on a whim, just go out and drive...
I felt the bubble again, almost immediately.

The bubble is a happy place, where nothing else matters except pure joy and doing nothing but exactly what my body tells me.
Its like when we're around each other my mind completely blanks, I want to do everything that just feels correct in that moment.  I've never experienced anything like this before...

Unfortunately as soon as real life comes back around, a simple text or a phone call will do it, when we part ways, (or the mention of an ex -_-) the weird non existent bubble burst and I instantly start to have insane panic attacks, every time.

What is this? Is this just a sign of a toxic relationship? Has anyone else experienced this sort of bubble-esqe...thing?",28May2020,1

222,"Hey all, I’ve been in therapy for maybe 10 years up until moving to LA 2 years ago. I had tried getting set up with a therapist through my Medi-cal insurance but I couldn’t get ahold of the right department and I kept getting the run around. So I eventually gave up.

My anxiety and depression keeps increasing and I’ve reached the point where I absolutely have to go back to therapy. I thought about doing virtual therapy such as BetterHelp but I really think I need to be on some sort of anti-depressant at this point. I’ve tried a plethora of “natural” remedies already. I don’t know how to go about getting help or medication. 

I’ve always been with kaiser, integrative health doctors or military doctors and getting help then seemed a lot easier. I’ve found Medi-cal to be really confusing and inconsistent. 

Can someone help to point me in the right direction or give me some insight into what the process is like?

Thank you",28May2020,1

224,"Okay so this is a long wind up, my bad

I was overwhelmed with emotion because I started to remember a pet that died a few months back. I was sad when she died but I kept shifting between logical 'yep she is dead, but why am I not sad rn' and extensive emotional realisation that she is dead. A few months passed and I became unable to emotionally react to her passing.

But I got overwhelmed with emotion because I forced myself to look at a video of her for 2 minutes before I started to remember how much I love(d) her. When I got overwhelmed, I realised the emotional part of my brain kinda seperated off of my logical brain, so my logical brain was having seperate thoughts than my emotional brain. My logical brain was aware that my emotional thoughts were seperate all of a sudden. I realised because I was crying about my pet, and the other part of my brain was thinking 'hey I should go brush my teeth' and I started to think that I was lying to myself about my emotion because how can I be so sad at the same time as being so neutral. But because my emotion felt so genuine to me I thought maybe these thoughts occured in seperate parts of my brain, like two different people. At that point it was, for some reason, very obvious that that was the case. I realised that everytime I am overwhelmed with sad feelings (not too often, fortunately) this same thing happens but I never become aware that my brain seperated.

I feel like this could explain how I (and others) have a different personality in a social setting, like I feel my brain is usually controlled by my logical thoughts but more emotional and social thoughts take over in social interactions, basically like a second mind with different thoughts taking over.

I always fail to retain anything like this, even now my memory of how this event felt to experience has faded (I knew this would happen though so as soon as it happened I wrote down what I felt)

Is it normal for emotional thoughts to be seperate like this? Also does my different personality thing have any merit?",28May2020,1

All my life I have been known to be very robotic/emotionless. I have been brushing it off for most of my life but I noticed it’s starting to affect the people I care about in my life, including my wife.

I have always been a high achiever and people/ coworkers expect me to exceed expectations on pretty much any task assigned to me because I’m “a machine” as in I will work on something until the best possible result is achieved. As a result, I’ve racked up many achievements such as national titles in the sport I picked up, I own multiple championship rings, numerous promotions at work, etc. I take great in pride in this (as you can see I can’t shut up about it) but I feel like it is a part of this robotic personality I have which allows me to have this extreme focus on a goal.

Now there’s a very dark side to this personality as well. When I feel happy, my face shows no emotion (think: my wife walking up to the altar). I am unable to sing/dance because my brain will just not allow me to express it even though I’d love to. It’s like I’m locked inside my body. The people around me have been amazing to me even though I usually come off uninterested (I’m not! It’s just my face).

I don’t want my wife to have to sing and dance by herself in the car while I drive the car with my poker face. I just want to be able to at least be present.

Maybe this is a normal thing many people have and I’m just overreacting but I just don’t know where to start. Is this something I need to seek professional help for?

239,"For the last couple of days i've experienced this anxious feeling regarding simply existing. I don't know what it is, but the feeling of me being me, to even be alive feels so absurd and off putting. It's so bizarre because there has never been a point in my life where i haven't existed, but now it really bothers me. It's not about self-hate, i like the person i am, it's just that the very concept of existance feels anxious.

I find that either if i'm around people, strangers or people i know the feeling disappears, the same with if i watch a movie or TV-show, but not whilst reading a book. It gets especially awful when i try to go to bed, it get's hard to breath and my mind races. For the last couple of nights i've had to put on some music to focus on, in order to drift to sleep.

243,"When I was 13, my life was seemingly uprooted, and transplanted hundreds of miles away. I'm 32 now, and I guess this is where my struggles with depression began. 

Life in my home town was great. It was a small town, but not so small that everybody knew everyone. I had friends, played sports, participated in academic extracurriculars, everything was as normal as one could hope for. 

In the 3rd grade, I was given a test, and qualified to be placed in the program for ""gifted"" students. While it definitely expanded my educational potentials, looking back, it more so made me feel ""different"", with a sense of superiority over the other, ""non-gifted"" kids. It made me feel that because I had these gifts, I should be given special treatment, and allowed to get away with things that others did not. I didn't have to try nearly as hard as others to achieve superior results, in most cases. This lead to a lack of drive, to become the best version of myself I could be. Why put in so much extra work, just for it to go unnoticed?

Flash forward to 2003, and I am a freshman in Highschool, in a city that has ~35x the population. A school that, alone, had 10% of my home towns population. 2000+ students, and I knew no one, had no friends and was entering , potentially, one of the most uncertain, hostile environments, a teenager faces, highschool. 

I made a few friends, but mainly, I longed to move back to Virginia. I spent nights crying myself to sleep, hoping that some how, some way, it would happen. Even to the point of wishing for the divorce of my parents, so that my mother could take us back home.

This feeling went on for a few years, until I guess I just realized it was an unsustainable hope. 

I put on the face, and tried to do all the things normal highschoolers did. I went to parties, I tried to make friends, and maybe I did, but I always felt like the outsider. I spent social gatherings either stoned off my ass and super quiet, or drunk and obnoxious. There was very little in between. 

The underlying, unidentified at this point, depression, also caused me to have outbursts of extreme anger and frustration. Lashing out at friends and family members. It was self sabotage. I hurt the ones that loved me, so that when they pulled away, I could justify it by telling myself they never cared to begin with. It was an isolating feeling, that left me feeling lonely, even in a room full of people. 

I never really felt suicidal, but I certainly started to feel ""non-vital"", wondering what life would be like if I simply just didn't exist, if I had never been born, if I was hit head on by a semi truck, would anyone even care? These feelings an thoughts would linger throughout adulthood. 

I fell further into a depressed state, skipping more days than I went my senior year. It was simply easier to deal with the consequences of skipping school, than to actually get up and go. I had no drive, no desire, no motivation. I had no idea what I wanted to do when highschool was done and over, and it was paralyzing feeling. 

Minus the truancy, from the outside, I probably seemed like a normal guy. I had friends that I was always hanging out with, I had a girlfriend, a car, a job. But something was never right on the inside.

I fell into a pattern of frequent and often excessive, drug and alcohol use. Marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, acid, shrooms, various pharmaceuticals, you name it, I've tried most of them. In hindsight, I feel like I was just looking for an escape. Something to quiet my brain, if only for a couple of hours. 

In 2010, my first and only child was born. Before this, I had never considered myself ""parental material"" and always thought a dog would be the most responsibility I could handle.

On Sept 25th, we welcomed our daughter into the world. Her mother and I's relationship was incredibly turmultuous. We separated during her pregnancy, but decided to give it another shot before she was born. This didn't last long due to incidents in which I will not go into detail.

This split left me with a tremendous amount of anxiety for my daughter's future. I wanted her to have a ""normal"" childhood, and this surely would impair that dream.

These feelings of anxiety and depression became the norm. It didn't even feel like a different state, this is just who I was now. Angry, bitter, depressed, paralyzed by anxiety, unable to find motivation in life. But, you'd never know it.

I kept myself neat, did my hair, showered, looked nice, went to work, and preformed at a high level. I was friendly, engaging with both coworker and customers. Still had friends, still had romantic relationships, but most just came and went after a year or so. 

I put on a facade, and acted like everything was great, until it wasn't. I'd keep my feelings bottled up, until I couldn't. 

These days, I still have the stable job, the car, a nice house, beautiful daughter, and an amazing partner who has, for the last 5 years, been my rock and understood what I've been going through, even if I didn't. I still wake up and shower everyday. I still comb my hair and brush my teeth everyday. 

But, I also still feel empty, living a life devoid of any particularly special meaning or purpose. Besides her, I've driven off or withdrawn myself from all but a couple of friendships. Part of it is just not ""being able"" to do anything, to keep plans, to make new connections. Putting on and keeping up the ""show"" at work, is exhausting, and when it's over, I feel like I don't have the energy for anything else in my life. I go through every day, just waiting and dreading the next. Almost hoping to just not wake up one day, because all of the positive moments seem so brief and singular, while the negative seem to cling to me and compound with each new episode. 

Depression and anxiety has ruined numerous friendships, and relationships. Caused me to not know how to communicate with my parents and family like we used to.

I'm not writing this because I'm cured. I don't know if that will ever happen. I write this because I've spent almost 20 years, 2/3rds of my life, succumbing to depression. I recognize now, that I HAVE to do something. I don't know if I can make it another 20 like this.

To those that I've lost touch with, or hurt along the way, I'm truly sorry, it wasn't your fault. 

I'm not ok yet, but I will be. The first step is recognizing that I needed help. The rest will come, one day at a time. 

If you're struggling like I have, don't wait to talk to someone. I've wasted so much of my life feeling this. Today, I said, enough..",28May2020,1
244,"I have OCD, anxiety issues, depression and autism. Ever since I left school in 2015 and last year when my friend passed away, I have constant reoccurring dreams/nightmares of sometimes school, but mostly of my friend.

My friend passed away because of cancer (fuck you cancer), and sometimes in my dreams I ask him if he knows if he's dying? And he says yes and cries (this was one of many dreams I've had of him).

He feels excessive guilt for fairly normal things, especially weird porn he watched/read as a young teen (nothing illegal just cringey or strange and boys I was friends with at that age did most if it too). He confessed his guilt for trying to find images of naked girls aged 12-14 when he was 13. This was a once off as he never found anything on Google and quickly realised it was illegal. However, he feels guilty that somehow he checked something younger than this even though he does not remember this. He just feels so scared that he could've looked up younger, maybe even 5 years younger or something and forgotten it as he might have merely typed it in and not really tried or was so guilty he managed to block it from his memory

After he freaked out one evening, he told me the next day that he is 99% sure he never looked below 11, as he clearly only remembers 12-14 happening and he never noticed girls more than  year younger back then, so why would he? He still has that 1% and doesn't want to promise he didn't go below 11 as it's too scary because what if he suddenly realises he did one day? He has said before about various memories  ""I think X thing happened when I was 14"" before only to realise in a calmer state a few days later  ""no actually X never happened, I just panicked because it was possible i could have but I have no actual memory of it and realistically I would have"".",28May2020,1

256,"I’ve noticed my mental state really effects how well I can perform in all sorts of things. It’s really noticeable in some of my hobbies. 

I’ve never been able hold a consistent skill level at most things. Skateboarding for example. Some days I feel fine and everything clicks like it usually does but other days I can barely do tricks I have completely down. It’s like I can feel the feeling of being good at these tricks get blocked by something in my head. I don’t know how else to explain. 

It’s like if I were to go throw a baseball. The feeling of a good throw I once had is just blocked in my head. And my throw ends up coming off all wonky and uncomfortable. 

I’ve had a little success trying to focus myself and get over it when it happens but in general I can’t control it.

258,"I have had my self-worth tied to productivity and others' opinion of me for the longest time. I chose a career that often brings instant feedback from readers and colleagues, I thrive when I'm working myself to physical exhaustion and people are applauding my work. Recently, I am also noticing a craving for external validation about how I look. The more compliments I get, the more I want.

For a person with anxiety, this is proving to be a slippery slope. Sure, I thrive on the compliments, but soon enough my brain goes on overdrive thinking how I can keep it up. I must always outdo myself, I must always feel good about myself by meeting these arbitrary standards of productivity, by getting external validation. 

Tying self-worth with productivity is wrong, many have told me. Is it really? What should I be tying my self-worth to, then? What if I enjoy my productivity and creativity? Who am I, if I no longer base my worth on this?",28May2020,1

263,"I had my second of six Ketamine injection sessions yesterday for Suicidal Ideation &amp; treatment resistant depression, and I am feeling like something is working but I can't put my finger on it. I am also feeling more tired after this session than I was after the first one and I think I am actually experiencing a slight dip in mood that follows the second session that my doctors told me that would happen before the mood starts to improve throughout the rest of the 2 week treatment. There is a slight tiredness/soreness in the brain and the energy is rather low today but I am not feeling suicidal.

During the second session I began to realize just how far off track my dipression has led me and that it has been a long four years getting to consistent suicidal thoughts. I have been feeling like a passenger to the depression's destructive driving and I am starting to be able to see these things more clearly thanks to the dissociative effects of Ketamine.  I feel like I am able to observe my depressive thoughts and analyze them objectively more easily thanks to the treatment so far. Wrapping up my first week of injections tomorrow :)",28May2020,1

265,"Okay so, obvious warning if you're sensitive to reading stuff like this, as I'll be going into some detail at points. You know the drill.

TLDR: Got high, had flashbacks to my being a kid, remembered my dad touching me, not sure if that really happened or my mind just made that up, I don't really know.

Last preface; This is a question for me. I don't know if anything happened to me, and that's why I'm posting this. If you think, based on everything I say here, you have an answer, or any sort of feedback at all, please reply. Thanks :)

I lied - one more, I'm sorry - I'm first gonna tell the story that initially made these thoughts (probably with some extra context thrown in there), then I'm going to give some additional reasons why I think this may have happened, then I'll give some reasons why I think this may not have happened. Sorry about lying. 

Okay, so, this all started a while ago at my friend's house, with a few of my other friends and my girlfriend. None of them are important to this story besides my girlfriend. She's important. 

Anyways, we're all kind of stoners to varying degrees, and I'm the least stoner-like. I don't, and have never had any of my own weed, compared to them I'm pretty new, you know the drill.  

Now, this is also the story of my first bad trip. Essentially, I was freaking out. Now, without going into too much unnecessary detail, my girlfriend attempted to comfort me through my bad trip with cuddles, which was a good strategy to try all things considered. Sadly, which, to no fault of her own, made it worse for me. 

This is because when I was little, (like, 6-13), I never had a room of my own, and I always ended up sharing a room with my dad. And I always cuddled with him a lot, moreso when I was younger. The feeling of how she tried to comfort me reminded me of that, and I essentially had flashbacks to being a kid. I felt like a kid again. I started crying.

She tried harder to make me feel better, but I was far gone by now, and I started experiencing flashbacks of more detail. First I just remembered a feeling around an area you shouldn't remember feelings in when thinking back to your childhood. But it became more graphic as the night went on. 

I remembered a bunch of things. My dad making/letting my hump his leg, touching his di, him touching my di, more stuff along those lines. 

These thoughts freaked me out a lot, and I soon decided I should just go to sleep, which I did next to my gf. I fell asleep a few hours before anyone else.

I woke up in the middle of the night, and the things I remembered was all that was on my mind until I went back to bed, which was about an hour later after sitting on my phone.

Since then, I frequently get memories of being a kid when I was high, though they never involve my dad anymore. 

Now, for some reasons that I believe this may have actually happened.
1. I didn't go into too much detail, but the memories were pretty vivid, and the feelings associated with them were extreme. Whenever those thoughts came up that night, I cried. A lot. And leading up to this, I had almost stopped crying. I only did a couple times the whole year leading up to this.
2. Grain of salt, but, I have heard that marijuana is capable of digging up ""forgotten"" memories  
3. Grain of salt again, but, I was always kinda weird when I was a kid  By that I mean, I was fuckin retarded socially. I was really weird. I'm normal now, captain of a varsity team yada yada, but, god was I weird as a kid. If you look at pictures of me from then, which I won't be posting, but I look like a tard. Molestation can cause people to be messed up in the head. 
4. I've dealt with depression since early in my life, beginning all the way back in the 7th grade. This could be as a result of this? Grain of salt again.
5. When I told my girlfriend about this, she told me it made sense. I asked why, and she told me it was my subbiness. Grain of salt.
6. I reject those memories for the most part actually, but, that is actually relatively common in childhood victims from trusted people from what I've heard. 
7. My dad has a long (like, long long) drug abuse history. Heavy grain of salt. Not all drug abusers are predators, but.. yk. 


Now, some reasons why I believe this didn't happen. 
1. My girlfriend brought up to me that memories from traumatic events can be manifested incorrectly. Grain of salt but, apparently people who were not molested can remember being molested, because their brain messed up trying to recall an other trauma. I do have (diagnosed) trauma due to my dad's drug abuse, so it could have been this.
2. Barring the drug abuse, and hating my mom, my dad is a generally good person, and he doesn't really intend to harm anyone.
3. I remember the memories being vivid at the time, though now, a few months later, I have a hard time recalling them, especially sober. It's easier when I'm high, but even still, it's hard. 
4. I could very well be exaggerating how I was as a kid. I was a crybaby tho.
5. Being a sub doesn't mean you were molested.
6. My depression could have been caused by a laundry list of other things that I don't feel like getting into right now.
And finally.. 
7. My gut says this didn't happen.

266,"So im 23 years old, been struggling with noticable amount of shit in my head for no idea how many years anymore. During school it was like the stairs, every step leaded to escalation of the problems. Been through a few suicide attempts, none serious, none even close enough, common sense still tingling. Every single thing that went bad lead to another, much worse things to the point that i can see no return from. Life's hard alright, but i got a loving soon to be husband, family that cares and even a job in those troubling times. If i was absolutely alone i wouldn't try to fix anything and just off myself but there are people i have to keep going for.
The problem is that keeping going became rather displeasant, exhausting and hopeless expirience because i am unable to get help. There are but a plenty numbers i can call and start a therapy right away, simple right? Not really, because during my not-so-long lifetime ive lost all my trust for other humans. I see an enemy within almost anyone and a danger in anyone whom i dont know very well. The therapy wont work because it wont start because id rather find a cure for cancer than call anyone, Let alone opening to a stranger.
Ive been trying for many times to make that call and set things in stone but ive failed to do so again and kinda lost interest in fixing things.

267,"I have a family member that quit using meth in 2015, they heavily drank until mid 2015 when they were sent to prison. They were released in 2017 and seemed to be doing excellent. Around November 2019 severe paranoia started to come up. Suspicions of cars (fbi) following them, thinking the FBI is in a house across the street, refusing to disclose any personal information as they may be recorded. Bought a thing that picks up gps waves to check their car, etc. Oh and anger. EVERYTHING sets them off. 

100% sure no additional meth use(drug testing) although they've admitted to drinking a handful of times and smoke weed from waking until bed. 

No family history of schizophrenia. Their meth use was severe for about 3 years, prior to that it was only an occasional thing and exposed as children to meth, cocaine, alcohol and severe abuse and domestic violence. 

Diagnosed as a child (80s) as emotionally and behaviorally disturbed. Treated for ADHD, but the medication caused liver damage and mom refused to treat with any additional medications 

Refuses to seek mental health help because ""how would you feel if you knew something was going on, but no one believed you."" When asked to point it out when it's happening ""no, I can't put that on you."" Especially refusing right now because everything is telehealth and that's also a conspiracy to ""get me""

269,"I’m 14 btw. For some reason I like being told what to do and have never done anything bad like smoking which is what my friends do, a lot. If my mother asked me to do something I would do it without any questions like getting something out of the car or turning on the hot water. It’s sounds innocent but looking back on it now a part of me worries because one time I was talking very loudly at dinner with the family and my sister told me to SHUT UP! so I stopped talking. My mother was the one who shouted at her for being mean and at that point I just left the room. I guess the reason for this is because I’m not the type of person who gets into fights and try to avoid trouble mainly because I’m afraid I will lose. The reason for this is because a few years before when I was about 11 or 12 I got into an argument with some girl I accidentally hit in the face while running and her nose was bleeding. I thought I ended the argument by saying I was sorry but turns out the next morning her mother came to my school and shouted at me in front of everyone (My parents had already dropped me off at school and left so I was alone). I just stood there embarrassed and upset wanting her to leave. She left 2 minutes later and I just wanted to cry but couldn’t. Now that I’m in secondary school (high school) students are treated as adults. When a teacher shouts at me I feel like I can’t do anything other then wait until they are done and write a note in my journal for unfinished homework. When I tell my parents they tell me to never argue with a teacher and just learn from my mistakes. That’s exactly what I do. I once told my mother not to long ago that I wanted to be an “assistant” to a manager when I was over 18 to work. She was a little surprised that I wanted to be a person who ranks below a senior person and tried to convince me to be something better but eventually she understood why. 
When my friends ask me why I don’t go out at night to parties or haven’t had my first kiss yet is because I’m too young for such extreme things and must wait until I’m older. However the only thing I worry about is the person I will turn out to be WHEN I’m older.",28May2020,1

When having at least some friendships or romantic relationships are so common it is very hard to ignore it because almost everyone mentions about it and it instantly triggers me.

271,"I have an upcoming appointment with a psychiatrist for the first time in a long time. In the past when I've gone to therapy, it was mainly focused on my anxiety, since it was the biggest hindrance in my life. When I brought up other problems, they weren't given as much attention since anxiety was what controlled my life. However, I've always considered that I may have BPD, but I never brought it up because I didn't know if it was appropriate to.

So is it okay to suggest a disorder you think you may have to a psychiatrist? I don't want to self-diagnose; I want to bring up the possibility that I may have BPD, give my reasonings, and let the psychiatrist decide.

Or, should I just tell them all my symptoms without bringing BPD up at all and let them go from there?

272,"Hey all,

I don’t know where to really start so I will just start spewing out some stuff.

All of this is not really related to the whole pandemic.

It all started with a some rough areas in my relationship with my (25M) girlfriend ((24F). It was rocking and she was pressuring me with a lot of things while we lived together. 

Next, over the past several years my alcoholic father slowly drank himself to death. He eventually seeked rehab and quit his job. A month later, he was admitted into hospice for liver failure. All while he said he was sober, but never stopped drinking. I took time off of work and went up to my parents to help my mom out with my dad because we were doing in home hospice. I helped my dad out till the morning he died. The last few days of my dad were extremely disturbing watching him slowly pass, was seemed like an agonizing death of total organ failure. 

So that is why I feel like I’m pretty jacked up at the moment.

My question is, work has been difficult getting things done and paying attention. The hospice company said they can offer assistance with bereavement, etc. Should i go through hospice or my insurance company. I have always struggled with depression and anxiety, and I am just curious if I should get prescriptions to help myself through this. I really don’t know where to begin.",28May2020,1

280,"I first became depressed when I was 9, suicidal at 10, and was quickly put onto an SSRI. That, along with psychotherapy was helpful for a few years until it wasn't. I had reached the max dose of my SSRI and it was still lacking efficacy and so I changed it. Looking back, I have no idea how it wasn't changed earlier considering I had three suicide attempts while on the highest dose, it clearly wasn't working. So then I was put onto another SSRI (it is beyond me why they didn't try another class like an SNRI) and I had some noticeable sexual side effects so I switched again to an SNRI. I've finally hit the max dose for that but I still have nearly daily suicidal thoughts and ideations. I'm 17 now, the therapists are still insistent that psychotherapy is the way to go even though I think it's clearly failed. DBT, CBT, I've had dealt with specialists in both, and it hasn't helped.

282,"havent really thought about why I cant feel a connection with people, I guess I'll just brainstorm here

○Part of me feels there is no point, if your not dating with the intention of staying with that person, then you are simply waiting for heart break, I thought I was strong enough to bounce back quickly, and in a way I have, I'm a lot closer with my friends. I'm a lot happier now than I've ever been before, I think a big thing is that I have become really apathetic to a lot of stuff, I try not to think about things that hurt and it's been working well, but obviously not well enough otherwise I wouldnt be writing this. ignoring these feelings and occupying my self with something else is a coping mechanism which is useful in small doses, but lately it's the only thing I do.

○ when my parents got divorced and everyone carried on like it was nothing, I couldnt understand. Yes, people fall out of love and that's okay. If I could go back and change it, I wouldnt, both of my parents are better off this way. The way it happened never concerned me, I never understood how someone could have or try to have a thing on the side, it was just something that happened, I never really understood how badly my mother was betrayed until I recently started thinking about it, her best friend began having an affair with my father, the children in that family were my best friends, they still are. I saw them as brothers before it happened and I see them that way much more now. My mother lost 2 people, her best friend and her husband. I cant understand why two people that had known eachother for such a long time couldnt simply grow a pair and say ""this is what's up, this is what I want to happen, heres how we carry on from here"" I think that when this had all gone down, I had already created a negative opinion on relationships.

○ when I came into my first real relationship, it was during a time when I was extremely vulnerable. I wont blame it on that solely, I have a personality that tends to agree before disagreeing, and it's not healthy. However, when a person came into my life during this time, I did the worst thing I could have, I made them my life raft. This happened when I was young, which is probably even worse as it's become a foundation for me. Placing all my trust into one person left me wide open to be used. whilst on one side I felt amazing, I had this person whom I could confide in and they would offer me solace, they knew when to be just affectionate enough that I thought I was getting the best deal.On the other, i tried very hard to care for them, seeing my parents as a bad example of what to do drive me so strongly to try and do the right thing, but people arent perfect, I wasnt always good. But if I look at myself from an outside perspective, I wasnt a bad person. I think that when I realized what was happening in my own relationship, I panicked, I knew the ship was sinking and i thought the right thing to do was to stick with it till it hit the ocean floor, and I did let it sink, and I stayed even though it was hurting me. To be completely honest, before that relationship I didnt believe a guy could be abused emotionally, my opinion on that has changed a lot since then. I became a punching bag, It is completely right and justified for another person to rant to another about emotions and blah blah blah, I never picked up on when the rants stopped being about emotional problems and become an opportunity to use me as an outlet for a lot of anger and just a need to fight, and this devastated me, I was trying my hardest to be good and I like to pride myself in being honest when I say that I was a decent person. My agreeableness became a point upon which they could capitalize, and they saw this long story short, they did, I got very hurt, used, manipulated and gas lighted to believe I was the one causing problems. 

That part is taking to long to write now so next point I guess

○ when they became unfaithful, it cracked me in two whilst I was striving with every single bit of me to avoid something similar to my parents relationship, there wasnt anything I could do, this person knew the way I felt about it, yet they seemed to revel in it, for the first week after I broke up with this person they seemed to love it, it seemed like regardless of the fact that they were unloyal to me, they would still be better off than me. They came back and asked for forgiveness and this was within the span of around 3 or 4 or maybe 5 weeks after it happened, I became a very angry person, I never wanted to cut any person out of my life. But I did, I dont regret it, reflecting back on it, it's one of the things I'm most proud of my younger self for doing. Its best thing I did in terms of standing up for myself. That sounds silly but this person was my only friend, I willingly gave up my friend so that I could better my self as a person, pretty tough decision.

○ I consoled in my friends and realized they were more than just party buddy's and people I sat with at school, they were there for me more than anything. It is one of the most significant things I came to terms with, they wanted to help. Things started looking up from here, I was genuinely happy, I still am happy, happier than I have been. But the truth is, it's not enough for me, I want more, i want that kind of connection with people. Whilst in the pursuit of this, I began leaning towards being a bit of a dick, maybe it was a deeper resentment or who knows, I lead people on a lot, not trying to justify it or anything but I do believe it was a form of compensation for what I was feeling. to this day I dont understand why I became like that, really dont like it at all. 

○ I've moved on past that phase in my life, I think I left something behind though, my ability to feel emotional attraction is gone. Theres a person and all i want is to care about them, I do care about them, i dont know how to show it anymore though. A lot of the ways I thought were a good way to show you care, got insulted and put down. So now I'm just not sure exactly what they would want me to do. If I knew I'd do it in a heart beat. It ties back to the thing about dating though, is there a point? Am I really going to be with this person for a significant enough amount of time as to where I'm happy with when it ends?

283,"Hello reddit community,

I thought maybe I could get some of your advice/opinion on my situation, because I’ve been reading a lot of wise words of some people.

So basically this lockdown/social distancing has been a real rollercoaster for me (majority of us, let’s be honest) and brought out a lot of dark topics I have been suppressing for a long time (fun times, I know).
 
I have always enjoyed my own company and for some reason always had a feeling to put other people and their needs first. Which has brought me to the stage where I tend not to interact with people too much, because usually I end up concentrating and pleasing them (which sometimes can be tiring). On top of that I have a low self esteem, I think I’m not good enough/my chat is shit/I’m boring (my ex partner used to say that a lot to me, which really got stuck in me). 
I do have friends, but I feel like I can be a burden to them if I start talking about myself and tend to keep myself busy to distract from these thoughts.

Now during this lockdown I felt some sort of relief that okay, we are all in the same boat, not being able to see people. But people keep talking about their zoom parties and surprise surprise - I can’t relate to that.

So now I’ve been debating what kind of person I am. An introvert? An extrovert?
Feeling bad for the way I am? Feeling embarrassed and worthless because I don’t have the same social life other people have?

Do I need to change and put myself out there or do I accept the way I am? Also how would you suggest doing that, because I feel like a total friendless weirdo. where a part of me wants to stay in my comfort bubble being on my own and the other part wants to be normal (social media/pub drinks every night standards). But I don’t have that friends group to do it with, so I tend to be on my own and then I feel bad... and it’s basically a never ending circle. 

I hope this makes some sort of sense, because my head sometimes feels like a bucket of words/feeling and it’s hard to put everything in right places. 
And I hope there would be some nice people who would take their time to read my crap and help me a little.

Thank you!",28May2020,1

290,"This is probably a long time coming.

I'm only twenty. I have a reliable job, half-decent wages, colleagues who live with me, and a girlfriend. 

That is, until I cheated on her. Three months into a relationship with another woman at work. We sexted, talked about fooling around, both aware I asked my girlfriend to be my girlfriend.

Then we cut it off. And I hid it.

I lied for a year, pushing the thoughts I had out of my mind and loving my girlfriend wholeheartedly. She's amazing. She's beautiful, funny, intelligent, determined, and caring. And I betrayed that for some good feelings for myself. She found out about it early last year, by going through my phone, and every started falling apart. We both cried it out, I myself feeling selfish-hatred at myself. 

Fast forward half a year and here we are. It was rocky. We tried to make it work, to push past it, but so many memories were ruined, knowing I was texting someone behind her back lewd things. Our first year, a write off of lies. We got better, eventually, even looking at houses.

But just before lockdown hit, things tumbled again. I've seen her once in about three months, due to lockdown. We argue near every night. I always repeat mistakes I said I would fix, being snappy and rude when I don't mean to be, zoning out and ignoring her.

And my life outside the relationship is tumbling too. I sleep fitfully, waking up on little sleep with a stinging in my eyes, pasting a smile on at work and insisting everything is fine. My colleagues trying to get me involved in drinking during the week in their gatherings, which I refuse because I want to play some games and talk with the SO and friends, which then leads them to tease me, and my SO eventually get upset at me and mad because of how I acted when we do play and I get frustrated.

It culminates to not wanting to wake up each day. To know the girl I love is thinking about my betrayal day in day out. How I haven't left my place of living/work in two months apart from a run, which I do to near-fainting just to feel something. I pretend this are dandy at work, then cry for hours in my bed alone. It's even worse on weekends, when people are able to go see there loved ones, and I'm deprived of human interaction for a couple days again. Eating alone, stuck with self-depreciating thoughts, and that whisper in the back of my mind. Should I just end it?

Who would miss me? My girlfriend, but she'd move past me eventually. She could always do much better than me.
Family? My grandad would be heartbroken, but I couldn't burden him with my problems. My parents think I'm a better person than I am, I try to keep my personal life experiences away from them. My brother? We're close. But not close enough to talk often.
Work? It drags me down. Feels worthless some days, thankless, even though I'm constantly told it's essential. Those above us looking down, treating us like we're servants for their every whim. Not people who know how to do our job effectively. I'd be another statistic.
Friends? I have maybe a couple to miss me. And I haven't seen them in near a year.

At the end of the day, when I'm numb in bed or crying, I just know that I'm not contributing anything to this world. I wouldn't be missed if I ended it. If anything, I'd be giving chances to help make other lives better. At least that's what I tell myself.

Then again, being cowardly enough to his truths from family and love life, I'll probably be too cowardly to end my existence. I'd just mechanically go about life until some accident happens.

293,"I'm sorry,but I can't tell you what habit i have and what association i have.

But i will try to describe it.

**Description of the problem.**

My **hobby** is relaxing one,at least it is used to be like this.

**Association** that ruined my relax method is kinda sexual/traumatic type.This association came from obsessional thought.I logically proved to myself that it's irrational obsession and i do understand how stupid it is,but even after i won it rationally,i can't get rid of emotional association it leaved.

**What i already tried to do.**

1.I tried talking to psychotherapist in my city,but it didn't really help...She gave my recipe for medicine for some tablets,but they only makes me want so sleep and it doesn't really help.

2.I tried burying myself in work,but it's helping until you done your work.After you finish,it comes back.

**What already helped,but..**

I tried getting new good association above old bad one + changed my apartment and it *WORKED!*

*But not really*..I still had obsessional thought,but it just was bothering me rather less and i was able to relax normally and live happy.But my god damn greed...It wasn't enough for me and i decided to destroy this obsession once and forever. I was stupid enough to repeat this **thing/action** that originally created my obsessional thought in order to change bad association to good one,like i already did with hobby,but now with traumatic thing/action.

And this ruined it all and i'm now in the same point where i started. It just refreshed my obsession and bad associations.

**How i feel.**

I started noticing that this obsessional thought is like cancer. It started with my favourited hobby and now it spread to almost all things.I can't even watch some damn puppy videos on instagram without having some bad association.I can't relax,i became emotionless.I can only work or study.If i'm too tired,i just sit and do literally nothing for 5/10 minutes.

It has been 2 months since the problem appeared and i still can't do anything about it.

I know i can't get an accurate advice until i describe it all or in another case i'm going to get only general advice,but i'm ok with general one.",28May2020,1
294,"There's one thing that I feel is so important for everyone to know and for everyone to tell their partners/friends/family/etc. And its something my ex husband did with me.

When it came to me having episodes or panic/anxiety attacks, he would simply ask me ""Close or far?"". Sometimes it's hard to articulate what you want or need in a moment like that. You don't know what you want and then if the other person starts frantically listing off ""helpful"" suggestions you may feel overwhelmed and pressured- Adding to your emotional state. On the other side of things, maybe the person trying to help is becoming frustrated because they're concerned and it's becoming chaotic and they feel helpless, etc.  

So being able to narrow it down to ONE WORD as a starting point is so so important. 

Do I need them *close* to me? Physical affection and reassurance and weighted blankets and attention? 

Or do I need them *far*? Having them sit on the other side of the couch or have physical distance in the room but still be in my presence in case there's a change (and to avoid potential abandonment panic).

It's also helpful because the person in the emotional state has actually established at least one small portion of rationality and control by answering either close or far. Then you both can slowly start to progress through it in whatever way you can. 

It's been the most life saving little trick I've ever experienced and I encourage people to let others know about the ""Close or far"" question when it comes to anxiety/panic attacks.",28May2020,1

296,"Hello, folks. Pardon the throwaway account-- I don't use Reddit other than to browse, so I've never really needed one before.

I really have to get this out and talk about it. Until I can talk to a doctor about it, this is my only outlet.

So, I've recently come to terms with the fact that maybe I should be worried about this situation and deal with it before it one day compounds into something serious. I'm 22 and a lady, if that's relevant at all. I have struggled with depression since I was a kid, and struggle with a fairly bad memory issue that I still have yet to see a doctor about (no insurance-- gotta love the US!). I've also been dealing with this... situation, probably since I was a teenager. And by dealing with, I just mean ignoring and never talking to anyone about it. It's just kind of been my constant secret that I live with.

Now to get into the actual situation at hand.

I've been experiencing near-constant delusions since I was a teenager. I use the word 'delusions' because I guess that's what they are-- things that are not true that I still believe. Every single one involves me being observed by someone, constantly watched. I don't think they're going to harm me, in fact I know they have zero intention of harm! Just observing. For what, I have no clue. It's like the Truman Show, they're just observing me for entertainment or to see what I'm like.

The biggest problem is that they're all people who know me personally... my family, friends, even people I know on the internet when I don't know what they look like. They usually rotate between various people, usually people who are currently involved in my life more. They're never people I am staying with or living with. I don't have to know what they look like, I just know that they're watching. In my mind's eye, or what I know to be ""true"", I know they're in a room somewhere far away, looking through some kind of porthole or circular window. They can see any which way they want, and whatever they are peering through cannot be seen by me. Whether this is achieved by technology or magic, I have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem... I am very self-conscious. I care what people think about me, I like to be seen in certain ways. But there's things I'd like to do when I think no one is watching! Unfortunately, I never get that privacy. Ever. Because I ""know"" I'm being constantly watched, it's very hard for me to pursue any guilty pleasures. Songs I like to listen to, shows I'd like to watch... I can't, I don't want other people to know I watch them. I'm an artist, and it's hard to draw some things because they're silly or embarrassing. Sometimes I'll sit in the same place for hours because I don't want to stand up, because I know I'll need to straighten my pants or something and I don't want people to see that.

There's also other privacy issues. Taking a shower is an entire ordeal. I have to get naked so I can shower, but I don't want to get naked because my friends and family are watching. Using the bathroom is another ordeal. Sometimes I avoid it until I really have to, but I know that can be really bad and lead to UTIs and stuff. So over the years when it comes to these kinds things, I just kind of grin and bear it, rip off the bandaid. They're watching me and they'll watch me regardless, so I need to do what I have to do.

If I do something embarrassing and no one is physically looking, it still feels as if someone was. I'll comment on it, saying things out loud to ensure that the people watching know my tripping over the carpet was an accident, or that I was stupid for not being able to find something that was right in front of me (just two examples, I'm sure there's tons more).

There is One way that they cant see me, and that is if my entire body is completely covered by a blanket that isn't see-through. There has to be no gaps, so I will tuck a blanket all the way around me if I want some privacy. Doing things doesn't help stop them or reduce them, unless I am physically with and interacting with someone.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do about all this. And I KNOW they're delusions, I know it's not real.... and yet, I haven't been able to dismiss them!! It's impossible to ignore them. I tell myself ""no one is watching you"", but that is overridden by the fear that someone will watch me do whatever I'm doing! It's humiliating, and despite having this ""company"", I feel so isolated and alone because of it. It doesn't get in the way of my life in terms of going to work and paying my bills, but it does affect my personal life, the way I do things, and what I do. It's so weird. And I've just been letting it happen.

I have no idea what to do about it. I mean, other than going to see someone about it. And my greatest fear about that is that they won't believe me or won't think it's bad because I can recognize that they aren't real. Everyone I've read about having delusions never seems to doubt theirs, so what is this? I am a little worried that if I don't seek help soon, I really will fall into a delusion that I won't be able to recognize is fake. So I'm going to see someone as soon as I have the insurance to be able to.

Anyway, thanks for reading. If anyone has any advice, I am happy to listen. This is the first time I've talked about all this, and there might be some details I've accidentally left out. Thanks.",28May2020,1

299,"Throughout nearly all of my adolescence I struggled with my mental health. By age 13 I was diagnosed with severe depression, and was put on antidepressants. Although at first the medication worked and seemed to help stabilize my mood, the effectiveness of it quickly wore off. At age 14
I began to drink and smoke heavily. By age 16 I had attempted suicide multiple times, and at age 17 I ended up in ICU after overdosing. 
I still struggle with my mental health today, but to a much lesser extent. I no longer am on antidepressants and am able to go more than a day without breaking down and feeling hopeless.
What changed? I did. Having my family and friends visit me in the hospital helped push me in the right direction. It allowed me to realize that there are in fact people that care for me, that I do have a future worth living for, and that life is worth it. 
Repairing yourself mentally is a challenge. It doesn’t go away in a day, a month, and maybe not even in a year. It took many years of trying to get myself back on track in order to get to the place where I’m at today. 
Struggling with your mental health is one of the hardest battles you could face. It’s not easy in the slightest. But it’s worth it. 

Here’s some of the things I’ve done to help improve and manage my mental health:

* Talk to someone! It helps.... really! Bottling up your emotions is only effective for so long, and at some point you’re bound to break. You don’t have to go through anything alone, and there is always (ALWAYS!) someone out there who is willing to help.
* Cut out the people who make you feel worse. I had a small group of friends, and though I enjoyed being with them, I finally came to the realization that these people weren’t for me. Anyone who is constantly competing with you, puts you down, forgets about you, etc.... isn’t worth your time. Replace those people with ones who make you feel uplifted. 
* Start up a new hobby! I realized that a lot of my lower points or breakdowns occurred when I was bored and had nothing to do. So I started gardening! I have absolutely no gardening skills whatsoever, and my plants are probably suffering more than they’re thriving, but knowing I have to take care of them has helped me get out of bed each morning. It makes me feel productive, and waking up to check on my plants excites me.
* Stop blaming yourself. It’s not your fault you’re going through all that’s happening. You’re not to blame. You’re not a bad person, and you don’t deserve to feel the way you do. I always found ways to blame myself for my depression (ie, “I’m a bad person, I hurt everyone who I love, so I deserve to hurt too.”). Once I stopped reaching for these conclusions, I was able to turn my attention towards the true source of the problem, which was not myself. You aren’t the cause of your mental state.
* Become an active participant in your treatment! The harsh reality is that mental illness will never go away on its own. You have to fight each and everyday to overcome it. Luckily there are so many ways to do just that. I started by addressing my concerns with my doctor, and eventually went onto therapy as well. JUST TAKING A PILL EVERYDAY WILL NOT SOLVE ANYTHING! 

Nobody deserves to struggle, and nobody deserves to feel as though they aren’t worth it. Each and everyone of you are strong. Much stronger than you think. Fight for the life you deserve and never give up. It may take time, but it’s worth it. Hope is never lost.",28May2020,1

I have recently gone off my antidepressant, 10mg lexapro, and 15mg buspirone (under medical supervision) without tapering. I am still taking 200mg topomax a day It has been about nine days. This has led to uncomfortable feelings and a slight relapse of my drug use. I have been taking about 1-3mg of Xanax almost each day over the past week and drinking occasionally (about 5 drinks max every 3 days or so). For the first time in my life, I have noticed suicidal ideation creeping in. However, it was only for a moment and I have no inclination of acting on it.

 My father is diagnosed bipolar and my psychiatrist is aware of this. Over the past few months I spiraled pretty deep into alcohol and drug abuse, and was just finally recovering, after going to the ER 3 times, which my psychiatrist was also aware of.

I have an appointment with him coming up in about a week, and I am worried about how much to reveal. He has already brought up the suggestion of attending outpatient rehab, and the last thing I want is to say something that will get me involuntarily sent to a rehab facility. I am an adult college student and the last thing I want is to be institutionalized during the middle of this pandemic.

309,"One of the only things I remember when I was in grade 3 was in my mothers car thinking why would it be so bad if I died? I wasn’t thinking of killing myself but I just didn’t see what the big issue was since we all die. I was raised in a very well off family that happens to be catholic and went to a competitive private school. Everywhere I went I was expected to always carry myself in a dignified manner. It was only in grade 7 that I had a mental breakdown on a lot presentation and decided to take the whole thing as a joke adding unnecessary amounts of expression and overall having a great time. Somehow I got a really good mark on that presentation and that was the beginning of me becoming the popular kid. The classes were small and I ended up being a role model of sorts.  People started to tell me things that they shouldn’t like secrets about them or told me if I ever needed things to go to them because their parents work at x y and z and they could get it to me for free. Since the grade was less then 20 students the class felt like a family and we all ended up having a lot of fun.  After grade 9 at that school I Moved somewhere else (because of parents) and had to chance school. I ended up going to the best public academic school that was available and things started going downhill. I arrived 1 hour early to find all of my classes, found all of them but my first period class, ended up asking a very nice grade 12 to escort me there. She didn’t know where it was either. It turned out it was under the main stairs, and I arrived there 5 minutes late. In that English class we had a field trip in the next month that you had to pay like $20, payed it the next day. After a month the teacher called me out individually saying I didn’t pay it even though I did and even the people that saw me give it to her didn’t really care about me or something. Asked my mom about it, and she definitely got it since the money was taken from her bank. We decided not to make a big deal of it and give her another $20. She really didn’t like me since she always gave me a low mark on the presentation part of presentations as well ( I was ranked 2nd in a debate against schools in my private school)  and then took 30% off of my essay for not having a title and date, which it obviously had. Brought it up to her she said I don’t have time for you, raise my mark 1% then basically told me to fuck off. Asked a few people if I should bring this to the principle, they said yeah. Turns out word got around and she pulled me outside of class told me I got 100% on the culminating and basically bribing me, but didn’t say bribing. People that she liked got and didn’t deserve it got 90%+ and people she hated got 60s-70s. I’ve managed to get around 80s. This was only the first class of the first semester. There were some really good teachers but they were dwarfed by others like the one I got. This lasted 3 years. On my last year 5 of the 7 teachers were like her. The school was corrupt, this years English teacher decided to give a student 100 on 2 of their essays as well as exams, she gave us 3 days to do things and gave her and a few others extensions that lasted weeks. The class average was 68, which is abysmal in grade 12. It was disgusting. The class of over the student limit at the beginning with 35 students, after the first week it became 21 since everybody, including me tried to switch classes. This is due to her saying that a 70 is a very hard mark to get in English and that you should be proud to get that mark on the first day. She was reviewed since so many people left but nothing happened. The other English teachers gave their  students the exam (the exams stayed in the class afterwards )and told them what points to write and even wrote example paragraphs for them. Like wtf. We couldn’t even base our exam of off theirs since it was our teacher that wrote ours. Our teacher even said that she would inflate our marks during culminating and exams, to which she decreased the class average by 2%. This all bring me to where I am now, I have fought tooth and nail to get where I am now while nearly everyone had things delivered to them on a silver platter. Didn’t go to the uni that I wanted which was considered top 20 in the world but I’ve manage to get my second choice that was a double degree in a good uni. Sorry for the rant. But now after all this I just don’t care. When I was younger I cared about others more than myself to the point that I didn’t care what happened to me. Something terrible could happen to me and I would freak out but after a minute I just wouldn’t care or I just wouldn’t freak out in the first place. Now I just don’t care about anything, I randomly fall asleep at different parts of the day, and I don’t want to do anything. I’m sad but I don’t think I’m depressed. I can’t open up to my parents and the friends that I had while we still talk we don’t have the same bond anymore. Sorry for making this so long.",28May2020,1
