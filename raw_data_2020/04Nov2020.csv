I recently kicked my habit of biting my nails for the first time where it actually seems I've done it successfully.. the only issue is now I find myself dissociating more frequently or having the urge to do something anything, like smoke even though I'm not a smoker... and during these phases I sweat and my heart rate spikes and my temperature rises... is this something anyone else has experienced or am I just strange? also any ideas of any habits I can pick up that won't damage my health like smoking would!",04Nov2020,1

2,"I have reoccurring intrusive thoughts that people are out to ruin my life. it could be an old friend, a teacher who doesn‚Äôt like me, a coworker from over a year ago, etc. it makes maintaining relationships so difficult. 

i‚Äôve been wanting to unfriend some toxic people on social media for a while and i used this election as an excuse. i basically pretended their politics (more right than i) offended me and i unadded them over that. 

i‚Äôm so paranoid they‚Äôre going to try to kill me or blackmail me or something. i know this isn‚Äôt schizophrenia or something bc i know it‚Äôs crazy but idk what it is. please help me. i can‚Äôt eat. cant sleep. cant even get off my phone waiting to see if they message me to threaten me. help me. idk what to do.",04Nov2020,1

I feel like I possibly have high functioning depression because i‚Äôve been feeling like this for 2 1/2 years now, but I definitely feel like I can‚Äôt do it for another 2.5. I am also concerned about the amount of time it will take to make progress in therapy. 

I know that people say that making true change takes time but I feel like I don‚Äôt have that time anymore.

Is this that bad of an idea. What if i‚Äôm not depressed enough for meds but I end up getting put on them anyways, could it mess me up? 

People say that therapy takes time, but I feel like I don‚Äôt have time. I feel like if I don‚Äôt get better soon then it will start to have some major impacts in my life. I don‚Äôt want to come off to my therapist, who I just met today, or possibly a psychiatrist if I end up seeing one that i‚Äôm just drug seeking but that‚Äôs low key kinda what i‚Äôm trying to do.",04Nov2020,1

8,"okay so i‚Äôm 16 and this has been happening for as long as i can remember. if i‚Äôd give an estimate, since i was 7.

whenever it‚Äôs night and i‚Äôm on my bed trying to fall asleep, i sometimes get this anxious feeling and almost day dreaming about like a huge difference in size, i don‚Äôt know exactly how to explain it but like some scenario where i‚Äôm extremely small compared to something else, it always involves a huge boulder, for example a huge ball of stone just crashing into a flat grass field when i‚Äôm standing on it, bouncing around.

it doesn‚Äôt even have to be big as in size, it can be big as in time frame, for example i remember one time after the boulder landing on the ground without bouncing just watching people slowly dig away at this massive rock.

this always makes me feel depressed and sad and hopeless and anxious.

this whole thing probably sounds really dumb but the only time i‚Äôve ever mentioned it was to my mom several years ago but she didn‚Äôt think of it much and neither do i.

this is not a regular occurance, when i was 7-12 it happened maybe 1-5 times a year.

it‚Äôs 1 am and it just happened to me for the first time in 4 years

as i‚Äôve been typing this i‚Äôve had major goosebumps and this weird uneasy feeling, i don‚Äôt get the goosebumps in the dream things

this is all over the place but during the things im just really distressed, as if it‚Äôs a nightmare, im very uneasy, anxious and sad. this usually happens from when im resting (not asleep) until i wake up.

it doesn‚Äôt bother me much but i‚Äôm just curious on wtf it is, as far as i know there‚Äôs no one else i know that has this.


also there was one time where i wasn‚Äôt even the small thing, i didn‚Äôt even exist, it was just a still picture of the massive boulder again just hanging to an overhang of a cliff with just one piece of tape and for some reason i can‚Äôt get that picture out of my head, i can‚Äôt get any of the dreams out of my head, it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre stuck on my mind all the time i just have never forgotten the dreams.",04Nov2020,1

I‚Äôm afraid of negative conversations because my mind set is very sensitive towards anything negative. Just someone talking about death or sadness makes my mind spiral down a dark hole.

10,"Yeah.. It's two am in here and I'm wide awake trying to figure out ways to get contact with anybody that could give me medical advice and renew my med prescriptions.

Not excited to go to work in my loud and social workplace. It feels like heaven to get home everyday to silence.

11,"Heyo! I‚Äôve been wanting to make an app for a while, and I‚Äôve also struggled with mental health for a while, and it hit me. My goal is to try and make a mental health app that has different mental health disorders that each have their own way of helping. I can‚Äôt exactly put it into words, but an example would be for someone with depression, they would go into the app, click on the depression section, and then be able to pick from a selection of things that could help them. I have a few issues with this plan, though I think I could work it out, which is why I‚Äôm here. I don‚Äôt know which mental health disorders to include in the app and what I could put in the sections. Obviously everyone is different, but some general things that could help would be good.

12,"I'm 14 years old and for the past few years I've been struggling with my Mother's constant deteriorating mental state. I remember when i was a child, she was happy and enjoyed life. Nowadays she tends to be distant and cold, only focusing on her own issues. She constantly accuses my father, whom i have lived with since November of last year, of many things. This could be cheating, poisoning her, trying to poison me and my brother, or our animals.   


I remember this conversation i had with her a year ago about how she had someone or something telling her something, about how she was special, and how i wouldn't understand it. This confused me back then, but now i can understand what was happening. I feel as if she struggles with psychosis and paranoia, among other things. This manifests itself in auditory hallucinations, as i just mentioned, the feeling that strong events can have a huge meaning, such as little things that my dad might've said to her, as one of our animals had gotten hold of a rat somehow, and she misinterpreted that as him calling her a dead rat.   


Here i am, in the middle of this. I spent a week straight last night listening to this, all of it, from my room. I wholly understand that it is not my mothers fault that she struggles with these conditions, she has a long history of stress and abuse, which i personally believe is the cause of this. About yesterday, when things came to a head, one thing lead to another, and my mom was removed from our house for 3 days.  


Yesterday, in an angry rage, i assume having some sort of episode while we were out in the town over  trying to get help for her, she throws some of my dad's stuff out the window, puts his clothes in a basket where she dumps vinegar into it, and puts some sort of powder into the engine of his work vehicle, that isn't even his. I feel that she thinks she's completely justified in this, as she feels that she was in danger just staying with him.   
 My biggest fear is that she wont get the help that she direly needs, and instead comes back worse than before. The fact that i feel little emotion while writing this means I'm very desensitized to this sort of thing, having to deal with it for years. I hope to seek advice and sympathy for my situation. Any questions will be answered.  


TLDR: My parents argue, i feel as if my mother struggles with some sort of disorder that distorts her perception of reality. Recently, she had an angry rage, destroyed stuff, and she is now in some sort of facility.",04Nov2020,1

14,"I never wanted to be reliant on any substance nor on medication. The idea of being on meds for the rest of my life really upsets me, but more so because they still haven‚Äôt been stabilized and I HATE the effect these changes have had on my body and mind. 


I was first placed on lexapro and klonapin after depakote knocked me on my ass. I stayed on this up until the midpoint of this year, where I was placed on lithium, seroquel and half a tablet of the lexapro. I actually felt pretty decent with this medication combo. Unfortunately my lithium levels read low, and my thyroid level high. They moved me to trileptal and increased my seroquel. I thought the depakote was rough. I couldn‚Äôt feel awake until 6-7pm each day. I was beyond depressed but now, I feel like I‚Äôm right back to my mixed episodes. They just lowered my trileptal and seroquel while increasing my lexapro - well I feel more suicidal so that means they‚Äôll probably  change it again.

15,"So, I have this really silly mental health trigger. 

I get extraordinarily anxious/stressed when I can‚Äôt find something that I just *KNOW is here SOMEWHERE*

Everyone gets a bit stressed when they can‚Äôt find their keys and they need to go somewhere, but this is on another level. 

I‚Äôll try to explain it. 

Say you‚Äôre looking for scissors to open a package. And you can‚Äôt find your scissors. This would be a mild inconvenience for most people, and they would just find a knife. 

For me, I will heavily fixate on the scissors. Even if a knife will do. I could even use a knife to open the package and then immediately go back to my frantic search for the scissors. And I will get more and more stressed, to a completely unreasonable degree, until I find the scissors. I will start to cold sweat and hyperventilate and pace and compulsively run my hands through my hair or wring my hands or scratch my head or other compulsive behaviour. I will do illogical things like check and re-check the same cupboard or drawer over and over and over, even though I logically KNOW I‚Äôve checked and the item is not in that place. 

In this specific instance, I spent 20 minutes looking for this stupid pot of hot chocolate because ‚ÄúTHINGS DONT JUST DISAPPEAR‚Äù 

And my constant pacing, opening and closing of cupboards and hyperventilating eventually woke my friend (who is currently crashing on my sofa for a few weeks). She told me that she had used the last of it and that‚Äôs why it was gone. She apologised profusely for this and I said it was fine and had to explain my insanity. Very embarrassing and she must think I‚Äôm crazy now and feels an unwarranted amount of guilt over a pot of bloody hot chocolate! 

This is all a very long winded way of asking, is there a name for this? Does anyone else experience this? Are there any strategies that help?

I study in one of my countries best colleges (top 3) and I've taken this semester off cause I couldn't bare moving on without trying to learn and then ruining my GPA. 
I tend to ignore my messages and I answer them too late. 
All I do during the day is managing a fanpage on Instagram. Actually I put all of my time, resourses, focus and energy on this page to the point where I spend 48 hours straight making a mouth-dropping post for my followers.
I really want to do everything that I have postponed. I want to study, learn more about my major, find a job, lose some weight, read books, watch movies and learn art but instead I spend the whole day on my page. you see, I am trying to emphasize that I have interests I just don't have courage or energy to do them. I constantly ignore them untill it's bed time and then I start to think about my mental health prblms, searching it up a bit and redditing about it (it's 5:43am here). Every night I feel sleepy but I don't want to sleep cause I know that tomorrow will be the same. I will spent the whole day fangirling, checking Instagram and surfing the net. It's the only thing that make me feel good and bad at the same time.
There are times I want to leave the fanpage too and just have absolutely nothing to do at all.

I've always been a fangirl but I've never been this obsessed iny life. I have never been able to keep my life balanced but it has reached it's peak and I am not changing it.
I used to have many responsibilities in the college but I've cut all of them off and I spend most of my time avoiding my friends. When I try and meet them, I can have fun and they make me genuinely happy. 


I feel like I'm being lazy and I'm running away from my responsibilities. My family keeps telling me that. That this whole saddness thing is cause by the quarantine. But subconsciously I'm trying to find a reason to find what is wrong with me. If it's depression or not. I want it to be depression so I can blame everything on that and then be sure that there IS a way out, there is a way to heal and be normal and functioning again. I also feel like I'm just seeking attention by playing the victim here and I am deliberately trying to act like a depressed person to seek out love and attention. In order not to be blamed...

23,"Uhh how do I start


Well, I was talking to a friend other day and he said that what I told him is very close to an ed. Now I don't wanna hurt anyone with an actual eating disorder here, I'm just confused, please understand that.


So, basically I told him that there's some phrases that are stuck in the back of my head all the time. They are: ""we eat to live, they live to eat"" from RJ, the animal from over the edge. Ik, it sounds ridiculous that a phrase from a children's cartoon caused me to think I might have an ed, but this sentence is everywhere I go, everytime I want to eat, that I'm hungry, that I need food. It's annoying. It's scary, scary how much it bothers me. The second one idk where I saw it but it's: ""you're not hungry, kids in africa are hungry, you're just greedy for food"". That one, that one broke me. It truly did. It was what made me not eat for twenty two hours, what made me starve for real. I needed food, but did I? Did I really needed it? Is it fair that I get it eat every four hours and be such a horrible person, and there's people who can't eat all day long? No it's not. Then I probably should just starve. That's what I think sometimes. Ik it's bullshit, ik it's not true, but just because you know you're colorblind doesnt mean you can see the colors. (Quote from empty, jaidens animation) 


And maybe I'm completely wrong, and I'm just a needy stupid girl, who can't control herself. That's probably it. I'm sorry if I offended anyone with a real ed, I just wanted those fucked up thoughts to get outta my head.",04Nov2020,1
24,"YMMV. My context: I have ADHD-PI (diagnosed as an adult), and a very analytical mind that was recently diagnosed as ASD, though I'm still unsure.

I was obsessive-compulsive as a child but noticed my behaviour and quit it‚Äîtbh I think I may just have driven it underground, internalised it? Much as I did with the ""hyperactive"" part of ADHD.

*****

I've long tried to deal with anxiety by reasoning around it + taking up ""relaxing"" behaviours.

Here's the issue: I find that while this strategy can work sometimes, it also VERY OFTEN ends up becoming part of the problem.

E.g.: meditation? It's great while it's novel, but after awhile I find that the practice has turned into a set of internal compulsions? I find myself sitting in a certain chair + looking at a certain point + doing a certain breathing exercise + trying to cast my mind to a certain place, but now it's so full of anxious expectation that I often end up feeling more frustrated than when I started.

(*Of course I notice this, too, and try to NOT have expectations, to change things up a bit, to ""*be in the moment*"" as they say...but no, once I'm in this headspace it's very hard to break out!*)

This applies also to music, exercise, and hobbies (incl. video games like Minecraft).

The anxiety/compulsion always ""finds a way"" to get me. Paradoxically, it almost seems to work better ‚Äîto some extent‚Äî if I don't really ""try"", if I let myself be impulsive, then I am really truly ""in the moment""...

It's a balancing act! A very tricky one.

*****

The same thing happens with ""positive thinking"", like...the first time I catch myself in a spot of pessimism and take action to correct it? Great. But it gradually ""shifts"" over time into a thing where that ""positive"" thinking actually *feels* ""negative"", i.e. compulsive. Almost like a drug where tolerance builds up and leads into a vicious cycle.

To illustrate in a different way, it's kinda like [semantic satiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation), where you say a word repeatedly (*banana banana banana banana banana banana ...*) till you're no longer aware of the word's significance/meaning, really, but only the act of saying it?

25,"For the past few years I've been diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. And I can tell that my mental health has drastically improved since the diagnosis, but then drastically declined in the last year. I assume this decline has happened to many people though.

Basically, I've been wanting to tell my closest friends that I have gotten worse. I can't even tell my therapist about me thinking about hurting myself without her being required to tell my parents, so I need to tell someone. 

My friends all have similar disorders to me, so I assume they would understand, but most of the time they aren't the types to openly talk about that kind of stuff.

The psychiatrists won‚Äôt quit trying to give me seroquel and lithium, the therapist I was seeing wasn‚Äôt very helpful and I honestly felt like I couldn‚Äôt talk to her. If I had a problem she wanted to refer me to someone else, if I accomplished something she would just ask me what I wanted to do next and I would just be completely lost. I don‚Äôt know what I want to do next after I managed to be 2 weeks sober other than try to be happy about it. So to the therapist I am a disappoint and to the psychiatrists I‚Äôm just a bad patient I don‚Äôt know what the point in going back there is if there‚Äôs nothing they can do except give me meds I don‚Äôt want and pointers that don‚Äôt help. I‚Äôve been in and out of mental health offices since I was 7 and over the years I don‚Äôt think I see how it‚Äôs going to help and if it‚Äôs my fault then why can‚Äôt I just fix it on my own?",04Nov2020,1

35,"(this will be pretty scattered ://)

my mental health has been pretty bad since i hit the fifth grade, so it's been about four years now. i cry and get anxious a lot, but the crying is mostly done alone, and the safety of my room. the only times i've ever cried in school were in the bathroom and the time i had a mental breakdown before a presentation in class. my sixth grade year fucked me up badly, as it was ""cool"" to cut yourself and talk about suicide. a guy i really liked told me to go kill myself after trying to ""help"" me with my ""depression"" and claimed that he just snapped and didnt mean it (i have no idea if i was/am just an attention seeker, which is part of why i cant/dont want to rly open up to people about it) 

i'm not sure if i have depression but i'm fairly sure i have anxiety (undiagnosed.) when my thoughts start to spiral my ears start ringing and such, and i begin to cry. lately its just been about grades, school, and people. i've always been a people pleaser and it is so so hard for me to say no or correct someone if it affects them negatively, even when not saying/doing anything will hurt me in the long run. 

i havent been doing something i really enjoy for a long time. i have been drawing here and there but im just not excited to anymore. same thing with reading, although i honestly dont have the time for either anymore. i barely have time to practice the piano or even work out, which makes me even more miserable. im tired and exhausted and just want a day where i can do whatever i want.

i cant open up to anyone, and i honestly dont want to. i dont want to be that fake-depression/anxety person because i dont know if i am. plus what the hell's the point with bothering other people with my problems? i dont want to talk about it, and im not sure i could really put it into words anyways

38," 

A couple months ago, I started to feel really lonely. I only had one friend irl, and the online friends I had would never talk to me or spend time with me. Since then, I was able to make a decent amount of new friends irl and online that I've become close to. However, this hasn't stopped me from feeling lonely when my friends are busy or it's too late to talk to them.

On top of that, I also feel lonely because I want someone to love me for who I am, and to feel special to somebody. It's been over a year now since my first serious relationship had ended, and I find myself missing the emotions that came with a relationship. It's hard for me seeing the people around me happy with that person who's special to them and not being able to experience those same feelings, good or bad.

This feeling of loneliness is the biggest factor causing me to feel depressed, and I have no idea why it's affecting me so much lately. It has nothing to do with the virus, because I didn't have this many people around me until now. I've been having a lot of issues with feeling unloved and unwanted, and this state of mind is causing me to have dark thoughts and bad dreams as well.

One of the biggest thoughts plaguing my mind is the idea of being all alone. I'm at the age where my friends are all planning on moving away and following their dreams or going to be with the people they love, and I'm constantly worrying about not being able to physically see them. I keep imagining a future where I'm by myself in a dark, empty house, and not being able to spend time with the people I love because they're busy doing what makes them happy or taking care of their own families. And it's not like I wouldn't be happy for them, I just can't stand the thought of having nobody around to spend time with. I want to be there for my friends, and I want them to be here for me too. And I fear that when my friendships become long distance, our connections will weaken and I'll lose them.

I'm not really sure what kind of advice I'm looking for. Everyone I've tried talking to about this just tell me not to worry, or they just don't understand why this is such a big deal to me. But I would appreciate if anyone had genuine advice to offer, and even if not, I thank you for taking the time to read my post.",04Nov2020,1

I feel like some people don't know how genuinely hard school is for people who struggle with mental health. I'm still in high school and I haven't gotten the chance to be officially diagnosed however I've already talked to my doctor and school psychologist and they've both said I suffer with bad anxiety and possibly depression as well. The end of the first marking period is coming up for me and I'm failing like three of my classes and I have been trying to get caught up on my schoolwork for months now. I also haven't been attending my online classes due to being so anxious over simply being called on even though I know it isn't that big of a deal. I was trying to do at least some of my overdue assignments but I started having an anxiety attack and whenever I tried to keep doing my work I would just start sobbing and not being able to breath. It honestly just sucks being so anxious I feel like I can't even live. I know that I'm supposed to be preparing for my adult life but I don't even know how I'm going to make it out of high school at this point. My classes this year are really hard because I'm in a higher level program that my school system uses. I just wish I didn't have a mental breakdown every single fucking time I try to do anything and I know that I'm going to fail this marking period but I can't even bring myself to care anymore because I'm suffering every second of the day and my parents are too worried about my sleep schedule than the fact that I can't do anything because I'm too scared to do anything even though I know I would feel at least a little bit better if I was caught up in school and attended my classes. It doesn't help that whenever I do complete anything or get caught up in a class I have no sense of accomplishment whatsoever and that paired with my lack of motivation and my anxiety just sucks.

50,"I will try and keep this as short and concise as possible, but bare with me as I need to go into some detail about my past. Starting at about the onset of puberty, I began to experience intense social anxiety. The main reason i see for this, was that my parents never asserted much control over my life nor disciplined me in any way, and so I ended up spending the latter half of my childhood years locked to a screen. I wasn't having the sorts of experiences that build character, make you an interesting person, the sorts of experiences that people use to relate to each other. I would hang out with friends occasionally, but most of the time I would dissociate from whatever was going on in my life by watching YouTube videos. I wasn't really learning, or developing my emotional and social skills. I wasnt learning how to problem solve, or how to commit myself to something. How to have intimate relationships with others. I had stronger emotions then, and I was a very happy extroverted kid so my parents never really felt that they needed to push me. But even then I remember never feeling anger, or sadness, never crying, never being able to empathize with someone enough to feel their pain as my own. This was a key developmental period and I didn't utilize it in any way. From then on, I started isolating myself more and more, spending my days in my room instead of being with my family. Not trying to meet new people and build new relationships. Because my parents never disciplined me, I never had any self discipline, so I didn't ever set goals for myself and achieve things. In 7th grade, my stepdad attempted suicide, and I lost it. All innocence and happiness dissipated immediately. I recall not being capable of smiling for that entire year. I didn't feel much, except anxiety and awkwardness. I started smoking weed heavily at 13, which I regret significantly, as it made me feel less. After my two younger siblings were born, my parents didn't really have the time or energy to parent me, so they just kind of let me do my own thing. There was no parenting or mentorship available, so the self-neglectful behaviors only snowballed from there. They didn't know that I was doing nothing with my life, that the hours I spent in my room were being wasted. It's not their fault, I know they were doing the best they could with what they had, but I never learned the necessary life skills that others did. At a certain point, I stopped feeling love mostly. Fast forward to December of freshman year. My social skills were horrible, and I had no friends really. I texted in full punctuated, multi-sentence messages, which turned almost everyone off, and my presence made most people uncomfortable as I radiated anxiety and desperation. Then... I met my soul mate, a friend who I related to on every level of my being. But the relationship was born from and sustained by weed smoking. Heavy, heavy, weed smoking. Sometimes an eighth a day between two people. It made my social anxiety disappear, and I could talk like normal people. I learned how to say stupid silly things, how to be normal I guess. But slowly I stopped caring about school entirely and thinking about the repercussions this would have on my brain. My friend was self-destructive and rarely thought about his future, so I in turn became self-destructive and stopped thinking about my future. Then I came across the teachings of Alan watts and Ram Dass, great spiritual teachers. I was entranced and basically let everything else go, I thought if I transcended my ego, and become desire-less, everything would be okay. I neglected my relationships, stopped doing any school work really and made it my mission to experience reality without the filter of my mind. I wanted to stop thinking. Instead of doing what Ram Dass and Alan Watts REALLY teach, which is fulfilling your roles beautifully just without identitifying with them, by not destroying your ego, (individual identity) but to instead not identify with it, I abandoned my roles and tried to destroy my ego. I became obsessed with the guru stories, particularly the miracles, and developed a very delusional and distorted view of reality. Looking in retrospect, I thinking this was the oncet of drug induced psychosis. I decided to move in with my dad because I didn't want to face my failure in school and in life generally, so I chose to run, believing I would somehow have discipline there. Before moving there, my father had been alone completely alone, crippled by his severe untreated mental illness for over five years. I would go out into woods behind our house every day for sometimes 6-7 hours, and listen to the same spiritual lectures over and over again. I would also smoke extremely large amounts of weed, sometimes up to 12 bowls a day. I was not learning anything else for the twelve months that I was up there. What I thought was meditation, was nothing more than extreme dissociation. I forgot how to think, how to feel. I became incapable of carrying a conversation, and my thoughts became very jumbled. I eventually stopped talking at all. I'd be in the car with my dad, and he'd be talking to me, but I'd just sit there quietly... dissociating. I wanted to exist as pure consciousness, what's referred to in hinduism as the Atman. I was very confused, and mistook my pathological state of mind for a state of transcendence. I had a very delusional notion that I clung to for dear life, that every single thing that happens is predetermined or destined, and thus when I heard about other people's problems or terrible things going on in the world I didn't react emotionally. Eventually, during one of my trips to Seattle that friend I mentioned earlier told me that he smoked fentanyl, and I didn't feel anything. At that moment I knew something was very very wrong with me. I thought that what I wanted, for months, was to exist in a state of thoughtless awareness. But I am 16, there are many many things I need to be thinking about. I started to panic, and over the next few days I came to the conclusion that I had gone completely crazy. Over the course of the next month, I had uncontrollable thoughts brutally dissecting all my memories and using them as evidence that I've always been fucked up, that I've always been crazy. The thoughts told me that I would never get better, that the only option is to commit suicide, that there's no way I'll make it in the world. I felt that my life was completely over. I started to dissociate more and more, my thoughts became more and more incoherent, until I stopped being able to think. I then moved back home, and have been seeking medical care ever since. My thoughts are disconnected fragments that fade out before they ever finish. I'm not able to feel empathy at all, and not only empathy, all other emotions as well. I feel nothing... nothing at all. No happiness or sadness, no fear of love, no pleasure of emotional pain. I also have no access to my memories anymore, what used to be detailed videos in my head are now foggy and minimal. I am hardly able to have a conversation, because a conversation is an exchange of thoughts; if your thoughts are completely incoherent there's no way of connecting with people. If feels like I'm completely on autopilot, like I'm just watching my life go by without any control over it at all, without any control over what I say or do. I can hardly read anymore, as my brain is unable to piece the words together automatically. It feels as though my brain is malfunctioning, and that my mind has nearly disappeared. I know this may be hard to believe, since I'm able to articulate myself so well, but there aren't coherent linear trains of thought which are translating into this writing. Nobody I've explained my situation to really believe the extent of my mental dysfunction because of this. My ability to write elegantly creates the illusion of mental integrity. My question to you is, is this really a life that is worth living? Without emotions, is there any reason at all to go on living? I don't plan on commiting suicide, as it doesn't really solve my problems, so you don't need to comment about that. I just don't see a possible road to recovery. I'm getting a psychiatric evaluation in a month and a half, but all that they can really do is give a name to catagorize my symptoms, prescribe medications which may or may not improve things, and give me a therapist. But talking to someone will not make me feel again, it will not teach me to how to think again. It feels completely hopeless. I would give anything to feel sadness, to just be crippled by sorrow or anger. I regret not appreciating my anxiety more, at least anxiety is a feeling. Please, if you have any advice for me or have experienced something similar yourself, let me know. It would mean more than I can say. Thank you for reading this, god bless.",04Nov2020,1
51,"So, I am pretty much a loner and have been most of my life. I never had a girlfriend, don't really have any friends, never go out anywhere, am a virgin and my life has been constantly between home and work. About two years ago I started chatting with this girl I met on a dating app. We found each other appealing, talked about everything and I told her all my secrets and she pretty much told me everything about her. We didn't meet right away due to some of my phobia such as driving long distance or at night, but due to my loneliness I fell for her right away and due to the fact that I never really communicating this deep with any girl before. A few months ago we finally had our first meeting, and then after that we had two more dates. The first two dates were ok but the 3rd one was pretty bad were we spent an almost enire day together, the date was filled with a lot of awkward silence, forced conversations, and nothing happening due to my lack of social skills, inexperience, and shy, introvert personality. I even slept over at her place but nothing happened. After this 3rd date she said she didn't want to see me again, I understand why, don't really blame her and accept her decision. I tried to reason her with her to continue seeing her even though I knew it was over but she said no. 

The problem I have is I have all these emotions for her, regret what and what didn't happen. I want to let go of her, I understand that she doesn't find us compatible and accept that. I noticed on her social media she even started seeing someone else and invited him to her apartment and that image in my head of her with someone else is giving me anxiety to the point where I can't sleep.

I have a serious problem were I am in regret of what and what didn't happen, seeing her with someone else, and have all these feelings for her. 

I want to forget her but her images keep still in my mind, and thoughts of what happened. I lost her, I accept that and want to move on for the sake of my health but my mind keeps bringing her back being with someone else. This has made me stressful to the point where I can't eat, sleep, or even get aroused.

54,"This year has been a disaster for everyone, I know, but the last time I felt this bad, I was bored earlier suicidal and I am trying so hard to keep myself out of that head space. Like many, I was isolated because of the pandemic, and I was already struggling with loneliness. Then, about y weeks ago, I got hit by a car going 30 mph as a pedestrian and despite not getting any major injuries, I am suffering from severe PTSD. I live in the USA right now and I am so petrified about what will happen if trump wins again. I‚Äôm someone who suffers from severe body dysmorphia largely associated with my uterus because, as I‚Äôve been talking to my therapist about, going through a pregnancy/birth would be incredibly traumatic for me due to specific family history. I do not like children in the slightest and if I were to ever get pregnant while under the trump administration, I fear I‚Äôd lose my ability to abort. I will not debate abortion with anyone, btw. I firmly support it. It isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúbirth control method‚Äù. It‚Äôs a life saving procedure. I know if I didn‚Äôt have safe access to an abortion in that circumstance, I‚Äôd likely try to perform a home abortion, and if I didn‚Äôt, I know I would suffer the entire pregnancy with severe depression. I‚Äôd likely suffer from pre and postpartum depression that would likely lead to suicidal ideations. I know these fears are incredibly specific but they are the fears that haunt me. When I was hit by the car 6 weeks ago, it was entirely an accident. I unfortunately didn‚Äôt see the poor driver and he didn‚Äôt see me.

I‚Äôm so glad to be alive and okay, but I feel so deeply betrayed by my body for being an object that society expects to carry babies  when children are quite literally the bane of my existence. I hate the current government for trying to take away a safe procedure that could save my life. I hate that people ask me to just take birth control, not knowing the ignorance behind their question. I have been on so many birth controls. My iud gave me an ectopic pregnancy, followed by a miscarriage (thank goodness). The depo shot made me so depressed and withdrawn. The pill made me throw up for months. I am careful. But when the worst happens, who can I rely on to keep me safe? Not doctors. They won‚Äôt give me a hysterectomy. Not the government. They want to govern my body. I can‚Äôt even trust myself to go on a fucking walk without getting hit by a car.

56,"I am non-stop obsessing over my spouses past and just cannot get a moment of relief. Its endless. It starts when I wake up and continues till I go to bed. Shes way more experienced than I am sexually and some part of me hates it to a degree that I just can't seem to get over.

And I am never ever happy. Sometimes the thoughts are less severe if we just had sex. And I've talked to her about this. About how my selfish ass needed things that were ""first times"" with her to try and fight this obsessive demon. And she was open to them initially, open to the idea of having anal sex for the first time or other kinks I have.

But it became clear to her as well to me that these things were the only thing that might make me happy. And I think the pressure it put her under turned her off the idea. So now the few things I was hoping might actually help me fight these obsessive thoughts are not going to happen.

And I am so unhappy. I love her so much and only want to be with her. I can't imagine a world without her. But I am suffering over her and things I can't have. Things that I don't even understand why they are important.

I just want it to be over. I don't enjoy eating video games going outside movies nothing. I haven't felt any pleasure in forever now. 

I am not sure if this obsessive sexual bullshit is because I was abused or what but it is ruining my life. And I can't get help. And I can't check in somewhere because I am financially responsible for people. I tried to keep this short but I have so many more paragraphs inside right now. 

Important side notes, not to make anyone feel bad for me just because they might offer insight into my mental health issues:

Sober, but was a chronic (dying) alcoholic for 4 years
Dad is trans and ocd and my mom is an addict
Brother had cf and schizophrenia and passed away
Raped by two different men from 3-4 and then from 7-9
Bullied all my life
Two past incidences of being extremely obsessed with girls, the one in highschool I continued to have obsessive thoughts for even after not talking for years

I just don't think I've had a happy day alive outside of when my spouse first said yes to a date. It was a fleeting moment of happiness where I forgot about the other things in my past for a second. Then my cruel mind began attacking me with nonstop images.",04Nov2020,1

58,"tl;dr - Covid has caused my life to go from bad to horrendous and there's nothing I can do about it.  I've lost any sort of escape I had from the hellscape that is my household, and the only person I could trust and confide in has moved away.  My mental illness, a lot of which I had conquered years ago, is now back with a vengeance.

So, today my local school board has decided to stop with all in-person schooling for the remainder of November.  We only even really got to go in person for a couple weeks in the first place, and for those couple weeks I had an escape from home where I could see my friends for a few hours and not have to be around my mother.  There are quite a few reasons I hate my mother, but for argument's sake let's just say that she has, through negligence as well as malicious intent, put me through more trauma in the past 17 years of my life than most people would see by the time they're 30.  From the time she moved us into the middle of nowhere North Carolina with her abusive boyfriend for two years to the incessant manipulation and neglect, she's left me with my fair share of psychological damage.  At this point I'm pretty sure I have some degree of PTSD from how often she screams at me and how drastic her actions following said screaming bouts tend to be.  And now I'm stuck at home, 24 hours, 7 days a week.  The only solace I get comes from her going to work, but her work schedule is so sporadic and unpredictable that this only leads to me constantly stressing over whether or not I'll get to leave my room tomorrow.

And as if all of this weren't bad enough, I'm utterly without any sort of external support since the only true friend I've ever had moved away two months ago, leaving me completely and utterly alone on an emotional level.  Sure, there are other people who I could talk to, but after all I've been through it takes a whole lot of trust for me to even begin talking about how I feel with anyone.  She was the only person I trusted to take me seriously and be supportive, and now she's gone and I have no one.  I'm utterly alone with my crazed mother and my mental illness.

On the subject of mental illness, I've got a few of those.  Depression, social anxiety, OCD, a few weird sensory things, the occasional bout of psychosis which is usually accompanied with suicidal thoughts and generally destructive behaviors.  I've been struggling with these things for as long as I can remember, but over the past two years I had started to get better with a lot of it.  I fought most of my OCD rituals to nonexistence, I found ways to cope with all of the sensory things that stress me out to no end, and I was doing pretty okay in terms of depression and anxiety.  But that's all been undone now, old compulsions and rituals are slowly coming back, and I've gone back to having panic attacks every time someone yells angrily near me.  I would say that I'm currently the second most depressed I have ever been, and from some perspectives it's worse than ever -- I have no interest in anything at all, it's impossible for me to get motivated to do just about anything, and seldom does a day pass without me crying at least once over some minor inconvenience.

I just don't know what to do or where to go anymore.  I just want everything to go back to normal so I can see my friends again and get 7 hours of guaranteed reprieve from my mother and her antics 5 days out of the week. I feel like everything I love is slowly slipping away from me and there's nothing I can do to stop it.",04Nov2020,1

69,"The last four months of my life I have been feeling really unmotivated, anxious and useless. I'm a teenage girl who has mediocre grades, a few friends and some simple hobbies. Resantly I have noticed my parents behavior in comparison to other parents actually is kinda 'not good', and can be compared to emotional abuse. Of course, I don't want put abuse alligatons on my own parents, but I can't get it out of my head. This thought has made me feel really depressed, but I don't think I should self diagnose, but at the same time I haven't felt anything that I could compare to just simple sadness. Me being a big target for bullying and having awful not eating habits isn't helping me out. I have tried bringing these things up with my parents but they just kinda dismiss it, and if I even dare say something about how they're actions might be bad, they turn it on me and start taking about how much I'm overreacting and it's all my fault. I have tried bringing it up with one of my friends, her reaction at first were supporting, but then she said the classic 'you know you're parents still love you' line and now I'm scared to bring it up to her or even anyone because I think they don't take me seriously, that has not helped my anxious thoughts. I have self harming thoughs and sometimes even some thoughts about disposing myself and I'm scared that one day the words 'nobody would care' will get the better of me. I have had anxiety attacks over the smallest things, there was even a time I got one because there was too much people around. They started last year before all the covid stuff. I don't know what to do, so I've just kinda been trying to distract myself with watching YouTube and drawing but sometimes I just can't control myself and just start crying out of nowhere. I try to avoid eating for some reason and it's not because I think I have a ugly body (that award goes to my face), for me it's like a lust for control over something in my life, knowing that I made myself feel weak out of my control, it just kinda makes me feel 'better' temporarily. I also sometimes bite myself when I'm stressed. It's obvious that I have some mental issues, but I don't want to tell that to people, knowing that I'll eather be annoying or boring. I try to keep my mind out of dark places and right now I just hope that feeling like this isn't too commen.

70,"Hi everyone, i have been feeling weird these few weeks almost a month. It started basically a year ago when i didn't get this letter which allows me to leave my home country (Indonesia) for working holiday, but things got better after 3 ish months thanks to my nice, friendly coworkers. However, after the pandemic hits all of us were forced to take our unpaid leave and after 4 months of unpaid leave i got kicked out of my job thanks to the person who recommended me for the position. This person is one of the BOD in the company and owned a restaurant of his own, long story short bc like 80% of the staffs were forced to take unpaid leave and he knows i'm one of them he asked me to help him manage his restaurant as the store manager and that i could quit whenever i want to or if i dont feel comfortable or when the company decides to take me in to work again. But during my work there i didn't get along with his sister who also manages the restaurant and called quit after 1+ months of working and right after i called quit, my manager from the company contacted me and asked if i want to rejoin the team or not, but in a different position in which i rejected because i know that position will woek right under the operational manager whos infamous for calling/asking the staff to work whenever he feels like it and the day after the operational manager called me then asked me if i have filed the exit form which people fill when theyre about to quit the job or not, and i was really shocked so i said i haven't and he told me that my manager will do that for me and all i have to do is to return the laptop the company lend me.
Since then i was really stressed as i dont have any income anymore and that i have to live off my savings. I told my friends about it and one of them suggested me to continue my study and finish off my Bachelors degree (i have an associate degree from a college in the US, went back due to financial problems). After looking at schools and randomly applying a uni contacted me and said that i got accepted and i dont even have to pay for the application fee, so the impulsive me said yes and sent all the datas over to the admission plus paid the tuition fee before looking at the curriculum since it offers international joint degree for the majors and even offers their students to go to germany for a year for thesis research and internship. Whats bad is that their curriculum was really bad and they make their students learn whats unnecessary for their major and make it mandatory. I am majoring in food technology and i have to take computer networking, gaming algorithm and even some electrical engineering classes which is sooooooo out of the major.
Im so stressed and often cry while doing the assigments of the courses as i really dont have any idea about it or have any interest of learning it.
Told my mom about it and shes like ""so what you want to do?"" And i told her i wanna quit after this semester and try to find a uni in canada that offers full scholarship then i can work to pay for my living expenses there + money left from my savings but my dad didn't like the idea since my tuition fee was sponsored by someone and he said that i would be a jerk of i stop after a semester and dont get a degree. This house is getting more and more toxic as the day goes and im getting more stressed to. Theres so many times where i wanna cry but i couldnt since if i cried they gonna blame me and told me that its all in my brain and it will stop once i stop thinking about it, thing is, me, too, dont wanna think about any of it and just wanna force myself to shove this hard pill down but my brain wont listen.
Yesterday one of my coworker who secured a job after the pandemic contacted me and told me that his company is in need of staff and he said that he could recommend me, and i told him it would be great. Since getting a job means theres income for me so i can stop living off my savings and my parents money but when i told my parents about it theyre not happy and told me i shouldve rejected it since its gonna mess with my study but i dont wanna continue anymore.
I ended up do whatever i feel like best and did an over-phone interview with the HRD earlier today and the thoughts of i might be accepted to the company + the study + everything just stress me out so much and my head hurts so bad.

Have anyone ever experience this kind of situation? Im sorry if its so long and i kinda vent too but i really dont know whats wrong with me.
I used to not be this kind of person, i am a high key introvert and high key hates people but i never ever felt so much stress like these few months combined my whole life (im 22). Ever since i came back from the States it has been downhill for me and i feel lile i dont see no lights in the future ngl",04Nov2020,1
71,"a little background story: i've been dealing with anxieties since i was a kid but they've only gotten worse last year. it created some kind of domino effect that led me to almost take my life last month that left me in a somehow unstable state.

last night, it spiked up again so i decided to my comfort songs. first song got me teary eyed, but the next one... idk but 5 seconds in and I already found myself sobbing uncontrollably. usually the sobs i let out were inaudible or muffled but this time, it was painfully louder. 

this made me realized that i was bottling up my emotions all this time until it became overwhelming for me to handle. last time i allowed myself to show vulnerability was 8 months ago but even then, it was only an eight of the bottle. 

so yeah, i just felt the need to share this :)",04Nov2020,1

I‚Äôve started closing myself off because complaining and venting always makes things worse for me. I work through things better by myself, alone, in my head.

And that everyone deals with their struggle differently, I want to encourage that if anyone thinks they are dealing with a mental health issue to seek professional help.

That being said....

I have been suffering from depression for a while and I really hate seeing people thinking that having a mental illness is qUiRkY or FuN. Not just with depression but also with anxiety, DID, OCD, PTSD ect... I actually had someone come up to me and tell me that they fake anxiety to get away with doing things. So one more time for the people in the back mental illness is NOT  fun or quirky or a fucking personality trait. It's an issue that yes is getting more attention now thanks to people actually caring and improved medical science, but that doesn't give you the right to pretend that you have anxiety so your followers can mark you relatable. I've seen what happens to people suffering from anxiety, on a bad day my friend can't function in public I have had to drive to their house and calm them down. My grandpa served in the Korean war, I have never heard him talk about his experiences over there but before he died he forced me and my brother to swear we would never join the military. The worst part about it is when someone who has a large following goes and gets to discuss their ""mental illness"" when it's obvious they only did a 5 min. Google search and looked at the images. They can spread false information. Sorry about the rant I needed to get that off my chest.",04Nov2020,1

It sounds weird but I don't feel like I can trust my friends or family with this information because I don't even think they care about me much at all. I'm supposed to be moving in with those friends later this month but all I ever feel is that they don't want me to and that my parents want me gone even though all say that's it's quite the opposite. I can't make friends anymore because I have no drive or energy to meet people. I'm extremely anxious at not being able to find a person to love before it's too late. It kind of feels like my life just fell into a pit of cement and I'm now stuck there with this shitty feeling of coldness in my chest all the time and anxiety in my stomach. So often now I think about ending things because most of the time I can't even find a reason as to why I should stick around and the possibility of no longer existing is the only thing that really gives me any relief anymore.

77,"I (M53) was diagnosed as suffering from C-PTSD last year and recently another psychologist diagnosed quiet BPD. I‚Äôm what you‚Äôd call high functioning since I‚Äôve no problem holding down several jobs, as well doing online  copywriting and guest post writing, commuting 2-3h daily, bringing up my two children because their mum is more concerned with her bf and his younger kids, basically trying to work on myself and dealing with ending my last relationship because my gfs cheated on me with a sugar daddy. 

Here in France we‚Äôve just started a second confinement and there‚Äôs also a curfew operating in most big cities.  Since the end of last year i‚Äôve been going regularly to my local gym lifting weights/ boxing/cardio, i've lost a load of excess weight,  I started going to yoga classes in July, cut out all alcohol, sugars, processed foods and consequently put on a lot of muscle/toned up my body and was feeling much better internally as well as externally. Unfortunately since September i've been having problems. First of all i ended my relationship with my two gfs because they cheated on me with their old boss and now sugar daddy, i lost my two part time university jobs due to economic reasons, my son 'left the nest' and moved out to start his career ( so that left a huge physical and emotional emptiness since i'd more or less brought up  my two children on my own over the last 7 years when their mum left them to start a new life with her much younger bf and his young children), my freelance writing business got hit by the economic fallout from Covid-19, all the friends i'd made at my gym just disappeared off the radar, two of my work colleagues suddenly handed in their resignations leaving the rest of the department to pick up the pieces ( extra hours without extra pay), my GP suddenly left the local health clinic and no one has since replaced her, and   all the gyms/ sports classes are shut because of the newly reintroduced confinement. 

I'd made several appointments to see my psychologist and psychiatrist  ( normally i should be seeing them once a fortnight) but  each time they cancelled last minute, and i couldn't do any online Skype therapy sessions with them because each time slot clashed with my teaching timetable. Consequently, i haven't seen either since the start of September. I just get my prescription renewed and thats all. I called different support hotlines and got put on hold or told to see my GP ( i don't have one since she hasn't been replaced and no other doctor will accept to see me).

Last weekend I took too many pills and ended up  calling an Uber to take me to the nearest ER. I was refused treatment because there was no one available to  treat me so the nurse told me to either wait 6-8h or go home and call a paramedical service in the town where I live ( I passed out in the waiting room )  so I ended up forcing  myself to be sick in the waiting room toilet. I passed out again in the nearby car park, someone found me but even then no medical staff were available so  the woman called an Uber and I went home. I took about 150mg of vortioxetine. I must‚Äôve been out cold for most of Sunday because all I remember was having a terrible flashback and waking up drenched in sweat on my bathroom floor... no idea how I got there.  I went to work on Monday. I teach full time and I‚Äôve got several classes of 30+ very highly stressed out 15-18 year olds to keep occupied whilst everyone can‚Äôt decide whether to shut  down schools again or go for a hybrid teaching style. I suffer from a light fever, terrible headaches, brain flashes, insomnia, vommitting, flashbacks and panic attacks. I'm still working because since i don't have a GP to see i can't get ant time off work. 
My local pharmacist just told me to go and see my GP.

Since Monday I‚Äôve barely eaten, have suicidal thoughts, insomnia, severe flashbacks and other symptoms of going cold turkey. My anti depressants made me sick but my psychiatrist told me I had to take them or he‚Äôd recommend putting me in a mental hospital..i felt i was being punished.  I stopped taking them two weeks ago but last Saturday had had enough of everything and I stupidly took 12-15 pills. I felt I had no choice. My GP didn‚Äôt bother either when I told her I was attacked back in July and had been suffering severe flashbacks since then. She made it sound like it was my fault and being told to go to hospital was like a form of punishment ' if you don't tale the pills you'll have to go....'
The police didn‚Äôt want to know either when I told them my version of events and even accused me of wasting police time.. I was held in an apartment and assaulted during several days. My two gfs at the time knew and tried to help me. We were going through a rough period but then got back together. They helped me a lot cope with it and encouraged me to report it to the police and see a therapist.   I‚Äôve seen numerous therapists but each time they ended  up cancelling or postponing to another date when I‚Äôm working, or they didn‚Äôt understand why a heterosexual guy like myself would end up getting raped and assaulted  and because I told them I was into bdsm assumed I wanted it. They also didn‚Äôt  understand why I‚Äôve kept all my severe childhood trauma locked up inside me for the past 40 years. ( too much to list so it‚Äôs in my other posts). At least three police  officers made the comment  'only homosexual men get raped.'  One senior officer told me 'If you're into hitting women and having rough sex with them then we might have to investigate you....' I was given a warning for wasting police time!!!

No idea how to handle everything now. I‚Äôve tried doing some home yoga and meditation but get terrible headaches and fever like symptoms. My concentration levels are almost non existence, my creative inspiration to continue writing has disappeared, i repeatedly wake up during the night after seeing images of what happened to me when i was young, i can't eat and just drink litres of herbal teas and water.",04Nov2020,1

79,"Hi everyone, Seeing some people's problems mine can feel a bit like 'bitching' but at the moment I feel I need to vent some things out. I am going to get some professional help in the upcoming weeks and a huge portion of my problems will be over in two months (or at least I hope so), but I need to struggle through these two months somehow.

So basically I am a middle manager in a media company. I am dealing with my team and the clients' issues as well. For a while it was good as I was learning a lot. But after a while it became more and more stressful and frustrating. I also had changes in my team (and I did not really have a word in these changes) and the new member is causing me a lot of trouble as well. I don't want to go through all the pain points, because there are too many. The conclusion is that now I feel burnt out, stressed and tired all the time.

Last week I gave in my notice period (which is 2 months according to my contract), because I just can't handle this anymore. I thought just doing this would help at least a little, but they have started to involve me in an onboarding project which involves a lot of work and additional stress. And at this point I just don't know how I will get through the next two months. I am still dealing with problematic clients, daily issues, conflicts etc. Basically I just want to let these things go, because if the company does not realize (after I have been telling them for months, that we should do something, because I have issues) that it's not a good idea to put more work on someone who already told them he can't do this anymore and is about to leave, I really shouldn't care. But there are some good people in the company that I don't want to let down. And this is making it even more difficult.

85,"I think this is mental health related. I have treatment resistant depression (tried drugs and therapy with awful and disappointing results) but have put my life together in a way that satisfies everyone else at least. 

The thing is, the elements of human life and our society are just abhorrent to me. Working every day, constantly pushing forward, and most importantly relationships mess with my head. 

I've begun to distrust and dislike women over the past few years. It's like society is giving them a free pass to act like the worst of men. Like somehow they went from rightfully criticizing the toxic douches to wanting to be just like them (not saying they were perfect to begin with, no one is). But now I just don't feel comfortable around females and I feel like everyone I meet plays games with me whether it's trying to get me to like them or just trying to use me for some goal. 

Because my mental state is so screwed up I tend to rapidly loop thoughts that are particularly stressful or powerful and they just become worse and worse. As soon as a stressors brings me to the point of a panic attack (I have a lot of them), in the future that stressor will trigger more anxiety and possibly more panic attacks. I try to meditate but thats like intentionally inducing anxiety so I usually distract myself with ""productive"" work, exercise, or hobbies when I feel a trigger. 

Still, lately I've been having both violent thoughts about women, and sexual thoughts about men that concern me. I know I'm not entirely gay, because I'm not physically attracted to men. Masculine features are a turn off completely. And I cant imagine dating a man. But sometimes I lapse into a state of mind where i imagine sex with a man but dont picture him as any particular person and it feels so freeing. Like I'm being freed from female expectations and their pettiness that is so typical these days. 

Even more recently I've been feeling a huge block in sexuality. I'm already a 21 year old virgin, never dated or even kissed anyone. But I've usually been able to become aroused by women. Now I have no libido, instead sexual urges become complete anxiety and frustration and I rarely climax from masturbating. Usually I'm just left feeling very on edge so I've been avoiding it. Hearing coworkers talk about sex makes me angry and the other day I had a full blown anxiety attack and threw up in the bathroom after hearing a girl I work with complain about not having enough sex. It's just very unsettling to me. 

I'd like to say maybe one day I want a relationship or even sex, but when I write my feelings down or think about them very hard I really just want to die. I feel like an alien for this reason and many others; I don't want to do anything anymore, I cant even picture an ideal version of myself because nothing exists that would satisfy me. Maybe something in a fictional book, like a sorcerer or a sage or something like that. But within the realms of reality I'm completely disappointed at every corner. 

I often ask why I should keep going, I've even written down my reasons and the only convincing two are to listen to good music, and because everyone else would be sad if I took my own life. Which I have tried twice before as a teenager and it really shook everyone up and got them worried and made me feel like shit. Still it's never made me appreciate life more. 

I just don't know what to do anymore.",04Nov2020,1
86,"My boyfriend has what he and the psychologist suspect as an anxiety attack. Some times he can't breathe well and some times he gets depressive thoughts. I am not in a good space myself but I try to support him as much as I can.

Recently he went to a friend's gathering and all of his friends have things going for them but my bf is currently jobless (graduate since one year ago) and is not looking for a job, he came back feeling rather depressed. He spends most of his time at a part-time job (that I got for him and pushed him to go for) and his hobby. He gets triggered when I talk to him about finding a job and used to just mass send him related job postings (he did send a few resumes), but recently, I decided to not help anymore as I feel that he is not even putting in the least bit of effort.

96,"Depressed and badly heartbroken

I have recently came out of an abusive relationship with my ex girlfriend. She used to abuse me emotionally psychologically and then finally physically. 

I found out she was escorting and dominating for money and took her back. I also found out she was sleeping with other men and I took her back from it all. I loved this girl so much. But when I look back on it I don‚Äôt think she ever loved me. I think she was dominating me and getting off on it. She displayed real narcissist behaviour such as gaslighting me. Building me up and tearing me down. Used to even call me her little lost puppy. Never used to show empathy. She used to regularly laugh at her ex boyfriends she claimed she ‚Äúbroke their hearts‚Äù. 

I couldn‚Äôt even tell my friends What was happening out of sheer embarrassment. 


I live in a gang area in the us. And come from a low income housing project. Once I was on the way home and saw a man killed while on the phone to her. There was nobody else on the road just me and this guy. We was both wearing ‚Äúurban‚Äù style clothes. He turnt out to be an innocent man. This could have been me if I hadn‚Äôt gone a different way, I only went that way because my ex had called me and I wanted to talk to her. So I took a longer route. I used to smoke weed but it just had me thinking of me watching this guy die. It used to give me anxiety attacks. Uncontrollable shaking. She noticed that and used to play on it. Saying she gave me a place out the hood to come to. 

She used to always hit me and strike me and I used to restrain her. Until the last time. 
It ended with a big fight and I finally hit her back. 
Her last words she ever said to me before I hit her was ‚Äúcan‚Äôt you see I don‚Äôt respect you. You‚Äôre f***img me after you know I have had sex with other men‚Äù


She went to the police and filed false reports on me which broke my heart so badly. I was in jail dreaming that the charges would get dropped and she would tell the truth but she never did. I felt so betrayed because I stuck by her through everything. She used to cry in my arms while I rocked and kissed her to sleep. She was my first love. 

I am now facing legal battles against her vicious lies trying to defame my character. She always promised I couldn‚Äôt be happy if it wasn‚Äôt with her. And now she‚Äôs going through with her plans. 

I find it hard to eat regularly. 

I go to sleep and wake up in the middle of the night and can‚Äôt get back to sleep. Then sleep all day. 

The ‚Äúhood‚Äù I live in regularly innocent people are killed by accident and it‚Äôs not advised to be out by yourself for no reason. But it‚Äôs weird I‚Äôm not scared of anything anymore just numb. 

I have thought about ending it all but I been through so much even before her. 
I can‚Äôt have been through all that to go out like that. 
That means she will win. 

I‚Äôm a really good hearted person and sometimes
I feel to become a heartless villain and never show anybody love again. But she would still win because she would have changed me forever. 

All this while she‚Äôs enjoying her life. Has a new boyfriend. And regularly cryptically taunts me through her social media accounts.

101,"Hello stranger,

If your mind is running in circles today, please take a moment to pause. 

You‚Äôre probably not breathing deeply either, so let‚Äôs fix that first.

Close your eyes and slowly inhale until your lungs are full. Then slowly release it.Repeat this a few times until you feel calmer.

Feeling a *little* better?

Now, take a moment to do this:

1. Focus on sensations, not on thoughts\*.  
Take note of every sensation arising and coming into awareness ***in the body***.  
Not in the mind or in thoughts, *just focus on sensations like curled toes, clenched teeth, dry mouth, pain in the back‚Ä¶*  
Continue to breathe gently and deeply.
2. Allow the sensations to prevail ***without labelling or calling them anything***(*‚Äòit‚Äôs my ulcer‚Äô*)

This is important.

1. Ignore mental pictures, inner dialogue and all thoughts that arise. *This may take a few attempts.*
2. Welcome the sensation(s) without resisting. Do this by breathing into the sensations - just let go trying to stop them, or make them go away.
3. If you‚Äôre do this right (see #3 and #4), you will realize that the sensations are slipping away. Almost becoming more *diffused*. The ball of energy behind each one is dissipating.  
If not - gently go back to #1. The key is resistance - the thoughts, imagery, labelling that is trying to *push away* the feeling of discomfort.

Take a moment to ask for help.

Don‚Äôt believe in ‚ÄòGod‚Äô? That‚Äôs okay. How about *a higher power of our understanding?*

Could you conceive of a Power greater than ourselves? Just the way *you*understand it.

If yes - direct this prayer to your Higher Power.

The Serenity Prayer

    God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,  courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.   

What‚Äôs the purpose of repeating this Serenity prayer, you ask? No reason I can offer other than that it works. It just does :)

I do hope it helped you.

\*This is a technique described in *Letting Go,* one of my favourite books by Dr. David R. Hawkins. Some of you might know it as the Sedona releasing method. It‚Äôs easy, free, devoid of any religious or sectarian woowoo.

After Doc, I like to repeat:  
*Gloria in Exelcis Dio.*  
That means, all glory (and credit) be to God.

102,"Me (23m) and my girlfriend (21f) of 1 year broke up today after 2 stressful months.. Things changed in a blink when my girlfriend decided to become religious and everything there on started to go down hill. I supported her in her new found path and thought it wouldn't affect as much... But it did affect very hard, complete dynamics of our relationship changed and everything lead to increasing distance between us. 



Today I initiated the break up but soon lost my cool and acted needy, desperate and unsure of what I was doing (which obviously affects my dignity) while she remained calm and collected. 


Though we broke up on good terms and mutual understanding... The anxiety since is killing me. I can't stop thinking about it and it's affecting my work. I can't stabilize my thoughts and the fact that she won't be part of my life anymore is absolutely killing me. I love her a lot but there ain't no future for us.

108,"So, yeah... I have always had self-worth issues due to being bullied in elementary and my first technical school. I got called names, which lead into me getting into fights and having temper issues that, TBH, i'm not sure i've fully gotten over even to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bisexual man, and almost thirty. To this day i've never had sex or even gotten to go on  a date.  Not sure i'd even know how to react if someone agreed to go even on a single date with me.  I'm a gods damned virgin despite turning 30 come early next year. I'm, as much as i hate to admit it, fat. I haven't stepped on a scale in years, so i don't know how much i weight, but probably over a hundred kilos. Because of the bullying, i became somewhat anti-social and didn't really get out of my shell until around 2010, when i was in my second vocational school after dropping out of the first one. There i met a girl in my class on whom i developed a crush on... Sadly she wanted to remain just friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like i would get judged by most people for my interests, because i'm a nerd or a geek (my language only has a word that's seemingly derived from nerd, so i'm not sure what the difference between the two is, if any...) who loves games and anime. I'm even studying at a university to become a game programmer, though it's not going so well. There are subjects that just either go over my head, or have a teacher who teaches in a way that makes it hard for me to learn. I would say that they suck, but apart from maybe one, they're actually competent enough that most others seem to have less trouble than me.

I don't consider myself stupid at all, i'd even say i can be pretty smart and clever at times, but i have had trouble with the math classes here, partly because the teacher seems to teach as if we all went to college... I had no idea what the fuck a matrix is (apart from the movies), and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have trouble learning C++ because it's an ancient language that does some seemingly stupid stuff and IMO has basically no place in modern computer science apart from a history lesson. Except that people still insist on using it, despite C# doing almost everything better. I don't understand what reason there is for UnReal Engine to use C++...

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for rambling, this is written as it flows through my brain and onto the keyboard...

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i have trouble connecting fully with even other nerds, because i keep a few things about myself close to my chest and won't talk about. I have a diaper fetish. Nobody but my partner really needs to know about that. But, I am also attracted to prepubescent kids... I would never do anything to them, but as you can imagine, that is not something one can go saying all willynilly, even here in the north. There are people who would lynch me for just saying that some kid is cute, especially if i said it with the wrong tone. Like i said, i would never do anything to them, i use hentai to keep myself satisfied when it comes to such matters.

&amp;#x200B;

And i also have issues when it comes to penis size. I feel that my dick is quite small and i'm worried if i can ever satisfy anyone with it.

Again, this is a ramble, because my thoughts are quite scattered and unfocused, and i apologize for it.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these issues compound together and make me at times feel worthless and just today my lack of progress in our project at the uni made me have a mental breakdown where i felt worthless and unwanted. Also, i at times want to discuss things about porn with others, such as tastes in guys and gals, what kind of porn do the enjoy watching etc. Is that weird to want? 

&amp;#x200B;

I did attempt suicide by jumping off of a bridge back when i was on 8th or 9th grade... Something just clicked about not being wanted and being a burden. I at times still have slightly suicidal thoughts, like today i wished that the earth would just swallow me to stop me from being a stupid, shity burden on others.

I'm also kinda terrible at finances, partly because i have slight memory issues, where i won't remember certain details, or have to concentrate to remember them. This causes me to lose track of how much money i have spent for example... I can, for the most part, pay my bills on time, but then at times i have little money left for foods etc. And i don't have much to spend on frivolous things like buying coffee at uni etc. But i still do it because i'm a caffeine addict that needs his coffee.

I've been always considering suicide because i want to change but i really don't have the willpower because what's written in the past stays as the past. I don't even know if i could get into a good college and i really don't want to have to resort to offing myself. I've been dealing with both anxiety and depression but all i get is the oh so common ""just do it"" and i don't know how.

It's as if even i'm not supposed to or am even allowed to have problems because i'm in a normal sized house and can eat 4 square meals a day because my sister tells me that she doesn't have these issues that i do. Is it just the competitive nature of our culture here? My mental health has been spiralling down rapidly and i don't want it to end up with me being in the news as part of the obituaries.

113,"I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but please, if anyone can read through and tell me if any of this sounds like anything, please. 

Here's the thing - this isn't depersonalisation-derealisation. I don't think so, anyway. I don't feel like an outside observer, I don't have depression, I don't even feel particularly sad or empty. I have hobbies and interests and things I enjoy, and my life feels very much real. 

I just don't think I'm a human. 

Human beings are complicated - they experience good and bad things. They have hobbies and interests, but they have other things, too. They have stories to tell, they have achievements and they have trauma, they have talents and weaknesses, they have overcome hardship and faced failure. That's a human. And a human's purpose is to just live through those experiences and make the best of their lives. 

I'm simple - I've never experienced anything particularly bad nor particularly good. I have hobbies and interests, but that's pretty much all. Any interesting story I have to tell usually revolves around others, and I'm just a side character. I've never achieved anything and I've never gone through anything traumatic. I don't have any talents but I don't have any debilitating weaknesses. I have never endured anything. 

I'm not a human. And my purpose is to help humans, listen to them, support them, and then let them leave when they please. 

I started feeling this way when, on two separate occasions, a friend group I was in fell apart because of issues people had with my fiance. For reasons I won't get into, people started hating him, but they constantly texted him, discussed things with him, and finally messaged him to say goodbye. 

Meanwhile through all of this, every single one of them just... Stopped talking to me. No explanation, no goodbye, not a word. If I didn't have my fiance telling me things I wouldn't even have known anything was going on. 

...On two separate occasions. 10 different people. 

There's no way 10 people can just abandon another human without a second thought right? I mean they couldn't even do that with my fiance who they were angry at, let alone someone who didn't really do anything to them. 

So I have to just not be a human. 

Humans are interesting, complicated, and have good and bad aspects. 

I am boring, simple, and completely and utterly neutral. 

And I don't know what this is, but please, if anyone knows what could be making me feel this way, please tell me.",04Nov2020,1

There are a few subjects on my college schedule that I haven't participated in since the beginning of the year (started in October).

The problem arises with my evening pills - they keep me asleep well over my classes and I miss them every single time. Then when I wake up, there's major anxiety and shame and all kinds of self loathing stories/thoughts going through my mind. And then it just comes down to ""let's just k*ll ourselves, that way you will have an excuse for not coming"", and there's also the struggle of me being raised to do things no matter how I'm feeling, and cause of my poor decisions and pills, I can't do that, cause I am not conscious enough to get up EVEN if I hear the alarm at the right time. Some professors have not seen my face yet since the start of the year. I feel ashamed, like a complete failure and a disgrace. I don't know how to tell them my mental state has been so horrific I can't think normally and I can't do the tasks and homeworks, while at the same time thinking I will fail my senior year and fall behind and let down everybody, most importantly myself.

126,"Hi! 

I‚Äôm glad to have a found a subreddit for those of us suffering from mental health issues. 

I‚Äôd like to share some of my experiences and would appreciate if those who can relate can share some insights/useful information. 

From the past 10 years, I‚Äôve failed to maintain a routine - be it a sleep schedule, eating habits, or the like. First, it was an ‚Äúact of rebellion‚Äù from an angsty team who was having family issues, and believed that he should be able to control how he spends his time, but now it has become a habit and I don‚Äôt really have the energy to change it. 

I have been on antidepressants from the past three years. I started off with Sensival and became a bit too addicted to it. The doctor had prescribed a 75 mg dose, and I couldn‚Äôt sleep without it; this meant that I used to keep myself awake for a couple days and then knock myself out to sleep for 15 hours. 

I changed my psychiatrist, and the new one changed the medications to Seradep and Alprazolam. It went good for a while, but I feel like I‚Äôm still ‚Äútrapped‚Äù in a really terrible place. 

To help you understand my issues, I‚Äôll try to write a summary which may prove to be helpful. 

I‚Äôm currently 23, and have social anxiety from as long as I can remember (maybe because I stutter). I can‚Äôt stand large gatherings as I feel I‚Äôm being watched and judged for each of my move. I don‚Äôt post regularly on social media or the like because then again, you‚Äôre being judged on your posts. I can‚Äôt connect with many people, and let them dictate the terms of our bond - at least people can call me a good listener - which means that I feel unsatisfied with most of those around me. 

I changed colleges a couple years back, so I‚Äôm still enrolled in an undergraduate program, but I never really joined classes or kept the required attendance. Still, at least I was going to my college a couple days a week. After lockdown, the classes turned online and I have literally stopped taking them; they happen in the morning, and just before they start I‚Äôm sound asleep. 

I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of stuff I want to do: I want to read novels again, I want to write, I want to learn new programming languages, I want to dive into philosophy, I want to understand human cultures and values, I want to create art, and most importantly I want to be the person I wanted to be! 

However, all I end up doing these days is kill time, and wait for my brain to go to sleep again. I keep myself glued to my phone - scrolling through the different social apps, browsing YouTube, watching stories - waiting for myself to gain a iota of energy or motivation to start doing stuff. 

I have a strong support system, but I cannot open up to my friends or family about my issues. They think I‚Äôll be able to handle it myself but I am just so frustrated! I keep seeing the posts of my school batch mates, and people I know, ‚Äúenjoying‚Äù life and I can‚Äôt help but feel flustered. Why am I not living the life I want to? 

Although I‚Äôm 23, I still cannot see myself as an adult. It‚Äôs almost as if time never moved for me, and I‚Äôm still there in my teenage years. The responsibilities, and expectations from those around me are increasing. And I cannot fault them for that. People are grown-ass in this age, but then I look at myself and I just don‚Äôt know how to proceed with my life! 

I would like to know if there are others in this community who can relate to the mindset I‚Äôm currently in, and can offer some solid advice over how I can grow out of this phase. Please don‚Äôt recommend another psychiatrist because there ain‚Äôt many qualified psychiatrists in my country.",04Nov2020,1
127,"Hey guys, 2 months back I had my first panic attack, which transformed into a full day of panic attacks and anxiety which landed me in the hospital as I thought I was dying. The following weeks I had some dissociation symptoms from this traumatic event. I¬¥m finally feeling like myself more and more again. All I got left is my memory of what happened to me and it¬¥s kind of crippling me to move forward. 

However what¬¥s bothering me is that everytime I watch a movie for example I can¬¥t fully concentrate on it as I¬¥m constantly analyzing my attention span and think about how I can¬¥t let go of what happened and in reality, this is the thing, that is holding me back to pay attention. Same when I¬¥m with friends. I feel good whenever I¬¥m around them and can share some really nice moments and emotions with them but most of the time my head goes: ""Why can¬¥t you let go?"", ""Get out of you head"", ""I just want to forget what has happened to feel like I¬¥m in the moment again"". But these thoughts are the only thing keeping me away from being in the moment, you know? Sounds very paradox, but I thought maybe you could understand what I¬¥m saying. 

I feel kind of trapped in my head and in a constant loop of thoughts but the loop¬¥s only content is that I am feeling trapped in a loop of thought and can¬¥t be in the moment and like I said these thoughts are the only thing that keep me from being in the moment. Like I can¬¥t let my thoughts just be there as before but kind of want to take control of them, even tho whenever I do it, my thoughts turn against me and push me further away from the moment. 

I guess my biggest problem is just that I want to make myself forget about all of these things, which is not possible, as I can‚Äòt forget about it as long as I‚Äòm still thinking about it haha. 

I also have that weird feeling that I can‚Äòt ever get fully over it as everything in my life will constantly remind you of all of these things. Like I wanna move on but can‚Äòt because once I was in this overthinking state for a few months, everything around me or just songs, movies and everything I once loved got connected to all of these feelings and thoughts and they will constantly remind me of my past. All of this is such a weird experience really.

I hope you got any idea of what I¬¥m saying. I know probably all of this sounds not so bad, but it‚Äòs really fucking me up. I feel like I‚Äòm so dumb because of this as I can‚Äòt get out of my head and think about anything external really and I‚Äòm afraid that this will keep me from going to university or getting a good job later on as I just can‚Äòt pay attention. It‚Äòs really crippling me and making me depressed from time to time. Not to sound arrogant, but I always was a smart boy before this and now I‚Äòm so afraid that I won‚Äòt be able to use my abilities for good as I‚Äòm trapped in my head forever.

I just wanna go back to the person I was 2 months ago, I wasn‚Äòt even like a super happy person or anything like that but at least I didn‚Äòt feel so lost in my head and not everyday felt the same, with the same thoughts going through my head day in and day out. I feel so dumb for knowing what my problem is but just not being able to let go. 

Do you have any tips for me on how to overcome this? Or did anyone of you had a similar situation going on? 

Anyway, have a good day, people. I wish you the best :)",04Nov2020,1

I could use some help and advice.  I've long been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, in addition to ADD/ADHD, and have been taking medications to help with them, and I've been able to manage them.

I don't even know why they need a prescription. You can't abuse a pill that does almost nothing any more than OTC pain killers. These ""Antidepressants"" seem like all they do is make you sleepy, lose or gain weight, and make your libido disappear. If that's the intended purpose, don't call them antidepressants.

Zoloft is a libido killer. Mirtazapine and trazodone are sleep aids. Seroquel is a sleep aid and weight gainer. Lithium, buspar, latuda and wellbutrin don't do anything. None of them are antidepressants.

So, last friday on the 30th I went over to my boyfriend's house. I got there at 2 pm, I think at 3 pm his mom brought us pizza. After we ate I gave him a hand job, he cleaned up with some paper towels and I went to wash my hands. I don't remember but I think between the cuddling I touched him some more but he didn't cum. In the evening, I adjusted my panties and the back of my hand touched the inside fabric of the panty? I didn't touch my crotch directly but the fabric I touched touched it. I know it sounds a bit dumb to be freaking out about something so small, especially since on friday I had a low chance of pregnancy according to Flo. This morning I got my period,and I was surprised since it was supposed to start on this Sunday. I started having cramps like usual before a period for me and obviously I started bleeding. I put on a pad and had really bad cramps for a few hours. I changed my pad and the blood was brown. It's not that unusual for it to be brown at the start I think?its not that unusual for it to be brown at the start I think? It's just the first day of my period and so far nothing too irregular. I've also had pms the days after that friday. I also noticed that whenever I thought about how I could be pregnant I started feeling sick and when I moved on and calmed down I was okay. There are also no early pregnancy signs. I think its too early to tell, since I heard about the spotting that happens but I just want to know if there is a chance I'm pregnant? I've read sperm survives on the skin max 30 minutes and only if it's still wet I think? And I'm pretty sure when I adjusted my panties my hand was dry and 30 minutes had passed since I touched him.

I really like the taste of coffee, whether it‚Äôs just a cup of cold brew or more involved drinks. I have definitely cut my consumption down by A LOT, mostly because when I was younger I tended to opt for more sugar-y add-in‚Äôs and I also had frequent issues with headaches/ insomnia and my pediatrician said the acid and caffeine weren‚Äôt helping the situation. 

I‚Äôve recently gotten back into drinking it, but I still limit how much I consume. It‚Äôs not an everyday thing, like maybe once or twice a week max and definitely no more than 16oz in a day and for the most part this is fine. However I find that when I drink coffee after I haven‚Äôt slept well, on an empty stomach, or anytime past the morning (so like any time after 12pm), I have really bad intrusive thoughts I guess? I feel really stressed out, and thoughts about how I want to kms and die won‚Äôt stop surfacing for me. I have no idea why this happening and I just wanted to ask if this is normal and if other people experience the same thing. I have tried drinking decaf when I want coffee later in the day, but it seems to have the same negative affect which I don‚Äôt entirely understand as I thought the caffeine might be triggering this for me.

But I am not crying anymore. I dont have fights with my husband. For the first time in many many years I havent fantasized about suicide for almost a week. 

It seems like everything is how its supposed to be now. Our son is in progress, and my husband is improving and trying to be a better father and husband. 

But I feel something is wrong and I cant put it in words without feeling incredibly spoiled and selfish.",04Nov2020,1
140,"So, last friday on the 30th I went over to my boyfriend's house. I got there at 2 pm, I think at 3 pm his mom brought us pizza. After we ate I gave him a hand job, he cleaned up with some paper towels and I went to wash my hands. I don't remember but I think between the cuddling I touched him some more but he didn't cum. In the evening, I adjusted my panties and the back of my hand touched the inside fabric of the panty? I didn't touch my crotch directly but the fabric I touched touched it. I know it sounds a bit dumb to be freaking out about something so small, especially since on friday I had a low chance of pregnancy according to Flo. This morning I got my period,and I was surprised since it was supposed to start on this Sunday. I started having cramps like usual before a period for me and obviously I started bleeding. I put on a pad and had really bad cramps for a few hours. I changed my pad and the blood was brown. It's not that unusual for it to be brown at the start I think?its not that unusual for it to be brown at the start I think? It's just the first day of my period and so far nothing too irregular. I've also had pms the days after that friday. I also noticed that whenever I thought about how I could be pregnant I started feeling sick and when I moved on and calmed down I was okay. There are also no early pregnancy signs. I think its too early to tell, since I heard about the spotting that happens but I just want to know if there is a chance I'm pregnant? I've read sperm survives on the skin max 30 minutes and only if it's still wet I think? And I'm pretty sure when I adjusted my panties my hand was dry and 30 minutes had passed since I touched him. My friends told me it was okay but I just want to be extra sure? Thank you for reading",04Nov2020,1
141,"24 year old female, in law school, currently living with my parents because covid. I have ADHD. In September my therapist and psych thought I was showing symptoms of bi-polar. They said they didn't want to diagnose me immediately and put me on zoloft and wellbutrin --&gt; worst week of my life, went into a manic episode. Called a new psych and she told me that she did not understand why I was taking zoloft and wellbutrin and that ""no wonder I was feeling awful on it."" 

New psych diagnoses me with (ADHD obviously), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. I call two different doctors to get second opinions and they agree with this new psych. 

New psych prescribes me prozac 20 mg. On day 17 we have a conference and she said she wants to put me on buspirone. so I start taking prozac and buspirone (twice daily). 

On Monday, I got into an argument with my family because I said ""once i get my JD, I don't think I would take my husband's name."" And then we had an argument about that and also about money. 

My dad said ""are you taking your medication? because if you are...it doesn't seem like its working. are you sure its working? you are so aggressive and angry. i dont think your meds are working."" 

And I said yes.

My dad says, ""well you're screwed up in the head."" 

Thank you dad. I didn't need to be reminded that I was screwed up in the head. 

After that comment, I went to my room and just cried. I kept saying I don't even know what my purpose is in life. I don't make anyone happy. If I died I would probably save my parents so much money. I've had so many people around me die from suicide but life seemed to just go on and it will go on if I'm not here either. 

I'm not quite sure what to do anymore. No one truly understands how I feel and even writing this right now, I'm not sure if others will relate too. I've never felt so lost and so confused. 

This morning, my father said "" i don't want you to take this the wrong way, but i have a friend who sits at the board of a hospital and i called him to see if he knows any psychiatrists and i want you to call this woman‚Ä¶‚Äù

So essentially he's asking me to go get a fifth opinion. I really feel crazy and any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",04Nov2020,1
142,"When I was 16 I dated this religious girl. It started off well we were able to kiss and hold hands etc. Soon enough we progressed to sexual stuff as well, but we never had full on intercourse. After about a year her religious side started coming up and she stopped wanting to do sexual stuff and stopped wanting to kiss and hold hands. I was okay with this for a few months but soon I grew tired of this and I told her that I‚Äôm going to break up because we are incompatible. This really stressed her out and she went a bit crazy and started cutting herself and threatened to kill herself if I leave. She was under the impression that I would stay with her like this forever until we got married and then we can start doing stuff again. I didn‚Äôt leave her because I genuinely felt like she would end her life so I stayed and I convinced myself that it‚Äôs all going to be okay, I lived like this for a year convincing myself that this is my new reality.

By the end of the year she had become even more religious and she explained to me how we can‚Äôt be dating as it is against her religion, but she still told me that she wants to get married to me one day so I shouldn‚Äôt go for other women when I go to uni. So I was technically single and wasn‚Äôt allowed to speak to or be with a girl. For obvious reasons I had become quite emotionally numb and didn‚Äôt have the same energy with her. I think she realised that I wasn‚Äôt the same person anymore and she started calling the relationship toxic etc and finally left me. I felt so free after this but I still felt off idk how to explain this feeling and idk if i can shake it off. I possibly developed an eating disorder along the way because I became really skinny I was eating like 1 fruit or 1 small meal per day and sleeping for around 14 hours.

It‚Äôs been 4 years now and I have been able to pick up some good habits. However, I feel like I can‚Äôt feel emotions freely anymore and I don‚Äôt even know how I feel most of the time. I‚Äôve lied to myself so much that I feel like I‚Äôm lost in this world. I have had one relationship after this and this was thanks to my friends encouraging me to pursue one and get over my fear of women but I couldn‚Äôt handle this one because I felt really stressed. I feel like there is imminent doom, like I have no reason to be stressed but it feels like something bad is going to happen, especially when things are going good with a girl. 

I understand that not all women are the same, for instance I still love my mum and she‚Äôs an amazing person. But I find it difficult to trust girls and to be open with them. I wish I could become the person I was before I met her she‚Äôs negatively skewed my idea of a relationship. This is all so stupid I really shouldn‚Äôt let one relationship control me like this and it makes me feel so dumb that it‚Äôs still effecting me.

143,"First off, thank you for this forum for simply existing.

TLDR: How did you guys get the courage to get help? I'm afraid of meds due to my job(s) and the stigma that comes with mental health issues.

I'm Gutz, and I would like to give a simple background to myself before I start with a few generic questions.

I'm a US military veteran who has been absolutely terrified of seeking mental health care. i joined the army back during the ""dont ask, dont tell"" era and I've suffered from depression, self image issues and self harm for the last 16 years...

I saw a psychiatrist ONCE over a year ago and I was sobbing for an hour after. Just, I hated it and the fact that I've always viewed this struggle as ""My shit, my problem"" and it was super hard for me to come to terms with me actually being there. In hindsight, I think I wasn't ready emotionally. I've never been the kind of guy to talk about my emotions or my traumas.

All of that being said, I think I'm ready to try again. But I'm still scared of actually going and opening up to someone face to face to get the help I need. How did you guys deal with this raw emotion and mental hurdles to simply go get help?

Secondly, I'm scared of medication... not the pills themselves but the stigma attached to them. Is it as bad as my mind is making it out to be or has there been a drastic change shift where getting help isnt demonized anymore?

Thank you for reading this",04Nov2020,1
144,"I have a follow-up with my doctor very soon, about something non-mental health related, and was wondering if I should bring up my anxiety to him? I wasn't sure how I should bring this subject up to someone lol.

It isn't about any new anxiety triggers exactly, it's more about that I've had a lot of anxiety for like 20 years, and I'd like to lessen it if I could (and hopefully without medication). I just never felt like it was severe enough to bring up. I don't get panic attacks, and I don't think I have depression. I'm a bundle of nerves most of the time though, and I worry a lot, and I feel like it makes me irritable/unhappy, even when I should be happy and relaxed, like on the weekends or on vacation.

145,"i‚Äôm 14 years old by the way. firstly, my boyfriend of over 1 year broke up with me two days ago. i was extremely close with him and dependent on him for my happiness. i told him literally everything, and he was the reason why i did things. he broke up with me because my mental health was so bad, and so was his. i‚Äôm too dependent on him, it was becoming extreme. he told me that after we both get better, and if i can start to love myself then maybe we can get back together one day. 

i have OCD very badly. i take medication for it and i have a therapist but it doesn‚Äôt really do anything. i had ROCD pretty often (relationship focused) while i was in the relationship, and it hasn‚Äôt gone away yet. i was constantly worried that i was cheating and had to confess all these stupid little things to my boyfriend constantly. i was in constant fear of him getting angry with me and breaking up with me. although he wasn‚Äôt angry whenever it happened it still feels like my biggest fear has come to life.

Everyone is telling me to work on finding myself and loving myself. they‚Äôre telling me that time will heal it. i understand that but right now it hurts so bad. i literally have lost all motivation for anything. i haven‚Äôt showered in days, i‚Äôve only eaten light snacks and i‚Äôve barley left my bed. i have to be talking to friends almost constantly. waking up is the worst feeling ever. i hate trying to sleep because i keep thinking about him and feeling the pain. it feels like my chest and stomach are constantly getting stabbed by a knife. my mom offered to take me to anywhere that i wanted to go that‚Äôs close by, normally i enjoy getting out of the house but i said no. the thought of doing anything feels empty and pointless. i have cried many times since it happened but most of the time it feels like i can‚Äôt cry. when he first broke up with me i had a meltdown and kept repeating over and over that i don‚Äôt want to live anymore, and that i‚Äôm nothing. i already regret that so much. he told me i was manipulating him.

He‚Äôs bad off too, and it hurts me. We have texted a couple times just to check up on each other. He‚Äôs worried i‚Äôm going to hurt myself. I have been trying really hard to be positive about it, and he said he‚Äôs proud of me. He told me I was being strong. He is doing just as bad as I am with this and it makes me feel so awful to think about. i don‚Äôt want him to cry or feel this bad. i don‚Äôt understand because i thought both of us were starting to get better and then he went and did this. 

I love him so much. yesterday my friends said I wasn‚Äôt taking his feelings into account but i don‚Äôt understand because it feels like i am. my dependency on him was and is a serious problem. I had a problem where i saw him as some type of perfect person who can never do wrong and I still do. what‚Äôs wrong with me? I just wanted to be in a normal and happy relationship with him. that‚Äôs all i want. it‚Äôs so hard to get through everyday now. it feels like everything good has been drained from me. i miss him so much. i miss when everything was normal.",04Nov2020,1
146,"It‚Äôs because of the biases and negative mindset towards mental illness.

People with mental illness are described as toxic, attention seekers, selfish, don‚Äôt contribute enough in the relationship, clingy, abusive etc. 


A lot of people don‚Äôt even understand how the illnesses even work and lack any empathy whatsoever or the empathy they have is skin deep and or fake...but they‚Äôve formed their biases because of what they‚Äôve watched/been told or read or because of their ‚Äúterrible exes‚Äù behavior when in fact it was their bad character not their illness that caused the problems...mental illness is viewed as a character flaw that needs to be 100% corrected instead of an actual illness...I‚Äôm expected to ‚Äúhave it together‚Äù all the time...maybe I can have ‚Äúa moment‚Äù but it better be short and I better be back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ASAP or I‚Äôll become toxic. It‚Äôs like a movement that‚Äôs painting mentally ill people as ill suited even dangerous partners unless their illness is cured or ‚Äúunder control‚Äù enough that it‚Äôs not even noticeable. We are expected to be there for our parter on top of having our illness but things can‚Äôt be reciprocated less we become ‚Äútoxic‚Äù. We are the problem, we have to fix ourselves *on our own* which is funny because at the same time we are told not to bottle things up and talk and that we ‚Äúare not alone‚Äù. 

People lose interest or run for the hills if someone says ‚ÄúI have *insert mental illness*.‚Äù And the few that give you a chance leave or give you an ultimatum to ‚Äúget better‚Äù they‚Äôll leave.


I really believe it‚Äôll be better for my health if I stay single, I already have to deal with my own personal onslaught of negative comments...hearing it from someone I love the most in life will kill me...or make me irreversibly bitter.

147,"I've been seeing a therapist since I got sober almost 4 years ago.  It wasn't up until the past 6 months that I've been able to put together this theory.  When I have something to look forward to in the near future I get a rush of happiness thinking about it.  This can range from a project I'm enjoying working on at work, to an activity planned with my kids for the weekend, to the dinner I'm going to enjoy later in the night, a new episode of my favorite podcast, or even an Amazon package I'm expecting to arrive in the next couple days.

I find myself depending on finding these happy things to look forward to.  One thing that commonly happens is if I don't have planned activities or work around the house planned out the weekends I can get kinda snippy with my wife.  We have two kids under 4 so that's a big part of our weekend is keeping them busy and always making sure someone has eyes on the youngest 1.5yr).  

One thing I've been trying to improve since getting sober is my mental health.  Part of that revolves around mindfulness and meditation.  It's something I've started a few times but stopped after a few weeks. Anyways, I know a big part of mindfulness is being present.  And I'm worried about that because I get so happy and energetic when I have something looking forward to that it goes against the principles of mindfulness.  And it makes me think what I'm doing might be a bad thing?

Is this a thing?! I'm just wondering if anyone else has heard of this or experienced it.  I brought it up to my therapist but he didn't have much to speak on about it.  I'm not drinking a bottle of vodka a day or snorting Adderall anymore, but could this be a bad thing I'm doing?  I'm not sure if it's healthy.

Tnr: me and my sister shared the same dream!

So I fell asleep as my sleep schedule is off track. My dream that I had was terrifying. I was fine and then something happened in my dream. I am normally a very detailed and vivid dreamer. What happened I dont remember. It was blurred out. But whatever happened it destroyed me. I began to refuse to eat and cry for hours on end repeating ""please....please just end me. let me die"". While saying this I am literally close or was having a mental break down. It didn't matter where I was I was sobbing and pleading for my life to be taken. I became numb in my dream and a feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. I ended the dream by killing myself. Dreadful to say the least.
It was a haunting dream that ruined my mood for the day. My sister texted me in the middle of the night and said ""please get mental help. Are you okay?"" I asked her what she meant and she said that she fell asleep that night and in her dream I was begging HER to take my life. In my dream I was just begging everyone. She said I couldn't stop crying and looked very sick. She said at the end of the dream I killed myself and she woke up. She said that she told mom and because I had turned my dream phone off, they couldn't find me in my dream.

157,"Should I share about my mental breakdown during my exit interview?

TLDR: Broke down mentally because of work. Sent in my resignation letter a few days later, not mentioning my mental breakdown. Have an exit interview next week, wanting to find out more as to why I‚Äôm quitting. Should I bring up my incident?

I work in a customer service role at a firm that does e-commerce and traditional retail business. I recently tendered my resignation because I was burnt out from my job. 

The situation is that I have been in a customer service role since June; I inherited a large problem (many unanswered customer emails) because my predecessor left without a proper handover. This was also because my then-manager decided it was not necessary for my predecessor to serve a notice period and basically she left in 2 days after she tendered. 

Fresh into the role, I was a little hopeful I could change things and battle the horde of customer emails. However one month into my new role, my manager announced her resignation too. This really fucked up the morale within my team because we were all barely coping with the swarming number of customer enquires and our boss decided to uproot herself. 

When she left, upper management failed to find a replacement until 6 weeks later. My colleagues and myself were left to fend customer enquires and battle for cooperation from other departments all by ourselves with no one to support us. The problem snowballed especially badly for me.

Our new boss only came in mid October but the damage has been done. One teammate sent in her resignation a week after that because she was so burnt out and feeling beaten up from internal and external stakeholders.
 
Two weeks later I broke down mentally. I was suicidal one night after a day of work and bawled myself to sleep. The next morning I woke up and I started crying uncontrollably again. I stay with my parents and they had to intervene because I couldn‚Äôt stop crying and I was still feeling suicidal. Some context: I‚Äôm seeing a counselor, but I‚Äôm not diagnosed with depression.

I eventually sent in my resignation letter a few days later. However I was a bit anxious about it as I didn‚Äôt want to bring up my mental break down. I cited reasons like I didn‚Äôt want to continue customer service as a profession and I didn‚Äôt think my personality was a good fit for the role. She didn‚Äôt really buy it but respected my decision. The thing is, next week I have an exit interview with my boss and my HR because they want to go deeper as to why I‚Äôm quitting.

Every time they want to talk I get this feeling of spite towards them, I want to ignore them so they forget about me and I can die alone without anyone being hurt, but then if they do ignore me I also get pissed because I think I mean nothing to them and they only want to talk when they need me.

I have a little voice in my head that keeps maliciously whispering conspiracy theories against everyone I have ever known and everyone who is currently in my life, I know that everything it says is not true but I can't help but believe it strongly.

I'm exhausted. Every day is a constant back and forth between hating and adoring somebody, I feel horrific because I know everyone hates me and I'm disgusting, I have dark thoughts that I should be locked up for.

I feel like a toxic sludge of death that's shaped like a human, I don't feel like I belong anywhere, every day is a blur and it all blends together, nothing feels real anymore.

I tried forcing myself to morph my personality to be more aggressive, rude and overall unlikable, but it only made me feel worse because I'm not the type of person to be unreasonably rude towards someone even if I don't feel good about them inside.
My hope was that if I channeled all my dark thoughts and feelings into anger I would be able to let out all the pressure, like punching a hole in a pressure cooker, but this has only lead to more people not liking me and me becoming more lonely.

161,"Like 2-3 months ago I made a post on this subreddit about how I just can't deal with anything anymore and a lot of people wrote like ""its gonna get better"". But guess what, it doesn't, at least not for me.

I was never diagnosed, but I just know I struggle with depression and anxiety as well as other mental disorders. I wasn't diagnosed, firstly because I don't like doctors and therapists(I guess because of anxiety) and secondly because my mother never believed in this and always tough it was just a phase. I also think I should mention my parents are split, I live with strict mother and we have a lot of financial issues. Just to clarify I'm 17 M, so no one even tried to understand my depression as it is a ""girl thingy"". Any act of attention seeking or reaching out and speaking about my problem is considered pu$$y like.

I lost a lot of friend due to my depression, make a lot of mistakes because I can't think straight and make the right decisions when depressed or anxious. I still regret leaving my girlfriend 7-8 months ago just because I was sad and didn't know what to do. She helped me a lot and one of the main problems is that I don't have her in my life anymore.

Now, when I wrote a post about how I can't do it anymore, it was when it all started. My mental health has gotten so much better after that mainly because I started hanging out a lot more and found people similar to me. We formed like a little gang. One of the things that connected us was the financial issues most of us had. To have a better time we started shoplifting tobacco, alcohol, food, energy drinks or just stuff to sell and make money to actually buy anything.

I know it's gross, bad and all that negative descriptions but try to understand my situation. At the time it made me happier in a way. So a few weeks ago I got caught and a big cash penalty or prison time is awaiting me. I stopped stealing and I'm not planning on stealing ever again, I learned my lesson. I'm fairly good student. I'm about to enter faculty, one of the best in my country so I'm working on bettering my self but this is where the real problem begins. 

I need help, real help. The only people that can help me are my mentally abusive mother and her boyfriend. I now have to act by her rules and that is mentally destroying me. She leaves town for a few days when she has to work and she is taking me with her now because ""she cant leave me alone"". I'm not allowed to leave the house. I can't talk to my previous friends. I get even fewer money than before.

I'm not mad at her, I deserve the punishment but I can't stand myself anymore. On top of my depression this punishment made me feel even more miserable. I've got the time to overthink every little thing I did in the past few months. I mean the things aren't even that bad but I just overthink it too much. 

I feel so alone, to the point where letting myself think is a punishment so I have to keep myself busy with video games or music. I don't have anybody to talk to. I have friends but I don't feel like they are interested. The exact quote to describe this feeling is from BoJack Horseman: ""Everybody loves you, but nobody likes you""

I want someone to help me mentally, but I can't reach out to anyone. U can even read in this post how confusing I am, irl its even more confusing I can't even describe my problem to anyone. Not to mention how nervous I get when talking about my problems. I sometimes find myself talking to myself in third person, I guess it's because I want someone to talk about me that way, I want someone to notice I'm hurting. If I want that why don't I get that? I can't, I always think my problems don't matter and everyone has bigger problems and I just overthink. Maybe that is the real problem after all.

167,"I (26 M) have been going to therapy on and off since I was in high school. I found a facility and therapist a couple of years ago that I have been regularly going to ever since. 

I have been working with my therapist pretty consistently (2-3 times a month) since May and I feel that I have made really good progress. However, I‚Äôm currently working a difficult graveyard schedule and have had a hard time scheduling consistent appointments with him, so now, I‚Äôm only scheduling appointments when I feel I really need to. I‚Äôm also paying out of pocket and it‚Äôs becoming difficult to afford consistent sessions. 

I recently scheduled an appointment with him and half of our conversation was regarding scheduling. He seemed a bit annoyed that I have been inconsistent with my sessions lately and stated he would really only prefer to work with his patients weekly in chunks of 8-12 weeks. 

Am I being a ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúannoying‚Äù patient?

The vibe of the conversation was not very friendly and I felt like a major inconvenience. He had never hinted that scheduling was becoming an issue until now, and I have been very open with him about my personal life and erratic work schedule. I almost feel uncomfortable continuing treatment with him since I will not have a consistent schedule in the near future.

I was doing fine at the beginning of the semester but I feel like I'm spiraling downward into this hole that keeps growing deeper and deeper.

After studying my ass off and getting failing grades, I've lost my motivation to even try at this point. For one one of my classes, the average score for our midterm was a 50%, I fell below it. It feels like the university system is working against me at preparing me to take these exams. I feel like a failure.

I know that education is important and I am so close to finally getting my bachelor's but I'm questioning is it really worth the tradeoff of feeling this terrible about myself?

There's always something coming up and something to prepare for all while juggling full time classes.

A series that talks about the importance of raising awareness for mental health and invisible disabilities. We decided it was best to get this out there now, as after all, the coronavirus pandemic isn‚Äôt the only pandemic that‚Äôs going on.

Our first video discusses chronic illnesses, mental health issues, the coronavirus pandemic, lockdown and discrimination in the industry. ‚ÄôJust Checking In‚Äô is a helping hand as such and something that will hopefully raise more awareness for these conditions. We want this new segment to be something that gives artists in the industry who suffer with mental health problems and disabilities that platform that they deserve. We are human at the end of the day, and you can do anything if you put your mind to it. We‚Äôll be covering many different pointers including some advice videos, interviews from people in the industry and hearing their story, to a lot more too.

I just can't bring myself to actually DO something, even when I know that there will be consequences. This has gotten worse over the years.

Nowadays I can barely bring myself to play something more complicated like sudoku or same game on my notebook and can't even focus to watch anything longer. I can't even watch a 10 youtube video without having a second browser window open or playing something. I read news articles for two minutes before thinking screw it and return to wasting time doing essentially nothing. I can't remember the last time I read a news article completly. Even writing this post took me hours because I always stop after writing a few words (if at all) and then turn to something else. And I can already see how bad everything is phrased.

For the last two weeks I wasted nearly all my time going up and down in my room, thinking and getting angry about something until my shirt is completly soaked in sweat. Followed by panic attacks and devastating feelings of help- and worthlessness that makes me need to sit down and holding my head.

183,"Hello everyone, I hope all that are reading this are doing well with everything that is going on right now. I wanted to take some time to talk about my experience with meditation in hopes that it may inform others about it. 
I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety at the age of 13, and that diagnosis still holds true today (f18). 
I started investing time into meditation about a year or so ago and have seen myself benefit from it greatly. Meditation doesn‚Äôt have to be sitting cross-legged with your hands on your knees humming. While many people do that, you don‚Äôt have to. For me, I usually lay on my back. I also occasionally sit on my yoga mat. I then close my eyes and focus on my breathing. I take deep breaths to relax my body and slow down. When I meditate I either completely focus on my breathing or dedicate the time to understanding what I‚Äôm going through at the moment. I process what is going on in my life and how it makes me feel. I let myself feel my emotions, but not let them take me over because that time is dedicated to processing, not reliving. There are also many options of guided meditation videos on YouTube that are good if you‚Äôre just starting out and don‚Äôt really know what to do. 
After I started making meditation a priority in my life, I began to feel less anxious about what was to come, whatever it may be. I began to let myself live in the moment. I also began enjoying the little things in life and finding something to be happy about even on dark days. My depression usually worsens in the fall/winter time, but this year is different. I still have my days that suck, but I have a different perspective now.

He recently got an inheritance of ¬£100k from an aunt, which he is gifting most of to my sister to help her buy a house. I had to help with getting proof of the inheritance to the solicitor.

When I was on his banking page I felt strange about looking in too much detail - I'm 34 and still feel like the young one in the family and I felt I'd be prying. I was certain however that I saw one of the current accounts had ¬£800k in it.

This is waaaaay more money than my dad has ever told us that he has.

I didn't mention it then and there to him because as I said, I felt like I shouldn't really be looking at it.

After I drove home I messaged my mum (they live together), and said ""its quite likely that I must misread it, but was i correct?!""

She said absolutely not, maybe like ¬£8000 but not ¬£800k.

I feel like I actually went crazy - it was like a hallucination. Its not completely out of the realms of possibility, but it would change everything if he did have that amount. Firstly, he'd have kept it a secret (even from his wife) and secondly, he's forever of the mindset that we have no money and are poor.

Since I procrastinate so much, all the work I do is in the wee hours of the morning, often just a few hours before I have to leave the house for school.

193,"Hi Everyone!

This is my third year with better mental health. 

My whole life, at least as far as I can remember, was a cycle of anxiety and depression. It got worse when I had my first child; it was so bad that even the way I sat on the couch was as if I didn't want to take up space; it was as if something was chasing me, I was afraid of it (probably my own thoughts) but  I could never really relax, meditation and yoga have literally saved my life... that plus a healthy diet. 

Life is not perfect; I still have a burning urge to please everybody, sometimes I find myself walking around as if I was apologizing for my own existence and am working on it, but I feel like I am alive for the first time.  I love the zen/Buddhism approach to mental health, especially the emphasis on accepting everything about yourself and working towards change from a place of acceptance. That one concept has saved me from a whole cycle of guilt and shame.

Although the year has been hard on everyone, I am surprised at how calm I have handled it, mostly! (some days are awful). I have noticed it's the little things that make life meaningful, a nice mindful dinner, conversation, a nice walk outside, etc. And I have noticed candles also add a bit of inspiration to my surroundings. As I celebrate my third year of better mental health, I am launching a candle line inspired by the Zen concept of being one with nature and everyone else Aether.

As the years pass by and I grow older, I find it harder to hold my ground in this constant battle against my brain's negativity.

That may seem fine to some, but there were people with 6s, 7s and 8s. I‚Äôve lost motivation all over again. I don‚Äôt feel like I contribute anything, and that I‚Äôm just a failure. I feel like ripping my hair out half the time. It‚Äôs not helping my family believe I fake every fucking thing I tell them, but I hate having to look in the mirror, and know I‚Äôve failed. That I‚Äôm not good enough for anyone. No one else goes home to cry over this shit. I feel like I‚Äôm just overreacting, but but it‚Äôs making me feel like shit. It‚Äôs just another mistake in my life that I have to hold over my head even when I don‚Äôt want to. I think I‚Äôm like this because I don‚Äôt feel worthy of anything when I don‚Äôt do well, it makes every fucking thought multiply. If I do well, maybe for a second, I feel like a have a reason to live- that I have a future ahead of me, but then I can‚Äôt stay perfect. I‚Äôm just a fuck up with good luck that doesn‚Äôt last. Once again this is a fucking overreaction. It just so fucking stupid",04Nov2020,1
196,"i've gone to the doctors 3 or 4 times this year specifically asking about my symptoms that are most likely relating to depression but they keep shrugging it off as if it's just my anxiety causing my problems or they just don't tell me what my symptoms mean and go straight to trying to solve the problem. i'm too scared to ask the doctors myself if they can actually tell me what's wrong, let alone ask my mum. do doctors have to tell you what your symptoms mean or do i have to ask?",04Nov2020,1
197,"Back in April I decided to stop using instagram and Facebook, I also deleted my WhatsApp account. I am a small business owner so I have to post on Instagram sometimes regarding that, otherwise I keep my profile deactivated for weeks, and I never post anything personal. I was seriously addicted to showing off the highlights of my life and obsessively posting quotes or political crap and seeking constant validation.  I didn't even have the conscious awareness of how much it was feeding into my issues. (and didn't feel affected negatively by it at the time, even though I now look back and see how bad it was for me).

However.. once COVID started... Something in me snapped. I couldn't take the weight of the world anymore, social media became agonising and I realised I had to retreat inwards and seriously face myself once and for all. 

The change has been remarkable -  my anxiety is almost gone, I sleep much better, I read daily, I spend more time playing my piano, my concentration is better... It has even gone as far as strengthening my relationships and finally distancing from the ones that had become toxic for my wellbeing.

When I have a new business launch, I have to post on IG, I feel like I have to, but I always find it stressful and addictive and end up feeling overwhelmed.. When I don't use social media I am present, relaxed and self assured. I can't find a way to balance it out... it's all or nothing. And I am seriously starting to wonder if that is even a problem? Why should I make space for something that makes me feel shit, and why do I need to try and train myself to be more resilient to something that is not essential?

I have now reached the point where I am willing to take a positive risk of not promoting my business on Instagram because I have realised my happiness and health is so much more important.

198,"**If this is not the appropriate place to post this, my apologies and please tell me if there is a subreddit where I can talk about this habit/issue. Thank you!**

I really enjoy giving to people, usually small gifts or treats. It's a habit I've had since forever. When I was in school I was known as 'that girl that gives candy on every special day.' I just get a strong satisfying feeling when a person lights up after I give them something, and I loved when it became such a regular thing that everyone in class got excited whenever it was a holiday, because they know that I have something to hand out to them. It was wonderful. It went on through high school as well, giving things to students, teachers, and even security. I also hooked up my neighbors all the time.

Once I started becoming independent and using my own money, I realized that my love for giving was pretty damn strong. I don't know why I was still buying things for everyone around me, even when money was tight. I would sometimes give to homeless people on the streets as well, but one time a man grabbed me really tightly after I gave him a couple of bucks and he refused to let go of me until I began to shout so that others could hear me. I've given money to people who looked miserable on the street many times, and it was only then that I realized just how stupid that is to do. I don't give to the homeless anymore unless I'm at an actual shelter.

So it's 2020, the company I work for is struggling, and the *holidays are here.* I want so badly to go full Santa and buy so much for friends family and co-workers, but my future is uncertain and I know that I should keep my money close. But the temptation is so strong. Finally I said to myself, ""This is not healthy.""

I don't know why giving is so addictive for me. 'Seeking validation' is a reason I've heard before, but I don't know. My family was a bit lower class growing up, but it's not like I feel I've been deprived of anything when I was younger. Seeing people happy because of what I give them, especially if they were in a bad mood beforehand, is an amazing feeling, but I wouldn't call myself selfless.

I don't know what I'm asking for in this thread. It's mostly venting, but I'd also like to hear your thoughts if you have any. Thank you so much for reading!",04Nov2020,1
199,"I'm going to see my doctor soon to ask him about being tested. I'm a sophomore in college and life has always been extra hard. I am and have always been the last one to finish a test or else I'd stay after class. I never finished the in class readings bc I just couldn't focus and I'd end up reading the same sentence over and over without getting it. I am really good at remembering events, but as far as trying to go to class I'll forget my whole laptop or my mask. I'll get up to eat and end up cleaning my toilet. I sit down to do a 30 minute assignment and I can't focus so it takes me an hour. In the middle of someone talking to me or me talking I will completely zone out or forget what I'm talking about. School becomes so stressful that i feel like I can't do it and I'll have panic attacks.

Here's why I feel like a faker though. When I was 15 my mom brought it up to my doctor who asked me if my grades were bad and i said no but that's bc I cheated through highschool bc I couldn't actually do my work. Then he told me to get some more sleep and that everybody has a little bit of ADHD. 

Teachers, friends, and girlfriends have asked me about it before and I always said no bc my doc said I didn't have it. But doing my own research recently I realized that I'm not lazy or alone, but for some reason I'm scared to go to the test and be told no and that I'm just lazy using this as an excuse.",04Nov2020,1

213,"When I was 17, I was generally innocent and didn‚Äôt know the evils of the world‚Äîand if I did‚ÄîI never thought anything could happen to me. Just a little background. I was in a very vulnerable position. I had just had surgery on both of my feet and had casts up to my knees, of course in a wheelchair. I had unlimited percs. All of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù had ditched me because I couldn‚Äôt drive. I had been having a rocky relationship with my parents at this time. 
     This is when I met Michael. A 21 year old musician from Indiana that had a song on s**ndcloud with over a million plays. As a 17 year old aspiring musician, I was in love instantly. He started to tell me how much he loved me and that my family didn‚Äôt love me. Since I was not receiving love from anyone else I held right to him and started to draw away from my family and friends. He told me he wanted to come visit me. I was so excited. He flew to Utah. Got a motel room in my city. The day I got my casts off I was mentally preparing to walk to that motel to see him. I honestly don‚Äôt even know what I was thinking. But I snuck out of my window and made my way down to the motel. When I got to the motel I walked straight in and went up the elevator to his room. I knocked and he cracked the door open. The lights were off. I asked him if we could turn them on and he said his eyes were really tired and sensitive from the trip. I asked him if he could take off his hat and glasses, he said he didn‚Äôt want me to see him. For some reason that didn‚Äôt ring any warning bells. At this point my feet started to ache and I asked him if he had any Over the counter pain killers or whatever. He gave me a Pill and I took it. He immediately pulled out a laptop and the screen was open to porn. I started to get really dizzy and he started to touch me and take my clothes off. I got really thirsty all of the sudden and there was no water left. He gave me a 10$ bill and sent me down to the vending machines. 
I look over to my right, towards the door as it opened and my dad walked in. With 4 cops with him. I started to cry and shut down. The cops start tearing apart the motel since I refused to tell them where he was at first. Micheal came down the elevator and then when he saw the cops and me and my dad‚Äî he panicked and walked right past us to leave. 
Cops outside immediately stopped him after my dad saw the look on my face as he walked past. They questioned him briefly and I cried for them to not hurt him. The cops came to my house after and told me that they couldn‚Äôt charge him with anything and they have released him. They told me that he was actually a 37 year old man from Indiana. Then a female cop turned to me and said,
‚Äú you were lucky you know, he was gonna cut you up and stick you in that dumpster behind the motel‚Äù 
I screamed at that c*nt and ran to my room sobbing. I ran away that night and hid in a different city with my friends. They stopped Michael as he was leaving The state on a train and searched him, but again didn‚Äôt do anything to him. 
Since they didn‚Äôt do anything to him, it just made me think that he had done nothing wrong. I was so mentally fucked from all of this. I ended up having my parents drop me out of high school to go to a Wilderness group for 10 weeks and then a very hostile ‚Äútherapeutic‚Äù boarding school‚Äîwhich actually had more in common with a prison than a boarding school. Lol
When I got out I felt as if my parents truly hated me and I left‚ÄîBACK TO MICHAEL. I know I‚Äôm truly a dumbass ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
We started traveling, I was 18 now and he abused me mentally in public making me sob in public on many occasions. We ended up homeless on the streets of Los Angeles after starting in Chicago and making our way around Michigan, Indiana, Illinois. Then using the train to get to California. He refused to get a job. He wanted to support us by scamming people and using his mother. I felt so trapped. 
We made it finally to Tuscan az after being on the streets for about 4 months. Got into a small place and things were looking up. 
 He once again refused to get a job. Mentally and physically exhausted, I applied and went through the interview process of more that 30 jobs. I didn‚Äôt get one. 
We got a dog that ended up biting my leg after he beat her. 
I remember one night I made dinner and he didn‚Äôt like it and he hit me over the head so hard that I blacked out, when I woke up he was sitting over me and I pretended to still be unconsciousness. I sprang up and hit him as hard as I could. His body went slack and he fell. I was absolutely terrified. He woke up and threw me in the closet and kicked me until I stopped screaming. He left the apt (probably to make sure the cops didn‚Äôt show up) I crawled to phone and called my parents sobbing telling them I really needed to come home. I knew leaving is so dangerous. I carefully planned my escape and then had him walk me to the bus station so I could go to therapy. I went to the greyhound station instead. I‚Äôll never forget the way people looked at me, covered in bruises, 100lbs on my 5‚Äô11‚Äù frame, sunken face. 
     That‚Äôs not the end of Michael. He came back to find me. He kept showing up to say he loved me but then he would just mentally destroy me. I wish I could move on. I wish he wasn‚Äôt out there capable of doing this to someone else. I hope I can move on. I hope that sharing this with you will help me with my process.",04Nov2020,1

Any advice on how to deal with others hallucinations/dillusions?

i just got a call from work from someone with family history of schizophrenia, but i dont think they are getting treatment. 

they just told me my actions were horrible and i am a horrible person but they wouldnt give me any details and how everyone is in agreement with them but again no specifics. how they overheard this non-existant conversation where i went off the rails and it was inappropriate behavior. 

i am honestly shaken up. there was no reality to anything they said.they obviously dont know they are going off the rails and i the family seems to be pretty helpless in helping him. i see them for work regularly but at work they are fine. its like their delusions are person specific? and for whatever reason, i am the target?

most people i know are really stressed about the election, and i think i am too but i feel so numb about it, and that's triggering a lot of guilt because i feel i should be more engaged in it but i just can't. i voted, did my part, and while i want more than anything for things to turn out okay i feel like i'm at capacity with stress and just can't handle taking on anymore. i just feel so bad, because i do care and i'm clearly affected by what's happening but i'm just not getting this high anxiety reaction to each and every little thing that happens with the results so far like everyone else seems. feels more like a dull ache. idk. the guilt feels awful, i feel broken.

222,"I don't know where to start with this, but  it's my way of asking for help, I suppose.

I would like to wake up with no memories and a different personality, because the one I have has progressively turned into a self-destructive parasite. I hate myself.

I have no friends, no trustworthy family, no support, and no hope. I've been spiralling down for years, and it's all becoming too much for me. Although I can't put in words what I feel, I want to; I need support, and I need to let out what has all been bottled up, but some things in the bottle are so deeply  buried that I don't remember them, or don't know if they indeed did happen.

I want to self harm. I need the pain, and it's the only thing that makes me feel remotely alive - or good. I know many think this is unhealthy, but it's the only coping mechanism I ever had. But I had to stop, because the continuous condemnation from everyone around me including parents, friends, therapists and peers was crushing.

I cried for help several time but was met with laughter, condemnation or judgment. Even when asking people in a position of authority, this was no different.

I wasn't very old at the time, and I learned to hide things - after all, if all you get from expressing your pain and asking for support is a condemning reaction from all others, then why express anything? I hide and hide and put on a mask and a fake smile, and it pleases these people who are supposed to be there for me, be it my parents or my therapists. I bottle everything up, because when I show what hides underneath they hurt me even more. So, I felt even worse and wanted to cut, except if I did the backlash would be worse. So I put on the mask again. My therapist thinks I'm feeling better, but she is blind. The more 'normal' I become, the more pain I bear on the inside. The therapists judged me too, they told me how to think and behave, they told me what was wring with me, what I was bad for doing, what they - fallible people, as we all are - believed I should do. They were being paid to tell me what I should be, paid to judge me, paid to change me. Paid to change me, but at the time I still had esteem for who I was. I liked myself, and they were telling me the person I was was a bad one, that needed 'treatment'. So their idea took hold, of course. I started doubting myself, hating myself. Cutting myself more, too, because of the self loathing. When suicide started to take hold in my mind, no one helped me. I cried for help, no one gave me a helping hand when I needed it. No one stopped to ask me if I was alright. All they knew to do was judge, mock, and hate. I began distrusting people more and more.

I can't describe what really happened, nor how I became what I am, how I became this wretch I despise. But I can describe what I am become, which is Iwhy I am here. I am filled with hatred toward people, filled with anger toward people who said they would help me and instead started dictating what I should be, calling me insane. They called me a madman because I was paranoid, but I was paranoid because these very same people left me when I needed their help. In the past year the paranoia has become a true part of me. Everyone, including the people I once called friends or parents, or 'licensed medical professionals', wishes to hurt me; one could call this unreasonable but the past is all the proof I require. I can't confide in people; I hide my feelings and act more or less normal, but on the inside chaos is brewing. More and more, I find people disgusting. Their pretty little institutions that they take so much pride in praising but that only cause suffering to those that it says it will help; it will not help them! It will put them into a socially acceptable box or it will kill them. Their precious little society, made of people who say they will listen and help, but who use the information disclosed only to break those they deem socially unacceptable. It is the highest form of cowardice and utterly disgusting to build trust between themselves and me, to allow me to confide in them and to reveal my inner pain and darkness just to stab me in the back.

I'm not just filled with hatred and rage, though. On rare occasions, after a particularly intense episode of pain-induced rage, I will calm down and just feel... sad. No anger, no loathing, just a lot of sadness. I'm sad that no one cares about me, sad that I no longer have it in me to care about anyone, sad that it's come to asking people on reddit to help me, sad that I have no hope or ambition, sad that I see this society and this species I am both part of with so much contempt, sad that I can't cut myself to feel a little better, sad that I have no friends, sad that I care about nor love anyone, least of all myself, and ultimately sad to be alive .I was a cheerful child, who dreamed of helping others and making the world a wonderful place, I was enthusiastic, I was just.. alive. But no more; I dream of nothing but to go to sleep peacefully, and to find blissful silence, peace and to put an end to what feels like a very long scream. I've become cold and stone hearted; I have no empathy left. I would like to love, care and feel compassion again, but there's nothing left but ice. I see people suffer, and it brings me no tears. 

Furthermore, seeing people happy and laughing disgusts me. Seeing people filled with joy fills me with anger - why should they be happy after what they did to me? Why should they be able to feel love after treating me with such hatred? I don't want to come off as selfish, but I'm kind of jealous to see people enjoy what has been taken from me - love, caring, compassion, joy, passion, hope. I feel like I deserve it to, yet they took it from me.

The mood swings have started to affect my functioning too, as I can go from one extreme to another in a matter of seconds, completely breaking focus and concentration, and often taking a lot of time to calm down again.

Sometimes it feels like it's not real, none of it. Like I invented everything - like the things I mention above, like the suicidal ideation, the self harm, the way people treated me - in my head, or that it was planted there by people who wanted me to feel like shit.

I don't always feel in control of my actions, as though another person in my mind is taking over. My sense of self and identity has been touched by a lot of doubt. Sometimes I even feel like I'm not my own person, I'm 'taken' by another mind - or I am inhabited by another mind.

The hallucinations, too. I see flashes and sparks, arcs of searing light. It's troubling, at times.

I don't know what else to say, though I know there is still much to say. I just don't know what, but it needs out of the bottle, I need to vent so desperately.

The loneliness hurts a lot. I feel completely alone facing a thousand uncaring judges; and I must face and fend off the darkness alone, too. I'm starting to understand the true meaning of friendship; friends are those people who are willing to wallow in the same darkness as you to make it easier for you to cope. I have no such people. I don't know where to find them, and I certainly don't know how to trust, how to share pain and darkness with someone, how to essentially allow myself to be vulnerable in the presence of another sentient being. How could I, after having been given such proof that the reward is never there, and that vulnerability is always met with betrayal? But I need to be loved and cared about, as much as I need people to love and care about. I'm no perfect person and the way my mind has come to work certainly makes me a piece of shit in many eyes, and maybe I really am a worthless and horrible person, but I still desperately feel the need to be loved and cared about - and to feel the same way toward other people. I don't want to hate people, nor do I want to be hated. However it is the only way I have come to function - to hate, and in turn, to be hated. To be filled with rage and in turn to be treated likewise. And to have deep, deep distrust toward everyone - especially the people who appear kind and willing to help; they are the most insidious and dangerous ones.

The emptiness as well; I feel empty and have nothing to fill the cold, lifeless void.

I have become so angry and hateful, so paranoid and tormented, but ultimately I'm sad and hopeless.

Nothing brings me joy or pleasure anymore. I am physically exhausted and my body aches. Sleep no longer rests me, and I wake weary every day. I have no hopes, no dreams, no loved ones, no friends, no sense of self, identity or purpose, no belief than that I must die and no faith.

However I want to be wrong about people. I want to be wrong, because I want to put an end to all this. That will come either through death, or through being wrong. For if I am wrong, then people are not all disgusting. If I am wrong, not all people want to bring me suffering. If I am wrong, there still exists the possibility for me to love, to care, to have compassion and empathy, to feel alive, to feel joy, to hope, to dream, to be loved and to have passion. If I am wrong I could find peace and happiness in life rather than in oblivion.

So, if you read this far, thank you. I probably left out many things but this is the most I can do for now. Please share with me what you think of my situation, and if you believe it is not as hopeless as I believe it is, what I can do. I sincerely ask you, if you can do so, to bring me support, because I am becoming truly desperate for some, and truly desperate for the empathy I was never shown.",04Nov2020,1
223,So if death is the end no matter how you live your life what is the point? Why put it off for another day? Why is today good for someone to die but not for me? How does anyone know when it was to soon... isn‚Äôt that how we feel no matter how old someone was. My mom lived two or more lives in her lifetime but yet we said gone to soon. How do you know. Because I feel like I know I‚Äôm ready to go. It makes no sense but I just know. I‚Äôm tired and ready but what keeps me here? Why cant I just kick the chair? Why can‚Äôt I just pull the trigger? Why can‚Äôt I just jump? What is it that stops me every time? Life didn‚Äôt come with a manual so how do we know anything?,04Nov2020,1
224,"I‚Äôve started to hear the voice of my mom yelling at someone everyday at night for the past year or so, I didn‚Äôt think anything of it at first as I thought she was actually yelling at someone in the middle of the night. 

Yesterday I heard her yelling at my sister and I heard my sister yell back, I was curious so I got up and I saw that my sister was asleep. Obviously I was very confused so I asked my siblings today whether my mom was actually yelling at someone and it turns out she sleeps very early so no one yells at night at all. They said that it‚Äôs very quiet at night and they don‚Äôt really hear anything and they‚Äôre light sleepers so I don‚Äôt think they slept over the sound or something.

225,"So... This is my first time posting in this sub, and after browsing it for a while I came to the conclusion that maybe somone could give me their opinion in this matter... I think I don¬¥t have mental health issues, sometimes I have anxiety attacks (Can¬¥t breathe, can¬¥t stop crying, shaking etc) but I don¬¥t think that qualifies as mental problems. The thing is that sometimes I do things that I have also seen in people with mental health problems, for example: Strong emotions, being loud in all situations, act inmature for my age, I don¬¥t understand things as quick as the others, I get to easily distracted etc... Am I over reacting? Do I need to see a professional? Or all those things just normal?  

Maybe it¬¥s also worth mentioning that I¬¥m pretty sure I¬¥ve been through some traumatic? experiences, or at least that¬¥s what I think they are?

226,"I feel like there are more and more people struggling with mental illnesses. I don't know if it's because I  am unconsciously more drawn to people who struggle with mental issues, but I barely know anyone who hasn't dealt with mental illness. Does anyone think the same about it?

I think it will be, or already is an issue people should talk more about. Like alright people are at least more open now and tell you that you should seek professional help if you don't know what to do anymore. However I feel like our health system is just not able to handle it. You have to wait for months and months for a place for therapy, or you have to pay loads of money.
So it's kinda bold to say just get professional help when it's not that easy.

I just wish it would be more accessible and common to get help from professionals, so that people would also get the chance to get help preemptively before illness start to manifest.

I am just concerned, that especially with the youngest generation growing up with toxic social media and stuff, that there will be more mentally ill people than healthy and that I will become a serious issue. Just some thoughts :)",04Nov2020,1

I‚Äôll try to be brief:

From a really young age (around 4/5) I can remember worrying obsessively about things that could go wrong. My brain has always felt like it‚Äôs going at 100mph, and I‚Äôm a big overthinker.

There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a specific trigger but I could be anxious about absolutely anything if I thought about it.

I‚Äôve managed to not let this take over my everyday life, mostly by completely shutting down any thoughts as soon as they pop up, and being as in control of things as I can, but I think this has led me to both apathetic and very closed off. It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm unable feel anything without feeling everything, and I hate having to mute all my emotions because of this. 

Is there a better/less damaging way of dealing with this??

235,"Please help me put this into context. Is this normal or is this poor mental health.

Long story short. I miss one of my ex girlfriends so badly. We broke up 5 years ago and I‚Äôve had multiple relationships since. However my mind always wonders back to this one red head girl that I loved.

I feel like a part of me is broken and I‚Äôve come so far with developing myself these past 5 years but it just feels like I‚Äôve filled an empty hole in myself and glued the broken bits of my soul back together. I feel fragile, my selfesteem has never been lower and I miss her.

I‚Äôm working at home and this lockdown has me feeling like every day is like Groundhog Day. I‚Äôve never had so much free time in my life and yet it feels like I don‚Äôt even have time to brush my teeth.

I also hold onto this idea....

When we were together we started a business together. When we broke up I toke the website down but I‚Äôve always kept the domain name (the web address www.)....... one day I want to use that domain name for something so if she searches it she can either see that I‚Äôve been successful in something (like a new business) or I‚Äôve tributed something romantic to her like put a poem on the page or learn to play a song. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs romantic or sad and sappy. I know nothing will ever happen again between us and part of me doesn‚Äôt want it to because that part of my life is gone. But I hold this romantic notion that one day I want her to check that old website and think of me again in a positive light.

I‚Äôm ranting and I‚Äôd like someone from the outside to give a view on everything I‚Äôve just said. All advice appreciated. Please be nice

236,"I've been feeling a lot of guilt recently about how I walked away from a friendship. There had been problems in our friendship for a long time due to alcohol misuse, a volatile friend group, mental health issues, trust issues, and jealousy.  I have typed up a letter to try and get my feelings on to paper, and I was wondering if it would be totally selfish to send this to my old friend years later and if I would be better off keeping it to myself? My friend has borderline personality disorder and used to be quite paranoid so she may or may not respond badly to this message. 

 See below for letter

DISCLAIMER: Before you read you continue, I want to reassure you that dont want anything from you.¬† I don't expect you to understand or agree with what I am trying to say. I am not really sure that I can put what I am feeling into words anyway.¬† I don't expect any response from you, and please feel free to block me from social media if you wish. A massive 'fuck you' would also be an acceptable response. 

I am not sure if I am sending this message to you because I feel I owe it to you, or that I owe it to myself but I just wanted to say I am sorry.¬† I don't even know if these words will mean anything to you anymore.¬† If so, read no further, delete this message, and don't waste any time on it.¬† I am writing today as years later I still find myself feeling pretty horrible and guilty about how I left things with you after many years of friendship. Maybe I deserve to feel guilty but its been nearly 5 fucking years, which is starting to feel pretty ridiculous.¬† I think part of the reason I still feel this way is due to the lack of closure. There was so much I should have said to you, and I should have listened to what you had to say in return, even if it wasn't what I wanted to hear. I didn't think I could handle it. I felt so crappy about myself. I felt like any critism or conflict would trigger a full mental breakdown.¬† Even now, I still cant quite make sense of how things went wrong. I loved you lots, I had loads of fun with you, I felt understood and appreciated by you, and I felt like you were part or my family.¬† I know there were some trust issues in our friendship, which I think untimately led to things breaking down. Without a doubt there were things I did which didnt help the situation, and so many things I should have handled differently. I should have been more honest with you about a lot of things.¬† I fucked up there.¬† At that point in my life, my ego was so fragile that I didnt even feel like a real person a lot of the time.¬† I was dealing past trauma and shame. I felt very fearful and I put a lot of walls up to protect myself. I was really scared to let anyone see me, incase they used that to hurt me. I pretended to be confident to protect myself.¬† I tried to show you the real me and talk to you about my life experiences but the more I did that the more scared and paranoid I became and the more I saw you as a threat.¬† I felt so anxious when I saw you that I felt sick and my hands would shake. I would usually calm down after some alcohol or a smoke but then when I sobered up again I would have some major anxiety about whether I had said or done anything wrong. I was always drunk or out of it.¬† I always wanted to say the right things to make people happy and to make them feel better but I always seemed to get into situations I couldnt really understand and hurt them without meaning to to.¬† I never meant to hurt you but I fucked that up. I meant to always be there for you but I walked away. It felt like I needed to protect myself from you. But I didnt need protecting from you.¬† You never did me any harm. You tried to help me, you tried to support me, you tried to make me feel better. I was just really not well.¬† I was also jealous of you. Not a nice trait I know!¬† I always though you were so smart, funny, creative, and beautiful. You could light up a room. Everyone who met you wanted to be around you. I felt like nothing in comparison. I should have been more supportive and not been so caught up in my own negative feelings.¬† I totally believe in women supporting and building up other women. I practice this in all my female friendships......but back then I failed you. I wasn't the friend I wanted to be or the one you deserved and for that I apologise.
It took 3 years of intensive therapy for me to be able to think more clearly, to feel like a real person with my own needs, views,¬† likes &amp; dislikes, needs. To be able to set boundaries and stand up for myself,¬† to not lose myself entirely to other people, and to feel like I have some worth, and to be honest about my life without feeling shame. I dont feel trapped by my situation anymore or embaressed by my life. I dont have to exhaust myself trying to pretend everything is going ok.¬† I was a mess for a very long time and any friendships/relationships were a total headfuck for me. Even now they are not perfect.¬† 
I've made a shit load of mistakes and I know that I can't make up for all of the things I've done but I am not a bad person. I care about people,¬† I want to see them do well, I feel bad when I hurt people, and I look after the people I love.¬†¬†¬†When I knew you my head was too full of my own issues to fully empathize with your situation, and I was probably pretty needy to.¬† I am a bit better at these days as therapy has freed up some space in my head, but I could probably still do better. 

Whenever I think about you I really hope your life is going well.¬† If I could ever do anything to help you out I would, although I doubt if I am the best person for the job.¬† I think there is something about our mix of personality traits that doesnt necessarily work together. Which is crap and I hate that, cos you were the best friend I ever had.¬† I appreciated the fuck out our chats. You got me. I think you get a lot of people. Its a unique talent. You made a lot of space in your life for people and not all were deserving. I would have liked to have been a person that was deserving of your efforts.¬† I wanted to be someone positive in your life and be a true friend, but it didnt work out that way.¬† I am still not sure if all of it was my fault, or if some of it was.¬† I suppose it doesnt really matter anymore. 

Before just want you to know that¬† I hope you are well, I hope Blair is well, and I hope your family are well.¬† I hope age 30 and beyond has brought you more inner peace, contentment and self- compassion. I hope you have good friendships with people who appreciate you and bring out the best in you, I hope you have managed to fill up your life in ways that make you feel happy and fulfilled,¬† and I hope thay you've managed to retain your brillant sense of humor in the face of life's challenges.¬† 

I'll not bother you again. Upon reflection I think I am sending this message for me, I've needed to do it for a long time, but I hope you've been able to take something positive from it too and that I've not upset you by sending it. 

Take care Eve. 
Your one of the good ones",04Nov2020,1
237,"I was having a somewhat decent day, until everything kicked in again. I started having a ton of negative thoughts. I was at work, so they went from thoughts about how I‚Äôm probably useless, hated, and invaluable there, to thoughts about being worthless and hated in general. 

I‚Äôm in my first semester of college, but I struggle to get anything done sometimes. It‚Äôs hard to believe that doing the work matters when I feel like I don‚Äôt have a future. I can‚Äôt see myself being here in 10 years. I don‚Äôt want to exist most of the time, but I‚Äôm too scared to do anything to make that happen. 

I‚Äôm also too scared to fully tell someone how I‚Äôm feeling. I can never get myself to talk to my family about anything personal. Plus sometimes I can‚Äôt fight the feeling that even they don‚Äôt care. My mother let me down already once, and after that, even when I‚Äôve tried to hint to her that something is wrong she brushed it off as being an adult. I feel like my brother doesn‚Äôt care about me. I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable enough around him to talk to him as myself, or make jokes. I feel like he won‚Äôt care. He‚Äôll talk about his interests, and his opinions, but never asks about mine.   He only asks me questions about my own life when I‚Äôm quiet and not responding to his own comments. 

The only person who has really tried to help me has been my (now former) teacher, who I‚Äôve known now for 5 years. She doesn‚Äôt even know the full story though, or the thoughts that go through my head.
