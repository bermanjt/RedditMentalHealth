0,Been staying at my parents house since April with nothing to do and I hate my life. My partner is in another country and I miss them with my whole soul. I need something to change. Today made me feel so dead inside. I ruin the day for my parents and then get really emotional about everything. I just want to cry and hug my partner. I've been applying for jobs in the hope I can get one and maybe my partner can come back to this country and stay with/move in with me but nothing yet. I feel like life is a mistake. I would give -anything- to be able to move in with my partner tomorrow because life right now feels empty and meaningless.,26Dec2020,1

TW: Death, Suicide Mention, Break Ups 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom died 4 years ago and so the holidays are always really hard on my two sisters and I. My stepmom and my dad are getting divorced after 5 years and she has been staying with a friend for the past few days. She was a manipulative bitch who cheated on my dad and hurt all of us emotionally. I'm glad she's gone, but the break up is really rough on my dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's said he's depressed in the past but the break up is really causing his depression to flair up. He has  said before that if he didn't have my sisters and I he probably would have killed himself. The most haunting thing since my mom's death has always been the thought that I am one step away from being an orphan. If I lose my dad, I will be completely alone because all of my family lives 2000 miles away. I will lose everything if my dad dies. I am really scared and I need to help him but I do not know how. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be there for him but I am lost and I don't know how I can help him with my own struggling mental health. I'm only 16 and I don't have my license or a job so I can't pick up more financial things to take to some strain off of my dad. I know that that would help him but there is only so much I can do with my limited resources. I need some advice and I need to know how to help my dad. I can't lose him too. Please help.",26Dec2020,1
3,"So quick backstory. I've had a life filled with trauma and abuse, and I suffer from BPD 1. Anyways someone who I was in love with recently left me for someone else. She used to get me so high naturally. Whatever causes that. A simple touch would set it off, and its absolutely pleasurable. I'd be messed up for hours. Maybe its what heroin feels like? After she left, of course I got super depressed as usual. Except today something went completely different. Some kind of phenomenon where I got high asf. The same high she used to give me, if not better. I tried Googling it, and I can't find anything. The best hypothesis I can come up with is that it's some kind of defense mechanism that has managed to divert whatever chemical that causes depression, to my pleasure sensors/synapses. Idk. I don't know much about what goes on in a brain. Has anyone else ever heard of such a thing?",26Dec2020,1
4,"Hey guys, I’m 19 years old male. I live in Canada and I struggle with bad health anxiety that has caused me a lot of stress over the last couple months. It started when I got some bumps in the back of my throat and they started to bleed once. I then searched it on google and told me it was cancer so I had a huge panic attack for 2 months didn’t sleep crying every night scared to sleep thinking I was going to die in my sleep. After I saw a lot of doctors they told me it was nothing to worry about. Kinda scary seeing blood in ur throat tho. I had no pain it just started randomly. After the large panic attacks I felt weird and searched my symptoms and ended up being derealization cause by my trauma.  I really want my life back anyone know how I can help my mental state.

5,"I was diagnosed with pretty severe GAD as well as depression early in this year, although I’ve struggled with depression over the last 7 years or so. Anyhow, I was put on antidepressants again a few months ago, and I’ve realised that I can’t cry. I went from crying literally every day because of being so anxious and worried all the time, to only being able to cry over:

1. Characters dying in movies/series/books

or 

2. If I’m frustrated 

I’ve also noticed I don’t really feel that many emotions anymore, if that makes sense? It feels like I’m just sort of numb nowadays. I get happy, very often actually. I’m either happy or I don’t really feel anything. I’m just “fine.”  I didn’t realise this when I was on antidepressants a few years back(but I was also very very depressed back then so maybe I just didn’t notice it), and I’m taking the exact same brand of antidepressants.

Is this a common thing? I feel like it sounds so dumb, but I literally can’t cry. Not even if I WANT to or if I’m sad. I just can’t. Has this happened with anyone else when they’ve been on antidepressants?

Starting to worry I’m just messed up or something haha.",26Dec2020,1
6,"Idk of this fits on this subreddit but I'm just looking for a place to dump my thoughts and this is very big to me and I just want someone to say I'm ok and not mad. 

I'm struggling with some seriously weird feelings that used to be infrequent but the last few days are constant. Nothing feels quite real and everything feels alien even though I'm home. I dont quite feel like me, like im an observer looking out. Like, shits happening and I'm here but am I really doing it. Sometimes I feel super aware of whats around me and every little noise and other times it feels like nothing I cant see even exists. I don't know what is wrong and its starting to scare me and I dont want to feel like this anymore. 


I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression recently and have started taking SSRI medication to help and im scared that those meds are causing this. But I've also felt like this before just not as frequently as this. Previously it was every week or so. Now its almost constant. Today has been rough, I'm at home with my parents but they just aren't people I can talk to.",26Dec2020,1
7,"i’ve been severely depressed and suicidal my entire life, i’ve never had a single friend and don’t get along with anyone regardless. it makes anyone im around uncomfortable, but i can’t not be miserable no matter what. yes i’ve tried therapy. it’s a burden to everyone and their days, and so on so on.

how can i get better at pretending to not be this way/masking it? i have no one that cares for me so part of me wants people to be aware of how much i’m suffering.. but even when i ask for help or reach out, it never works. idk

being the way that i am, and also pretending to not be, are both insanely uncomfortable.. for hopeless cases like my own, not being this way is impossible because i’m treatment-resistant.",26Dec2020,1

9,"Recently (59f)came across some papers while cleaning up at my (59m)ex bf’s place. I glanced over them and was in total shock - it was some type of form for the boy scouts sexual abuse law suit compensation. the dead line was nov 16th i think and i’m guessing he faxed it in since the papers were still there. i only saw the age 11-12 of the abuse. He never mentioned that  tho he did mention something that happened when he was 16 by a 26 yo male. He told me in his 20’s that he would go to adult book stores and get blow jobs from guys. He’s only 5’7” and got picked on a lot in school and other kids thought he was gay. We met 3 years ago while he was going thru his 3rd divorce. After being in a relationship for a year I started to notice things he said didn’t add up or he would tell me something and when I would ask him
about it a few days later he would say he didn’t say that or that’s not what he said. One nite laying in bed at his place I noticed a light shining in the corner that i never saw before. After a couple hrs I finally get up to check it out. It was an old Iphone 4 that didn’t turn off. i had seen it before but never turned on and i figured it was his soon to be ex-wife’s. I opened the texts and everything he said i was paranoid for thinking turned out to be totally true and so much more. I gave him the phone and left. When I called him later he was mad at me for reading his phone. He told me he had trust issues. I warned him when he told me he loved me “please don’t hurt me, keep it real, I’m am not sure my heart could take another breaking” I was celibate 7 yrs when we met. We remained friendly since we have a few joint projects in progress. We also would still have sex sometimes. Since I found out how much he lies and will not tell the truth EVER I had to find out the truth for myself. I should have just run away as fast and as far as I could get. The truth was and still is... he is on every dating site and hook up site, he will pay for sex, he tries to hook up with girls in their 20’s and 30’s for money of course. He falls for every sob sorry they tell him to get him to send them money. He believes every get rich scheme that comes his way. He didn’t believe me when I told him one was a ponzi scheme until the FTC shut it down after he put 37K into it in 4 months. He never believes anything I say but believe the women from online and gets upset when they lie to him. But doesn’t understand why I get upset when he lies to me. I told him I had trust issues before we slept together. He told me he had no issues and grew up in a happy family and life. So many red flags I don’t know why I chose to ignore them and hoped otherwise? I knew he was too good to be true. He was such a gentleman, good hearted, generous, hard working, thoughtful, helped others all the time. The other things that raised flags - he gave money every month to churches in other states by mail, he’s republican and a born again christian and maybe goes to church 1-2 times a yr he listen to christian music in his car all the time &amp; says it makes him feel good. He was in the navy for 10 yrs. He lost a foot in an accident. He’s balding and getting a gut. He is always getting texts from females 24/7 they usually only want $. Once in a while he will go on a real date with someone around his age that he met from “Match” but it never goes beyond a first date. He will have sex with any female who will let him. Since I just learned about the boy scout thing I’m curious since he doesn’t really have any vices like drugs or booze or cigs or coffee - tho he does gamble and take risks and buys so much crap he doesn’t need it ends up in storage rotting away since he never maintains anything he buys he chases pussy non stop I can see now and why. He won’t talk about it - He prolly only filed for the $$$. But why leave the papers not very well hidden if you didn’t want anyone to find out? He finally started to get counseling thru the VA by telephone until covid started then counseling stopped. How can I help him understand unless he faces his past trauma he will never be whole or like himself. He is Literally like 2 different people, a perfect gentleman and a perfect lying scheming thief pervert of a man. He is also very closed minded and avoids his own problems by helping everyone else with theirs and will go totally out of his way to do so. I love the gentleman side and want to stab the other side. He will not let anyone see who he really is and acts like he’s the most happiest person in the world. I even found out he called suicide hot line 18 months ago. He tells his few friends that I’m crazy and I’m sure it seems like it from what he tells them but they don’t know the full story, that him lying to me and gaslighting me and paying for sex, having sex w/o condoms with anyone (condoms are a must for me) plus all the other things I found out would make any woman crazy. I don’t know what to do since i care about him but i also don’t want a 71 yo rich lady to get hurt either that he’s been seeing as a friend but she really likes him a lot. His wife tried to warn me several times via texts and it just made her seem crazy. I try so hard to do no contact but since i’m the project manger at one of his properties (1 yr ago I quit a good paying job) which is how i’m surviving money wise cause of covid and not many jobs in BFE plus i own land next to him, he’s come to his land maybe 3 times a month. I have worked for and paid for everything myself and even pay my 1/2 when we eat out. He hates me never believing his lies and my snide remarks about his shit and hates when I call him out - he yells at me loud so I will stop. I know i have major issues and been working on them just started taking lexapro to help with the stress and anxiety, depression all while beginning menopause. If this is posted in the wrong place or I didn’t follow the rules please forgive me still learning and trying to understand how reddit works. I really like all the different sub- reddit’s and learn new things every time I come on here. Not sure why I posted this other than to just get it out of my head since it helps me when I write stuff out. I don’t have anyone I trust that I could tell them EVERYTHING, no family, some friends but rather be alone especially holidaz and birthdays.

10,"Lately I’ve been reading a lot about the universe, evolution, consciousness, space—just about anything science-y. It’s made me feel bitter that I have to live in this body, a body that I despise and fails me. If we only have one life (as the saying goes), I’d rather be anything else. I do, in some ways, think life is beautiful. Nature is beautiful. Love is beautiful. But society doesn’t care about making our life enjoyable. No...one must go to school from a young age, decide on a career while still a kid, go to college, work and pay off the debt from school, retire, die. That’s it. &amp; that’s assuming you go to school. If you don’t, you’re thrust into a pool of minimum wage jobs, struggling to afford basic necessities, hoping that you’ll be lucky enough to work your way up the ladder or find a job that doesn’t require a master’s degree (as more and more do, nowadays). 
I want to travel. I want to go to Japan and Hawaii and the UK. I was to swim in the ocean, climb mountains, grow a garden, learn to cook, watch animals in the wild, learn different languages. But I can’t do any of those things. I’m almost 21, completely dependent on my family, 2 years behind in school. The next ~7 years of my life will be occupied with school &amp; work. Then so actually have to make $$$, so there isn’t a way to just be free and do whatever my heart desires.

I am so sad that humans occupy this amazing, beautiful earth, yet focus so much on money (which we created!!). I mean, it literally costs SO MUCH MONEY just to survive. It’s seriously depressing.",26Dec2020,1

16,i was put on wellbutrin recently for social anxiety. i have had hints of depression in the past but all related or tied to my anxiety. i feel like the wellbutrin has sent me spiraling into what seems like a possible mixed episode. i know there are side effects that are quite similar so not sure exactly how to different side effects from anything else. but i have been more irritated than i have ever been in my life. i have been agitated and snippy and get mad very easily almost as if i am on steroids. it is very unlike me since i am a chill person generally. i have a lot of depression too and have neared an anxiety attack multiple times every day. i wake up after sleeping just a few hours fully rested and in the mornings i pace and practically bounce off the walls. i feel almost as if i am on speed. i also tend to sing a lot and just make noise in general. i also have a bunch of tics ive noticed recently. the main thing though is the anger and the agitation. i feel like i am unhinged and need to be careful with myself. my aunt has bipolar disorder so it sort of runs in the family but not a strong correlation. i’m wondering if i should call my doctor and go off the meds or if it’s just the side effects and i’m overthinking it. anyways thank all of you guys for your time and hope you are doing well.,26Dec2020,1

I don't know what's wrong with me. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 5, and since then I've completed a complex reality inside my head. Every time I get into a new TV show or emotional support fandom, I insert myself into it, creating complex backstories and scripts in my brain. I sit and space out at a blank wall for hours, building my own reality. Fact checking new things to add to my reality, where I date my favorite character and have a large group of friends and everything is okay. I can't live without it, I seriously can't. I don't know how I can function without it, but I've stopped taking care of my physical self, only to further develop my fantasy self. I don't know how much longer I can take it.

And I have people in my life whomt I would rather live on with for centuries than to ever go through seeing them leave (or leaving myself) to the bare ignorence of either the afterlife or plain, empty nothingness.

 I grew up to the thought that once we all die, we will all be reunited in heaven (which branches naturally from my fairly religious family, but as I get older my perception of religion and spirituality gets a little too shaken up for me to ever be sure about anything). I've wasted years of my teenagehood that could have gone wonderfully to extremely strict parents and low self-esteem, and I fear losing more years as I feel like I'm racing through life like it's pure meaningless dust. 

I fear the idea of getting buried, I fear the thought of my body decaying and slowly decomposing into the soil, I fear losing breath or even getting into mildly dangerous situations which others would consider adventure.

Ever since school, I’ve had to deal with life changing anxiety and it effects me with everything that I do. I hate things being bought for me or people spending money because I feel like I don’t deserve it. My parents work so hard to keep a roof over my head and make sure I have a warm meal every day and I just feel like I don’t deserve the good things in my life. The worst thing that someone can call me is selfish or cocky. I try so hard not to be these things that I almost feel scared to speak up in any situation, and when I do, I go bright red. With school, I was bullied for 3 years every day and it’s taken a real toll on me. Learning wasn’t an option, meaning that I failed all my exams and because of Covid it’s been 2 years since I’ve meant to retake them which is really stressful. A teacher could have submitted me for a predicted grade by the government, but they ‘forgot’ and I’m struggling, I really am and I just don’t know about much anymore. 

I live in an amazing household with an amazing family but I think I’m a little broken and I don’t know anymore. I know there’s people I can talk to, but I hate things being about me and I feel awkward.

I don’t know is this is just me but I regret so, so much. I regret doing a lot of things I have. I wish I could go back and never make a Reddit account, or any social media. Being online makes my mental health so much worse and my anxiety has worsened so much because of it. I regret making online friends because they’ve impacted me negatively and I can’t just delete everything and disappear because I want to be considerate of their feelings. 

I regret getting closer to people I know in real life. I have no idea why, because it makes no sense, but whenever I share feelings with people I immediately regret it and feel anxious. I have showed my friends many of my hobbies and now they’re interested in them, which also makes me feel horrible for some reason. I don’t know why.

I think mostly I just regret developing a lot of friendships because they make me uncomfortable and nervous, even though I have no reason to be.

I just have a question because I am feeling very weird. I get very uncomfortable when interacting with children.

To get this clear, I DO NOT habe any sexual feelings for children, I do not find them attractive what so ever so that is not the issue, that is not the reason why I find it so uncomfortable to physically interact with them. I have no issue talking to them it's just that I do not like being touched. I don't like being touched by my family either (by touched I mean hugs and stuff not anything inappropriate). I don't mind hugging my close friends or my boyfriend but I get so uncomfortable with my family and children.

Some cases I read about years ago still pop up regularly in my mind and it’s really starting to have a detrimental effect on me. I try to minimise suffering whenever I see it in my own life, but whenever I see any news of deaths/murders/tragedies they really stick with me, and I just can’t help thinking of all the tortured souls that exist along with me, all across the world, and how powerless I am because I can’t help them.

34,"Since I began my teenage years I've been struggling a lot with OCD, mostly in the form of checking things over and over again, not trusting my memory which lead to doing things like refusing to hold knives just in case I cut myself and wouldn't know, covering my mouth in public so I wouldn't think back on it later and think I said something offensive unintentionally, checking emails and papers for the same reason, intrusive thoughts, so many other things. In my Junior year of HS I became depressed and stopped caring about other people, so those obsessions have left me. More recently I've taken on a different form of obsessions that I still don't understand or know how to stop. 

They come in the form of over thinking. Sometimes overthinking and worrying so much to the point where it takes up my entire day and my head feels like it will explode + I'll throw up. And now I worry so much to the point where I sleep all day and night so I don't have to worry. I sleep all day, then take sleeping pills at night so I can sleep for as long as I can. I'm tired of worrying. My worries mostly come in the form of religious worrying. I like my religion and I don't plan on leaving it, because I know my obsessive thoughts are wrong, but I just can't stop it. Recently I've been worrying about something so little, but so big to me: magic. This is important to me because I'm a very creative person who has always loved movies, books, just about everything based on magic or people with super powers. I've incorporated it into my style, and I've planned on making a career out of fashion, so you can see how this is frustrating for me.

I have this sudden phobia of magic, which shouldn't be a problem, because the magic I like is merely fictional. I tell myself that I'm allowed to think it's cool and fascinating for this reason, but my OCD won't let me. Movies about this stuff have been my only comfort and now my OCD has taken it away from me. And the worst part is I KNOW I'm wrong, but I can't control it. When I'm not sleeping I'm pacing in my room and reassuring myself that my interests are okay, but all my OCD does is point out whenever I'm sinning, or find a way to make it seem like literally everything I do is a sin. I just want to sleep forever. Someone tell me what to do. For context I will once again mention that I don't plan on leaving my religion.",26Dec2020,1

40,"Hello,

 I'm very new to this sub so I apologize if I'm not fabricating my words correctly but I will do my best at trying to explain my condition to see if anyone knows anything about this. A little over a year ago I started experiencing very odd episodes that last around 20 seconds with an overwhelming feeling of familiarity and ""sick like"" uncomfortable feelings. They initially tend to come on slow so I can tell maybe seconds in advance before I have an episode. They always start mid morning and I'm not sure if it has to do with sleep deprivation since I now moved into city and loud cars are always passing my window, I can safely say this may be linked to it. Conditions are: Heat flashes, increased heart beat, sense of familiarity, mild confusion, loss of appetite. I will also say that I can go weeks without having them and then all of a sudden I will have them. I normally have 3-4 of these episodes a day when I get them. My theory is that it could be Focal onset seizures (partial seizures) since most of the symptoms I experience coalesce with the symptoms described. I don't believe it's a crazy mental health problem but I would like to know if it could turn into something worse. I want to thank anyone who took the time to read this and sorry if this was a bit too long but I felt like this was the only website in which I could get some decent info on it.",26Dec2020,1

45,I’ve struggled with both before but I’ve always been raised to believe that they’re just things that come with being young.

46,"I'm really struggling at the moment. My whole life basically revolves around the trauma I experienced five years ago. It follows me everywhere. I'm currently in a pretty nice relationship, but it always seems to get complicated. My abuser is still in my life. I see him once a month (precovid in person, currently on a zoom call) as he is another volunteer at the organization we're both involved in. No one besides my partner and previous therapists know what happened. My partner is often frustrated that this person is still around. He sort of wanders into other organizations and hobbies that we're involved in (I don't believe it is intentional and I don't think he knows he did anything wrong). My partner's solution is that we just move across the country. He's been wanting to do this for a while regardless, but his drive is exacerbated by this situation. My instincts tell me I don't want to go. Everything I know is in this state. My family is here, my grandmother is in her mid-nineties and if anything were to happen with her, I would not want to be on the other side of the country. My sister lives in a city not far from here, but in Canada. If I were to go anywhere, I'd like to go there, but immigration is just so hard.

I would love to speak with a therapist, but my insurance is more localized to the other part of the state. I have to drive about four hours for any medical appointments. That just isn't realistic for weekly therapy sessions and I have been rejected so many times by different therapists over there who do teletherapy. I'm just so lost and so upset. I'm nearing 26 which will mean I will lose any insurance I have. I am physically disabled as well which is what started me down this spiral tonight.

47,"Every single day for the past month or so, my head hurts; along with my stomach. Period already passed, I’m not sure if it’s because of dehydration? I drink a lot of water —is it too much? I rarely have an appetite to eat, but when I try to my stomach hurts, so I usually avoid it. 

When I try to focus on anything, eg. reading, playing games, drawing, even talking to people; my head is in constant pain and I feel nauseous like I’m going to pass out.

48,"Hello all. Recently I’ve made some revelations and realizations that have lead me to reach a level of self-love that I thought was previously unattainable due to my long history of depression, anxiety, BPD, and a suicide attempt (obviously failed). If you find you hate yourself, not loving yourself, or feeling worthless, I hope I can communicate some of what I’ve learned with you and help.

I’ve never been one to have friends. At all, really. I’ve had one childhood friend and they’ve drifted in and out of my life. I felt so alone starting at the age of 14, when your adult friend groups really start to form and you start to create lifelong relationships. My high school experience was nonexistent. It’s supposed to be the time of your life when you party, meet boys, create friend groups or join a friend group. At the least, make a few friends. Not one party, not one friend. I shit you not when I say I couldn’t/ didn’t make a single friend during high school. That’s when the depression began.

I could go on and on about the little details of my experience with depression, anxiety, BPD, and suicidal ideation. But I won’t say too much about it, since some of you know what it’s like and that’s not what this post is about. But I will say that for 4 years, getting out of bed was a chore. Cleaning my room was a chore. Talking to people was a chore, making friends was a chore. Taking care of myself was a chore. Hell, eating was a chore. Breathing almost seemed like too much some days. Some days I was manic with ideas and energy, some days I couldn’t lift a finger because it just took too much energy. I lay awake at night, taking hours to fall asleep even though I didn’t get out of bed that day. Some nights I got no sleep. Some days I slept 14 hours. The only consistency that existed was that most days and nights, I lay in bed imagining a hundred different ways to die. Everything was fucked.

My suicide attempt included slitting my wrists until I could touch the bone. Ordered a suture kit and some scalpels, went the whole 9 yards. Not many people can say they’ve surgically opened their arm up until they could touch their own ulna and radius, but here I am. How did I do this? Copious amounts of Oxycodone, Ativan, Xanax, Paroxetine, alcohol, Baclofen and Amitryptiline, of course. Yes, I overdosed and almost bled to death. In the moment I wasn’t even aware of how close I was to death. My foot was halfway over the fine line between life and death, and I just had to go a bit further. Just give in the the sleepiness from the drugs, just bleed a bit more, just let go of consciousness. It would’ve been easy. Peaceful, even. No pain, it was just like falling asleep after a long day.

I’m still alive and kicking after that. How? Well, I got taken to the hospital and by some miracle it wasn’t too late, although I had already passed out in the car. I stopped breathing. But here I am. Scars all over my arms but I’ve found the will to live. The will to kick depression, anxiety, BPD, antidepressants, drugs, alcohol and suicidal ideation. You know what the funny part is? The near-death experience isn’t what set my will to live into motion. You’d think so, right? I was suicidal after that attempt, for many months. No, it was a switch in perspective. 

My previous perspective taught me society dictates your self-worth. Friends dictate your self-worth. How much you should love yourself is dependant on how many friends and followers you have, how many parties you have been invited to, how much money you have, your line of work, what kind of family you come from etc. The list goes on and on. If you don’t have these things, there is something wrong with you, therefore you should hate yourself. You grow to hate yourself. 

There’s a beauty in being alone. There is power in being alone. Someone once told me, “You have to be your own favourite person. That’s the key to loving yourself, is becoming your own best friend.” Being alone lets you nurture yourself and become your own favourite person. When you are your own best friend, you suddenly never feel alone again because, well, you can’t leave your own body. You will never need anyone but you. 

My perspective now? I want to live, because I’ve hit rock bottom and the only place to go is up. It’s exciting to look into the future and realize your unlimited potential. What else can you lose? You can only build from this point on. You are about to meet a lifelong friend, the best person you’ve ever known, someone you love and will be there for you forever. Until you die. So many people have not had the privilege of meeting this person. That person is you. 

Try to love yourself. Fall in love with yourself. Become the person you’d want to fall in love with... and when you do truly fall in love with yourself, you will never need anyone else for validation or self-worth. Why? No one, no one can love you more than you. No amount of love or validation from another person will feel fulfilling or correct, because you’ll have a void in yourself that can be only filled by you. Not by anyone else. 

So, I began to live for myself... and life got so much easier. It was like a veil had been lifted and I felt one thousand pounds lighter. How? Because I was living for myself, to please myself. No one else. I can say it’s a lot easier to fulfill the expectations of one person (yourself) than the expectations of 20 other people. Many people don’t even get the chance to ever truly be alone in their lives, and as a result they never truly grow, they never learn to be their own best friend. And that ultimately fucks them, because eventually we all feel alone, and what sets you and me apart is that we are okay with it. Others are not. 

Validation is for parking, and opinions are a dime a dozen. If you live life trying to fulfill the expectations of others and expect everyone to have a great opinion about you, you will never, ever be happy. I thought I was supposed to act a certain way, hang out with a certain crowd, everyone was supposed to have wonderful opinions about me, and if not, at least like me. No. People suck. People disappoint. Don’t place your happiness in the hands of others. If you place your happiness in your own hands, no one can take it away from you because it’s yours to keep.

I barley had enough energy for myself, let alone others. Your energy is valuable. It’s for you. You choose what to do with it. My advice, use it on yourself, not worrying about what others think or how they feel about you. That all falls into place when you first learn to love yourself, spend more time on yourself, use your energy on yourself. There is nothing more attractive than a person that is flourishing due to their own self-love.

I’ve fallen in with love being alone... sure if I died right now, not many people would care. I wouldn’t leave much of an impact on the world. Most people wouldn’t think much of it. But who gives a fuck about what other people think?? Place value in yourself. You live for you and no one else. So fuck other people, fuck their thoughts, opinions and expectations. You are at your most potent right now, where you have nothing to lose and EVERYTHING to gain.

I’m not a replacement for professional psychiatric/ psychological help, however I am here to help anyone who wants someone to talk to. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you, and I hope my words have helped in some way.",26Dec2020,1
49,"I'll use today for an example... So my aunt's cat came into the room for literally for maybe 2 seconds that I couldn't see him, so I know he couldn't have done anything. But I keep getting these repetitive thoughts in my head that maybe he scratched my Pc or peed in a corner even do I know it's impossible in the time frame. And I will worry about this until something else happens. But over the worrying, in general, I my hair has fallen out and I'm only 25, can't have a meaningful conversation as I can't concentrate on anything else other than thoughts. And another example is if a find any piece of dirt in my bed I believe it's faeces even though it doesn't look, smell or how would it of got there in the first place and it just looks like a crum or something. And I'll have to watch my whole body and change my sheets. Or the thoughts will linger non-stop. Also if I get a bit of water on my pants from washing my hands I'll think it's pee even though I saw the water go on my pants. I also wash my hands so much they're all raw and red. I can't use the utensils in my house, as I have to use disposable one's as I will wonder who touched them before me. Can't touch door handles either. Another thing is if I get a general bug or like a freeze on a computer or console. I will believe my computer is broke, even do I logically can find the reason why it happened and it's not a problem and just a common issue. This generally goes for all my tech and it doesn't matter if I know it's nonsense, I'll still feel like they're gonna break anyways. I have a lot more examples but I'm sure you get the jest, the thoughts get so bad over something as simple as a scratch on a controller I won't be able to leave my bed for days.

1- I feel like I can’t help enough people. I lost my friend at age 10 to suicide and I always have felt like I’m responsible. I now take everyone else’s mental health on my shoulders and it makes me sick. I don’t know how to care for myself and I just cry every night.

2- I don’t want to leave school because when I’m at home I’m ignored and alone. My parents work from home but barely look at me during the day. They tell me to get off of my phone but that’s the only way I can feel less lonely. I feel like I’m using my phone as a coping mechanism and when my parents fight or when I’m just lonely I have a tendency to have a panic attack. 

3- I hate eating in front of people and I eat a lot when I’m alone. I’m super weight insecure and I tend to want to binge eat to cope. 

4- I’m fucking sick of the bullies. All the time I get made fun of for anything I do. I get made fun of for liking anime because it makes me “weird”. I get made fun of for my weight. I get made fun of for my face. I get made fun of for whatever I’m wearing. Anything I do, the bullies follow me.

The reason is that I'm too lazy to solve my problems, and I don't have it in me to just end all my problems, so I just blabber into the endless abyss of the internet. I'm not looking for advice. I'm so far beyond the point of advice. I've known for a while now what my options are in life, and everyday I choose to be this guy. This guy that no one actually even knows. I don't know, sometimes I think I'd just be nice to talk to someone honestly. Someone who isn't trying to help or fix me. Not some perfect person who's going to tell me what I need to do as if I don't already know that I should keep a routine, set goals for myself, journal, etc. Just someone who's in the same boat as me. I...I don't know man. There's just this void in me that's been there for a while and I just hate it. I mean, I've gotten use to it. But, in moments of self-reflection like this, I start to remember how much I wish it wasn't there. I wish I felt whole. I wish I didn't know as much as I did. It just doesn't seem worth it, man. I just don't see a solution. I don't know what to do. I wish I hadn't spent so much of my life alone. I wish I had friends besides my teachers. I wish I had gotten along with my family. I just wish I didn't feel like I had to do this all myself. But, that's the uncomfortable realization we have to face, right? We are alone, ultimately. We have to make due with what we've got. I can't rely on people to hold my hand for my whole life. And yet, I can't survive any other way. I don't know. I don't really want to wake up tomorrow. For the umpteenth time I just feel like I'm done. I don't have any juice left in the tank. I'm sure by tomorrow afternoon I'll have forgotten why I felt this way and go back to drifting aimlessly through my meaningless life until the next time these feelings boil up.

I'm sorry.",26Dec2020,1

I’ve noticed that whenever someone I know gets angry or sad, I instantly get very anxious and wonder: Are they going to hurt or kill themselves?

62,"Late night, tired writing but, there is something horribly wrong with me, and I don’t know how to pin point it. I feel like I’m spiraling into madness

I’d say all this started most likely around October this year. I was a very consistent weed smoker and would go to my supplier everyday. I was abusing it like crazy, and that’s what I think started all this. Now I don’t smoke as much, especially after a month break, maybe once or twice a week now, but every single day I hallucinate. I already have bone-shakingly bad anxiety and overthinking issues, so this amplifies it. But what I see is like a colorful filter on everything all the time. It’s a very faint blurry rainbow filter, when I look at something black i see rainbow everywhere, it’s not black. I don’t know how to explain it. My vision is always somewhat moving and colorful. There’s always a rainbow static aura around everything. Recently I’ve been seeing white comets streak down very fast in my peripheral vision, or a very quick white flash, or even one time where I saw black cracks emerging from my view. Those scare me the most, because it happens at random. Most frightening of all however are my thoughts, I have been heavily paranoid recently. Always thinking my friends are up to something bad, thinking they dislike me or are planning something. I have thoughts of my family hurting me, and me having to kill them. These are all thoughts that terrify me because I genuinely feel like it’ll happen one day where I have to defend myself. I just don’t know what’s happening, I hate to self diagnose but are these the early stages of psychosis? What is wrong with me? I do not take medication, nor do I have access to therapy or any sort of treatment as of now. I have trust issues with those things, I don’t trust them.",26Dec2020,1

With that out of the way, I will not insult your intelligence by restating my question, it’s in the title. To start, I have trouble sleeping every night, I toss and turn and simply can’t fall asleep, and when I finally do I wake up in brief interims of time. For instance, I will fall asleep and wake up 2 hours later, and then another hour after that. 

Throughout the day, I feel like a zombie and my mind cannot make a single thought with clarity, it feels like my head is full of fog or I’m groggy. I used to be able to pride myself, weird I know but I’m an ambitious person and I like to challenge myself often, by being able to do mental math pretty quickly in my head. However, with this going it’s like I will attempt to do so and the thought gets completely jumbled in my head. 

I take melatonin to help me sleep, and it does help some, although I don’t feel I should have to rely on it to just sleep every night. 

I don’t believe it’s stress related, as I’m not a very stressed person, and I do exercise as often as I can. I feel it may be diet, specifically too much sugar. I don’t exactly eat the healthiest, which I’m sure is a contributing factor. I know I need to quit but with time and all being an issue sometimes, it can get hard. 

I just want to be able to think clearly and make rational decisions again without feeling completely stupid and to be able to stay awake during the day or anything like that. It also totally dumps on my motivation and impacts my mood and interactions with others. Any help is appreciated.",26Dec2020,1

However, starting a few months ago I did, and they're always in third person likr a movie, as if my view is a camera, and sometimes I'm not even in the dream myself, but am always far away. But lately I've been getting closer to myself, and the dreams have felt increasingly more off, like the feeling in Coraline where she's with her other mother and family, and I'm getting really scared to slipping away into that with it becoming my reality. I know I'm real and this world is real, it just greatly doesn't feel like it and often question it, and I'm scared that the dream world will become feeling more real and I'll get stuck or completely messed up.

I am getting worse and worse by the day, i barely eat or sleep and im hurting myself almost everyday

I've been getting abused since i was a toddler, both physically and emotionally and by different members of my family over the years. Back when I lived with my whole family (0-9) basically everyone abused me, both my siblings didn't like me and would bully me, my mother hit me and treat me like I was the worst thing to happen to her and my dad frequently hit me, yelled at me and would throw/slam my head into things. once even giving me a concussion that had me sick for days.

It continued and even got worse with my mother when we escaped my father but me and my siblings are now on good terms. My mum constantly yells at me for anything from having ""attitude"" to being ""rude"" to even using the bathroom , and no I'm not exaggerating that last one. For context me being ""rude"" is both me not talking and talking too much, being too reserved and being to forward and basically anything I do she finds a problem with. she is constantly manipulating me and blaming me for everything wrong, she once called me a ""selfish brat"" for cutting myself and she frequently mocked me for it. she also doesn't let me see a therapist despite it being covered by our provinces healthcare and I've been asking for almost 3 and a half years now.

I've been suicidal for a long time and have been cutting since I was around 10(?) but I cant bare living in this house anymore. i cut around everyday now. The only thing I can seem to do is either run away or kill myself. I've been looking into youth shelters, lgbt shelters (I'm ftm trans) and even mental health facilities but I don't know if they'll let someone who runaway stay their without their parents knowledge.

the only time i really feel ok anymore is either when cutting or when talking to people on hotlines..

73,"I have been with my boyfriend for over 2.5 ish years, and my insecurities regarding his ex has been a recurring topic.

He broke up with her 2 years before he met me but they were friends while we started dating. I tried to be really cool with it, but started to become increasingly uncomfortable with their relationship, as she would often contact him about relationship problems, and sometimes even call him in the middle of the night. I asked him to tone it down, but it did not really change any of her behavior, so less than a year into us being official, he decided to cut off contact with her for my sake. Except she didn't get it the first time around and he had to reiterate again that she needs to stop contacting him.

I think I was pretty decent about my insecurities then despite being uncomfortable, and I continued to be really good about it for a good while afterwards. What triggered a new onslaught on insecurities was when she sent him an invitation to a reunion of sorts of college friends (not as big as it sounds -- it would be her, my boyfriend and 2 other guys) after not having spoken to him for more than a year. My boyfriend did not reply to the invitation, but he did ask me if I would be okay with him going. I had a complete breakdown over that because all I could think about is how much he wants to see his ex. I told him that it's wrong of her to just ask to hang out with him after he made it clear that their thing is over, but all he did was get angry at me and tell me that she's just tone deaf, but does not mean any harm by it. He later assured me that he just wants to see the other two guys because it's hard to pin them down, but since then I have had a lot of trouble finding any peace.

I constantly compare myself and his ex. I'm always on a quest to prove to myself that he loves me more. I've been trying to get better at it, but I have no idea what to do and my constant questioning is wearing down my boyfriend. Today was a decent day up until the stroke of misfortune by which his ex literally texted him after 1.5 years of not talking. She texted to ask what would be a good gift for someone of his profession. I find that super unnecessary because 1. it's Christmas day already 2. my boyfriend does not know whoever she's trying to get a present for -- just google it if you are that stuck. I asked him to tell her once again to leave him alone, since she does not seem to get the message after being told exactly what was expected of her.

He did it, but he also actually gave her gift advice and told her that I'm not cool with them being in contact, rather than just telling her to not contact him again. He insists that he just wants to be polite and just resolve this peacefully, but it makes me really uncomfortable that she might be getting the message that he wants to be friends but I am just getting in the way, which is going to prompt her to try to contact him again. I really want to believe that he's not still trying to preserve that relationship, but I can't keep the bad thoughts away that he would actually rather be with her. It does not help that I think she's being really disrespectful to our relationship, but my boyfriend just excuses it as tone deafness. I just have this deep burning anger for her, which is useless because she does not even know I'm constantly wishing the worst for her. It's just a waste of energy.

77,"Hi there my names Leo, im 23 M. I've had ongoing struggles with mental health issues the last 8 years, over this time receiving  at least 3 diagnosis' (depression, ADHD, and the most recent being schizophrenia).

Across all of the counselling and medications i have tried, nothing has proven to be effective, and my  symptoms still remain. It has been such a hard few years and i am so devoted to finding something that will improve my quality of life, although it seems hopeless after so many failed attempts.

It has stopped me from being able to work and im addicted to weed (its the only escape i have as no clinical medication has worked.) This is ruining my life and I just want to feel myself again.

My symptoms:

I have a few issues but I will try and list the most prominent ones.

* Im always stuck in my head, i zone out and i miss what people say to me, im constantly overthinking everything from the smallest things, to the biggest problems. I tend to also catastrophise the smallest thoughts into big scary manifestations, its crippling. I can't distract myself from these thoughts and even playing my favourite game won't even satisfy me. I cant concentrate and i feel this overthinking is potentially dangerous. (they are all my own authentic thoughts, and not intrusive thoughts). These thoughts are almost always negative thoughts, i am extremely pessimistic.
* I feel no pride in myself or anything I do. My self esteem is low i dont think im capable of doing things anymore and i get no reward feeling from completing tasks such as cleaning the house or going to work, or things as simple as cooking a nice meal. 
* I have lost pleasure in things i used to enjoy. I dont go out and try new things anymore, I find that I wont because i don't enjoy them. I know i am supposed to be having fun and there is nothing boring with the activity im doing, but I just feel numb and bored.
* Im impatient and I always finish peoples sentences. I feel like i know what they are going to say and i finish it for them, its a habit and i feel i do it because i want the conversation to be over with. not because I dont enjoy the topic, but i just feel a weird sense of urgency and impatience with everything.
* Im impulsive. I do things or say things without putting any thought into it, im always aware after the fact but i can come off as really rude sometimes, it comes across as i am not empatchic at all and i dont care about what i say, its like i dont know what ive done wrong.
* Depression. I just feel sad, not for any particular reason, i think this is maybe cause by my negative overthinking.

This has been ruining my life for as long as its been a problem and I just want to move on with my life and be happy, I have a baby on the way and so much to live for, i just want to feel that way.

Is my diagnosis correct ? what do you think it could be if not ? please let me know your advice, I really appreciate you taking the time, this is very important to me and my family.

81,"TL;DR- I think I may be going down the road to a very serious mental illness but I don't know what it is. 

I am diagnosed with a few ""serious"" mental illnesses. Bipolar Schizoaffective Disorder (which for years was full blown schizophrenia but that is what my current psychiatrist is calling it), Dissociative Derealization Disorder, and PTSD. (among a few other ones)

I have the memory of a gold fish. While I remember a lot of trauma, and some important things. I forget things far more frequently than I should, and don't remember most of my life. This memory loss is being noted by people close to me, very frequently. I almost never remember medical/mental appointments, and always forget to put them in my phone so I can remember about them. I am ""missing"" time, but have yet to be told I've done/said anything to anyone that I can't remember. (though the gaps in my youth may yield different results) Half the time, I don't know what day it is, and if it wasn't for work, I would never know the current day of the week, or the date. 

When I wake up in the morning, my environment is almost always unfamiliar to me, even though nothing much has changed in my environment for many many years. I know where I'm going if I need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, so it's obvious that I ""know"" my surroundings, but they look unfamiliar most of the time. Kind of like I'm revisiting my childhood bedroom and everything is just how I left it, if that makes any sense. 

I feel as though I am drifting through life. As I explain it to others, imagine being drunk and high but without the falling over/etc. Just the way your mind feels. If that doesn't help, imagine you have been awake for a few days. You know what you're doing, but you're not fully there. I'm barely aware, but I am aware enough to do what I need to be independent. It's basically like I'm watching someone else's life through their eyes, but have a little bit of control over what they do.

I could go on for hours (and I have before) about everything that's been wrong with me throughout the years, and everything is just getting worse as time goes on. I've been on a variety of different meds throughout the years, but they only help keep me a little more ""level"". 

I can vaguely remember what I felt like before things were this bad, but I don't remember what it feels like to feel in control of my mind. My reality ""broke"" when I was 7, and nothing has felt real to me since. I vividly remember the moment, and ""reason"" everything began to feel fake. Which is a perfect example of my ""odd awareness"" (as doctors have described it) of what's going on with my mind, while still being unaware in basically every other aspect of life. 

  
I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this, to be honest. Maybe someone has an answer or insight that no one else in my life is giving me. So I guess I'm posting in hopes that someone will have an idea of what's going on, if they experienced something similar in some way.   


Again, I could go on for hours, but I'll end it here and answer any other questions in the comments.",26Dec2020,1
82,"hi. so i know i’m a bit young to be on here. but i thought i’d give it a try here cause the responses are better than in other communities.

since i was eleven i’ve had severe anxiety and i’ve had physical tics (neck, head, eyes) for a little over a month. 

but i met this kid (m15, 14 at the time) and had decided to be his friend. and we’ve grown closer recently after we started gaming together on weekends and school breaks.

i always knew he was cool. but within these past two months i’ve realized he’s got super cool hobbies and is overall really nice.

i remember he sent me some video that had a title similar to “you and your best friend in twenty years” and i was like oh my god! best friend? really?

i really just started sobbing. i had never been so happy. i’ve never had a real best friend. at least not since i was four or five.

i cried every night for a month about how much i love my best friend and how happy i am to be his best friend too.

after i came out to him a few weeks later, he was the only person to respect me and still is. he’d casually call me them in front of his brothers and on phone calls.  

i started to get really obsessed. and i feel like it’s only become worse.

the night i started having tics was while i was playing overwatch with him. and i didn’t want to leave. cause playing overwatch with him is when i’m most happy.

this had never happened to me before. i’d have these small jerks in my neck. and they started to really hurt.

but eventually i realized it was serious and i needed to talk to my mom. i showed her and she panicked. the whole house panicked. and everyone was freaking out cause this had never happened before.

and all i wanted was to talk to my best friend because i know he’d care. i was even more upset, only making my tics worse because i wanted to talk to him.

after i saw my doctor (yet to see a neurologist), she said just to stay calm and stuff so i’ve been trying.

but whenever i happen to have a trigger, i get extremely upset because i wish i could see my best friend.  

i find myself crying and hiding in my room or distracting myself when he’s busy. because i really wish i could talk to him all hours of the day, not even just when i’m feeling anxious. 

and it’s gotten to the point where i’m afraid i’ll ruin our friendship by saying even the slightest thing wrong. 

i’ll sit in front of my keyboard for hours, wondering what to say. i get so stressed and start picking at my skin and biting my nails. because i don’t want to lose my best friend.

i’ve made another friend (m16) i have a similar problem with. and he’s really sweet which is the issue. because i’m even more obsessed. i’ll just constantly check his social medias to see if he’s unfollowed me and gotten bored of me.

i’ve tried to write in a diary but there’s too much in my head to put into words.

and i’ve tried to talk to another close friend (f14) and she’s just romanticized it and said stuff like “oh how cute!” and will act like it’s an ideal friendship. 

and i’m not necessarily saying that it’s because of my anxiety, but i felt the mental health sub would understand a little.

i just really need advice as to what to do. do i stop being friends with him? do i distance myself? i just really want to stop being so anxious all the time and so dependent on these two guys.",26Dec2020,1

I can’t kill myself because it would hurt many people and I’m just too scared to. But I don’t wanna be here. I can’t do this. It’s Christmas which means gathering as a family and that makes things so much worse, and that snowballs and makes me feel worse. I hate being around people. Especially my family. I’m judged for so much and that doesn’t bother me. But I’m bothered more so by my dad. He hits my sister while I’m away at college. I can’t stand to be around him anymore, even when he’s happy-go-lucky. I hate it. I’m trying to figure out what to do about that to help my sister (please no one try and intervene, I am handling it) and I guess that’s another reason I can’t. I have to help her. He also cheated on my mom when I was very little and they stayed together for us. My moms never directly blamed shit on me with that, but some things she says I know are correlated with me basically being the cause for our disfunctional house and the reason they’re still together and so hateful. I haven’t cried since the last time I tried to kill myself and got really close (almost 3 years ago). The same year my coach killed himself. At college this year, I got news a kid I coached for 2 years shot himself in the head (intentionally, he left a note and everything). He was 14, and for anyone that had coached or taught, you know you have a certain kind of care and love for your players. And those things hit me even harder it seems. Two days later a former teacher of mine back home killer himself too. Then a week after that, a family friend who was practically my second dad died of alcoholism. Then, a month ago today, my current college coach also died of a heart attack. He was the one from that team who fully supported me and I was open with. He was amazing. This shit is too ducking much. I simply can’t. 

The reason I know I’m a shitty boyfriend too is I don’t know how to help. Well I do, but I can’t do so without feeling so fucking bad. My girlfriend has been struggling recently, and all I wanna do is help. I’m always there, and try and say the right things. But the thing is it also stresses me. I don’t let her see that, I know it’s not what she needs at those times, so I’m calm and collected it seems because that’s what she needs. But I can’t handle it in myself. It sometimes makes me go full blown panic mode. Of course I don’t show this, because I wanna help. I know she’s the best thing for me but I can’t help but feel guilty, like I am the cause for her stress and sadness. Like I am a shit human because I can’t fix it. I know that’s so stupid, but that’s the best explanation I have. And then I feel even more guilty, because I should be helping her and I should not be all worked up about it and just help (even though I do. This is literally all an internal conflict).

I feel so fucking trapped and hopeless. I opened up, and have gone to therapy. The psychologist is actually amazing. I love her. I’ve tried many of the things she recommends. Some have helped for a short amount of time. My mom got me to do this after all those events this fall. Then she told my whole family about it. I feel I’m treated lesser than everyone else here now. Like I’m some China wear that they have to treat carefully or I’ll break. In the fall I had about a two month span where I would drink everyday (I would go to class drunk, practice drunk, did everything except drive drunk), and I functioned better like that. Except one night I was so wasted I told two of my close friends back home about having depression and anxiety and shit (I hate saying I have that. I don’t know why. I’m diagnosed and shit but I still don’t feel my problems are big enough to be considered that) and now I don’t wanna be around them. They’re supportive and haven’t changed, but I have. Now that they know I just feel like less of a person to them. I’ve pushed them away and hide away in my room, I don’t hang out anymore. 

5 days ago I had a panic attack. Stupid me took 15 migraine pills and felt like I was going to die. I was fine, but during this attack it turned out I also sliced myself open and didn’t notice till the next day. Since then I don’t know why, but I can’t stop. My arms look like I got attacked by a cat. My leg the same. I just do it. I think it’s because I think it will toughen me up. I also slammed my head so hard I can’t hear very well from my right ear right now. I think this may be a minor panic attack right now. I’m covered in blood. I don’t know why I do this. Society associates these things with the “it’s just a phase” emo kids. I’m not. I don’t want attention. That’s why this is anonymous, plus no one will read it. But I’m pretty normal on the outside. I’m from a farm town. I’m writing this with my cowboy boots and jeans on, my truck outside. I go to college where I’m one of the “tough guys”, and am quite popular amongst athletes and normal people because of the news. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. My mom said she “will help fix me”. I didn’t like that. It makes me feel less human. Help has made everything worse. Sometimes I wanna go back to being lonely where no one knew anything other than the happy go lucky dude who played baseball, because I internalized everything. I just don’t want to do this shit anymore. I feel like I wanna mutualize myself until I need to go to a hospital. Maybe they’ll help me or something. I just can’t fuckinh do it. I can’t kill myself, but I also can’t go on. I’m just stuck. I’m stuck. It’s physically painful too and I hate it. I can’t drink anymore either, or it just gets 10x worse. I can’t even look at any substance without just wanting to get so fucking high or drunk that I forget my name. I carry a knife so when I have a tough time I can give me that edge. I just fucking hate life and myself. I hate the way I am. I’m sorry for all of this. I don’t expect anything. I needed to say it.",26Dec2020,1
85,"Some stuff happened that I won’t go into detail about since that causes my mental state to go back, but my first instinct was to do damage in some way, but before I could got too deep into that thought I remembered underage drinking won’t land me as much prison time as starting a fire. Now that I’m realizing how fucked up my mind is, in ways I haven’t listed, it’s telling me to just buy some razors and start cutting myself again.

86,"It’s hard to process things that you’re over, but have had lasting effects. Something happened that has really messed me up. I’m not sad about the event itself anymore, but upset about the ramifications of it. The messages that this event sent me about who I am, my value as a person, etc. It was one of those situations that felt like a last opportunity, and now I sit here feeling like my chance are gone, there is no hope, etc. Sometimes thinking about makes me feel apathetic and other times it makes me feel sad. I think that it will be one of those life events that changes you permanently. 

It’s like spilling pasta sauce on your shirt, and months down the line no longer being pissed at yourself for spilling it, but still having to see the stain. I can see the stains. I hate and I can’t get over the fact that they’re still there.",26Dec2020,1
87,"What are panic attacks? Are they hyperventilating to the point you can’t breathe?Are these panic attacks or just crying sessions?

Whenever I have these experiences it’s always just thoughts. I rarely panic because of outside forces. I think I panic because I feel a lack of control in my own thoughts. I’m afraid of being deluded, or narcissistic. I’m afraid of being blind to things about myself. It often causes these experiences. It often leads me to not want to express my emotions. Because I feel I don’t deserve to. 

I mentally compare it to an obese person getting angry at Dr. Now because they haven’t been following the diet.

I’m afraid of not seeing what’s wrong with me. When I think about the way my sister believes she does no wrong and that we should essentially worship her, I become afraid that I’m exactly the same. I’m only a bit more self-aware because of my interest in psychology.

It makes me panic because I’m afraid of becoming the exact thing I hate so much. The exact thing that has sucked the life out of me.

91,"Hi everyone! This is my first post and it’s something that’s really important for me since it’s been something that has been bothering me for a while. 

I live with an amazing person, who, like me, has mental health issues. Since I’ve finished therapy and taken meditation, I have been able to maintain a very happy lifestyle and I’m able to help myself immediately with minor inconveniences. However, my friend tends to feel low more often and I always try to be there for them, but I’m still not at the point where I feel like I can help others without affecting my own well-being, which really sucks. 

I really want to be able to give people help and support they need but talking about mental health still brings a lot of uncomfortable feelings and triggers past memories from my life. Because of that, I tend to feel anxious during my friend’s low points and I feel like it’s affecting me way more than it should, however, I don’t want to back up and ignore someone else’s health but instead, I want to become more comfortable with talking about mental health without feeling so triggered.

96,"Rewind 2 years ago, I had my first relationship. But when I broke up with my partner, he got mad and sent me death threats. During that time I was terrified, I cried, I was shaking, I could not sleep straight, etc. Everytime I thought of that memory, I get scared and could not think straight. Go back to the present, I had the chance to be in another relationship. But I refused immediately. Even though the person asking for a relationship did not react angrily, in fact he was actually very friendly afterwards, I still felt the same fear I had during my last relationship. My breath noticeably became faster, I was scared, I almost cried, and I could not focus straight again. I am starting to get worried since I do not think that getting terrified from a memory from a few years ago can make someone very scared as if that event is happening right now.

I feel so alone in this world like I don't belong and I feel like I can't relate to anyone around me. Im scared that i'm a narcissist because i do have moments where i think i'm better than everyone else around me but then a few moments later i get humbled once i look in the mirror, im not sure if this is a god complex or mania but i literally go crazy and feel like i'm multiple different people. Going off of that I find myself over analyzing every little thing in this world and the people in it to the point where i know exactly how someone acts or what they will say next, I then try and match myself to the person in little ways to make myself seem relatable and likable. I know this isn't healthy but whenever I meet someone new that peaks my interest I can't help but over analyze and obsess over them, day dreaming about them. I hate that I am like this and I don't want to be, ever since I was little my mother has always screamed at me to stop obsessing over things and I thought that was just her being a dick but now that I get older it scares me because aha think she is right, I do obsess but I can't help it. I get obsessed with music, people, ideas, what ifs, food, shows, fictional characters. 

  Whenever I look into the mirror I see myself differently than I did before even if it was just seconds before. I often imagine what I look like to other people and try and view myself through their eyes using my imagination because i am so scared about what I look like. I go through these periods where i don't eat or barely eat anything every day for weeks and then I will return to normal and then all of a sudden start skipping meals. I just want to be skinny so I can look and dress the way I want to, not for anyone else. I hate the body and skin I am in. the thought of food has made me throw up on many occasions. I just don't want to be this way anymore, i have been dealing with this for the past 8 years of my life and am at my breaking point. I saw a therapist when I was 13/14 and haven't seen one since (i am now 19). I have tried asking my family for help with finding another therapist but they either ignore me or tell me i am crazy. I aldo don't think that my mom realizes how badly her words hurt me, every day I get called something for little to no reason at all. Today i was actually napping and she came to wake me up and i said ""okay i will get up"" and she called me a rude bitch and slammed my door.

99,"After a couple of rough years, I've found some happiness lately. My wife and I have retired, we are financially solvent, and we're still in love. Unfortunately, over 250,000 of our fellow citizens have died from the world's latest pestilence. Mental health resources are stretched thin, social workers are exhausted, medical staff are exhausted, other people's financial resources are exhausted, and people are *miserable.*

I want to do something useful, but I don't know what. I'm not interested in *feeling better*. I want to help *someone* *else* feel better. I would prefer to do it anonymously, because there's nothing honorable about showing off.

With respect to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, I'm minded to focus on donating to the local food bank. However, I'm more worried about the mental health of the other members of my community. The local Social Security office is quite generous with its food stamps; people are getting enough to eat; they're well-fed, but they're depressed. I can see it in their eyes. They're hurting. I have no idea what to do.

Ideas:-

* Donate to the food bank (as I said earlier)
* Cook for friends, to save them from having to buy the groceries, cooking them, doing the dishes, etc.
* Slip $10 bills into random mailboxes at neighboring houses

Or another that taught you how to help your children or friends with BPD. 

But what do you feel would make the perfect mental health YT channel? Are there elements in any of the current channels (as good as soooo many of them are, I must say) that are just missing? 

Sometimes I feel as though it would be great if a channel existed where you could learn about a disorder/illness/have someone interviewed who suffers from it with a montage of clips from “real life” episodes or breakdowns, and then what helped them with links to resources and perhaps how other countries take the approach to mental health.

Throwaway because I don't want this on my main account in case someone finds it. I'm an adult, and legally in full control of medical decisions. I've got an abusive home situation I've been dealing with for my entire life.

In short, everything that goes on during an involuntary psychiatric hold, as I found out a few days ago when I tried to go to a hospital for treatment, only to have my abuser tell the hospital that I was suicidal before I could give any information. This led to PTSD symptoms, which I'm trying to obtain treatment for, but am terrified that my abuser will repeat their actions, leading to my situation getting worse. I would also like to leave the situation and get my own place to live, but I'm worried about my abuser calling the police (who will absolutely believe them over me) and telling them I'm suicidal or homicidal so they'll hunt me down and force me to return.

When you grow up you don't grow with depression, it is formed over time. Many people have it, but they may not notice when you have depression you can feel hopeless or suicidal even, but the worst thing is when you feel alone. You feel you don't matter but you do, The worst thing a person with depression can do is give up. When life hits you hard you've got to look forward because no matter what age you are you always have a future to look to. 
If you do have depression you shouldn't keep it a secret, you should always tell someone
But there are people who you shouldn't tell because they might just say What are you depressed about or You just want attention”. But if you are depressed you have a right to want attention to it, Your wanting people to care isn't wrong it's human.
Different people have different causes for it, It could be family, bullies, or even being rejected by a crush. But you can't let these things pull you down, you have to break through all that.
No one can tell you how to stop your depression, but there could be things to help you get through this. The best way is to surround yourself with people who love and care about you, Even if you don't think so it's not true there will always be at least one person to help you. If you’re like me, you don't want anyone to know so you hide it, But a lot of the times it could build up so much you explode with tears it doesn't even matter where you are at, I know, because it happened to me in school a few times. If you are silent about how you feel speak up or look for things to make you happy like hobbies or listening to music, something you’d enjoy.
If you don't want to talk to anyone, keep a diary or journal to write your feelings in and hide it. Even if you're a guy It's okay to have a journal or diary It's just a name, And it's okay to cry. Crying actually can help release the stress weighing on you. For all the people who don’t have depression, this is my favorite quote from Dr.Seuss
“ Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it's not” Because even if you don’t know what someone is going through you have to show you care to make that person’s day even a little better. 

Dear reader, I know you need a friend if you read this so if you ever need anyone feel free to email me- misterimperfect24@gmail.com I believe I can help you and I'm always here to listen and be a friend  so remember you are loved.

I thought that I moved on, but in this week I’ve started remembering again about my ex and her family! When I sleep, I remember her and her family! So, my anxiety starts and I wake up! I can’t sleep well!

117,"I’m 15 years old (F), and I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist who’s now my therapist I guess? I see him every two weeks, I don’t think it’s helping. I feel so bad, I’ve been nagging my parents to take me since I was 10 and it’s not helping me. 10 years old is when all my intrusive thoughts started. The persistently violent and sexual and just unwanted thoughts that still torment me all began, I just wanted to go so I can finally get diagnosed with OCD so I can put that to bed, you know? Not cure it but I think getting an official diagnosis would help me. But no, I have now been diagnosed with depression and agoraphobia and panic disorder. No offense to my psychiatrist he’s nice and all but I don’t think I need to figure myself out, I’ve gone 5 years without any sort of help so I pretty much had to do it all myself. I just walk out of the sessions, empty. Unchanging. I feel no positive change. I feel so empty, I feel so empty about feeling empty I don’t know what to do anymore. Therapy and getting diagnosed with agoraphobia just instigated a new wave of intrusive thoughts, and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m having mental breakdowns for weeks on end. I fill the void with my writing, and analyzing cartoons and my art and all that, and those are the only times I feel not-empty. Even if it’s just for a moment, I feel okay.

127,"Oh where to begin...
I guess I should start by saying I have suffered from depression, anxiety and panic attack disorder for 10 years now, I'm 21 years old. 

I have had a lot of underlying issues over years found out by working with therapists and through institutions, but these are a story for another time as I don't want this post to be endless... 

For a long time I have wanted to try and end things, most times I ended up in A &amp; E or our local mental health institution for a week or so.

This may sound odd as I'm not very good at using my words but, it's not that I don't want to live, I think it's more the fact that I've never felt like I belong here. no matter how many good things I have in my life; the idea of death (being at peace) felt a lot more appealing to me.

So earlier this week it was a regular night and absolutely nothing happened to trigger this in me: I drank half a bottle of whiskey and then took an overdose (an amount that should have killed me 3 times over) then went to a remote location to lay down and die. Obviously in these moments I was very upset, but not for me, only for my family as I knew this would destroy them. As I started to fade away, I was thinking about what I had done, I was so... Peaceful, the idea of being nothing and existing nowhere felt like such a relief, and I was actually excited to go.

(warning : this next part may be a bit graphic) 

After saying goodbye to everyone, My boyfriend found me after looking up my location on Snapchat, which I, stupidly, forgot to turn off. He took me home and shoved his fingers down my throat to make me throw up the pills that hadn't already settled into my bloodstream. Then he called an ambulance and off I went to the hospital where they pumped me full of fluids and stabilised me. 

Long story short: I survived. I told everyone that I regret doing what I did but the truth is, the only thing I regret is not turning off my location. I was so close.

I have everything to live for: an amazing and beautiful family that loves me, a boyfriend who treats me right, a roof over my head and food to eat. 
But now knowing how close I was to death, I want to end it more than ever. My boyfriend has put my medication and all objects I could harm myself with in a lockbox so now I have no way of doing so.. 

So I guess my question to you is: I have everything to live for, so why is it that I still want to die?",26Dec2020,1

130,"Hello everyone, 

Merry Christmas to everyone who celebrates and I hope that everyone is hanging in there with whatever they are going through. I'm sure that everyone of us is struggling in one way or another, so I hope that the days are easy on everyone's hearts and minds. 

Please excuse the long elaboration, but I can't keep anything short for the life of me and I'm in need of advice. I've been a mess throughout this year, I suffer from depression, anxiety, I have commitment issues, etc. But a few months ago I met the most amazing guy ever (I'm 30 and he's 28) - we just clicked right away, it was magical. Until he left me without a word.

We understood each other without words. We are both very giving people, so it was beautiful ...I had just ended something complicated and he was healing from toxic and abusive relationships. I made it clear that I am not looking for anything, and he told me, that he's not looking either, he just takes things as they come and he's still figuring things out and rebuilding himself, but then we both got swept up pretty quickly. 

One time, he told me about a girl he used to hook up with, who met up with him and wanted to get into a relationship with him. He told her, that he doesn't feel the same way and then told me, that he told her about me. This was very much in the beginning, and I was like: What? And he continued: Yes, I told her I met a girl on tinder, and that she makes everything a million times better by just existing. 

His ex also reached out to him in that time, and it helped him how I was by his side and then he told me, he doesn't know what he even saw in her now, and how he was putting her on a pedestal. 

The physical part of a relationship is very difficult for me, my last and only relationship was 8 years ago and ended after it got physical (he was very religious and couldn't stand the 'guilt' that came with the feeling) - he was my best friend and I felt used. It was very hard for me to open up to anyone since then and as I need the emotional connection and feel safe, the guy I met on tinder was the first one I got physically intimate with after that - I felt safe, he was incredibly caring, understanding and sweet and it was all about me. 

This happened three times - then he started to distance himself. In the country I'm currently in guys are enlisted into the military after they finish their education. He had the medical exam that day, and they told him that he had to come in again after a few months. It's very hard on him, as he's felt stuck the whole year because of this and he's just working on his business, but needs to know if he's getting into the military or not, to be able to actually start it. I knew that he struggled a lot with this and with the lack of routine.

It was the first day he didn't text me good morning. After that, the texts became less frequent and he started isolating himself ...weeks after we met once shortly and I could literally feel how drained he was. He would tell me, how sorry he was, but he had no energy to go anywhere, to get up and get dressed, he can't text, but that I should call him, he would pick up. However, my mind went into panic mode: ""See, that's what happens when you open up to people. Noone wants you, because you are disgusting. He's just too nice to tell you that. He's letting you down slowly."" 

I tried to fight my own demons as he continued to tell me how sorry he was, that it had nothing to do with me, how much he misses me and wants to see me and that he just hopes I forgive him for this and for the lack of energy, and I told him I understood and kept asking about him every few days or so. Calling someone gives me anxiety, when I don't feel 100% comfortable that the other person really wants to hear from me...and I still had this tiny voice in my head, that he doesn't really want me.  So I never called.

I fell into a hole myself - I stopped going out, and got depressed. I'm really glad that I have an amazing flatmate, that was  there for me through it all. After 3 weeks I decided that I needed to change things, I finally started replying to messages that have been piling up for months to meet with old friends and relatives. I knew that he had noone to pull him out of his hole. He doesn't have a close friend he confides in. I was the second person he trusted with his schizophrenia (which he now had 'under control'). Or that's what he told me, of course. 

I convinced myself that this is not about me, that he might need help and decided that I needed to get him out of his hole...as if he knew it, he texted me first on that Friday and asked if I would be free on Sunday. I was euphoric and said yes, of course. Then he never texted again. On Sunday afternoon I asked if we are still on for tonight, and how I understand how hard it is for him, that I don't really wanna push him, but that I think he needs to get out of the house. He replied immediately and apologized, told me that something came up with his brother and that he won't be able to make it, how incredibly sorry he was and if we could make it tomorrow, with the promise not to cancel this time. I was already busy and told him that it's okay, but that I can't, and that I'm busy for the rest of the week, but that I'd keep him updated. 

I was devastated, it felt like he was hoping that I'd forget about meeting up and came up with an excuse...like, why didn't he tell me immediately when he knew he couldn't make it? I would have understood, but that way I felt played. I went onto tinder and for whatever reason checked his profile and saw that he had updated it with the phrase: ""....wait till you find out about the massive emotional walls and how I like driving people away to protect my fragile, broken heart."" 

I know how I isolate myself but still would be active on social media, but seeing that he went on tinder broke me a little. I texted him after a week again, because I promised. I apologized and told him that a lot has been going on and that I can't make it this week either (which was true), but that I wanted to check up on him. He never replied. I checked his tinder again, where he had updated his bio to something, something, 'fighting his own demons first' ....great at listening and giving good advice, but bad at giving said good advice to himself ...not looking for a relationship right now, as his exes really made sure of that'.

I unmatched him after that, knowing that it was doing me no good to check it. 

Long story short ....I still think about him and miss him every day. We were never exclusive, and I'm not sure if it's important or not, but the last time I saw him, I  met with a guy friend of mine who wears a lot of perfume. I hugged him, and when I got into the car of the tinder guy, he immediately told me: you smell different ....  
and I don't know why it caught me completely off guard and I told him, that I just mixed different perfumes together today and that may be why. I don't know why I did it, but I didn't want him to get a false impression, besides I haven't seen him in forever by that time and it was just, I didn't wanna make it awkward - the perfume guy is also into me, so I guess I felt kind of bad about it....but yeah, I never gave it much thought and randomly remembered that detail  weeks after , and I do wonder if that added to his distance, but I don't know. Maybe I'm also trying to find anything to blame myself and find some rationality in the chaos...the thing that drives me mad is that it was GOOD, we were magical together and it didn't make sense that it ended like this. 

It has been a month with no contact, he never replied to my message and I'm not sure if I should reach out again. I wonder if he's okay, if he still cares, if he's completely fine and living his life and already forgot all about me? Does he need my help? Did he just ghost me and I'm trying to find excuses? I honestly don't know, I'm meeting other people, but nothing compares and I feel like I'm not really healing, but distracting myself. The perfume guy is still kind of there, but he just lacks the depth the other guy had. But emotional depth seems to come with its own issues. I'm not sure if it's a prerequisite to be damaged in one way or another to be able to connect with another human being on such a profound level as we did. 

I read a great article about [social isolation](https://whatsyourgrief.com/social-isolation/) to be able to understand it better, but I'm still at loss at what to do, because I feel so rejected and unwanted. Does he even care? He hasn't asked about me at all. Have I done all there is to do? Should I leave it at that? Should I reach out again and wish him a happy new year? Will it turn into something toxic and draining for the both of us? Will I get hurt even more? I feel how I never want to open up to anyone ever again.

If you've come that far, I can't thank you enough. Thank you for your time and for caring. 

Take care and stay safe.",26Dec2020,1
131,"I have a diagnosis of mild depression, generalised anxiety disorder and social anxiety. I recieved this diagnosis when I was 17 and scared of being completely honest.

Social situations make me anxious, I worry about stupid little things. I want to kill myself. I have nightmares about people trying to kill me, I have flashbacks of being bullied, I hate everything about myself physical and personality wise, I often eat until I feel like I'm going to throw up, I cut, punch and bite myself, I pick at my skin, I have become super impulsive which has led to me running away and chopping my hair off among other things, one time I went through a phase of starving myself, I can get super excited out of nowhere like my emotions just flip, being in two minds so much that I argue with myself out loud.

And then on top of it, she often talks about people who nobody knows and she must realize it. Like she talks about her friends, who none of us know, but as if we would know them. She also will just come up to us and talk. Like my boyfriend and I are sitting here using our laptops trying to catch up on some emails, and she just sits down and starts talking.

137,"Hello everyone, something has been bothering me recently and I’d like to get your opinions on it. So throughout my childhood and teenage years I was always told that I was pouting or being a baby, but the more supportive people in my life (namely my girlfriend and a couple other close friends) make me wonder if this is true.

An example of my behavior is this: Let’s say I’m going to a big party later in the week and I’m excited, but a couple days before the party it gets cancelled. In some cases I have a hard time brushing it off, so I may be quieter, more withdrawn, not wearing the happiest face, etc. It’s extremely rare that I’ll lash out on people around me or directly make people feel bad. Now in this case the supportive people around me would help me feel better and maybe hang out with me, but my family would say something like “Stop pouting, you’re just making everyone else feel worse.” I don’t know what to think anymore.

I've never been to therapy and never been diagnosed with anything, but I'm fairly certain I deal with depression and definitely anxiety. 

When the slightest of things goes wrong, and I'm left with my own mind (no immediate, HUGE distractions), my internal voice will just start planting every possible *worse* outcome in my head. It's not just like ""hearing voices"" because the voice is *mine.* 

Someone doesn't text me back when I'm fully expecting them to, and I start saying things like ""They don't actually like you. You know it, everyone knows it"" and with someone I'm interested in, it's that same thing with more ""they're just trying to ease away from you because they don't want to be harsh"" and ""they're with someone way more interesting than you. You're not good enough for them""

I sent her the contact information for when she’s ready but should I call to inquire? Are there any resources out there that could help? Are there any programs that provide therapy for free or has fee assistance programs in Florida? I know she’s having suicidal thoughts because she feels she could’ve prevented it but she did everything she could. She went looking for him, warned called his family, called the police, and so much more. I just feel stuck and I really want to help. Any advice will be much appreciated.

149,"I've really tried looking up why I have this behaviour. But it's really hard to find anything about it.

Ever since middle school, I imagine myself in thrilling situations, such as having superpowers or leading a revolution, with usually accompanying music/media like trailers.

The music itself is generally really important. As it gets me in the mood and feeling. If the music isn't at the right moment, or I lose focus, I don't get any kick out of it. And then when I sync the daydream with that music, so like, a drop in the song accompanying an epic moment in the daydream, I get an adrenaline rush(?). I think this is Frisson. But I'm not sure.

Sometimes these rushes get so intense that I start to cry or at least, tear up. Especially when I'm watching trailers about video games or movies or other topics that I'm really passionate about.

*Would this behaviour be destructive in the long run?*   
Like, the idea that I might be addicted to the adrenaline has been in my head for a while. And this rush has been ingrained in my daily routine, especially before COVID. For example, when I travel somewhere on my bike. I usually use an epic or stimulating song to trigger the frisson to give myself a jump start. 

I might be totally wrong on that it's adrenaline. It's just the only term I've learnt to describe the feeling.",26Dec2020,1

152," Hi all,

I am from Germany so sorry in advance for my English.

My friend (40) thinks he is a prophet. He has always been into spiritual stuff but recently it has been extreme :/ He also watches new age videos such as Magenta Pixie and things like that (enneagram) and thinks he can influence energetic vibrations to lead humanity, activate Stargates etc. In addition, he wants to be like Jesus. I am really worried about him as I think it might be paranoia or something like that.

He does not take drugs but drinks about four beer of alcohol every day in the evening which has become that bad due to Corona and kind of a habit now - he is definitely not coping well.

So last time I visited, basically a week ago we had a total fallout. I stayed at his flat for a few days. There he has been treating me really bad (hostile), I would pretty much consider it bullying. Complaining about things, criticizing etc. Even his housemate said that she had never seen that side of him. (She also wants to move out asap as she does not feel comfortable. She gets random criticisms and feels a bit stressed in the flatshare).

**To name a few examples:**

\- I once dropped a bit of chocolate ice cream on his pillow on the sofa. I said ""ups"" and got up in order to clean it in the bathroom. He freaked out ... When I wanted to slice the tomato, he told me I was using the wrong knife (I should have used the sharper one ...). I do not know his knifes and the knife was fine. For sure I was angry about it and stopped talking for a bit.

\- He has been losing friendships over the years. He is also in an argument with one of his former best friends who he has known since university times. He became offended when she sent him a photo of her unborn baby who had the mouth open on the scan - he thought it was a reference to his big mouth. He took it personally and has not really contacted her since - not even congratulated her to her pregnancy. Offending him was not her intention. She sent the same photo and text to many of her friends, even me. But still he does not see it this way.

\- When I was at his flat: Even though we settled on what to cook earlier in the day; he decided not to participate in the cooking process when we wanted to do it, as he just ""did not feel like it"", however, behind my back he criticized my potatoes and called them ""shit"" (I rarely hear him use such words, usually never) but this is what he told the housemate.

\- Understandably, I was in a withdrawn and not energetic mood once is hostile behavior towards me started - however, he was able to switch from a ""not okay"" mood to a ""let's have fun"" mood and this was just irritating.

\- Once he put on the Magenta Pixie video on TV which he wanted to show us, he started criticizing my attitude, how I was not opening up. He was praising the housemate for being interested as she was making noises like ""aha"" (though (I later talked to her) this noise was just made as she knows he does not like criticism - so he interpreted her ""confirmation"" totally wrong). She is also worried about him.

\- Also which I am very worried about. He has a ""friend"", which he did not like much in the past when he was still more normal. Now that she is into that spiritual stuff; he enjoys talking to her. She claims that she can talk to/communicate with trees and he believes her! I think she is a bad influence and just a ""support"" for his mental instability.

\- He told me he has never felt more clear in his head.

\- On the train he was asking my why I was so negative all the time; I told him it was due to his constant bullying behavior towards me this weekend. He then replied that this was not true, he was referring to my general energetic pattern ... I never gave him the answer which he wanted as there was not such one. He did not like that.

\- He always compares me and other friends to the enneagram descriptions. He gets his daily mails. I feel like he does not see me as an individual anymore but always tries to find truth in the enneagram. Furthermore, he (so we think) adjusts his behavior unconsciously to that of what the enneagram says. According to the enneagram, he thinks he is the Reformer (type one) - perfectionism ...

\- He once promised me (already two years ago) to show me his university photos. He never did. When his housemate was there he got them out, showed them to her, asked me briefly whether I wanted to see them. I was saying ""yes"" but more quietly. Then he said: If you are not energetic for it, then you shouldn't (He had already criticized me a lot at this point). At the same time I was angry and I thought, why would you show them to her ""now"" and not me in the past. You have known me for much longer.

In the end we decided on a friendship pause.

I don't know how to get him out of there. His behavior was just appalling.

I called an anti-sect-organization for advice and they told me to keep my distance and that I should tell him, too if we decided to pause the friendship. In addition, I should use the words ""I"" and ""me""; tell him about how I feel about his changed behavior and how he hurt me but also that I would still be available if he needed me. But also, I should not mention the spiritual stuff nor criticize any of it which might just drive him deeper into it. Also refer to positive past experiences to try to get him out of it (to activate positive feelings from the past).

I just don't understand. He has changed for the worse and it makes me so sad to see his changing behavior and hostility towards me. A friend would never do these things. But what can I do?",26Dec2020,1

154,"I've never told anyone how close I've felt like I got to ending it because I'm always scared of their reaction, I know the only people it's fair to share this kind of thing with is doctor's but I'm always scared they'll tell parents or take away my control or something.

*trigger warning describing what I tried to do*

Over the summer I got really down and planned to kill myself, I wrote out suicide notes to my family and close friends and left them out so they would find the notes before they found me. I took my dressing gown cord and tied it round my neck and tried to tie it to a branch in the garden, I was struggling to tie it while holding myself up on the branch and eventually gave up and just broke down crying.

A few days ago maybe a week I tried to practise killing myself, I set it up inside and managed to get it to work so I was hanging but I was afraid to put weight on my neck in case I changed my mind but now I know I can do it, I know how to set it up so it will work. 
Last night I didn't try anything suicide related exactly but I tried to strangle myself, which obviously wouldn't kill me just gave me a sore neck for a long while. 
Part of my wants to try again tonight, to keep trying until I actually do it, I don't want to hurt people I care about but it feels so hard to think straight or at all these days, I just want things to stop.
If anyone does choose to read this, what do you think a doctor would say/do if i told them this?",26Dec2020,1
155,"I often hear really great stories about therapy, and I'm glad it's working for a lot of people. In my experience, some mental health professionals just aren't that great. To me at least. Some have definitely made things worse, broke my trust and said horrible things to me or did not take me seriously when I talked about some issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Others just didn't really do anything meaningful that added something to my life. I guess it's not their fault, but it's frustrating since you're told that's what's supposed to help. Also, my high school did not deal well at all with me, and even after a year since leaving, I still feel the shame and stress that they imposed on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish issues like this were talked about more, so I guess here I am. I found my own help in someone else, and yet I was told that it was wrong, that my issues should be dealt with by a professional. And I totally get that. And yet this normal person helped me more than any mental health professional ever did, so that's why it's confusing. It's hard for me to talk about the mental health professionals' or school's maltreatment of me, also because it's hard to find people to relate to. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard to realize these people or institutions that are meant to help you, actually make your pain worse. I genuinely don't mean to discourage anyone, please go to therapy and try it out for yourself if you feel like you might benefit from it. This is just my experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it's hard to find any solice in the way I've been treated. I've tried to talk about this to people but my pain is often not validated. It's hard when people don't take it that seriously, or that basically imply I need to get over an unfortunate comment made by a counsellor. Or when they break an agreement that we had regarding privacy. Of course it's not the end of the world, and maybe I'm just being sensitive, but I put trust in these people because of their being a professional especially. It's just hard. I just had to get this off my chest, but please let me know your opinion/experience. Stay strong everyone :)",26Dec2020,1

Also, I just went through a massive, MASSIVE break up.

I didn't freak out through all three of these moments, surprisingly, I feel numb to most of it when it happened, but then yesterday I just...

Today's better than yesterday, much, much better. Yesterday is like the worst of the worst, but today I feel bad just once, I feel like I'm going to gasp for air, I feel so hot too, but then I drank lots of water and everything subsided.

I am 28 yo, male  


Lately i've been feeling strange, everything in my life is going and it has been going perfectly for years. I have everything i have ever wanted in the face of my two beautiful healthy boys, my amazing wife that is such a good person, money, security, a lot of free time (I am not an employee and i can stay at home do whatever i want for as long as i want) .. basically everything i've ever wanted, i have it and still every day at some point i start thinking of bad negative stuff.. about death about cancer about losing my loved ones and i can't seem to get it out of my head. I am just really afraid that something will go wrong and that something will happen and i than will have the actuall reason not to be happy. Nothing is wrong in the moment but often i forget to be happy and i just think about who died when and how and why and start ""knocking on wood"" that it doesn't happen to me or my family. It's just exhausting to think about stupid stuff that has little to no meaning to me. For example there was this guy that i knew 7-8 years back, we were friends at the time but not really great friends just we smoked weed together in a group of people, sometimes only with him too... that was 2013-4 lets say... i lost contact with him at that point and never thought of him ever again up until 6 months ago when i was with a mutual friend of ours and i asked him jokingly ""how is he doing"" expecting to hear the same old answer that he is doing drugs and stupid shit.. than he told me - ""he jumped off a building"" ... i have no idea why but that struck me so hard as like i cared (because i really don't see a reason to care but i guess i do?) so after that i've been thinking about said person quite often and wondering why am i thinking about him, like why.. it has nothing to do with me, i haven't seen him for 7 years and why do i all of a sudden care about what he has done... and thats just an example of thoughts i have in my mind replacing the good times im supposed to have with my family and my kids ... its so annoying not being able to enjoy the best time of my life and i know that there will be a moment that will come and i will regret wasting the good times with overthinking useless things but it will be too late.... what can i do to change that i have no idea...   


\*i used to smoke a lot of weed and have kinda anxiety problems with that but a few years ago i stopped, and now i smoke just now and than and i don't have that same kind of anxiety\* i dont know if that has anything to do with it or not......so yeah... i just want to be happy man...why i am wasting my time with such thoughts when i should be happy and i know it...it sucks to have everything and still find things that deviate you from living in the moment and being happy.",26Dec2020,1

OK, so I want to know what happens in your everyday life. Please comment if you can. I wanna hear it. 

For me, it’s waking up late at 12PM. Sometimes not eating on time. Use my phone for 9+ hours, if not, play a video game, or video games for 9+ hours for the day. Eat food, maybe shower. Poop and piss. Sleep late. Procrastinate homework. This is for the holiday break or if there is no school. 

If there is school, it’s just the same except I wake up at 7AM and go to online class and do the same things after school. There’s no fun and mental stimulation. Are your days just like mine? It’s super sad.

Do I have to live like this until the end of 2021? It’s sad to see so many people in my country are fine with this. Like I don’t see any sad people or any rants with living like this.

Plus life is dog-shit in my country. My main goal in life is to leave this country and settle in a first world country so I can be happy, no joke. You can’t do anything here, they say it’s more fun here but it’s not. My future doesn’t look bleak or bright. Just normal. 

Also, time is sooo fast. It’s been so faster since the start of quarantine. It’s crazy. Time flies so fast because of the monotonous activities I do. This contributes to my sadness. 1 second kinda translates to 3 seconds. Some months feel faster than others. :(

I think quarantine has taken a toll on my mental health, maybe physical health too. 

I watched a movie again for the first time since April 2020 in December, I actually watched 3 movies so far in December 2020. I kinda just spontaneously watched a movie with my family which is pretty cool.

We start texting and eventually start sleeping together again. 2 months later, I get preg. Im scared but also excited because I thought it meant we would officially get back together. 

I was SO wrong.

He was pissed when i told him I was preg. Told me to have an abortion....which caught me off guard because he always said he was against abortion. I was so confused.

About a week later, after I got an official positive preg test at the doctor, he made a confession.

He confessed that he actually had a gf and she was 7 months preg. Meaning....he had cheated on me while we were together, got her preg and left me for her. 

Ive never been so devastated by anything in my life. I was in so much emotional pain, I stopped eating. Yes, while I was in my first trimester. Doctor had to put me on nutritional drinks and increase my visits, to monitor me. 

Ex kept in touch with me for about 2 months and then ghosted me when his other kid was born. He changed his number and moved. I had no way to reach him. I finished the rest of my pregnancy alone. He also wasnt there for my sons birth. 

He eventually showed back up when my son was about 6 weeks old. Only because his gf found out he had another baby. 

It was such a whirlwind after that. Lotta disrespect, mistreatment, flakiness trying to co-parent with him. It was drama until my son was about 5-6 years old. 

My son is an early teen now. In the last 3 years, his dad had shown improvement. The dad and his gf (now wife) are still together.

I still have alot of resentment towards him. What concerns me is, recently ive started to have alot of repressed memories. Things from the situation that I had completely forgot about. Alot of memories. Like 40-50 of them. It’s caused me to be depressed and feel alot pain about the situation again....even though it was a long time ago. 

Ive gone to therapy, practiced gratitude, tried meditating, etc. Nothing is helping. I really wish these memories never resurfaced. I feel almost as bad as I did when it first happened.",26Dec2020,1
178,"Everybody around me doesn’t care about the pandemic anymore. I work in public health, my closest friends don’t care and/or think it’s a hoax or a conspiracy, I had to tell one of my friends that I needed a break from him after he kept sending anti vax stuff, I’ve left the football team I was playing for because the group chat was so toxic and along the same lines, my brothers family went to a couple different houses over Christmas, my girlfriend is breaking restrictions also. Everytime I go to the shops it’s like half of the people in there aren’t wearing masks or wearing those fucking hidden disability sunflower lanyards. I feel like I am very much on the edge and about to lash out. I’m finding it difficult to avoid any negativity like this as I am constantly surrounded by the pure selfishness and ignorance, it’s all I see on the Internet, it’s all I see in the streets. People are dying everywhere and everyone just doesn’t give a fuck anymore, we’re locked down and will continue to lock down until it gets better so why is it so difficult to just wear a mask and respect each other. I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to hurt somebody so much in my life, I can’t escape what’s happening around me and find peace. I’m locked in a flat in the city and am consumed by it all",26Dec2020,1
179,"So my uncle has been an alcoholic forever. Most of the time being a functional alcoholic, he never really bothered anybody. However the in the past two years, he’s been really annoying. My extended family had an intervention for him, and even though I did not attend because I didn’t want to be put in that position at 14, he complied and went to rehab for a week until he checked himself out and returned home. Everybody was supposed to cut ties with him because he didn’t complete the course, but because of my family being very large, his sisters and brothers as well as his parents just couldn’t do that. When he checked himself out of rehab, he was then constantly calling people in our family from 2-6AM to say random stuff. One night in August of 2019 my family fell victim to that. I was 15 at the time, and my dad was not answering and the more he called and didn’t answer the angrier my uncle got. As time went on, my uncle left messages, one threatening to kill my father. My brother was asleep and I was awake with my mom when she played the message and I heard it. This brought me into shock, and a panic attack. I couldn’t breathe and I was crying and I could barely stand up. At this point my dad was sleeping and my mom was comforting me. He continued to call and eventually my dad answered and told him that he was going to call the police if he called again but that didn’t stop him. For nights I couldn’t sleep, I was doing poorly in school when it started, and some fun activities I was supposed to do like go to my first concert or the first day of sophomore year. We blocked his phone number on all of our phones and our land line as well as his email. But every time I heard a noise outside at night or I got a phone notification I was terrified. Over time I talked to my doctor who told me to see a therapist, but my dad doesn’t believe in therapy so I never did. My doctor told me to take melatonin and my sleep returned to normal. I was doing okay until about February of 2020. My dad asked me to go through his texts and delete them because he was running out of storage on his phone and he was busy, so I did. But going deeper into his phone I saw texts that he never talked about from years before he was admitted and our family had the intervention. He was ending terrible, horrid things to my father, and that triggered everything again. I had another panic attack, but I didn’t tell anybody this time. After about an hour sitting on the bathroom floor I got over it. It wasn’t until my dad cancelled something on me that it all came out again. I was already deeply upset and then him cancelling our plans to go into the city made it even worse. I told him, and he just continued to say that my uncle can’t hurt me. He was all bark and no bite, but all of the events and the voicemail from august replayed over and over in my head. I couldn’t get it out, which made me spiral mentally a little bit. High anxiety and stress always on edge. But again as time went on and I hadn’t heard from him, the feelings went away. There was one other time, I don’t remember when but I was going through my grandpas emails to help him clean up his inbox and I found an email titled something on the lines of “dead parents are going to get it” and his parents are my grandparents that I love very much. I was able to hold back my panic attack until I got home and then freaked out in on the bathroom floor again. The only thing my dad has to say when I mention it is that my uncle won’t actually do that. And sure I get that but it’s the trauma from the initial event that comes back and terrifies me to my core. That night I gained a whole lot of anxiety and I could barely do every day tasks without thinking of him and the message he left bouncing around in my head. After that everything was fine until yesterday, Christmas. He wasn’t invited and I was over at my grandparents along with my parents and my brother to help set up our little Christmas dinner (only us and my aunt and cousin all socially distanced of course) and I saw a grey head walking up the driveway. At first I thought it was my other uncle who was invited just stopping by to say merry Christmas, but then my mom answered the door and said that it was my uncle. My heart dropped, and my dad came up to me and said to just stick by his side and not say a word. I thought okay. I can do this. But the moment I heard his voice, I couldn’t breathe, I literally ran to the bathroom and slammed the door and started to hyperventilate. I took my mask off and sat on the toilet because I was getting light headed. This was the first time I had actually gotten even a glimpse of him in almost two years, and I thought I had gotten over it but I hadn’t. Tears streamed down my face and I was choking on my breath trying to not make too much noise. I had my phone on me and I was texting my friends trying to just get some reassurance (they knew my fear). After about 20 minutes of my parents not knowing where I was they texted me, ironically at the same time. Asking where I was and if I was okay. I was able to text them back where I was and that I was hyperventilating/having a panic attack/crying/hiding in the bathroom. I was trying to wait him out, but he seemed like he was staying. After about 40 minutes or so, my dad asked if I wanted to go home, but it was Christmas and I wanted to spend time with my grandparents (theyre 93 and 89) and I love them with all of my heart. My grandpa asked my dad what was going on, and he didn’t want my father to yell at my uncle to let me enjoy Christmas (he was afraid my grandma would have a heart attack because she was thrilled that my uncle was there). so my grandpa told my dad I was welcome to go upstairs and wait it out in his bedroom instead of the little powder room I had been in. My dad came to the bathroom and knocked on the door to let me know he was there, and then snuck me upstairs to the guest room. My grandpa was so understanding and when I went upstairs he tried to make me laugh, and he actually sided with me over his own son saying that had my grandma not been so happy with her son being there, he would’ve let my dad kick my uncle out in order for me to enjoy Christmas. I was up there with my dad for about ten minutes just crying/hyperventilating/hugging my dad until he went to go get my mom (she’s better at comforting me) and then I was up there for another ten minutes. She then asked if I wanted to take a ride around to get away from my uncle, so she brought my boots and bag up and I put them on before running downstairs to the front door, still crying and upset/unable to breath properly. When we made it out to the car, my uncle had come out for a smoke break, and I started to scream at my mom to get out of the driveway as fast as possible terrified he might try to stop and talk to us. So we left and drove about halfway home (we only live about 15 minutes away from my grandparents) so I could calm down a little bit. My dad was still at my grandparents house and he was going to text us when my uncle left. As we were driving my dad called and told us that when my uncle was actually leaving he would let my uncle know what was going on despite it being against my grandmas wishes. According to my dad he started off talking, and when my uncle didn’t get it he began to yell at him. He soon left and I went back to celebrate Christmas. My dad says that I need to get over this fear because my uncles never going to do anything, and I know that but I just can’t shake the feelings that resurface whenever I see/hear his voice or anything from him. The night of that call in august was actually the worst day of my life and he still haunts me. I’m not sure what to do because after all he is my uncle and at some point or another I’m going to have to cross paths with him, but I just can’t. Figuratively speaking, he’s like a monster, a grotesque monster that I’ll never be able to slay because I am terrified. As much as I love my father he isn’t much help, and he thinks I just need to get over myself.",26Dec2020,1

183,"I know this is a bad idea no one here is an expert but before I go to a therapist and ruin my life yet save it I need to know if I’m crazy. let me explain as far as I know anyone in my country how is mentally ill is known as a crazy person. it depends on the symptoms but sadly mine Mach what they call crazy. I won’t be in the military like all the men in my family and I won’t get married. but I will be alive so a brief summary. I was told at 14 that I was a man and God will start judging me I studied many religions and left all religion and no longer believe in God I’m 18 now 

the symptoms 

Nightmares 

every single day in these nine months I see a nightmare involving God in one way or another I had prophesy dreams. nightmares about God . seeing Biblical prophets and Mohamed. or a completely normal dream but there is an angel in the sky. or I don’t have a dream. but each time I wake up scared even if I see nothing 

The voice 

I hear a voice like when you talk to your self inside your head. it asks of me two things. one that I should end my life because I’m angering God here on earth but God will not end my life for he is just but the voice says If I truly love God I should have ended my life sooner. 2 that I should summon a demon the voice says that I’m blocked from knowledge of atonement but a demon can revel this knowledge and God will forgive me for seeking such a hard path . two days ago the voice spoke out of my bathroom door even though I live alone. I asked the voice what it was it said just a voice in your head. I asked it the same question today it said you were all you. 

Random sadness

I don’t believe in God but when ever the voice speaks of God and how I failed God I get really sad and almost do IT . 

the dialogues I got from people 

schizophrenia

impossible since I don’t see things and the voice doesn’t speak outside my head but few times. I have seen things with the corner of my eye and heard people run towards me when I’m in the desert alone or hear someone sing when it’s dark and only when it’s dark at the desert 

Catastrophizing 

it doesn’t make people hear or see nightmares . many people in my country are said to be crazy because of there mental illness. and never get married. and since I want my family to be proud of me I must join the military like the rest. I don’t see how I’m assuming the worst 

a religions nut 

 I kinda agree with but it’s not a mental illness and I don’t believe in God 

a liar 
just assume I’m telling the truth both my face and name are anonymous and this isn’t exactly a good look. I really wanted to use this Reddit account to post out of context photos but sadly I discovered Reddit close to the time I lost my mind. 

possessed 

I don’t believe in demons and if true why would a demon wast it’s time like that 

I’m posting this since there is no were else I can ask anonymously. and get answers with many people viewing it . I will go to a therapist but imagine being a therapist and listening to me say these things you would think I’m crazy. I much rather have a name of an illness going into this.",26Dec2020,1

187,"Recently my wife of four years left me. It was a very hard decision for her and even harder for me to accept. Not even sure I still accepted it. I just knew that there was no way I was going to convince her not to leave. Not this time. The reasons she left are because I made her feel so overwhelmingly insecure and because of that she hasn’t trusted me for a long time. That I would never change the things I was doing to make her feel that way, and she was tired and exhausted from waiting for me to change. She literally had no love left for me and felt that she had lost herself in the process. When I heard those words come out of her mouth it destroyed me. I felt like I had literally went numb and fell to pieces. 

She is an amazing woman and I have always been completely obsessed with her from the very beginning. She has taught me so much and has changed my life for the better. She saved my older kids and I from a situation that was ruining me and harming my kids. She was and still is a saint. She is so ambitious, smart, funny, generous, caring, thoughtful and literally everything I have ever wanted in a wife. She is so gorgeous to add to all of that, too. I really messed up. 

Now I am so depressed and lost and insecure. I told her I can’t imagine my life without her on so many occasions. Even before there was any trouble in our marriage. She literally is my everything. We had two perfect kids together. Our 2 year old is so very smart and silly and just plain happy. Our 6 month old always has a smile on his face and loves to laugh. They usually bring me so much joy and happiness, but ever since the split I no longer feel those feelings. I love my kids. The mean the world to me. I would do anything for them. I just don’t feel anything anymore. I feel dead inside and nothing but pain and anxiety. My sadness seems to be a constant thing. I do have days where I feel slightly better. Like I feel I will be alright, that I’ll make it through this. I also have more days, though, that I will always be miserable, sad, lonely and angry. I have always never had much patience when it comes to my kids. I am usually the mean strict parent, but my wife was helping me change that as well. Now I  I have an even shorter fuse. I don’t abuse my kids and I would never harm them in any way, but I get so angry and mean. I get so frustrated and overwhelmed with them. After I put them to bed or when their mom comes to get them, I always regret how I treated them while they were with me. Those feelings along with my loss of the one person I loved with every fiber of my being makes me want to commit suicide.

I have thought about it before. I know it’s not the answer to my problems. I know the pain it would cause for my family, her family and my kids. But I feel that I am not the best thing for anybody. I have always felt this way. I don’t have very high self-esteem and never had. All the bullying and people taking advantage of me throughout the course of my life, has taken its toll. My wife was working so hard to make me feel better and she did. I started to feel like I was worth it and that I was a great person. Now that she has gone, it seems like all those negative things about me are back and have doubled. She told me I was a toxic person and that I was suffocating her. I see that now. It only added to my despair. I hate myself even more now, than I have ever before. I want to die. My kids don’t need this angry toxic person in their life. My family doesn’t deserve to be hurt by me anymore. Her family doesn’t deserve to be hurt by me anymore either. This world would be better off without me. My kids would become great people without me. She could finally be free of my constant sadness and questioning her every action. She wouldn’t have to worry about me at all. Not that she worries about me anyway. She’s told me she is struggling too with all of this, but she seems so happy and not even a little bit depressed. Granted, I’m not with her every waking moment, but what she is showing is not what I am showing. I have already made a plan for my suicide. I will make sure that everything is taken care of before I leave this world. I don’t want to leave her or my family in a tough spot. I know I need help, but I literally don’t want it. I don’t want to live a life without her by my side. The thought of her being with someone else absolutely kills me.

189,"Please I need help or advice or anything really. For the majority of the past year, I'd say I've had a fairly acceptable reaction to pandemic protocols. Occasional frustration with a few tears shed here and there. But for the past few weeks I've experienced a radical self-destructive change in attitude and mental state in response to ""the new normal"". I'm almost never happy or even content with life anymore. My emotions constantly flip between depression and rage every few minutes. I've lost almost all control over my thoughts and feelings. Every time I see anything even remotely pertaining to the pandemic, it sends me into a downward spiral of resentment and bitterness. Every mask, every piece of paper taped to the front doors of businesses, every plastic screen at the cash registers, every mention of the virus' name sets me off and ruins my day. I can't sleep, I can't eat, it takes tremendous mental effort to even get out of bed. I've become hopeless and delusional as well. The unrealistic belief that lockdowns will never end persists in my mind, only worsening my anguish, even though deep down I know it can't be true. I often find myself fantasizing about doing things that I believe would end my torment, even if they are morally despicable, and believing I would not feel remorse afterwards. For example, if I had a big red button that would instantly vaporize every person on earth with the virus, I would press it without hesitation. I'm obviously very mentally ill, but I can't seem to find a solution. There's no escaping the pandemic. Signs of its existence are everywhere you look. Anyone I ask and every article I've read about pandemic fatigue basically tells me to suck it up because there's nothing you can do about it. I've tried and I've tried and I assure you it doesn't work and I'm tired of hearing it. If I didn't have family and friends waiting for me if the pandemic ends, I'd probably kill myself now.

190,"My whole life, I have been in survival mode preparing for a horrible blow. I am petrified of death, and since I was young have been on mental missions to “prevent” any bad thing from happening, and equating even the smallest of failures with the fear of death itself. 

It seems that I’m comfortable in my anxiety, because when I am calm and stable, I can clearly see I’m stuck in a deep deep horrible empty sadness. 

I seek more distractions- through love (unrequited) or friendships so that I can never be alone with this horrible empty feeling. 

My whole heart goes out to anyone who is suicidal and struggling with harmful thoughts. But part of me (I’m probably wrong) is fascinated at how a suicidal person wants to surrender to their pain, how they’ve accepted they ARE in pain. They do not have an illusion of control over their pain. They don’t want to run from it, they’d rather surrender to it wholly.

I would love to learn more about this experience, and how you were able to improve your condition in a healthy way that didn’t need distractions.",26Dec2020,1

I then get the brunt of the abuse when I speak of the money woes at the current company.

I voice my concerns, but get put down and ridiculed for ""not taking any risks"" to better my overall living situation despite the virus numbers not coming down.


So far it's all been mainly online bullying. But I've encountered lighter versions of it at my own work and places I deliver to. I've got bills and a pickup truck payment to make.

I'll try to keep this brief and concise, but I'd appreciate some support. Please comment if you can. 
(I'm 16, almost 17, and female) 



1. I'm not diagnosed yet (but seeing a therapist). 


2. I've had signs of OCD since I was a kid, but only started having it bad in July, when sudden paranoid thoughts started eating me up alive.


3. The thoughts since then have changed a lot, but always in 3 big themes:
    - Paranoid thoughts
    - Harm thoughts and sexual thoughts combined
    - The general idea that I'm a bad person or a psychopath (very much associated with the second theme)


4. The paranoid thoughts would give me hours of anxiety each day and then I'd realise they were just stupid and felt relieved. Then the cycle started all over again. 


5. The sexual/harm thoughts didn't give me the time of relief, only anxiety and sometimes just nothing. 


6. The sexual/harm thoughts are specially caused by real events (but not only):
     - The fear of pedophilia came after I remembered a hentai video (with kids/pre-teens) I once watched (kinda by accident) and got turned on by (I was already feeling turned on because of other ""normal"" videos, but that one helped) and after someone I knew compared the LGBTQ+ community with pedophilia (I'm part of the community) 
      - The fear of incest came after I watched an incest video while watching porn and got turned on by it (but not by the incest itself)
      - The fear that I'd like (mostly in a sexual way) to hurt people came from the fact that I used to get turned on by torture stuff (never wanted to act it out and I could easily get turned on by normal things too), but I don't think I do anymore (I'm afraid I still do though)


7. I used to be able to realise (deep down) that these thoughts were not true. Lately, not anymore.


8. Lately, when they appear, I just accept them as absolute truths and the worst is that it doesn't bother me as much as it should. I just don't have the energy to fight them anymore, or to care about them. 


9. The anxiety has been getting weaker and weaker (even though it kinda depends on the days), but the thoughts and the groinal responses are very much still there. 


10. Some concrete examples of thoughts are
       - What if the fact that sometimes I tell lies makes me a psychopath?
       - What if I'm a bad person for picking nice things for myself and not for others?
        - Maybe I've never actually felt empathy
        - What if now that I found out I like girls, I'll also like little girls?
         - What if I still like torture and would like to inflict pain on someone else?
         - I'm being followed/chased
         - Someone/something is watching me/about to grab me
         - Maybe the fact that I like this fictional villain or the fact that I want this fictional character to die makes me a bad person 
         - What if the attraction I feel for people my age never leaves and I'll end up becoming a pedophile? 
         - and many more


11. Compulsions?
      - Reassurance seeking
      - Ruminating
      - Researching extensively
      - Over analyzing the thoughts
      - and others


12. I can't enjoy the things I love because ""only good people can and you're not a good person."" 


13. Don't have motivation or energy to do anything, feel (a little) numb, want to sleep all the time, just feel really down, and tired of living.

I actually feel bad that I don’t want to go out to see my family and disrespect social distancing! Even though if I went I would just be annoyed that I have given in yet again, I don’t want to go. 

I don’t want to just sit there and watch a movie on Christmas and be quiet because my sister is pregnant and can’t drink so we can’t play the games we played every year.

I just want to clean my house and have a relaxing bath with a face mask on.

I don’t know if this is an odd thing to do, but it’s worked for me, so maybe it’ll work for you (Dr Seuss up in this bih)!

Think back to pictures of when you were a littttle one, and close your eyes, and remember that that little person is YOU. And they need care. They need a hair wash, they need a snack, they need an environment free of hazards, and you’re the only person around to take care of them. Think of yourself as them at that moment in time, and put that little person in your shoes, and ask yourself if you would let them skip a shower or a meal. Probably not. So don’t do it to yourself. And if you have to tell yourself that you ARE that little kiddo who needs your help, then do that.",26Dec2020,1
204,"I just want to share my story and tell everyone who is struggling, don’t give up. 

In the beginning of January 2020, I decided to give psychiatry and therapy a try. I was in a very dark place for many years. I’m 22 years old and haven’t been happy since I was in elementary school.  

I used to be against psych meds when they were recommended to me in high school, I thought it would mess with my brain chemistry and wasn’t for me. After a chain of events that happened during the last 6 months of 2019, I decided I needed to be open minded about mental health and realize things are more complex than they appear. Nothing is black and white in this and I deserve to explore all the options this world can give.

I was started on a bipolar medication for bipolar 2 patients, even though I’ve never exhibited any manic episodes in my life. I’ve exhibited severe depression and racing irrational thought. I have seen things at night, like my deceased cat at one point, and Frankenstein when I was a little girl. Those are the only two times I have had psychotic episodes which I told my psychiatrist about. 

The bipolar 2 mediation scared the living daylights out of me because my libido completely disappeared. I couldn’t feel a single thing down there. I stopped taking it the 3rd day of being prescribed.

I then got put in a medication for bipolar 1 patients.
This medication made me very emotional. It made my thoughts even worse and deeper. I took them at night, and I was groggy and felt awful and emotional about 1 hour after taking them. I stopped taking them after about 3 months. I took them in combination with an ADHD medication I was also prescribed, I continued to take the ADHD medication after I stopped the bipolar ones. The ADHD medication helped with focus, but made it impossible to do tasks because my emotions even more intense and I made me sensitive. I cried at work and everywhere else. I felt like a complete mess, like my life was in shambles. I’ve never been a crier, but on these medications that’s all I was. It was 4 months before I told my psychiatrist I really am failing with these medications. I stopped taking them consistently before I told my psychiatrist about all of this and I stopped seeing my psychiatrist for about 4 months after my experienced with the medications because I felt like I was on a never ending roller coaster ride with them. It was hell.

So, 4 months later, I go back to my psychiatrist because I’m tired of how my poor mental health hygiene is and I feel like I need to try.

I tell her how emotionally draining and unhopeful I was after that experience. We decide to hold off on bipolar medications and continue to treat the ADHD/ADD. I tried one medication for a month (last month to give a better time frame) it gave me awful migraines and I couldn’t get out of bed past 4 pm. The physical effects it had on me was for the lack of a better word, draining. Having a mental impairment was hard enough, now I’m trying to manage an every day persistent physical side effect from this medication. I was in my college semester at this time. I told her 4 weeks later I couldn’t take it anymore, I was becoming even more hopeless.

She put me on a different medication for ADHD/ADD. I was very pessimistic about it, I was expecting no great results. I was surprised, because it has changed me. It has made me feel very normal, happier, and rational. I’m not sure if it helping me with focus is assisting my mind to stop the endless thoughts I had. The negative thinking all of the time is gone. The thoughts I once resolved in my head that would come back a few minutes later, are 90% diminished. I forgot how it felt to feel like this, I forgot it was even possible!

Individual therapy was also a tough, excruciating journey. The therapist I saw in the beginning of the year told me that the childhood traumas I went through, were “kids just being kids”. I almost had a mental break. I didn’t start therapy again until October with a different therapist. 

I saw the other therapist in October, she told me something about dissociation, and how I’m showing signs of that.. but also she noted that it’s normal for everyone to dissociated. She gave me an example: “I forgot how I even made it to work this morning” or “I forgot How I even took that exit to work this morning” that’s a form of dissociation. It’s normal. Well, I took it and ran with it and started researching everything about dissociation and diagnosed myself with every form of dissociation. It effected me to the point where I didn’t even go and see her again until last week. 

She’s a good therapist. I was able to tell her why I didn’t go back to her after our apartment in October. She was able to start working me through my trauma. She listened to me. She understood me. And wow, it feels amazing.

You can feel amazing too. You can find a great medication and an great therapist no matter what painful experiences you go through during your journey in finding them. You deserve everything the world has to offer.",26Dec2020,1
205,"Hi, my (nick)name is Jo and I don't know what's wrong with me. For my entire life I've felt disconnected from people, depressed, different, and like I have a specific purpose. Said purpose is being a musician and writing/recording/touring/being famous. It started as an ambition but has turned into the only thing I focus on; I can't imagine how my life would be if I don't become famous and achieve this goal.

I've been diagnosed with OCD and ADHD, and because of them I'm depressed, anxious, and suffering from trichotillomania. But I feel like that's not all that's wrong with me. I'm very interested in mental disorders for some reason because I feel like I have something worse than my doctors think, maybe because I've gotten so good at hiding it over the course of my life. I'm 15 so my parents are still very much involved in my life but they focus more on my sister's mental health (she's been hospitalized because of her mental health before and I haven't, so I think they see her as worse than me). 

I don't have any trauma that I can recall that could cause any of what I'm feeling. I've never felt suicidal, never hurt myself, never abused any substances, and am medicated for my OCD and ADHD.

Now for the actual things I'm feeling, excluding the things clearly explained by my OCD and ADHD:

* In September I had a kind of realization that I'm not that deeply involved in anybody's life and I don't care that much about other people, which led to my concern about having a personality disorder and/or early signs of schizophrenia, which my therapist said was my anxiety since I don't actually display any psychotic symptoms but I feel like I will when I'm at the average age of onset.
* I simultaneously see myself as a normal, flawed person, and a person of greater value than others who knows more about the fundamentals of human existence and significance than almost everyone else.
* I get horrible anxiety about opening the door to my bedroom and seeing some deformed creature sitting on my bed waiting for me or being followed down the hall by a different deformed creature that will catch up to me and do *something* to me. 
* I tend not to make friends with many people, but when I do I get far too comfortable far too fast and basically tell them my entire life story within a week of knowing each other. 
* I haven't cried in a pretty long time and can't think of many things that are likely to happen that would make me feel emotional. 
* I get hyperfixations and spend far too much time doing things related to them (ex. if I hyperfixate on a band I'll listen to them every single day for weeks, like I'm doing right now actually). 
* I do things/behave in ways that would be considered weird that I only notice are weird right after I do them, like saying something that's not related to the current topic or talk about the same thing for a while, and other things that I can't really describe.
* I don't know if this is cause for concern but I practice witchcraft and believe in faeries, psychic abilities, etc. but simultaneously know they're not really real? I honestly don't know
* I don't have a very strong sense of who I am beyond my obsession with being a famous musician. I don't know what my personality traits are, I don't know how to describe myself, and I don't know what makes me *me*. 
* Sometimes I get really irritated by certain things, but after the tense situation lightens up I almost immediately change and apologize for my irritated and often rude response to normal human behavior from other people. 
* In certain situations, I can get overloaded and will sometimes lie on the floor (if I'm at home) or just zone out and stare off into space, partially listening to my surroundings but not responding to them because I neither want to nor feel able to. 

I don't know how much of this is normal and how much is cause for concern, because my therapist tells me it's all just my anxiety but I feel like it's something more. I don't feel like I'm just anxious; I feel like a square trying to fit into a round hole. 

If anyone has any further questions that might help you better understand my problem I'd be happy to answer them and I would be grateful for advice on how to bring this up without having it dismissed as ""just anxiety"".",26Dec2020,1
206,"About three years ago I came to the conclusion that if my life wouldn't in some fundamental way change within a few years, things would just slowly fizzle out. Needless to say very little has changed and much is coming to pass how I thought it would. Despite my best efforts whatever purpose my life has burns dimmer and dimmer. Those around me that though they could help have all one by one been slowly going through the five stages of grief, slowly realizing that I was right back then when I said ""Just let me die. Get over it while you can and move on with your lives instead of letting yourself get dragged down into the pit that surrounds me."" I don't know when it's going to end but I'm assuming I won't last another year like this. This life is starting to suffocate me. Every waking moment, every second feels like suffocating slowly, desperate to come up for air. I've been through the works. The hotlines, the doctors, the psychiatrist. No one can help, most even claim there's nothing inherently wrong with me besides the fact that I want nothing more than to stop. Stop everything. Walking, eating, thinking, breathing. I'm just done with it all. I'm already doing all I possibly can to stay alive and to change but it barely slows the decay. One of these days I'll truly just stop. Just take a step off of the train platform or walk off a cliff. There's just nothing else for me.",26Dec2020,1

208,"I have an ex-roommate/friend who has suffered in the past from depression/anxiety. A few months ago in a text they mentioned that they’ve been struggling recently and have moved back in with their parents due to this. For context they are 30 and quit their job to do so, so it seems quite serious. Anyway, recently their hamster died, and I’ve now received a succession of messages to ask if I’d be willing to attend the funeral of the hamster via zoom and do a reading. While I lived with said hamster for about a year before moving out, I wasn’t that bothered about it nor particularly upset to hear it had died as it wasn’t my pet so I didn’t have much to do with it. Anyway, all these messages about a hamster seem a bit intense to me, especially given that it died a couple of months ago now. For a 12 year old whose hamster died yesterday I’d not be surprised, but for a 30 year old it seems a little concerning. I don’t like to weigh in where I’m unqualified, but I do have a masters in psychology and to me this seems like it might be slightly manic behaviour. My question is: would it be inappropriate to reach out to their dad (who they have in the past been open about their mental health with and who ive met several times in person) just to say something like ‘Hiya, I’ve been receiving some messages from Julia lately and am just a bit concerned about the content. They’ve been mentioning a hamster funeral they want to hold with readings. Im happy to attend via zoom, but it seems a bit intense for a hamster so I wanted to check in that everything’s ok with Julia? Hope you had a nice Christmas”",26Dec2020,1
209,"If you’ve tried meditation a few times then you might have become frustrated. You’re sitting quietly, enjoying the silence, enjoying the stillness and a thought about work pops up, or you remember a difficult conversation you had. You might feel like you’re somehow doing it wrong or you can’t do meditation. 

It’s important to know that this is normal; noone can meditate without having thoughts. Your mind is constantly looking for things to resolve, it’s a problem-solving tool which has evolved to be on the constant lookout for danger, learn from mistakes and its very good at what it does. The challenge comes when the mind is overstimulated, over-active and is constantly processing potential dangers and trying to learn from things in the past. That fragmentation of our attention creates suffering and it’s not until we stop for moment that we realise how busy our minds actually are.

And thats the first step - to simply observe the mind. Notice the thoughts as they arrive, not judging them, not being carried away by them, just noticing what arises. You might imagine yourself sitting on a hill, seeing each thought as a cloud passing overhead and passing over the horizon. Another way to visualise it is sitting by a river and watching leaves float past. Just as we don’t try to stop or hold onto clouds as float past, we allow our thoughts to enter our awareness and then pass through.

So if you find that you’re having a lot of thoughts while meditating and you have to bring your attention back to your breath often that doesn’t mean that you’re doing it wrong - that’s the practice. Over time, training your awareness, you tend to find the thoughts come less often, they’re less intense and they cause less suffering. You spend more time in the present moment and feel calmer and more relaxed.

I internalize things, I was a very awkward, emotionally in-tune, gifted child who grew up with an agnostic, paradoxical, hypocritical, borderline adhd/autistic father and a neurotic, OCD, Panic stricken mother. I was shut out by my brothers and sisters, highly eccentric, and bisexual. I was in and out of home-school and public school my whole K-12 career. My life has been a total reality tv show trainwreck. I was told by everyone I was different, and destined to be a “rockstar”, so I never saw the value in working and thus have never held a job for any prolonged period of time. I have thought of myself as a narcissist, and a pessimist, while simultaneously caring for the world and bleeding my heart out to and for others and giving the shirt off my back. I thought I was smarter, more gifted, and more important than the average Joe but never voiced an opinion. My mood fluctuates throughout the day and changes at the drop of a hat. One wrong encounter, one wrong intrusive thought, and I’m a nervous wreck of an emotional mess for the rest of the day. I’ve never been suicidal but have faked the act and feigned desperation for attention, and not even out of / or by desperation. I drink daily, and compulsively, out of me having a narrow, specific scope/field of interests (and borderline obsessions) and I take up after TV/Movie characters when I find them interesting, so much so to the point that I and my family can not believe how astounding my memory is of specific scenes.

214,"Hi everyone. I know there's much more pressing matters and others in worse situations, but if anyone is willing to help, I'd gladly appreciate any words you may have.

To put it simply, not too long ago, a good friend of mine were in group messenger conversation brought up some things he wanted to learn how to do, like learn an instrument and languages. However, in my reply to him, mentioned that I was also planning on doing the same through my upcoming university semester, essentially feeling like I had one-upped him. I know he and I have some differing opinions on university, and he having gone through some stuff recently, I felt extremely guilty mentioning that. I tried to encourage him a little after he felt resolved himself, but it feels disingenuous, especially with what I had said before, and that's where the conversation sort of fell. And since the whole day, I've been questioning myself, felt like one-upped the conversation hard, and generally felt bad about it. I've tried to rationalize it or stop myself like I'm overthinking it, but I just keep wrapping back around. It's even making me look back upon my decisions of taking the related class in my university, and I just I know I hated myself for even thinking that.

This has happened a lot to me over a lot of situations and with different people. Every time I mess up in some way or even feel like I did, it completely destroys me. It just makes me think way too much and overanalyze the situation psychologically (""oh man, I hope he doesn't see me in that light,"" ""I feel like I sounded like a dick,"" ""Why the hell did I say that?!"", etc.) and it just overwhelms my headspace, making me rethink even parts of myself if I'm doing that. Worse is, I don't know how I can deal with it, and it comes and goes. Is there something wrong with me? I'm not really sure how to approach myself on this. Any advice anyone has is appreciated.

tl;dr - Had a conversation with my friend whom I felt like I one-upped unintentionally, and I feel extremely guilty for doing so. Though I've tried to put it out, my brain is still dwelling on it, feeling bad. I've felt this before in a million situations where I've messed up and has caused me to even start overthinking aspects of myself at times. Is there something wrong with me?

217,"Hello,

In the last 3-4 years some unfortunate things have been happening in my life mostly related to family members getting and dyeing of cancer. The latest affected member was my grandfather from my father side. He got diagnosed with a type of incurable brain tumor ( don’t remember the name) the doctors gave him 3 months but somehow he survived for a whole year and died this August. I had other family members die before and during COVID too but this was different . He and I where very close. I was his only grandchild and he was the one who thought most in life. My parents even if I like them very very much they where never here for me. It was my nanny or my grandparents. He was the one who came to my school plays, he took me to hospital when I was sick, took care of me when my parents where doing their own thing and so much more. He was my father figure I don’t know what to feel. Last year today we where celebrating Christmas together. And now I’m alone my parents are in a holiday during COVID smh. Even if I love them my parents did something I will never forgive them for both of them. I feel like I have no one to talk to and just wanted some or any opinion. I know that it’s a normal part of grief but sometimes I get hit by this intense wave of sadness and feel bad for some minutes and it gets better. I sometimes wait for my grandfather to call me like he did every week even if I never did that. I feel ashamed that I never called him as much as him. There are some other stuff to. Now I hate going to the hospitals. Spend too much time there for other people and just don’t want to go to it anymore. Any thoughts

218,"Tbh, I’ve been a terrible kid when i was young. Spoiled,disrespectful and all the things that are wrong, i did those things. Not trying to beat myself here just being honest with myself and the world, no bullshit. In the past couple of years I’ve been struggling with my mental health. I tried to hide it. My parents only knew like 4 months ago when out of nowhere i broke in tears at lunch. They took me to their room away from everyone to see what’s going on and tried to help me. Thanks mom and dad. They kept stressing the point that i need to be honest with them so that they can help me. But the truth is I can’t.

I’ve always been alone. I didn’t have a friend to talk to before. So i got used to dealing with things on my own, even if i suck at it. There are things that go in my head that I don’t want my parents to know about, cuz i know that it will break them. Lots of irrational thoughts that come to me daily. Lots of wrong I’ve done that i keep remembering. And feeling numb and depressed lots of the time. My parents are also very religious, and im not. On the surface ppl think i am cuz im surrounded by religious ppl. A part of their help includes doing prayers and speaking to God and so on. And other scientific things to help with my situation. 

Truth is, the religious part don’t work for me. The scientific part only works temporarily. And throughout my life I’ve disappointed my parents so much that I can’t tell them about this. I just don’t want to hurt them. Im tired of seeing them get exhausted and drained because of me and my baggage. They don’t deserve to live like this.

I'm a 29 year old science teacher, extorverted and married with no kids. My job push me to interact with hundreds of people every year, so I'm not isolated at all. Basically, i have no problems to find new people and meet them. 

The issue here is that the last interpersonal relationship i've form was from 9 years ago (with my wife). In 9 years i've have not make new friends in person. The reason behind this is because the cultural gap between them and i. Let me define ""cultura gap"".

I considere myself as a world citizen, mostly an internet person. I feel interest and emotion for all cultures in the world, but the person around have a strong sense of tradicionalism. They always listen the same music, dress like the same, eat the same things, and celebrate holidays like always been done.

I don't like that, not anymore. And when i want to show them another things, they refuse it and ignore it. I feel really sad, because i don't like them repetitive ways, so i feel apart and disconnected.

During this pandemic isolation, I've been alone the most part of the time, and surprisely I don't felt alone or sad because of that. And to be honest is becoming a little addictive to be this way.

My wife starts to worry because i'm slowly become a isolated person that don't want to get out and socialize with people. I understand her concern, but i feel comfortable and in control this way. 

This time lately, I rarely talks or intereact with other person in real life, even in internet. My wife works all day outside, so basically i'm alone all day. I know that human beings are social but i really need to overcome this ""crisis"" or it's ok to be this way?

I don't know if is good of bad for my mental health (that boderns me a lot), so i request your helpful advice. I'll appreciate it a lot. Thanks.",26Dec2020,1
221,"Hi there!

I have a question that I can't wait to ask you guys ( haha). I am a very, very impatient person and I just don't know how to cope with it. I talk very fast, I walk very fast and the worst is I can never enjoy  a moment because I keep thinking what I am going to do next. Moreover, it is a serious issue since I can't focus on lectures and studying either ( especially lectures). With studying it is better once I get drawn into it. But watching a person talk for hours is just unbearable for me.

What can I do to start being more patient in general?

Thank you in advance!",26Dec2020,1
222,"Mental Health Concerns

I keep experiencing the same feeling you get when a person says they are experiencing deja vu, but it’s almost like a flash of a life experience I haven’t experienced yet. All of these life experiences are of me getting into bad car crashes. Is this possibly just a subconscious fear I am having?",26Dec2020,1
223,"Hi guys! 

I don't know how to cope with my loneliness. All the social media that I use to fill my time when I want to relax only makes me feel worse: people in big groups going to the mountains, visiting each other on Christmas, doing activities and so on. I have none of that. I have a few ""friends"" that I would classify more as just acquaintances who I talk to sometimes on groups, but neither of them ever asks me specifically how I am, if I want to meet or anything like that. They all have other closer friends. And yes, I tried connecting to them myself, but I usually get an excuse. Corona doesn't help either. 

I am also in a relationship but lately it's more of a long distance one. Also, my partner has friends and people to talk to and go out with, so I try to avoid pushing him to spend time with me only because I don't.  So yea, to put it simply I am alone. I tried doing so many things to make friends, but it's harder with the virus and also because it's just hard after an age to make friends with people. They already have friends,  so they usually act like they don't need more.

What can I do, how can I cope? I even tried understanding Buddhism and meditating but it didn't help.",26Dec2020,1

It happens sometimes that she can't go to college due to her mental state, and when it happens I tend to tell her it's fine and she shouldn't worry about it. Although I know she needs motivation to go out, I know it will make her feel much shittier if I will make her fill guilty about not studying. am I making it worse? Should I try to convince her to go even when she don't feel like studying?

226,"A suicide joke was told amongst my family today . It was a joke , that’s all it was , no bad intent was directed at anyone. 

But I sat in the chair and thought to myself “if they knew the nights I used to sit with a blade in my hand screaming at myself to end my life and then throwing the blade across the room at the last minute. Or the nights I’ve sobbed myself to sleep praying I wouldn’t wake in the morning. Or the hospital visits I went to , so I could get stitched back together. Looking the woman who gave me life , straight in the eyes and sobbing as I told her I didn’t want it . The deep scars that even now I have to cover , as my body is horrible to look at “

this joke was never aimed at me or meant to hurt me in any way , but after years of silently chuckling at offensive jokes I stood up and said “I don’t think this is appropriate “ and they all got the hint and changed the subject . They meant no harm , but next time you make a joke , THINK . It might hit closer to home than you know

227,"I'm a 30 year old male. I'm not sure if I have a problem or not. Right now I have a BMI of 20, down from about 26. I definitely have body image issues - what I imagine as my ideal build would definitely be very underweight if I actually managed it. The point is I'm a healthy weight now.

For the last 2 years, I have gone through phases of restricting food and eating normally. For maybe 3 weeks I restrict obsessively, by counting calories and one or no meals a day, and avoiding certain foods - I'm constantly on it and find it difficult to stop. Lots of critiquing in the mirror, trying to pinch my ribs, weighing, etc. 

Then I might decide to have a few drinks on a Friday night. Or there might be a party, or like right now a religious festival. So lunch will become a 'normal' meal, dinner will be a 'normal' meal. And although I almost always skip breakfast anyway, I'll keep eating properly. I know I'm not binging - I'm just eating normally, and this will last maybe another few weeks. No obsessive thoughts, no scales and I'm probably meeting a healthly calorie range all the time. Then slowly I'll start obsessing again, skip a meal and the whole process starts again.

It feels like smoking, which I finally gave up a few years ago. For years, I'd quit cold turkey, be OK after a few days. Then having one cigarette meant I'd immediately be back on 20 a day for another few months. 

I've had a relaxed December. Completely happy, and I made and ate Christmas food over the last week without any anxiety. I know I'll be restricting again soon, because the body image anxiety has started. I've not gained any weight, nothing's different about me since the start of December, but by now I know the signs. 

I know its not healthy, but how serious is it? Half the time I'm eating perfectly normally (and again, I'm definitely not binging during the normal times). Most of my friends think I'm just a serial crash dieter, but my housemates who I cook have definitely noticed, since for the last year we've all worked from the home, and they see how much I vary my portion sizes. I don't know if the normal times will get fewer and shorter? Will it get harder to 'go normal' each time, even if there's an excuse?",26Dec2020,1

230,"need to vent, and rant, I need support, I need to know I'm not crazy. I need many things... I need a psychiatrist and a counselor, I need one now. I feel even worse because I've posted about this in a few subs, but no replies. I'm desperate. 

I don't know where to start. There's just so much.  Too much. Basically, my husband and I are going through a really rough patch, that's an understatement. I feel completely alone. I feel unloved and unlovable. I haven't been shown any physical love or affection in years, no interest, intimacy, no comfort.  I'm pushed away like a bug. Like I'm some disgusting creature. I see so much disappointment and disgust in his face. Nothing is good enough. I don't do enough. I'm not a good enough mother. I recently had a mental breakdown at work, and lost my job. It all just built up, and I broke. I'm broken.  He hasn't shown any kindness towards me or any interest. It's all just normal polite, daily things. The bare minimum. We don't talk about me, or my needs.  


I don't know what is wrong with me! I feel like I'm loosing myself. I don't recognize this person, I have become. 


I'm beneath the dog. I ruined Christmas. I couldn't find one of the gift cards I bought my son. It was 50$ I had the receipts, I tried to show him that I bought it, and how all the money was accounted for. He refused to look at them. Later, I just wanted to talk, to connect. I brought up some marriage and self help books I was reading.  That got ugly. I started crying and he was yelling. Told me he couldn't stand to sit here all day today and watch me cry. He said I don't do anything. I took a shower, calmed down and cleaned the house. Why, can't I stand up for myself?


I'm almost scared. I never know when I will be yelled at, or what will  be said. I try so hard... I know he hates me. I just overheard him talking to his daughter, my stepdaughter (20). He tells her everything. They were talking shit about me. I know they were. I had cookies in the oven, and when I bent over to get them out, she says ""I'm gonna whoop your ass"". My husband said I dare you, and then he said ""your gonna get hit, if you do"". I feel like they have their own schemes and inside jokes. They hide things from me. I can tell by the strange little bits and pieces I hear. I overheard them whispering about moving out, and about some plans to get rid of me. I have confronted him in the past, but the yelling, blaming, and defensiveness just proves my point, I feel, in a way. I'm accused of ease dropping, in my own house, when I'm in my bedroom laying on the bed. Now, I'm really uncomfortable around her. When she is in the living room/kitchen, I hide in my bathroom. I would never do this before, I broke.


Nobody knows how bad I feel, especially about loosing the gift card. I literally got sick and threw up. I beat myself up over it so much more than anyone else could. Nobody cares how much I'm hurting. I'm just pathetic. He has been telling everyone how bad his Christmas was. 


When I finally came out of my room, from hiding earlier, he actually acknowledged me. He asked what I was doing, in a nice way.  Why would he do that after he was talking about me? This makes me feel crazy and paranoid.


I can't remember anything, I am always forget things. My mental, emotional and cognitive skills are... not normal. I fold in on myself. If that makes sense?

I bet they purposely keep me out of the loop. He doesn't tell me anything! What am I supposed to do? I feel that he purposely keeps himself unavailable to me. Like, constantly playing video games, or watching TV. He won't let me interrupt him. Is this crazy???


Sorry if I jumped around, I just don't know anything, anymore. My feelings are all over the place! 


What can I do the next time I think they are talking about me? I know he does it, ive read messages about me on his phone.",26Dec2020,1
231," I'm starting to feel really worried about my girlfriend. She told me a few hours ago that she hallucinates a lot. They're always really graphic. Like seeing somebody get held hostage or someone getting shot in the head. And she told me she hears voices a lot, too. They're mostly whispers, but sometimes they tell her to kill herself or tell her how much of a mistake she is is what she told me. I don't know what to do. Like, I've already tried to convince her to talk to a counselor but she didn't. I've tried everything. She refuses to go to a therapist or take medications. She thinks she's fine but she's not. Help?

232,"I have a small group of girlfriends and we all suffer from some form of mental illness (depression, anxiety, PTSD).

In this friend group I frequently play the role of mother/therapist.

Over the past few years (but especially this year) my friendships have started to feel more and more like a chore.

One of the strangest things I've noticed is that my friends are ""bad weather friends"". If I am feeling depressed, or something in my life has gone wrong they will always be there for me. They are supportive and understanding if I'm having a problem but the minute something good happens in my life they disappear. 

They also disappear when something positive happens in their lives. 

They seemingly only want to communicate when something bad is happening in their lives or mine.

Has anyone else had this experience?

I'm trying to understand why my friends are like this but I just don't get it.

233,"i know that not alot of people will care about what im about to say but i know that ill feel better by saying the things that are on my mind.

i just had a breakdown, out of no where i burst out crying, the silent cry you do when you dont want to be heard when really you feel like screaming, infact im still crying while typing this. 
I haven't had a breakdown in a while but its good to let it all out sometimes, i dont know why i brokedown , maybe girl stuff, maybe the current situation of being in lockdown, maybe just being in a bad mood i dont know. I hate whenever this happens especially the aftermath, just feeling numb and completely exhausted not knowing what to do to cheer myself up. I know that things will get better, they definitely will, its normal to breakdown no one is expected to be happy all the time.
I have people around me who i know are there for me and might possibly see this reddit post but i dont want to dump all of my problems onto them because that isnt fair. Im always greatful for the support i recieve from the people closest to me, especially from my boyfriend, he always cheers me up.

234,"• Overthinking - I tend to overthink alot, even the littlest things. This wouldn't have been a problem if it was only me dealing with it but this is not the case I tend to bother everyone around me with my behaviour when I overthink something. Like even when there is a minor issue I tend to make a big deal about it and risk around the hospitals untill I'm clear about the issue.

• Trust issues - I have extreme trust issues, From the example I cited above I don't even trust the doctors, I tend to go from one doctor to another for the same issue and the person living with me should obviously be the one to take me around the hospitals. 

• Phobias - My fear of men and secluded places. I've had a traumatic experience, where I was sexually assaulted by a man in a secluded area and since then I have extreme fear and it triggers everytime I see an empty place like an elevator, stairs, or anywhere and this just gets even worse if there is any man approaching by. I noticed this fear triggers me even when I'm with my family or friends and tend to rush then to leave the place as soon as possible. 

• Identity issues - I've been blackmailed by a guy whom I trusted to be nice man. Since then I've deleted all my social media. No facebook, Instagram, or linked in. I always opt the platforms that are anonymous. 

• Past Relationships - Should one discuss them at all? Coz, everytime I discussed it, it only backfired.. Like the guy pretending to be fine and cool about it earlier but when things get worse they tend to bring them up in the arguments as a way to demean us. I feel it is better to lie about it that I don't have any past than beibg honest. 

These are few things I bother me and make me question if I'm eligible at all for a marriage! Because, I don't think I can handle a family with all my fears and Overthinking. I don't think I can make a good supportive wife to my husband and a mother to my child. I don't even know how to discuss these with a person I'm getting married to.",26Dec2020,1
235,"My (21f) Boyfriend (31M) is choosing to support my goal to gain weight even though it will put him at the bad end of situation. 
We’ve been together for almost 3 years now and he’s been really supportive through my battle with depression and anxiety. He’s made many sacrifices for me, despite being on the bad end of the situation most of the time. 
Gaining weight has been a thing I’ve always wanted to do, because being underweight severely affects my confidence, and in turn makes my anxiety and depression levels higher. I always talk to him about what’s on my mind so he knows that. 
I have recently been able to start working on this goal, because I got new a job. 
The problem is, the job doesn’t really pay me enough to be able to take care of us AND the extra stuff I would need to start gaining weight (only in terms of food, other expenses are taken care of) This is why he has decided to tell me to do my thing and not worry about him and that he will get food from his family. 
You see, he has been taking care of both our expenses for the past 2 and a half years but he recently lost his job due to covid and is in the process of finding another one. 
For a long time I have felt like I don’t do enough in the relationship, he does basically everything because my anxiety causes me to not be able to live life like a normal person should, and I’m very insecure about that. 
Mostly because he’s mentioned that I don’t really make many sacrifices due to my mental illnesses multiple times. I’m worried that this is internally making him uncomfortable and he’s not telling me, and maybe that will harm our relationship. 
This causes a dilemma, because on one hand, I want to take of us.
I finally have the chance to do more in the relationship in terms of finances. However, on the other hand, deep down I know getting to a healthier weight will make me feel more confident and less anxious, and I’ll be able to function better or.. more normal. 
Both are important to me and my mental health but choosing the one that mostly benefits me makes me feel bad and choosing the one that doesn’t benefit me as much makes me feel bad. Ugh, I’m a horrible person. Can anyone tell me how I can make myself feel better about these kind of decisions?
I’m very nervous about posting this but I don’t want to feel bad about it anymore 

Sorry if it’s too long and if my grammar and format is bad.

TL;DR: My boyfriend is encouraging me to make a decision that will only benefit me and I’m insecure that it will cause harm to our relationship.",26Dec2020,1

237," I don't even know how to start this, but recently I've been finding myself crying or feeling like crying over the smallest and dumbest things. I'm not -or a used to be- someone who cries easily, like I would cry one or two times a year, and during those few times I'd cry it all out until I had ""no more tears left"". So that's why I'm surprised of this problem now.

I'll give you a few short examples of what I mean, maybe that could help you a little to understand what I'm trying to explain.

\- Maybe this one is actually justified. This happened on December from last year. I had a final at uni, one I actually studied for and I was prepared for. Turned out, I fell asleep that morning because I had been messing up the twenty alarms on my phone the previous days and I forgot to put them all back for the final morning. I woke up at 9 o'clock -literally the same time the final began- by myself, I had a 5 minutes shower and flew my house. The moment I closed the door of the elevator I broke down and started to cry. I didn't cry for more than 5 minutes tho, it was really short.

\- This one was on February from this year. I was trying to do some math exercises for a test that was around the corner, there were a lot of different subjects that I had to learn them in a really short time. I was struggling a lot because I couldn't get any right answers. Out of nowhere my mom called me on the phone telling me that one of their (my parents) tenants was coming to the house and that I had to receive the money and give him an acquittance. I do this every month with the other tenants that I have been more familiar with over the years, so it was no problem for me to do it, although I didn't know that man as well as the others. Anyway, the acquittance was in blank so I had to filled it. Idk why, maybe because I was already stressed about my math exercises, but when the intercome (the man was already here, just a few seconds after my mom called) sounded I broke down and I started crying. All while my mum indicated me what I had to write down, not to mention how I kept making mistakes and writing stuff where it didn't belong, making me more stressed out. Same at the previous one, it just happened like for two minutes. When I was receiving the man I wasn't crying anymore.

\- Just like the first one but I didn't have anything important to do that day. I fall asleep because I didn't put the alarm on my phone, and I woke up by myself at 11:30 (when I'd usually wake up at 10:00 thanks to the alarm) I didn't miss any online class or anything, but that didn't stop me from crying.

\- This ones are more recently and honestly plain embarrassing. I find myself feeling like crying -eyes stinging, the feeling of my chest tightening- when something I planned doesn't work out the way I want? Like when I already know what I want to cook but my parents tell me that they already decided what they are gonna prepare. Or that I have to wait for them to eat, when I eat a certain hour (15 pm) and they eat a an hour later (16:00 or 16:30?) because they're not hungry when I am.

The last ones sound pretty embarrassing/stupid the more I read them, but those are the ones that keep happening more often, considering that we are in quarentine (since the middle of March) here in my country. I don't know why I react like this to things so simple as the ones I just said, usually I would just get angry or frustrated but I wouldn't cry about it, let alone so easily. (Like I said, I didn't usually cry easily for the dumbest things like I do right now) I didn't know who or where to ask about this, so that's why I'm posting it here. Is there any explanation for this? Anyone has been through something like this?",26Dec2020,1
238,"Im unsure if this is the right sub to post this in, but I’ll do it anyways.

15F. I have been diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression, OCD, and ADD.

This first happened in October. I wanted to try this “reality shifting” thing that had been happening on TikTok. I shut my door and was getting ready to go to sleep, when I imagined a large humanoid figure with an abnormally long neck coming out from under my bed and starring at me. I started to shake and internally panic, causing me to leap out of my bed and stand on the middle of my hallway, still shaking.

It has happened several times again, but tonight was the last straw. I was laying in my bed and had the door open, showing my dimly lit hallway. I was watching YouTube on my laptop (just gaming videos, nothing scary) when I imagined another humanoid like figure that had spider like legs crawling quickly through the hallway and climbing up my footboard onto my bed. I panicked yet again and hugged my knees to my chest, starring at my hallway with wide eyes until my cat came to me and started rubbing against me, calming me down.

I talked to my friend about this (they have been studying mental health for a few years now) to which they said it was not normal and it could be schizophrenia, although I don’t believe them.

It’s just.. I am such a romantic, I am obsessed with love, really, I love reading and watching romance like I love breathing. And sometimes both end up making me bawl my eyes out. I am aware of (one of) the roots of my inner turmoil (short: lifelone emotional, physical and for 6years sexual abuse by my older brother when I was little; parents were oblivious bc I was a serious stockholm syndrome case and protected my brother about every bruise etc; me forgiving him years later for everything bc tired of hating him; him throwing it in my face and pretty much literally breaking my heart)
I also know that due to my other trauma with people, I have major trust issues. Adding to the list, my fear of losing someone dear to me by death is downright crippling. Also, I am hyper self aware when it comes to my psychological issues which brings me to the point of this post. 
I would be lying if I said I didn’t want love. A trusting, loving, kind yet passionate partner who supports me and lets me love him. Bc God knows I have so much love to give. But I also so do not want a relationship. Not only do I not want to be a burden. Bc I know I can be fun and outgoing and loving and happy for the most part, but I am so broken I feel I’m suffocating at times. For quite some time, I was doing really well, not needing anyone. And I am sure it must be possible not to need anyone. It can’t be that you have to make yourself emotionally dependable on others. I refuse to believe that. But I am so, so tired. I don’t know how I can get out of this mess (don’t suggest therapy please, I know that’s prob the first thing that comes to mind).
