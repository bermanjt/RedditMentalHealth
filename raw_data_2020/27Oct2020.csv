0,Everyday I feel lost. I just walk through my day. I’m so suicidal but I’m too scared to actually kill myself due to being too scared of pain. I’m just so lost and unhappy I feel like I’m always living on the verge on a total “mental breakdown” I’m always apathetic yet crippled with anxiety. I have no friends for help and Idk I’ve exhausted all my resources. I have so much to say yet not enough  words to explain. I dont know how to explain when I just don’t know myself. Everyday I get more and more aware of the fact I can kill myself. Not sure peace y’a. I just want to hear what u have to say don’t b like “oh it gets better” I’ll just assume u say it,27Oct2020,1

2,"I'm a 20 year old female who has a long list of things wrong with my brain. I've been self-harming for 8 years and it's gotten progressively worse through out the years.

I got a cat when I was a teenager. A little black kitten named Edgar. But we'd call him Egg. He was my absolute best friend. We followed me around like a puppy. He'd sit in my lap when I'd play video games and he knew when I was sad or about to cut again. He got me through heart breaks, addiction, and even suicide. To make a long story short, my parents weren't paying rent and we got evicted. I couldn't bring him to a motel with me. My aunt offered to watch him and her fucking son let him outside. I never saw him again.

That was almost two years ago now. My heart still fucking aches. I cry almost every night thinking about him. He made me so damn happy. I know it's dumb being this sad about a cat, but he was all i had in terms of support for a while. I don't know what to do. I felt like he was the one thing that kept me sane.",27Oct2020,1

6,"Hello everyone!

Please don’t make fun of this. I’m struggling with this issue.

I’m a white guy that have OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I have a Pure Obsessive variant (Pure O). It means that all the obsessive process happens only mentally and you don’t see the compulsions happening, or maybe they’re not apparent.

With this OCD Pure O Variant, I had some phases. 

A. I had a Phase when I believed my thoughts were able to cause harm to others, because sooner or later after I had a bad thought something bad would happen after.

B. I had another phase when I believed I was getting sick. And getting worse and worse. Of course, I was not.

C. Now I’m having a third phase where i found myself incredibly scared of being racist (not in a long term, as this were part of me for a long time, but of having postures that can frame as so).

Thus, makes me feel unwell and treat black people very well, giving them bigger and nicer looks, paying more attention to what they say, these kind of things.

The problem is, this isn’t something that seem totally natural, and sometimes they notice it and it kind of feels like a reverse racism (not like black against white, but like treating blacks best over whites) and that I’m doing so only to look nice.

What would tell me?

I would feel better to have replies if psychologists but I’ll see all posts

14,"I recently got out of a “relationship” with someone I consider to be a narcissist, so I threw myself into research on it. I became fascinated with it, and realized it might be describing how I am.

I am a 20 year old woman who has always had a problem with emotions. I don’t like voicing them, but I do feel them. I think when someone shows their emotions, I show sympathy, but I secretly think they are weak. I am also really bad about “turning on and off” how I feel about people. Especially those I’m close too. One day I feel normal towards them, the next day I am pretty much disgusted, thinking I should tell them I don’t want them around anymore. I even have these feelings toward my mother.

When someone I care about (as much as I am able to care?) makes me mad, I do little things I know to make them upset until they apologize. Or if someone has “crossed” me in some way, I take their biggest insecurities and throw it in their face. I tell them all the things I secretly think that I know will hurt them. It’s almost like I black out when I am angry, and when I’m done going in on them, I come back to and feel horrible for the things I’ve done and said.

I kind of expect everyone to think highly of me. I don’t actively do this, but if I walk into a room of strangers, I just kind of assume everyone has this amazing perception of me. Like “wow, she’s special, I hope she knows it”. It’s not like I can walk into a room full of doctors and expect them to think I’m better than them, but I do hope they think things like “she’d make a perfect surgeon, she doesn’t need to waste her time with anything else”.

I like when people open up to me and trust me with their biggest secrets. I like knowing someone considers me someone who knows them the best. But I never let them into who I really am. I pride myself on that, honestly. How could they be so dumb to open up to someone they don’t even know? I have multiple people who consider me their best friend, and it usually turns me “off” of them. I’m your favorite person? I expect to be, but at the same time, it’s like, I don’t even see why I would be. 

I actually do, though, put people on a pedestal when I first meet them (only if I view them romantically though), bur honestly after a while it wears off and I’m looking for the next best thing. But if they aren’t obsessed with me or fall back, I try and get to be their #1, even if I don’t feel the same. Even now, after I got out of that “relationship” I have a back up I am kind of trying to “get back” into my life, slowly but surely. When he was really into me, I was disgusted with him, but when he showed a lack of interest I was fighting for his approval and love. There was even a time when we were just friends and he told me he thought other girls were cute and I would always say things like “she’s too pretty for you” or “you could never do that well”, I said I was kidding when he called me on it after putting up with it for so long, but I kind of knew I meant it. 

I am actually pretty reserved and quiet (which I’ve read isn’t usual for a narcissist) but I am charming when someone sits down to have a conversation with me (at least I think so). I don’t think I can think of one person who has a bad impression of me. And if they had one, I think they are just jealous they don’t compare. And I can admit this now, but when it comes down to it, I genuinely think it’s on them and not on me.

I found that if I see a girl who’s prettier than me at work, I try and figure out everything about her and get everyone’s take on her. I’m sure she’s nice and great, but probably not as great as me. I think I’m a jack of all trades, and no one could possibly attain all that I do.

One thing I’ve always said is “I care that people are doing okay, but I don’t care about how their day is going. Like if I was at work, I don’t care to hear the story of how your cat died yesterday, and I don’t feel bad about it either,” but I don’t want to see that person walk into the street and get hit by a car. I’d hope they are okay, but honestly, right after it happened, I’d forget about it. But I’m sure a lot of people think like that, don’t they?

I don’t lack empathy all together. If someone’s father died, I’d get what they’re going through, as my father is deceased too. But if someone said their younger sibling passed away, I can assume they’re sad (obviously) but I wouldn’t be able to feel what they’re feeling or even begin to try.

I don’t for sure think I have NPD, but I do think I have a personality disorder. I don’t want to go to my doctor and say all those things and her see me as some self absorbed monster. Because, I genuinely don’t think that’s what I am. I care about people and not just for my own personal gain. Does anyone have any idea what it could be?",27Oct2020,1
15,"To whom it may concern:

Abuse is a horrible thing that, unfortunately, we as humans have to learn to deal with. However, it seems to me that moral spectrums become relative when it comes to a higher power because we can't wholly observe ""God's"" intention. Through the power of relative perception, we can theorize the possibility of an ""ultimate energy"", but we cannot give any certainty to whether or not it exists, because ultimate implies infinite, which our quantitative brains cannot comprehend. If you perceive the possibility as an infinite yes, you are called faithful because you believe in things that cannot be observed. Unequivocally, the perversion of faith into hate is exemplified through extremists, no matter the religion they follow. That being said, I'm not here to attack anyone's faith, I'm solely here to get different perspectives on religous abuse.

A little backstory as to why I'm asking this:

I was adopted at 9 years old with my blood brother after growing up homeless in California for the first four and being juggled in the system through multiple states for the remaining five. At this time in my life I was too young to know if a ""conciousness"" existed, let alone understand what that even meant for myself. All I knew was that I need food, shelter, and that I liked learning things. When I got introduced to my adoptive parents, they seemed to be good people so I decided to try to follow in their footsteps, physically and morally. However, I was unaware of the fact that I was getting indoctrinated into an extremist southern baptist family. My adoptive mother is a certified biblical counselor, and my father is a devout deacon. However, throughout the 8 years I lived with them, I was physically and mentally abused on almost a daily basis. All of this was done in the name of ""Godly Reprimandation."" I'm not going to go too far into the abuse, just for the sake of I dont want to accidentally trigger anyone reading this. All that matters is that 6 years ago I was ""kicked out"" (I told them I was moving out and they threw all of my stuff over the fence in the front yard) and have been fighting to survive the effects of the abuse. Like the rest of the world, I've been spending the past few months of quarantine worrying mainly about my physical health, but I can't help but to think from a sort of ""god head"" mentality. Ethics is a delicate subject because of different perspectives, and if all I think about are my ethics, my mindset becomes fragile too, so I'm hoping to learn better ways to project my energy towards those I love so that I dont exhibit the effects of abuse onto them. I'm aware of the ways that I find catharsis, but if my means of catharsis hurts someone else, it isn't truly catharsis; its abuse. I try my best to refuse being like the people who did that to me, but sometimes I catch myself doing it. These behaviors manifest into sociopathic tendencies and I'm hoping to change, but I'm not sure how to disprove god and justify my anger towards the abuse I suffered in his name. If whoever is reading this has found ways of maintaining a sort of balance, I would be overjoyed to hear from you. Thank you so much for your time!",27Oct2020,1

Was around constant arguing, still am though, had to deal with being constantly dragged to my sister's doctors' appointment (she has severe depression, anxiety, anorexia, and sleep apnea) and it goes on and on.

She has self-harmed since she was 13. She is 19 now. I, too, have fallen down this rough path. I've been cutting and self-harming with other methods for two years now. I still do and relapsed recently. She found out I made a third Instagram account this year, which was about all my depressing thoughts (and some mentionings of wanting to die) so I deleted it. She told me I am depressed and that she would know because she has struggled with depression (clinically diagnosed) for so long. 

Enough backstory, onto how I feel. 

I sometimes find it so hard to get up and do things. No motivation, feel empty but have this heavy feeling of sadness, I think, in my chest. Too tired to do much of anything besides just feeling sad, empty, unmotivated, or a combo of two. It's so deteriorating. 

Maybe it is worth mentioning that I have clinically diagnosed Generalized Anxiety disorder and am much of a perfectionist. I have very low self-esteem and think so lowly of myself. I have always had to put on a smile, laugh, and pretend that I'm happy and okay. When I'm really not. I feel like I'm dead, a lot. I'm very grade-driven and that's how I give myself self validation, but even then, I don't think highly of myself even when I get a perfect score. Lately, how I've been feeling for the past three years has gotten worse and I feel how I do even more intensely. It's just so hard. I feel like I don't go a day without feeling sad or numb at least some point in every day. 

The thoughts I have, they're just.. so draining. I also want to mention that I have been feeling this way most of the time for 3 years now, I am thirteen atm. The world just seems so deliberating to me. I don't know what to do at this point. There's a lot more, I just don't know how to describe it. But from what I have described, do I sound depressed? 

Notice: I am not trying to be an edgy teenager who thinks depression is quirky and a trend. I understand how horrible it is and I'm sorry to everyone out there. It's not fair, I know. I hope everyone is doing okay and if you're not, that's okay too; but I believe in you and I'm proud of you even if I may not know you. &lt;!&gt; I am not asking for a diagnosis, I just want to know if I should try to gain the courage to talk about this with my therapist.

28,"I feel terrible

This just happened, and i feel like shit.

Let me start by saying that my mom has a short and explosive temper, and if something happens that sets it off (like you’ll see), she tends to don’t think very rationally.

So the thing that happened is that my mom was making her dinner, and while she was doing it, one of our cats (he’s a rescue, and very young, like 4 or 5 months old) broke a type of “chainmail” (i don’t know how to call it) from the window, and that set off her temper, because that specific cat is a bit of a troublemaker, and has been breaking that “chainmail” from days before.

Anyway, when he broke it, my mom exploded, and wanted to throw the cat to the street (and she would have done it), and i decided to not let it happen.

After a bit of a struggle (that consisted of me trying to stop her), i finally got her to stop trying to throw it out (i.e.: by unwillingly redirecting her anger towards me), and more struggle ensued.

A tad later after the second struggle, she blow up by verbal means, and started saying that “i love the cat more than her” and “to never again try and interfere”.

And she’s now locked in her room, angry as hell, and i feel awful that she told me all those things, and the only thing i wanted was to stop her from throwing the cat to the street; i feel awful that i didn’t think of another way and had to physically oppose her; i feel awful about hurting her feelings; i feel awful because i do love her, like any children loves their mom, and i didn’t want to hurt her, but i feel awful because she’s angry at me, and i didn’t want that to happen, and i feel awful about doing that, even if it meant protecting the cat, i hurt her, and i just wanted to protect the cat, but instead i did this.

The essence of this content is to bring self awareness, which will lead you to becoming a better person. Hence We Discuss 10 personality traits of people pleasers.

Seeking to please people all the time may end up hindering you from reaching your full potential and achieving your goals in life and you see, people pleasing is not the main problem itself, it is merely a reflection of more deeper issues, which more often than always, has to do with one's estimation of their self-worth. 

For some, It stems from the need to always be liked and accepted. to other,  it may be as a result of their up bringing or maybe a situation they went through in the past, which over time has made it their way of life.

I'll make my story short. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression that has prevented me from moving into a 'real' job, hurt my studies and motivation.

Hobbies include: Films and TV, heavy metal music, history, working out at the gym, psychology, US politics, art, trying different foods, occasional video games, atheism, writing, bushwalks, most things horror-related.

Not expecting much, but would love to at least talk to anyone. Have a good day.",27Oct2020,1
36,"I've always had a lot of energy. I might not have always been doing what I was supposed to, but I was always doing something, be it constructive or destructive. 
I was a good student in highschool and a partier. I generally had a job and had big social circles in the places I had family. Had Friends and always had someone around to talk to or hang out with. 
I had some family problems, lost my sister and my mom and there was a lot of fighting at that time (dad was a Dr mom was an English teacher but they were toxic and the house was crazy at best).
Had to drop out of school. Got on meth hard. Was in and out of jail and eventually prison a few times.
Got sober after my last release in 07 and went to work serving tables at busy restaurants and paying for a few classes at community college. Made A's, fixed my gpa and got scholarships to Texas tech for engineering.
Made president's list spring and summer terms this year, but began struggling mentally towards the end.
I quit going to the gym, I took out loans and quit my job, I don't have any friends anymore.
My friends from highschool are just gone somewhere, my good friends from my troubled years dead in prison or strung out.
I don't ever see anyone. I have no one to call. I dont ever leave my camper except class.
I am starting to get behind, just cus I can't sit and do my work, but I've been going to school and making A's and serving and bartending and running a small landscaping service for two years since getting sober.
What is happening to me. 
I'm lonely.
I'm ten years older than the people I see everyday. 
I haven't had a girlfriend since before I got on drugs in 2010, or about that time.
I haven't had a regular lover since I got sober.
I'm thirty and I should be a doctor by now.
I'll be 33 when I graduate for engineering. That's ten years I wasted.
And I'm scared bdcaus I keep wasting hours or days daily. 
What if I waste this too?
I slipt on meth this weekend. For the first time since 2017.
I can't do this. This isn't the world I thought was waiting for me.
And I can't even get myself to go to the gym or go ride my dirtbike or do anything. 
What's happening to me?

I'm not lazy. I was always doing something. Now I can't do fun stuff even",27Oct2020,1
37,Ok so I’m a 20 year old male and I would consider myself an introvert. It really takes a lot of courage for me to open up and express my feelings. I never dated anyone or anything of that nature because I’m not that social. I have a female friend who I seriously liked and after months I finally built up the courage to ask her out and she declined. I’m grateful for the fact that we are still friends and it’s like that moment never happened but I’m so torn down about it. I want to move on but I can’t. It’s eating me up and it’s distracting me from other things in life. I see her frequently at the gym and it’s just depressing knowing I care about her so much but those feelings aren’t mutual. I seriously want to get over it but I just can’t it’s such a hard pill to swallow. I know there’s more people out there but I’m so tunnel visioned on her I’m blind to everything else. Please help me I can’t keep living like this I know I’m probably making this a way bigger deal than it really is but this is destroying my mental and I take my mental serious. Thank you,27Oct2020,1
38,"So a while ago my grandma died. We weren’t that close so it didn’t fuck me up that much. I just sorta internalized it. What did fuck me up was the funeral.

I saw my first dead body and i felt like I couldn’t breath. I sat down in the pews or whatever where the funeral was held and I think i just kept repeating “this isn’t happening” or “this isn’t real” in my head. 

It’s been a while since then but I think I believed myself when I said that. My memory foggy, so pinpointing any specific experience is hard to link to my current scenario, but the funeral is one of the most vivid things I remember. All the rest of my memory is fucked.

Any way I don’t think the world is real. I don’t think anything is real, including myself . It scares me and depresses me at the same time. I’m still in high school so the only thing it’s fucking with is my motivation, but since i’m supposed to be a high functioning genius according to my parents, I haven’t fallen behind. 

It just sucks I guess and I already got a therapist and i’m thinking of sending an email abt this but it seems so scary I don’t want to be seen as crazy or something. 

Any tips?",27Oct2020,1
39,I don’t know what’s always wrong with me. I am only 24 years old. I constantly have anxiety and feel depressed over life. I can’t find any joy. I get so mad at very little things and I like to isolate myself a lot so I’m not around people. But this doesn’t help me at all. I’m sorry I’m just venting on her because I just need support in some way. I have gone to counseling but can’t seem to stick to it. I have been in depression/anxiety meds and I hated who I was. I haven’t found my purpose in life yet and maybe that is a problem. But I feel I have no purpose. I feel hopeless.,27Oct2020,1
40,"Hi there! Before I begin venting, here’s some context: I’m a student at university really busy between classes, internships and volunteer work.

This quarter I started taking 4 classes. Probably shouldn’t have done so but felt like I needed to take these classes to transfer in time (I go to CC). I’m a Computer Science Major who feels like my coding skills are not good enough to pursue internships but I do anyway. Whenever my professors teach on Zoom, I feel disinterested, bored and just end up doing something else while on Zoom. I feel like I’m a little behind in homework now. That’s my fault I guess. 

On top of that I’m juggling two internships and 1 volunteer work. My first internship which is currently ongoing is okay. They’re mainly students trying to found their own startup and I help with the code. However, I don’t feel competent enough to help. My knowledge is pretty basic and the code looks pretty complex. I feel like even they know I’m not competent enough. I reached out for feedback and although they sounded nice I think they tried not to hurt my feelings. I don’t know what I’m doing. I only make minor fixes to the user interface. This one time my mentor had to fix everything I wrote. 

I have a lot on my plate right now and I want to give my 100% to each of them. However, at the same time, I don’t want to let go of any of these opportunities cause as a prospective transfer student interested in majoring in CS, it’s really competitive so I’m doing my best to standout. 

All this is putting stress on me and I don’t look forward to waking up each day anymore. I moved here (US) 9 months ago and 3 months in school went online so I don’t really know anyone besides my family living with me. Everyday there’s constantly so many things to do, and I’m just so scared I’ll mess my grades or my internships will finally realize I don’t know what I’m doing. I cried for the first time just now. I don’t know what I’m doing and everyday whenever I procrastinate or don’t get what I wanted done I regret it for not being productive. I know my mental health is not doing well but I think if I can grind it out for the next 2 months I can do it?",27Oct2020,2

42,"Honestly it's strange. My mind is all over the place right now, I do have pretty bad body dysmorphia and an ED and I just want it to stop, I just want the constant torment of hating my body and the constant worry of what will happen when I eat, I'm not severely anorexic, hardly anorexic at all, hell, I'm the average body, if not larger but I have to admit that my BDD has seriously been getting on top of me lately.

I've been genuinely entertaining the idea of heading to the forth road, although I would never act on it, I think I just need to think there, granted a suspension bridge across a river is arguably not the best idea for a mind that isn't doing the grandest but a vice is a vice.

I know I wouldn't ever act on it as for my family, if it were not for them I would have already acted on it long ago, I've been to the forth before and seriously contemplated my fate and a small while after almost ran myself off the edge of a cliff, but that was then, and this is now. Then I had great reason to want to meet the water, these days I haven't a good reason at all, which is a good thing absolutely but my body dysmorphia is just one ugly beast when it rears its head, I'm so over it these days that I think I'm starting to reach my tether with it.

47,"Since about 3 years ago my OCD got really bad and has affected every part of my life and daily routine in some way or another. It is not so bad to the point that it’s unbearable or I can’t get my work done but it is a huge inconvenience and very uncomfortable. Some of my main obsessions/compulsions are thinking I’m dirty and taking too long in the shower, feeling like my hands are dirty and going through a whole bottle of hand soap in a couple days, and feeling like I forgot something and recollecting on everything I did in my head over and over again. I also have this thing where I am convinced I smell horrible and worry that others think I smell so I try to not put myself in situations where I would be in close physical proximity to others. So if I need to get past someone I will take the long way around. If someone is close to me and we are talking I basically hold my breath or look away when I talk because I’m worried I have bad breath. I likely smell fine however as I have very good hygiene. I even use a bidet. No one has ever told me I smell bad except for maybe when I would get picked up from cross country practice and my mom said I smelt sweaty. If I get extremely nervous and sweat through my deodorant then maybe my armpits will smell a little but I usually don’t get sweaty armpits. I wouldn’t say it is a confidence issue as I am fairly confident and have a good image of myself. I have tried to get over these problems by going to multiple therapists and researching as much as I can. I have tried putting myself in the situations that cause the anxiety and try to ride it out but the “what if” in my head always sends me back to worrying. I have asked my general physician if he thinks I should be put on medication but he thinks I am too young. I am 18/m. I don’t want to have to use medication as crutches but I also want to live an enjoyable life while I am still young. Any opinions or advice is much appreciated.",27Oct2020,1

49,"god, where to begin. my mental health has never really been good throughout my life, with the exception of like the first 8 years of my life and some good seasons sprinkled on top of shit. but im not gonna unload the pandora’s box, i just need to talk about what’s been going on recently. within the past 4 years of my life i’ve been slowly discovering my gender identity, which is either non binary or binary trans ftm. within the past few months, the realization of all the fucked up god awful things that trans people have to deal with kinda hit me. for example, the never ending depression that comes with realizing that i might never be able to be comfortable with my body. binding can make me feel good, but instead of giving me a confidence boost like it used to i know only get saddened by  all of the small details i pick out. i genuinely don’t like being trans at this point. i know that it’s all doom and gloom, and i still firmly believe that trans people can be happy with themselves even without any medical transitioning. but, due to the fact that i have a predisposition to depression since i’ve had it in the past, i can’t help but get increasingly depressed and angry. i don’t know how to deal with the realization that being trans fucking sucks. like how i’ll never be flat chested unless i can somehow come up with the money for top surgery, or how in the US there was a very discriminatory law passed in texas towards trans and disabled people, or how almost every day i hear some transphobic shit that threatens my well being. wish i could find a gender therapist to talk to, but i live smack dab in the buckle of the bible belt so the closest gender therapist is probably an hour away at least. god, it’s all just a mess. ill spend hours of my day just obsessively researching shit like surgeries or trans suicide rates or lack of protected trans rights in my area, even tho i know it makes me extremely sad. i’ve spent hours and hours just laying im bed crying because of this shit.

ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS, i’m unable to communicate any of this or any of my other mental health/emotional well being to the person i am closest to. i won’t use his actual name, but i’ll just call him james. james and i have a very close and kind of strange relationship. we used to date and there’s a lot of bad relationships shit we went through, but that’s a whole other story. he’s relevant to my mental health now because he has told me that he doesn’t babe the emotional capacity to help me. i totally get that, but damn i just wish i could talk to him. i’ve developed really bad habits because of this, like convincing myself i bother him and extremely bottling up my emotions. i get needing space, and i really don’t want to make him help me when i know that it would hurt him. i just, idk. sometimes it feels like he doesn’t really care about my well being? like i’ve told him to some extent about my dysphoria and how that has made me increasingly suicidal, and yet i have to sacrifice my well being and keep my mouth shut for him. i deeply care about james and i don’t want him to sacrifice his well being to help me, but that means that i have to suffer in silence. i’m not supposed to talk to him about being suicidal or my safety or my dysphoria or anything that’s deemed emotionally heavy. so while i’m dealing with my mild to sever depression, anxiety, and gender dysphoria, it’s made all the worse by the fact that i have to go through it alone. 

i guess that’s why i needed to vent, just because i can’t keep going like this. i have been on and off planning to kill myself for a while now. i can’t continue to live in constant pain, the least i can do is try to relive that pain through strangers on the internet.",27Oct2020,1
50,"I’ve always had times where I’ve felt pretty out of my body. As if some part of me is 70% outside of my physical body and not weighed down. If I tried to scratch myself, it wouldn’t feel as real as when I do it when I feel entirely inside of my body. It’s a weird, floaty, weightless feeling. I feel very hollow, more hollow than the usual depressive emptiness. It’s like even my bones are hollow. Maybe my arms aren’t even there. It’s like being hungry on an empty stomach, except that emptiness is spreading throughout my body under every inch of my skin. 

I know I usually feel like this in emotionally intense / high-conflict situations because I start to panic. But this also happens quite a bit with no specific trigger as well. 

I had a bad depressive day yesterday. Today I don’t feel completely in my body. I feel like my body and my brain are separate from each other. I could be doing work and just not be actively present at the same time, like I’m awake and asleep all at once. Coming back into focus (when I’m really mentally out of it) feels like hypnic jerks every couple of seconds. 

It’s a weird feeling but I don’t know, I’ve never gotten an answer for what this is. If it helps with context, I’ve always seemed to be very prone to daydreaming and mentally checking out of things. This also happened prior to getting onto antidepressants. Maybe I’m just perpetually sleep deprived or something? (Though I do sleep a lot these days) Or maybe this is just drowsiness?

54,"Hello, hi, my decision making skills that are worse than a carrot has brought me here so I really can only blame myself. I’m a student, and I’ve been blessed with actually having nice teachers. However, I had a rough self esteem period two or three weeks ago in October (topped off with my menstrual cycle) and I didn’t do any of my homework and didn’t pay attention at all in the majority of my classes. Now I have no idea what’s going on in classes, I’m behind on a lot of homework, and most of all I’m failing a class because I just can’t sit down and do my fucking homework, and my mom keeps reminding me (but she’s a really good and understanding mom and I love her and she doesn’t deserve to keep reminding me of something I’m reminded of in my own head). But the point is that I just keep putting it off. The more homework I have, the more I want to sleep. The more I sleep, the more homework I accumulate, and the cycle continues.

I know I’m doing this to myself, and the marking period is going to be finished in a week (maybe? I actually don’t know it’s just a vague deadline) and I’m too scared to touch the homework I haven’t done because that requires an explanation to my teachers. But I know I’m just making excuses. There’s no good reason for me to be doing this to myself. I just hate school taking half my day away and expecting me to work for the other half I have left. 

Pushing away school for the moment (like I do with my homework, ha) Halloween is also coming up. Fun fact, that’s my birthday! My friends and I are finally doing our first proper group costume and I should be excited but I’m just... not. (I actually have never seen monster high which is our theme so im not really crazy about the group theme but that’s not the main point here) I’m actually a little nervous because one of my friends admitted to having symptoms of depression and had agreed to getting seen by a doctor. Which is amazing and I’m super proud and supportive of her wanting to take such a big step in being better mentally but I’m afraid of doing literally anything that would bore her or make her feel uncomfortable. Whenever we hangout you can kinda tell if she’s getting bored or uninterested and it’s makes me feel awful because I hate people not feeling included or not having fun. (Also she said she doesn’t like dark self deprecating jokes which is very fair and reasonable because they can be very straining to a person who’s not in the right state of mind and I stopped for her but those are like the only jokes I do to cope with my feelings so yay me) So to TL;DR this topic: my friend has symptoms of depression and we’re meeting up soon with all our friends and I don’t want her to feel bad in any possible way.

So, to wrap up my pity party quickly bc the taxis will be arriving soon and the cake’s getting soggy, other than my friend’s own mental state which I share my own worry in accidentally making worse, the school part is entirely my fault and I know I just need to buckle down and bite my tongue, but it’s hard. I’ve actually been considering going to my guidance counselor (for what? idk probably just to vent I didn’t think that far ahead), which is something I’ve never done before as I don’t like asking for help (which is ironic because I’m here lol).

68,"I've struggled with social anxiety throughout my life. In elementary school, in high school, and even throughout most of college. To make it worse in 10th grade gym class I had a very embarrassing moment. Almost everyone was in that gym class. The class went quiet, and I accidentally farted super loudly. Everyone bursted out laughing. I was a quiet kid, and a lot of the ""cool kids"" would make fun of me about that incident. Even my friends. Everyone knew that story. Anyways it lasted until graduation, and even in uni when i would see some of the people from that high school gym class. I use to get flashbacks of all the embarrassing moments in my life. On top of that I had some pretty crappy friends in high school. Friends who would blackmail me, a friend who punched me in the face, and friends who stole from me.

As I got older my social anxiety slowly became better and I gained my confidence. But looking back on my high school years, I use to think that i would never gain my confidence, and that high school was all there was. My world was just high school. But I made so many more friends after high school. Amazing ones, ones that loved me for me, and didn't try to take advantage of me. I also realized that having an embarrassing moment wasn't the end of the world, and everyone gets them. 

2 things I noticed that helped with my social anxiety were:

1. Embarrassing moments will pass
2. Stop comparing myself to others
3. Not being afraid of failure

There are good people in this world. You just have to find the right ones. Trust me. Theres no use in holding onto bitterness, it only hurts you.

72," I don’t really know how to start this so I guess i’m just gonna start, recently I have been struggling. i am terrible at talking about my feelings, opening up is something i can’t do especially to the people in my life. 
My mental health is slowly deteriorating and i’m just numb. November 10th is my nephews birthday, this will be the second birthday without him. 

my family life gets worse as each day goes on. i had a falling out with my mother the other night, and not to my surprise i am the “crazy one” I recently tried to open up to them about how bad my mental health is but my mom and my brother laughed in my face telling me i’m just being dramatic and to take my meds, “it’ll make you feel better”. 

My close friend and i decided it would be best if I moved out and assured me i was not the problem but i’m struggling financially, I don’t know if i could do it. 

I recently began a relationship with someone I really do care about but tonight he confronted me, asking if i still had feelings for him. after that i felt awful, my depression is starting to kick my ass to the point i can’t even fake being happy anymore. 

to distract myself i asked my friend to hangout, knowing hanging out with her would make me feel better even for a little while. after confirming plans yesterday, and looking forward to seeing her today, i get left on delivered and still haven’t gotten a text back. 

My other close friend lives an hour and a half away with her boyfriend, making us distant to the point she hardly answers either.  

i feel so alone, i use to think if i reached out to my friends i would have a support system but i’m starting to think i don’t anymore considering i am not getting the energy i give out, they call, i answer. they ask to hang out, i go. they need me, i’m there. and i can’t even get a “hey i’m busy right now i’ll get back to you when i can.

76,"So, due to my mental health issues, my memory ranges from bad to really fucking bad. Over the past couple of days, my memory has been pretty much nonexistent. Along with that, I’ve been sleeping for about 15 hours out of a 24 hour day. My brain just isn’t functioning at all right now. I’m so fucking tired - mentally AND physically.

This is probably going to sound really stupid, but the main reason I feel like a piece of shit person right now is because of my memory issues. I forgot - not only my Grandad’s birthday (he’s the only father figure in my life, and I care about him more than I do most people. He also has a brain injury, and he has really bad cognitive issues in general.) - but my little brother’s birthday, too. Nobody even messaged/called me on my Grandad’s birthday to remind me, so when I got a message from my mum telling me to at least send my brother a “happy birthday” message to make his day (he’s severely autistic and sees me as one of his idles in a way) it all hit me at once that I’d forgotten the birthdays of two of the most important people in my life. My Grandad’s birthday was 4 days prior to my brother’s, so that sucks even more. 

I called my grandparent’s Homephone and spoke to my Grandad not long after I received the message from my mum. I apologised to him and wished him a “happy belated birthday”. He laughed, but I could tell that he was kinda sad about it. Every time I’ve tried to contact my brother he’s been in his own little world, so I haven’t had the chance to talk to him yet. 

Again, I know that this sounds like a really stupid thing to beat myself up over. It’s just the icing on the cake, you know? I was talking to my Grandad a while back about how frustrated I get with myself when I can’t remember things, and he’s the one person that fully understands where I’m coming from. He’s been struggling with worse memory for the past 16 years. I’m just tired of forgetting things that are usually important to me. I live in a supported living facility and my care worker has recommend that I try speech and language therapy again to see if that will help, but I think that it’s probably a waste of time. I mean, I only had one session the last time I tried it and the therapist told me that there wasn’t anything that they could do about it because it wasn’t hugely impacting my life or whatever. I don’t know - that was years ago, and my memory has definitely gotten worse since then. 

I’m sorry for rambling on about something so small. I just want to remember things. I don’t want my family to think that I don’t care about them. I couldn’t be as pissed off at myself if they were the birthdays of people in my family that are mentally capable of understanding that I forget things without meaning to sometimes, but these are two people that don’t think that way and CAN’T think that way.",27Oct2020,1

81,"In March, I was in a very dark place.

It was right after we had been sent home from my college campus because of COVID. My once happy college life was suddenly shattered right before my eyes. A phase of my life that I had hoped would help change me was suddenly gone. As a result, I fell hard. I would spend hours in bed, with no motivation to do anything at all, I would skip my online classes to watch YouTube videos, and I just generally wasn’t in a good place mentally. All the friends I made in college were suddenly practically unreachable because I felt no motivation to even pick up the phone anymore, and my family didn’t really care what was going on, so I had no one to talk to.

That all changed when I found Gurren Lagann.

For those of you that don’t know, Gurren Lagann is a mecha anime about a boy named Simon and his brother Kamina who persevere against all odds to make the impossible possible. Through Kamina’s guidance, Simon learns to break out of his shell and take life by the horns, motivating him to fight with everything he has, no matter what challenge was thrown at him. It’s a really beautiful story about perseverance and determination against those that wish for nothing but your demise. It’s a story about how one man, no matter how insignificant at first, can eventually break through to make the impossible possible and save the world.

When I found it, I was just surfing through Netflix looking for something to distract myself from classes. At first, I just thought it was some cutesy mecha anime that never took itself seriously, but as I continued to watch, I became emotionally invested in the story and the characters, and, with the help of Gurren Lagann, I was able to break out of this cycle and emerge from my shell to fight against all odds. 

Since then, I’ve taken the message of this anime to heart, incorporating its messages into everything I do. This anime saved me from the pit of despair I put myself in, and for that I am forever grateful.

Obviously, this show is not for everyone, but if you are like me, if the quarantine and the pandemic and everything else going on in the world has caused you to go down this path, I strongly encourage to watch it for yourself. It has helped me immensely, and I hope that it’ll help you too.

I've realized that I don't like anyone knowing what's going on in my head, but I feel as though I need them to understand? Maybe it derives from growing up being singled out for being different that I seek this ""approval."" Just recently my therapist suggested I have my doctor lower my antidepressants, which I take means they're beginning to believe I have the tools to manage on my own, but I'm not so sure. Life is so weird. I know some of what makes me feel fulfilled, but doing what makes me fulfilled doesn't fulfill my NEEDS. Physically especially. I believe I'm an addict of some sort. I always have a female on standby- and I tell myself I need them, and I never ACT like I do. I want love, but I'm too scared to trust anyone after what I put myself through with my first relationship.

Sometimes, I daydream about what I'd like to talk about with my therapist, but I end up letting her drive the conversation anyways because I'd rather not get into it with her- not that I'm worried I'll burden her, but I have things I'd rather not share with a living soul...

87,"[TW]Abuse, sexual assault, and suicidal behavior/thoughts/actions 

I don't even know where the start. I'm sorry if this is the wrong flair/tag, I just need help. This will also probably be a mash of things and I'm sorry if I ramble, I just need help. I'm a 15 year old girl. I have an older sister by 4 years. My parents divorced when I was young because my father wasnt the same after being in war. My mother wasnt stable either due to her personal trauma from childhood and an abusive relationship. My sister was nice to me up until the age of 4. My memory is very foggy, my therapist says its not brain repressing the trauma. I remember how she was abusive though. I remember what she did to me slightly. She was verbally abusive for the most part (at least from what I remember) She blamed me for my parents divorce and the fighting. If she was yelled at, it was my fault, if she was hitting me, my fault. Things like that. My parents didnt believe me because my sister had mental disorders. I kept repressing certain memories. That's the only way I knew how to describe what I was doing. She use to make me kiss her with tounge when I was around 6-9. She would take baths with me and use the shower head in ""adult"" ways and use the shower curtains to separate us. I didnt tell my parents because I knew it was wrong after I was 10. Apart of me doesnt want to believe its real and it happened. So I kept telling myself ""There is no way"". But I remember every detail of the room, down to the bed sheets. My sister once caught me watching cartoon porn when I was 7. I didnt know it was porn because I was 7 and it said it was my little pony. I I didnt even know what sex was. She yelled at me and was saying she would tell my father. My father could be verbally abusive at times, but never once laid a hand on me besides spanking. I was terrified and I cried. She said since I was crying I knew what I was watching. After that she black mailed me till i was 11 with it. She once made me take off my shirt and get on all fours and would take a kitten, scare it so it sank its claws into my back, and then rip them out. My parents never believed me. When I was in 3rd grade they took me to a psychologist behind I was thought to have adhd. The psychologist saw my sister, and for some reason she said I was just trying to get attention. So they left me undiagnosed for 2 years. The abuse didnt stop. At this point my mother had left the house and they were divorced I think. I remember the nights I would just cry for my mother. My father finally took me back to a psychologist and they screened me for ADHD. They said I had it. They prescribed me pills and also a therapist as its required by law in my state to have a therapist and psychologist. Between 5th grade and 6th grade is when I talked to the therapist. That's when they discovered all the stuff that was happening to me. They first said I had mild anxiety, that diagnosis turned into depression and anxiety. And then it turned into PTSD. Even with this the abuse didnt stop. My sister would yell at me alot. I was assaulted by someone I thought was a friend at 12. I tried to tell my sister, she didnt believe me. I started to self harm at the age of 11, I tried to tell my sister. She didnt believe me. I had my first suicide attempt at the age of 12. I was taken out of the 7th grade because I had told the school therapist. I was homeschooled and then my sister moved out to my mother's house in town. My sister would still torment me. I was more developed then her, my mother did have larger breasts, but she didn't inherit that. I did, and my sister hated it. Everytime she saw me should would make comments on my body, and she would hit me hard in the breast. Breast cancer runs heavy in my family, and I mean that. My great grandma had it, my grandma had it, and my mom has it. My grandma on my father's side was the only one who helped me and would listen to me. She was my beacon. At the age of 13 I had 4 suicide attempts under me. I was on a suicide watch list for 3 years. A girl told my father I was cutting out of spite, and he never let me touch sharp objects and hid my meds. I'm again 15 now. I am much better, I have a stable relationship (1 year strong), I have good friends, and I havent attempted suicide since I was 13 about to be 14. I had attempted the night of the 27th because my 14 birthday was on the 28th. I still relapse on self harm, and I stopped taking meds. The meds never worked and it made me feel worse. The fact that if I wanted to, I could over dose scared me. I only ever tried to overdose. I have struggles swallowing pills now. Sorry this was a rant. I think it may be hard to understand. The one thing I want to ask is. Should I tell anyone about the sexual assault my sister did. I only told 2 people. And that was today. I broke down in tears and needed advice.

89,"My quarantine project was myself. After being rejected for the umpteenth time, and being described as ""not her type"", which we all know what that means, I couldn't really handle it any more. I locked myself away, and hated food, hated inactivity, hated my fat. I went from 320 to 245, with another 25 till my goal weight.

I lost weight because I wanted to be loved. To be lusted after, even, just once in all my 30 years. I wanted to stop being ghosted. I wanted to be approached first. I wanted my friends to invite me to hangouts... the ones where they got a hotel room, and every one in the room is attractive. I wanted people to take me seriously, both as a human, and a sexual being. 

Now all that does happen. Culture shock is the only way to describe it. People want me now. Not just physically, but they want to hear my words, too. They hang on every word! It feels like my IQ shot up 30 points, no one questions my decisions, or ideas like they used to. I dont have awkward interactions anymore. People are so happy to meet me half way in a conversation, when I used to have to fight just to finish a thought, or had to do all the work to keep it afloat. I used to get disgusted looks from women when I greeted them (from the south, it's what we do) but now they ask me how my day is going. And they stop to hear the answer.

So what's the problem? It was never me. It was my weight. I'm still the same person, but just because I don't jiggle going down a flight of stairs, suddenly i have worth. Now all I see around me are shallow, ugly people. Didn't I deserve the time I'm being given before? The benefit of the doubt? The simple respect of being heard?

I was heavy. Morbidly so. But why do my friends want to hang out more now? Why are women who rejected me coming back into my life like they're still worth my time? Why did my Facebook friends triple almost overnight? Why does everyone- my bosses, friends, their families, my family, treat me like I'm this awesome new being they've never met before, and the old me is dead? They all spent years telling me I wasnt ugly, and now I realize it was so much worse, I was fat and they were too embarrassed to be honest. I can tell because they no longer censor their hatred of fat people, and the things fat people do around me. They expect me to be in on the joke. (Obviously I know I was, and am still fat, but I had no way of predicting how much it mattered.)

So now, I feel like I have no one. I dont trust women who clearly wouldn't have liked me when i was big. I told people who tried to come back into my life to fuck off. I've deactivated my Facebook, and haven't returned any calls. I'm afraid I'm going to curse someone out the next time they tell me how much better I look.

I want to think how to detangle this issue and how to improve upon my problems how to be better in the relationship and also in life. And also his role in the fight, what he said that irked me, what he can do better, etc. 

But my mind is an asshole. I start by thinking about the relevant issues but then my mind takes a turn. And I think about ""what would happen"" if we broke up, or if one of us died, or if we hadn't gotten together in the first place. I mean I start making up stories in my head, movies if you will, that are just not relevant and can never be real. And these stories are usually centred around me being the victim

And this doesn't just happen after a fight with my boyfriend, it's all the time. I want to do constructive thinking to improve upon myself, my habits the way I live my life, but I always get side tracked because my mind takes a different direction. 

What is wrong with me? 

This is affecting my life a lot. I waste a ton of time day dreaming, if you will.

98,"Hey guys -

So glad I discovered this subreddit. Wanted to start a dialog about the process of finding a therapist. I've personally found that finding a therapist that's a good fit for me, to be incredibly challenging. Ultimately, did find one through a specialized catalog, but even that took multiple consultations.

Some of the websites that do questionnaires feel long and tedious, and the matching process doesn't let me feel like I have a lot of control of who I get. Browsing through catalogs, while allows me to have more control - feels time consuming and I still don't really get a good feel of the person behind the picture (am I fan of the video introductions).

Am I alone in this, or do other people feel similarly? There must be some better tool that exists that I'm not aware of?",27Oct2020,1

The religion is a traditional pagan religion, and this part of my religion only exists in my area of Europe. I have heard so much about racism but never actually experienced it in my life.

Sure, I have self doubt. But I do have issues with learning. I can be given the simplest of instructions and while I can be anxious about it, my concern is part of me doesn't ""get"" it and I feel like I'm missing something.

—————————————————————————



I am exhausted. Drained. Tired.

Every day I wake up more depressed than the last day. I am 23 years old and have accomplished nothing in life. I haven’t gone to school, and will most likely never go seeing as I don’t want to spend the next thirty years in crippling debt, plus I have no idea what I would even study. My anxiety is so bad it’s gotten to the point where I don’t leave the house anymore. I stay in bed all day every day and wait for my s/o to get home from work. My s/o’s family loves to remind me that I have no job and am a shitty person for allowing my s/o to be the “breadwinner”. I have no interests or hobbies. I don’t shower for several days. I cry a lot of the time but feel empty and numb for the time’s i’m not crying. I constantly think back to my childhood and relive trauma (bullying in school from both students and teachers, emotional abuse from both parents, one of them being a heroin/pill addict up until last year, abandonment from friends, etc.). There hasn’t been a single day in the past few months where I haven’t thought about killing myself or thinking of some form of death. I am constantly paranoid that every one hates me and will leave me. The only person who cares about me is my s/o but even then I am still deathly afraid that one day they will realize how awful of a human being i am and will leave me. No matter how many times they assure me they wont and that they want to spend the rest of their life with me, I simply can’t believe it. I ask my mom for help finding me a therapist and I get told how much of a pain in the ass I am and that I should be able to do these things myself without help. I am constantly reminded that I am a burden. I am a waste of space and should never have been born. I have no purpose in life.

Basically, I’m Muslim and gay in a country where it is illegal.
 I don’t want anyone to put down my religion since it is one of my coping mechanisms and the main reason I haven’t killed myself yet. It’s hard, BOTH islamophobia and homophobia and the fact that I don’t feel safe at all. I wish I was normal. I wish I could just give my mum the grandchildren she wants. I know my problems are nothing compared to a lot of people and that’s what makes me feel worse. I feel like I shouldn’t be sad but I’m so scared. I feel watched everywhere and on the internet- I’m even scared of thinking as I feel that someone might see my thoughts (it’s stupid I know). I’m still a minor so marriage is still not an issue but the time is nearing and everyone in my family loves to remind me and it means at some point I’ll have a choice: be disowned, taken to conversion therapy, ruin my family’s life or to get into a marriage I don’t want but at least my family will be happy

But recently my girlfriend and I have started to think it could be something else. She’s mentioned asd, I’ve thought of Tourette’s.

I’m still gonna get checked but I’d like your input.

I cannot control myself, nearly whatsoever. I will sing stupid jingles on and on out loud but make the jingles up. I’ll say stupid things, only sometimes are they ever the same or repeat except for the N-word. That is a constant.

I don’t think I’m ticking out though, like I have nearly no muscle spasms at all ever. It seems fully verbal.

Say my girlfriend asks me to do something she’s asked me too several times today already. I’ll respond in a joking haste. With something that makes no sense. Earlier today I said “I’ll give you the lighter (in a weird accent) if you stop being a doonging danger” 
It can get way weirder than that however.

I also constantly repeat “you hate me” or “I’m gonna kill myself” or dumb things like that. Without having any self control about it.

I’ll just spit out these words or sentences without being able not too. I don’t ever notice it’s happening till half the word or sentence is out of my mouth and by then I have to finish.

So I work alone, which is fine, supplying a pub with beer from the brewery next door. Both owned by the same company, I work in the pub too occasionally mostly handling admin and social networking.

Recently our kitchen staff (mostly lads) were made redundant and our bar manager passed away. The long and short of it is I'm left with a manager who doesn't really talk, and something of a cult of young girls whom I share very little in common with. The other day I joked that I need some male company, but now I realise I wasn't really joking. Since we lost our bar manager the place is devoid of humour in place of pretty feminine conversations, not meaning to come across in the wrong way here, but you know the sort of thing. I always feel like I'm intruding, but when we had chefs and male bar staff I never felt that way and used to hang out after work for a drink when we could.

Home life mostly consists of child rearing, and we do get out and about at most opportunities together, but the lazy days are nice too. I'm pretty happy there and the whole thing fills me with joy.

118,"So i (17f) have an okay relationship with my mom(50F), i help around the house and she supports me financially and we get along well sometimes. Other times i feel like she is the reason that i have many mental health issues and struggle to view myself in an okay way. lately it seems as if she just wants to control my life and monitor whatever goes in and out of it.
for example: i’m 17 and lately i’ve been posting pictures of myself on social media. mind you these photos are not provocative, sexual, or anything like that. they are literally selfies with me and my friends of just selfies of myself. my mother hates when i post pictures and i feel that if im 17 and they are literally just pictures of myself that i should be able to post selfies, i don’t even have followers or anything and i post these pictures on vsco where i honestly have like 20 followers. she has told me that my smile in these photos is weird and that i smile like a mouse and how the other people in the photos smile nicely. she tells me to take them down and tells me that if i don’t she will take away my social media and even take away my phone(that i fully paid for with my money). she is really controlling but whenever i tell her she needs to let me live my life and nobody will see the pictures. she brings up the fact that she’s raised me and provided me with a nice life. i just feel like she needs to stop being such a prison guard and start acting like my mom. 

she also uses internet as a sort of currency in the house. these days a new internet is available where u can control it from your phone and turn off certain devices internet off at the click of a button. me and my sister both are teenagers and i am almost an adult and she is already an adult. we tell our mom that it’s weird to control our internet because we are both grown up and this is more for younger kids who spend waaay too much time on their phone. but all she says is that we need to help out around the house more and we spend too much time on our phones (according to my phone it’s about an average of 5 hours and considering that school and my life is online i’d say that’s actually pretty good). she will then turn off our internet if we didn’t do chores or sleep in too late as “the internet is to blame”.  and we aren’t even people who just spend time on the internet my sister goes to a nice university and gets really good grades and i’m in grade 12 and get all A’s, so it’s not related to grades or school or anything.

another instance is that my mother doesn’t like that i talk like a baby. you see i don’t exactly talk like a baby i just sort of change my voice around my parents. i don’t know why exactly but it’s kind of like my parents treat me like a kid so i just NEED to act like one?? i don’t know how to explain it. it just feels weird to talk in a regular voice with my mom and dad. so lately my mother and father have been mocking me and saying that i talk like a child and how i won’t get anywhere in life. it really hurts my feelings and along with the mocking of my smile i just sort of hate it when my parents talk about me now.

another really big thing i just need to get advice on is my mother checking my phone. so i have only had instagram which was my first social media since i was around 14 and about a year ago when covid was first happening i had 500 followers which isn’t that many but my mother thinks it’s too much so i removed them until i had about 200. in this social media instance my sister is also against me and she regularly reports my online presence and anything that sticks out to my moms “rules” which is why my mother knows about what i post online.  so basically i have 500 followers and i talk to my friends online and we have conversations where yes i swear and yes i talk about things that i like. so this time that my mom checks my phone she sees a chat where i am swearing and talking about a character in a movie that i considered ‘sexy’. she blew it she went psycho and made me leave every single group chat and stop talking to boys because according to her all boys are evil. so i always end up deleting chats after i send them and i don’t join any group chats and it’s not even that they’re bad i am just so fucking done with feeling like my mom will find anything. so now i feel like i have social anxiety and i barely do anything online like i don’t like posts, don’t follow certain people, and don’t post online because i always feel like people are watching and judging me. i even recently deleted my old account and made a new one so i could have everything fresh and nothing from the past 2-3 years would be visible to anyone.

i literally hate myself and i cant seem to fix it and i REALLY need therapy. all this stuff is just scratching the surface on how my moms parenting (she doesn’t want me to be friends with boys, checks everything of mine, mocks anything she feels i should change about myself) has affected me mentally and if you guys could just read the stuff i said and tell me if i’m in the wrong and what she’s doing is right?? i to don’t think it is but my mother tends to gaslight a lot and emotionally manipulate us into thinking that what she’s doing is okay. please feel free to ask questions or clarification about anything and i am writing this while crying so if i don’t make sense i’m sorry. i’ve been thinking about posting something here for a while but i just decided to do it before my mental health falls even more. i’ve also had suicidal thoughts where i feel like if i just ended my life it would help my mom a lot instead of her just criticizing every little thing about me and what i do, and get random pockets of depression where instead of helping me my mother just gets mad at me and doesn’t speak to me until i apologize to her for being rude and not speaking to her. please tell me and give me advice on what to do, i’ve asked my mom to take me to therapy but she always asks why and tells me i can talk to her when i obviously cannot.",27Oct2020,1

**Tangerine** 

The somber gaze of the lackadaisical tree covered in her apricot leaves. 

Swaying patiently, perfectly, through the cold, crisp air, delicate to the slightest of touches, her tangerine leaves.

A slight wilt of the soft arm reaching out. Extending into the last of the life force for her butterscotch leaves.

Trembles of the bittersweet air flow through the last of her papaya leaves, left as the beautiful oak tree beneath.

I tried Bupropion for 1 year, it had literally no effect. So now I’m wondering if maybe I may have bipolar disorder? I’ve noticed I tend to go through “phases” or “waves” of depression and phases of (for lack of a better word) mania where I will try new hobbies and fizzle out. (I am now currently the proud owner of a recurve bow and an easel, neither of which I have touched more than once since I bought them in September) I spend money, feel great or at least decent (depression=cured!) and then come crashing back down again. And the lows are often far lower than the highs are high.

124,"Male, 41, history of anxiety and major depressive disorder. I have been doing a lot of reading lately about some things that I've been experiencing over the last few years. Without going into all the specifics, while I haven't been diagnosed with ADHD, I have found that I do meet a lot of the criteria for ADHD. 

I do know that some symptoms need to be present before the age of 12. I honestly don't remember a lot of my childhood for some reason, just bits and pieces. However, not long ago I was going through a box of things my mom kept from when I was a kid. One report card from first or second grade had a note on it that said I had a hard time focusing and was often found staring out the window during class. 

My question is, can symptoms show up really strong later in life?

125,"Hello. I'm a male, 21year old. I wanted to let you know, how internet made me look at human beings in a new way;  men and evil. This is my transformation.

I was a regular teenager, joined college, talks to everyone, flirts with my crush and, the defenition of a ""nice guy"", who's ready to give up an argument when I realise I'm wrong. About my crush, she's just amazing. Everyone knows I'm in deep with this girl. Everytime I talk to her, she embarrass me infront of her friends and I'd act like a baby infront of her. 

Then ""YouTube recommendations"" happened. 

I saw a recommendation in YouTube one day, ""BuzzFeed: 100 questions women have for men"". After watching the video, YouTube recommended me, ""100 answers for women from men"", a real funny roast video. It kept going like that.

Time passed.

It was just a normal day, in my class, the teacher walked in and I did something funny, everyone laughed. My crush, made a joke about me at the exact same moment. I walked upto her, slapped her face real hard and she burst into tears. I walked out of the class.

""The realisation""

I got suspended. I instantly became hated by everyone. My friends were still with me, telling me that what I did was nothing wrong, and she took it ""way too far"".

But I couldn't stop thinking about YouTube. Maybe it's coz ot the tons of machine learning stuff I did in social engineering or because I'm a computer science student, I knew it right away, Internet made me toxic and internet lies are affecting my real life.
Everything I saw in my YouTube recommendations those days were about, ""feminist roasts"", ""man hating feminists"", ""SJWs"", ""owning the activist"" videos. 

I looked back at the days when I talked alone, defending my imaginary self sayin ""men aren't rapists"", ""men have rights too"", ""women aren't oppressed"", ""work more to earn more"" in my head for hours everyday. YouTube changed the way I look at others. Everytime I see a girl, I make up arguments for putting her down if she comes up with any feminist ideas, which btw has never happened to me. Everytime a girl comes talking to me, I try to make her know that I don't give a shit about her, ignoring her, making her feel like ""women aren't that valuable afterall"". When a girl talks to me, it feels like they're putting a test on me to check if I'm desperate for a women to talk to me. I started refusing to help any woman in any way, with the fear of ""getting used by a girl"". Started calling my friends ""simp"" for helping a girl with literally anything and everything.

My present.

All of this was a year ago. I told my crush that I'm sorry and now we don't talk. She wasn't just a crush for me, she meant something to me and now I've lost her completely. Her friends hate me bigtime. I started to smile at women again. I still can't talk to women like I used to, coz I keep saying to myself that I might be attacking thier privacy. I'm disturbed by the fact that I see women as some alien species. I deleted my YouTube data. I check on my friends to see if they're falling into this rabbit hole. 

Will I ever be normal again? I don't know. I still say sexist stuff in my brain constantly. My mind is irreversibly altered. I talk alone. Everytime I watch a movie, I think about sexism. Everytime I talk to a girl, I keep a distance. My capability of bonding with the opposite gender got degraded completely. I doubt if I'll ever be able to get married and live without fear of getting cheated. 

Right now, I'm trying to get out of this and start fresh. I rarely opens youtube, started learning music, learning new languages and sleeping, a lot of sleeping, off of the line from the internet. 

I'm worried about all the men who fell into this and turned out toxic and women-hating for the rest of his life, without knowing that he has gotten highly biased ideas into his brain. This gives me a feeling that the numbers of rape, abuse, assult is only going to rise as these kids grows up with toxicity build into them. I'm pretty sure that, the next generation boys are going to be the most toxic, instantly triggering, most violent, relentless human beings ever existed.",27Oct2020,1
126,"TL;DR this whole things turns into an emotional disaster at the end of me venting, warning, my paragraphs aren’t that well structured

My relationship is over, I have no home to go back to, and I feel isolated from all my friends and family who just had to see me go through a near death experience (I overdosed on benzos, became unresponsive etc) that I just don’t know who to reach out to

My whole support system was ripped right out of the ground. They weren’t helping me or giving me therapy during the hold either, they just made sure I didn’t die or stopped eating. I just want everything to be the way it was 2 weeks ago. I was happy, stable. In a relationship I thought was finally going smooth sailing sense we had plans to move out together in December. But nope life just doesn’t want to hand me one nice thing. Just one. I had abusive parents, mentally disabled siblings, I had the bullying and the break ups and the ADHD, PTSD, major anxiety depression with a freaking main character complex but also thinks of myself as the worst people alive. Fuck 2020, I don’t know why I did anything this year. I should have played it safe, I wouldn’t have cared so much. I wouldn’t have my heart shattered by the words “I love you and I want to be with you... but not right now” 

As if postponing it will hurt less or you can soften the blow. I just want a hug and a kiss hello and to send you memes all day while we lounged around and did hw. Why didn’t you tell me you where unhappy, you said you hid it from me, if I would have known I would have done anything to fix it. And I know that’s not healthy and I know that these thoughts aren’t healthy. I’m trying to get them out of my heart and my head so I can sleep",27Oct2020,1

130,"Hi
2 years ago my parents finally split up after my mum ended up in hospital with an almost broken cheekbone from my father, I was there the whole time and was stuck there helpless as I was 12 at the time all I could do was clean up the broken glass and blood off the floor. As you can imagine the messed me up a bit and I’ve never managed to let go of the feelings of that maybe my mum wouldn’t of gotten hurt as bad if I tried harder, after this I’ve had a hard time dealt with depression and bad anxiety. Concentrating at school is near impossible Evan after all this time, I sometimes just breakdown for no apparent reason and most of the time I put of a happy face and laugh with others but I’m not always feeling that way. I guess I don’t really want to tell them about it because I don’t want to become a burden. I’ve been to therapy for a year but it didn’t help much, I’ve lost most of my social capabilities and have trouble talking to new people or even just keeping a conversation going. I still can do well in a lot of my classes but I feel underserving or I’m never good enough. I have a hard time trusting people and believe that my friends don’t truly care about me to begin with, I’ve never been the best with self confidence (doesn’t help I’m a bit overweight) and feel like no one truly like me. Ever since that night I’ve had nightmares where it just plays on repeat or I’ll be laying in bed just to see a showdown type figure looming over me and all I can do about is listen to music and cry until my feelings pass. I sometime see the shadow during the day watching just around corners not alway in the corner of my eyes either. I’ve heard voices before and sometimes still do and it all makes me feel like I’m going insane. Is there anything I can do about all this? Sorry for this being a very long post.",27Oct2020,1
131,I recently have been on and of Zoloft 50 mg to be specific and it started to make me have an unusual amount of energy. I was already smoking marijuana at the time but not in great quantities. This energy has let me be able to push through and do things I wouldn’t do before I started smoking in the morning then three times a day then all day. To put in perspective on how much I did I weigh 100 lbs and smoked 4.5 gs of carts in the last two weeks because I started scamming people in my family. This weekend I was forced to go on a fishing trip and I could not smoke near as much on because I was sharing a bedroom ect my mom caught me in 16 btw and I was left with little to no weed and I was having the worse panic attack I’ve ever had. After my medication kicked in I felt euphoric and great I didn’t think about weed all day and nothing seemed wrong until I only got 2 hours of sleep then 4 the next night then the next night and every day I lose sleep I start dissociating more and I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and he is a very straight forward and sometimes overwhelming so can anyone please give me advice on what to tell him.

140,"Ok so I'm a 16F and have been struggling with school and people in general. I have never been the most social person but I've always had good friends around. Lately school has just gotten harder. 

I don't like being crowded and surrounded by people and loud noises. My school doesn't help because I constantly feel like I'm going to be crushed by all of the people in the hallways and my friend group happens to have some very noisy people in it. I've gotten into the habit of just zoning out and waiting for the relief of being able to go home and be alone in silence. Music is my main way of trying to filter out everything and it helps a lot but when I do that Im not interacting with my friends. This has lead to some getting annoyed that Im on my phone listening to music or doing other stuff instead of talking to the group. I care about my friends and I enjoy hanging out with them but sometimes its just to much.

I've also always sort of dissociated myself from people and I struggle with have emotions and portraying them to the people around me. I feel like I fall on a base line of nothing when it comes to my emotion. I'll still be able to laugh and have fun but the second thats over I'm back on the feeling of nothing.

I broke up with my bf a few months back because of the fact that I couldn't show my emotions in the way he needed and also cause I never really cared to be in a romantic relationship with him. He texted me every second of the day and constantly said how much he loved me and I couldn't take it. I felt dread every time I got a text from him at home cause it was meant to be my space. I had to deal with people all day and when I'm at home I view that as my time to relax. He was also very physical when it came to pda and I hated it. I was never the one to initiate anything cause I didn't feel the need to and I realise this might make me sound like an asshole but when I finally broke up with him all I did was go home and forget about it. I didn't care that I ended the relationship and felt as though nothing changed in my personal life.

146,"Ok, so this is the first time I'm even talking about this on here, so please bear with me. Thid may be long, but this is something I've held deep down. My REAL problems and my life experiences. 
(If you want to skip the life story which I get, just skip to the last paragraph)


I grew up with really just my mother. When I was three my dad went to prison and I grew up without him. Tbh I've never had a normal family life or even a childhood for that matter. Up until I was 9 I spent my life mainly with my mother. I was an annoying, happy ,oblivious kid. School was hard for me during that time. We didn't have a home to live in, so my mother and I moved constantly and in the main school that I'm about to graduate from in about 8 months. Let's just say I didn't have many friends and most were put off by my adhd and how I was so energetic. Most of the people in the school bullied me to where I didn't really wanna make friends. Sure I didn't have my still bsf who I've known since preschool, but we really weren't that close in elementary. I was a lonely child back then. I remember moving into my uncle's house with his wife and her four kids I call my real first cousins. Well during those two years was pure hell and that's not an exaggeration. My cousins constantly bullied and punked me. My aunt was worse. Behind my mother's back she abused me and traumatized me. She locked me in a dark room by myself. She constantly yelled and put me down. She wiped me for no reason. Another thing is I had to go to one of the most ghetto schools I've ever seen. Only in first grade and I was bullied, beaten, and no help was given to me, but the one thing I looked forward to, was coming home to my mother. Just being around her made me feel safe and made my problems fizzle away. She was the only thing in my life at the time that I honestly cared about. The only reason why we left was because my aunt basically made the scar that I have on my head after making me fall over and busting my head. The worst part is that she glowed it, instead of taking me to a hospital, so I have hook shaped, hairline looking scar on my head. This is finally when my mother found out what these people. These people I know as family did to me for the past two years, my mother got into physical fights and broke a lot of stuff. It's easy to say we had to move. (Now, I know deep down I'm a nice guy, but my life experiences made me kinda fucked in the head a little bit, but I'll dive into that in a minute.) So we moved into my grandma's house. She was the most wise, hard working, and nicest old lady I've ever had the privilege of knowing. She gave us a home. I went back to the school I was in before moving into my uncle's house. Truth is that the people were the same, but I felt even more safe being away from my aunt and cousins. I met neighbors my age and made some friends. In school I started talking to people and made some really good friends. Everyday was great to me and being with just Me, my mother and grandmother was one of the greatest times in my childhood. My mother took me over to hang with the family members she grew up with, like my first cousins who are like aunts and uncles to me. My cousins who were my age. I spent so much time with them and got to know and have fun with my family members. I honestly felt happy and like the world wasn't gonna hurt me.

But happiness doesn't last. Two years after moving in with my grandma my mother had another child. This one who is my little sister had a different dad. I really despise the guy but that's only because my grandma told me has took advantage of my mother being drunk, but that's not something I can confirm I just didn't like him. So after having another child, my mother changed. While raising me she was more of a tomboy. She listened to Marilyn Mansion and wore leather and black. Had facial piercings and all that, but when she had my sister she turned more girly and quite cursing so much and acted more like female. It never bothered me, but my mother's attention was on my sister and truth be told I was jealous. I didn't really like my sister.

Now my mother had been to the hospital a lot in her life. I watched her get surgery and become sick and come back better than ever, but 8 months after my sister was born my mother got sick. She was in the hospital for weeks. For some reason I wasn't worried because to me she was invincible, but nobody can win against terminal brain cancer. I had no idea at the time. I was busy spending time with my grandma. Looking at it now, she was trying to distract me from what was going on. I remember one of the last things my mother ever said to me was ""You don't love me. You'd rather be with your dad."" I know she was on drugs at the time, but it hit me hard. After four weeks she came home, but she was hooked up to a oxygen tank. Still being oblivious I still thought she was gonna be fine, so I spent the that time fucking around.... and after 5 days of being home one morning me and my grandma had a race to see who could get to mother's room first and when I entered that room, it literally destroyed me. As I looked at my mother's cold dead body I could only stay silent and star at her. She laid half off the bed like she was trying to sit up and died afterward. Let's just say I shut down for months. I barely ate, talked, and slept. One of the most saddest things is that right after her funeral my sister said her first words, which were ""momma"". For years I shut out the world. God, people said that they cared about her, but then proceed to start drama and split the family apart. It took one person to bring out my real self and that I opened up to. He was my grandma's ex bf. They honestly cared about eachother and he was the greatest man I've ever gotten to know. He was a gambling, lucky, and street smart kinda guy. He taught me a lot and he made me have fun for once after my mother passed. He was the father I never had. 

After a year passed I was still severely detached from reality, my grandpa moved in with us after he got released from prison. Let's just say he was a dick. He took over the house and emotionally abused  me all the time. Telling me how worthless I am and how I'm a cocksucker. I cried a lot with him around. He drank and he was a crack addict. He wasn't plesent to be around. Time flew by quickly and it was the same everyday, until 7th grade. Middle school is where I became the hugest narcissist. I had some friends including my bsf. I bullied my friends and constantly had to prove that I was better and that I had such a great life, when I reality I was broken and sad. I just wanted to take what others had or I wanted others to be like me. It's something I hated about my thinking back then. I have extreme anger deep down and that's not some edgy remark like ""I'm a monster and a psychopath"", but deep down I was tired of constantly being brought down and not having control over my life. I only let it all out once and after that I've never let it out again. Freshman year came and my friends had a lot of fun, but drama struck every other week. I care about my friends, but back then I needed a good either kick in the ass or a reminder of what I have and to stop taking it for granted, because all I did was punk on people I thought were weaker and started drama with a lot of people. A lot was with my friends. I mean it was really petty, but I was very petty and full of myself. Until I got what I really needed. A kick in the ass and a reminder that if I didn't change my attitude towards people then I'll never be happy or have friends that I can count on. It really happened when I split up my friends and lost a major friend. I started drama and he was fed up with my shit. I even lied about him and after talking so much shit he kicked my ass. Over the course of half a year I changed. I was no longer a narcissist and a fucking bully. I was nice and treated most people with respect or I just kept to myself. Shit I even let my friends talk all the shit they want and I took a lot of those Insults and stuff from everyone around me, but it made me even worse inside. At home it was bad. I stayed in my room and my sister ""who I helped raise"" adored me and always bothered me. I yelled at her a lot to leave me alone and I wasn't there for her most of her life and I feel horrible for it, because I love her like a daughter and a sister. I made sure my grandpa never messed with her ever, but I wasn't there for her. I closed my real self off from everyone. I even lied about myself to people to either earn sympathy and so nobody knew who I was deep down. Now after freshman year I stopped starting arguments and I avoided controversy. For two reasons. 1. I didn't want to start drama and lose a friend or make people mad. 2. I didn't want to initiate a fight because I hate fighting. 
I'm not a fighter or a badass. I did dress edgy and stuff it was only balck clothes and long hair. I hate fighting because if I fight someone and they actually try to hurt me or do something that'll set me off. If I don't see you as someone I care for I will try to actually hurt you. Like brutally. If you were bigger and stronger I would use a weapon and do my absolute best to hurt you. It really scares me because my anger is so bad that I've almost tried to kill someone. Thank god I was stopped. Because.bavk in first grade when I was constantly beaten by two of the same bigger older guys in my class, I slowly gave into anger. These kids didn't just punch and kick they took chains of the broken swing and beat me with it. They stomped on me and kicked in the crotch and my face. They did that for three days during recess and after every recess I limbed to the teacher and told her about what happened and each time they would look at me and say ""Stop snitching"", so I felt like nobody was gonna help me and if I didn't do something I was gonna end up in the hospital. I remember I brought a small pocket knife to school and I was ready to actually stab them both. I wasn't thinking clearly during the time and I'm glad people told on me cause if they didn't I would have either killed someone or would have ended up in the hospital, so yeah I have a cold psychopath side of me, but it never comes out unless I get hurt really bad by someone or you piss me off enough. That's why I stay away from controversy. Now during freshman, sophomore, and junior year I had major relationships. Three to be exact. Each one of them cheated and fucked me over. I know I my seems I like obsessed, but I show respect and I never get angry with someone I'm dating, but I guess I'm unlucky. My most recent made me change honestly for the better. It happened in July. We broke up and yeah it did hurt and yeah I cried, but after she blamed me for the relationship failing after I had proof that she lied and went to her ex/bsf's house when she said she was with her family and having her bsf confirm that she stole her from me, but after that I finally had enough. I went to my cousins house and asked to work with in renovations. I did that for about three weeks and over that time I had time to think. I even quit smoking cigarettes. That was the first step to becoming me again. From then on I had several mindsets change until a month ago I finally stopped caring about pleasing others. I'm gonna really be myself and take pride in my interests. I even opened up to a couple people. 

(Now if you made it this far, I'm sorry for a long post. I just needed to get it off my chest. Now here's where the title comes into play.)

Nowadays I've been feeling really empty. I feel like I'm even more sad and lonely. It's confusing because I don't know how I really feel and what I'm feeling. What I want and why I'm doing things. I had a really bad mental and emotional break down today while I was at home alone. At first I smashed things and broke stuff and then cried so badly. After I cried I sat in my living room and thought about everything. I thought about how disappointed my mother would be with me. God I miss her so much. I even got a tattoo of her two favorite things that I thought of when I think of her. A skull and black rose. I also got her ashes mixed with the ink. I'm just so confused about why I feel so empty and depressed even when I have my little sister, my grandma, my bsf, and I'm able to do what ever I really want. God it's so bad that everyday I wake up and I just feel like the day will be just like everyday... horrible. I constantly think to myself that maybe stopping the pain and burden on others is the best option for me. I wouldn't do it, cause I can't hurt my little sister like that, but I still think about it. All I want is to be at peace with myself, but how can I when I'm just a boy in the middle of a mental warzone. I'm doing my best to keep it together, but lately I'm unraveling and I'm exposing my true colors, thoughts, and feelings. It's even more confusing when people especially my therapist say that it's a long process and it's gonna be hard to except your trauma and be happy, but like how am I supposed to. I don't know how to do it. I've honestly opened up to the people I trust which is like five people and I'm slowly being more and more vulnerable little by little, but even when I do that I just feel worse and more confused.",27Oct2020,1

149,"Hi! I am needing to hear some like experiences, because I feel a little isolated right now. 

I am having trouble remembering things. Like when the kids told me their school schedule yesterday. Or that my husband and I had a specific conversation last week. I can’t remember specifics of things anymore. I lose my train of thought. It’s almost like a can’t comprehend sometimes even. Things that before, if I didn’t understand at first, it wouldn’t take long to catch up. *ALSO, my speech. I trip up on my words. I forget common words. This is SO embarrassing! My family notices the difference. I speak to people for a living. It has crushed my self confidence.*

I have NEVER had these issues. I could think quickly. I remembered EVERYTHING. I have started making lists everywhere just so I can keep up. But this is legitimately making me feel like I’m losing it. I talked to my doc about these symptoms, but he brushed it off as being the Xanax.

I feel at a loss at present. I’m afraid that he’ll take medicine away, which is fine in and of itself. It’s the possibility of an episode which I cannot afford. 

Has any one else experienced these symptoms on these meds? If not these, then any? How did you cope with that if you felt you had to have the medication? Any resources on how to help strengthen my memory or cognitive ability?

My list of meds:
Lithium
Lamictal (lamotrigine)
Wellbutrin (bupropion)

Meds I don’t take every day:
Xanax (alprazolam)
Provigil (modafinil)

Thanks in advance.",27Oct2020,1

She’ll often sleep through a lot of the day, not putting in a lot of effort into anything. This can apply with her exercise, grades, and just other normal things. At a lot of points, it’s put stress on my relationship with her. She keeps seeing the results of what’s been going on, and won’t try anything to fix it. It’s not that she doesn’t care, either. She’ll often get upset and in a depressive mindset. Instead of focusing on fixing the issue, she’ll get upset over it until she forgets about it. It’s been a cycle at play for many months. Up until now, I usually try to comfort her and help her out of the sad mindset that she’s in, but I’ve realized it’s not helping her at all. So what do I do? It almost feels like she knows what’s going on is bad, but chooses to ignore it until she forgets.

I thought I really did manage to calm myself down because my inner thoughts are like “ok, you can do this. Trust yourself. Go for it. Stop thinking about anything negative”, and other than that my mind is blank because I chucked away all the worst case scenarios in my mind. But ?? I’m always so dumbfounded when i screw things up like omg what did I do wrong?! For example, i was in a school volleyball team and was always quite on-form. But during the critical match with another team, my spikes suddenly went haywire (it was really bad) and as a result my team lost... In my mind I was like WHAT???? WHY???? And I’m super confused at my body because my mind didn’t sense any anxiety (???). It’s like, I thought that my thoughts and inner-talks calmed my emotions, but my body and actions show otherwise.....

I haven’t done any of that in about a year, but it’s tricky as the feeling of needing to fill that void hasn’t gone anywhere. I’m working on myself in order to fill it, but speaking practically I’m not sure what to do. 

I like to write and meditate and occasionally make art, but the feeling I get that makes me want to fall back into old patterns is more of an aggressive one that makes me want to scream and escape. A lot of people exercise to get rid of this feeling, but I absolutely hate all forms of exercise. I have a co ordination disorder and whenever I try yoga, or running etc it just worsens this feeling.

160,"Hello!

At the very beggining of my post I would like to introduce myself a bit:
I am student, I am 20 years old. I am in relationship of over 2.5 year. For 2 years of my relationship - everything was good, there were some misunderstandings and issues, but there were much more good times. We shared a happy life.
About march everything started. My girlfriend announced that she is going to study away from my city and wanted to be in an open relationship. I was pessimistic about it and in my head I assumed that it is going to fail 100% and I am losing her soon. I was very sad and overwhelmed by this information. I cried through the whole week.
But there was a hope. She told me that she is considering going to my city (I didn't insist on it, and even didn't try to make her do it) to study, which pleased me at first, but then my kind of disorder/unusual behavior begins:

I wanted to make sure I love her, and I won't leave her for certain. I kept doing quizzes on online pages checking if I love her, when something in my relationship did not respond with things on the pages or quizzes - I got anxious.
And that went for about 2 months, a lot of anxiety. Then numbness, then again anxiety, then numbness etc.
Now I am here - I feel like I don't love my girlfriend, I dont miss her, I dont want to have sex, I am just indifferent towards her. Future together makes me anxious, although 0.5 year before it made me happy. 
My ""thing"" also ruined my relationship. I exaggerated every argument, overanalysed it assuming my future would be like this. 

I don't know how to describe it better, I am just looking for specific answer - is it something of mental issue or rather relationship burnout? 

Thank you very much for all answers in advance. Hope someone will notice it.",27Oct2020,1
161,"Does She Have DID?

I know we can’t really diagnose her but please listen. For as long as I could remember my mother had these constant mood swings and was abusive. Especially after she got divorced from my step dad. She was never diagnosed. I always thought she was bipolar and narcissistic. After my parents got divorced my father’s lawyer’s figured out she had all the signs of MPD/DID. I’ve read on Quora, Reddit and some other sites on children growing up with a parent who has MPD/DID and they all seemed positive. Not once did they bring up being kicked, screamed at, belittled or accused. I’ve tried to put her moods into 4 broad categories and examples.

1) Extremely Abusive
Yells, screams, was extremely strict, if I decided to not listen I’d get kicked or have my hair pulled. Tells her children they are the reason for her problems in life. 

2) Sweet and Kind
Loving, wants to hug and cuddle, offers to buy me things, showers me with love, talks about how much she loves and cares.

3) Poor
Talks about how hard life is, complains about how poor she is. Gets people to donate, give her money or help her with free services. Acts like a poor, single mother. 

4) Rich
Brags about her 2020 car, her horses, nice house, her fancy purse and wonderful, smart children. Buys herself new electronics, goes on trips. Refuses to think she could do anything wrong.

Are these personalities she has? I always thought it was her mood swings from being bipolar or narcissistic. She can switch from all of those within a day. I don’t understand how everyone who has parents with DID/MPD have had positive experiences. 75% of my childhood she was in her abusive personality.",27Oct2020,1

I've been in and out of a battle with both depression (usually relatively mild) and anxiety for a number of years now. Recently I graduated from university with a Computer Science degree. This successful period of my life felt great and I was excited for what the future holds but since then I've noticed that the rise in stress related to the job search is diminishing my mental health again. I tend to get severely anxious prior to interviews, sometimes even up to a week before, handle rejection very badly and battle with low self esteem.

I guess what I'm looking for is people who've been through similar experiences to talk about how they managed the onslaught of a rise in mental health issues related to the job search stress and any tips and tricks you may have. Success stories are also great!

167," **Could I run an idea by all of you which ties in with mental health and mindset?**

I have an idea which I'm tentatively calling ""Not Taught In School"" at the moment.

It was born from the idea that as you get older you realise there are so many skills you need in life that you just aren't taught in school (or by family or society in general).

Such as...

**Mindset and mental health**, money and finance skills, self learning and self improvement, preparedness and survival, relationship and social skills, entrepreneurship and creating wealth and so on (basically anything that constitutes a useful ""life skill"").

So my idea is simple...

To create a free weekly email newsletter that curates the best content on the web that is teaching valuable life skills and lessons that most people wouldn't learn about elsewhere.

I'm already reading lots of websites around these topics for years now and know who a lot of the top authors, bloggers and influencers are where as newcomers don't so I feel like I could curate a lot of useful content for them and save them a lot of time.

It would be a simple email round up highlighting the content and linking to it, sharing the general idea behind each piece of content, and with some additional commentary by myself sharing my thoughts and insights into the content and why it's worth reading / learning.

I know from my own experience it's too time consuming and overwhelming to keep up with all the different websites, blogs, YT channels and social influencers in one ""niche"" let alone several, so...

...the newsletter would aim to save you time and highlight only the most valuable and useful content that's actually worth reading in an internet filled with junk and spam.

Like I said above; it would be absolutely free to join and wouldn't be monetized initially but if it gained some traction then I may bring on sponsors / advertisers in future or scale it up into a full website.

However...

Before I spend too much time on this only to find there's not a great deal of interest then I'm looking to validate the idea.

Which is where you come in hopefully.

Based on what I've summarised above (and I know it's brief but all the details are not fleshed out yet and it'll be built on feedback from readers / interested readers) would you subscribe to the ""Not Taught In School"" newsletter?

Even if you wouldn't personally subscribe do you think it would be a useful service for someone who's new to self improvement and just starting on their journey?

Let me know what you think good or bad please. :)",27Oct2020,1

Fairly heavy drinker since 18.

Also big coffee drinker.

Diet isn't great either.

Not overweight though 😃

Night sweats and low grade fever started a year ago but were brushed off my my GP, bloods all normal, no raised glands etc.

Sat down a few weeks ago, long time after eating and had massive aching discomfort just below my sternum, this did not get better after downing milk which has been my go-to for years.

Looking back over the last 6 months, beer in particular has been hard for me to drink in any quantity without feeling nauseous.

Current symptoms:

Sore throat.
Pain swallowing deep down.
Hacking cough originating from deep in chest when I eat or drink.
Difficulty swallowing due to discomfort deep down
Hot flushes.
Persistent pain under my breast bone, not associated with eating.

Haven't eaten for a few days now, symptoms are just the same. Losing weight fast.

The cough and persistent pain worry me the most, and the fact that I've had this all my life but never this.

188,"so i got diagnosed with bipolar disorder my junior year but before that i just learned that mental illness was a thing and then it took a bit for me to realize i was suffering from it. but once i figured i was i was like well what am i suffering from. at the time i was experiencing a lot of chronic emptiness so i just searched it up like why do i feel empty all the time. and once i got past the stuff where it was about me missing something in my life and i found borderline personality disorder. i know self diagnosing is bad but my family doesn’t really believe in mental illness and let’s be honest mental health services can make it difficult to get properly diagnosed. at the time i felt like okay i’m not gonna say i have bpd but doing the research wouldn’t hurt it could be the start of getting a diagnosis. 

so reading that chronic emptiness is one of the symptoms of bpd and also learned i need to meet five of the requirements(is that the right word) in order to get diagnosed. i didn’t quite understand the other symptoms until my junior year when i got diagnosed. my rapid mood swings fit bipolar disorder but it didn’t explain anything else i was suffering from. like it took me a while to be honest with her because i worried anything i said would get me in trouble. when i started to come around to it i would talk about my fear of abandonment causing me to ruin relationships or how i see people as only good and bad. and just other things that were more so fitting the line of bpd. and it would go over her head like she’s scared to diagnose it. i can’t even get started on the psychiatrist i had so i was depending a lot on her word. 

i stopped working with her a year ago. and i don’t feel any more confident in the diagnosis. like when i realized i have anxiety it felt like i was more anxious but really it was me becoming more aware of the symptoms. i don’t know if that’s something you guys experience. but i never felt like that with bipolar disorder. i never noticed or was being told that i was displaying more symptoms of bipolar disorder. i feel bad for even questioning it. i’m not sure what i should do. ever since i learned personality disorders exist i’ve been wondering if the issue isn’t my mood but more my personality. should i be getting tested for personality disorders? what am i supposed to do with this feeling?",27Oct2020,1

200,"I'm 21 and I'm a shadow of my former self.
My fairytale relationship with a guy I met my *first day of college* started to struggle thanks to his own OCD about 8 months ago. His takes the form of constantly doubting whether he loves me/we're right together and getting  sexually inappropriate or violent thoughts. They aren't him but the OCD makes him feel like they *must* be real/he is in denial. He is terrified he is a bad guy in denial. 

It took me a long time to accept these OCD doubts he has about me are not to be taken seriously. And even longer to believe he isn't dangerous because of the inappropriate sexual/violent thoughts. I struggled between comforted him and doubting him and trying not to cry over the thoughts. Some really touched on my insecurities and others were so dark I nearly left, even if they were OCD. I spent hours a day for weeks reading all there is to know about OCD because I was so scared he was a monster or didn't love me and OCD was a front. I grew resentful and started thinking OCD was an excuse because he wouldn't get help. I asked for relationship advice day after day on Reddit because I was so lost, whether this was really OCD, whether this is emotional abuse, whether I should leave because I'm so bad for his mental health and vice versa. I reached out for professional  help because I was stressed over this 90% of the time for a few months. I could not relax-what if I was with someone who pretended to have OCD to abuse/traumatise me? What we were toxic for each other? The therapist believed I have OCD myself!

I'm scared I've acted so crazy that I don't deserve my boyfriend nor anyone else ever, even if I make a full recovery. I litreallt posted like 2 questions for advice/reassurnace *every single day* for like 3 months as a crutch/coping mechanism for my inner turmoil. What worries me is I'm not sure if I'm still with my boyfriend because I worry no one else will ever put up with/understand this level of crazy, and if that's true and I'm staying out of desperation, shouldn't I leave and let him find someone decent.",27Oct2020,1

She had been really rude and I told her that I was done, and I dropped this ""friend"" after she went on a n hour and thirty minute detailed rant about how she had self harmed and how the knife was slicing through her skin and the blood was dripping down her wrist and she was suicidal, she was going to kill herself because no one would care, no one would notice, and it was my fault. 

She literally said that it was my fault she had cut herself, and she was going to kill herself, because I made her feel this way because I told her I didn't care anymore and if she wanted to ghost me then she can. It triggered me because I have struggled with self harm for years and that put that imagery in my head and I told her that it wasn't right for her to do that. 

I told her that I didn't put the knife to her skin and it wasn't my fault because she decided to do it, and it wasn't fair for her to blame her actions on me, and try to trigger me, and it wasn't fair for her to try to trigger a relapse because that is what she was doing.  I also told her I understood that she was in a rough spot and she needed to get help, then I sent her the hotlines number and live chat link. 

She then told me that she wasn't going to do it, and she hadn't done anything, and she said something about it being a joke. Which set me off, because suicide is not a joke and it wasn't okay for her to try to use that to manipulate me. It wasn't okay for her to tell me how I would feel, and it wasn't okay for her to go into so much detail about self harm.

I'm studying in the UK and I've been meaning to contact my uni mental health service for a while but (as I'm sure many people can relate to) I struggle to actually do the things that I need to do to get help.

I want to try to help myself but not being able to take such a simple step is discouraging and frustrating, so I was hoping to gain some insight here as to things that might be relevant and how I should go about writing the email. For example, who should the email be written to? I'm unsure as to what help I actually need and I don't feel like I even fully understand the problems I'm facing, so I really don't know where to begin, but I don't feel like I'll be able to continue without a little external help

Just the other day, I was standing by the train tracks and spaced out. I imagined myself being pushed in front of a train and lying motionless on the train tracks. I imagined how my twin would react, I imagined how my mother would react, I imagined what my boyfriend would say. I wasn't supposed to be leaving the house, but I did, so I imagined my mother being disappointed and angry at me. I could see my twin being emotionless and numb and following my example. I imagined my boyfriend getting incredibly angry and cursing my name out, asking why I couldn't stay alive for just a day longer. Then I snapped out of my daydream and realised that I almost missed my train. I wasn't shaken by it though. It has happened so many times before that I simply brushed it away and continued my journey. 

Even when I walk home alone at night - I space out whilst I'm walking and I'll just imagine myself being kidnapped and killed.

In school, I'll stare out the window and imagine a school shooter crashing through the window and taking me out first.

I can't say I've imagined me doing the same to someone else - it's always me. I'm always the one dying. But I never do it intentionally. I've never killed myself on purpose, I'll always get murdered or do something on accident.

A fire alarm goes off, and my immediate thought is to freeze. I'll freeze, space out and watch myself be burnt to a crisp.

Throwaway account. 

I think I am depressed. For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to kill myself, even when there's been no reason to want to. I started self harm at a young age by biting myself, scratching and cutting.

I tried to commit suicide when I was 6 by taking a couple of pills from my mom, they didn't work, I have no idea what they were. I used to dream about running away from home and dying in a freak car accident. I hated my family, I never felt like I belonged. I'm an adult now and I still feel like this.

I'm from a conservative society where mental health education is less, so I can't explain to people how I feel because I have no reason to be depressed and I don't look it. I still live with my parents and I have no means of getting professional help. I have seeked online resources but honestly, they don't help either. I'm really scared of doing something stupid to myself. I want to hold on to hope but I'm slowly losing patience. Once I suggested to my mother that I want to seek professional help and she got angry at me for wanting to go the place where nobody else wants to. I cannot seek professional help on my own as I am in a terrible financial condition. 

I can't bear this life. Every passing day feel like a punishment to me. I cannot open up about this to my friends either because none of them really understand the extent of how I feel and I feel ashamed to do explain.

226,"Hiii :) My name is max and I’m 17

I debated really long whether or not to post this as there’s people that are worse off than me but here we go.

I’ll just start with a few things about me

I’ve been „dealing“ with not being confident forever now and I only blame it on myself since I’ve never been bullied or anything. I heard dumb comments about my looks or voice before but I think everyone went through this. I’m a very introverted person at first but once I‘m comfortable with a person I’m very outgoing. (This has luckily gotten better since I started my apprenticeship 2 years ago.) :)
I never had a girlfriend before or even my first kiss, it always ended up with the girl not being interested anymore or her just talking to someone else. I never even got a romantical compliment that wasn’t over text and i never really felt loved by anyone else than my friends and family. I skate and game in my freetime but i’m not particularly good at these things and I also watch animes from time to time. I think I’m smart but most of the time I’m just too lazy to do something out of it, my grades are good but that’s about it. I’m interested in a lot of things especially fashion and technology (nerdy) things heh. 

As I said I never really feel confident but I always managed to kinda deal with it but it’s only gotten worse. I really need someone that can give me advise at this point. 
My face breaks out since this year and it doesn’t seem to get better even tho I use skincare products everyday. It hurts from time to time and I feel so disgusting. I think my hair looks fine in the mirror but on photos, or just generally not mirrored pics, it just seems like a huge mess. I’m skinny (123lbs 5‘8/ 56kg 174cm) I don’t think it looks that bad but people always point it out and it makes me feel so bad about it. I like fashion but usually my clothes just don’t fit the way I would like them too and it’s getting tiring to look for clothes on depop all day. I’m drinking enough water and I’m always trying to be positive about myself but my brain is giving in. I just got nothing i’m really good at and I look average if not worse. Girls i’m interested in usually don’t care as I’m just too shy to make a move since most of them probably are way more experienced than me. I wish I kept playing a sport so I atleast have something to do. I cancel plans often when I don’t feel confident and there was a time where I just stayed home on every weekend for a few months and it made me feel worse and worse. 

If anyone takes his or her time I’d be super thankful. :)

hope you have a good day!!!",27Oct2020,1

228,"So I have some major school exams in a week and it's made me realise, I cannot be motivated to revise - even despite the constant anxiety to do well. I suppose I've grown up being someone fairly academically gifted, but I'm realising that I cannot rely on that anymore. I have no dedication; the lack of focus outweighs the need to do well. It's so irritating, because a part of me still cares but even when I try to revise or do something; I lie and trick myself into thinking I'm being productive. Nothing sticks. I find it so difficult to absorb that information. I spend my days in bed, and I'm trying my hardest, but it's so difficult. I don't feel awake, or even alive.

Maybe my mental health will finally be reflected in my grades. Maybe my teachers will finally realise, or wonder if something is up. I mean, I guess looking half dead in the back of class for the last two years isn't enough of a red flag, but oh well. 

It's just so disheartening. There's all these expectations for me to do well, but I know I cannot live up to them. I don't feel as smart as I'm made out to be, or I deserve these expectations. There's this overwhelming pressure and yet half of me doesn't care. The other half is just screaming into an obstinate ear. English is one of the only subjects I guess I was truly gifted at, but my writing and focus are so severely impaired when I'm in a poor state that I just give up.

I want to talk to my school. I want to get help, but I don't want my parents to know. I'm worried it's something like depression or dysthymia and I told myself I was gonna tell someone months ago, but I never did.  I worry that my school will tell my parents, but there's no other way for me to get help. Currently, doctor's appointments are only done over the phone, and I don't think I'm even old enough to make an appointment myself regardless. But if I tell my school, I'm worried it won't be taken seriously, or it's just an excuse to do badly in my exams.

I keep on telling myself that there is something wrong with me, or I am a bad person. I do often enjoy spending time alone, but certain things trigger me. It has been especially bad this week, as it is almost halloween (my favourite holiday) and I would usually celebrate halloween with friends. I started watching Host the other night, and immediately decided it was too scary and switched it off and thought to myself that I should watch it with someone else; but then I thought about how long it might be before I actually get a chance to watch it with someone, and immediately I felt bad.

Saying all this, I know there is a practical reason why I am alone and that given a more favourable 'social climate' I will be okay. After going through a breakup at the start of the year, I am now living alone. I am also a freelancer so I work from home on my own.

Thanks to depression, I had zero motivation, but decided to go to university anyway. It did not go well. Panic and anxiety attacks, lonelyness etc. After 3 months I left and still didn't know what to do. The Next year I went to university again, but this time in my hometown, hoping it would get better here, but well, it didn't. I was scared of Therapy but was so desperate that i decided to give it a go. One year later I thought i would be ready. I thought I need to study, since my grades in highschool were so good. But here I am writing a silly reddit post. I just don't know what to do and I don't want to annoy my family and friends with my drama anymore. Kinda hard to feel like I am still worth something after quitting university two times and thinking about a third time. Sorry again for my bad english.",27Oct2020,1
234,"Since I was 12 I've had a habit of picking my skin, it used to just be my arms but now it's digressed to my chest, back and face as well. I'm 26 now and don't feel like I can stop, it's getting to a point that the scars on my face are becoming very noticeable, which makes me feel terrible and leads to more scratching. I've read that I should replace it with another hobby, but I have no idea what as the scratching really helps me momentarily feel better from negative feelings.

If anyone has been through this or has any advice please let me know, it would be greatly appreciated.",27Oct2020,1

236,"Sorry in advance for the long post, just a bit freaked out. 

Currently I (20F) am working towards receiving disability payments for extreme PTSD caused by a history of child sexual abuse from my father, emotional abuse, and multiple rapes. It's been a long process to get where I am with my treatment and I am still not anywhere close to receiving payments or functioning enough to support myself, so I have been staying with my mom. We definitely don't mesh well together a lot of the time, but for a while it was going well. I was even managing to steadily improve and had hopes to not need disability pay.

Until my mom started seeing Mike in April.

At first all I knew about Mike was that he couldn't come into the apartment for some reason and there was a reason that the two of them couldn't date. I try to keep out of my moms life as much as I can and didn't ask any questions about it. It was only two weeks later when Mike was finally available to visit mom in her home and date her that I found out why there was a barrier to this in the past.

Turns out Mike is a registered sex offender who went to jail for molesting his daughter while drunk. They couldn't date or have him in the apartment because it wasn't allowed under his parole yet and they had to have it approved. And now he can come over whenever the two of them want to be together.

For the most part I don't judge people for their past, I care about who people are in the present and when someone says they've changed I trust them until proven otherwise. My mom swears to me that he's a great guy who just had a lot of problems and make mistakes. But I can't handle being in the same apartment as this man with what I've experienced.

Being near a child molester, recovered or not, is a constant trigger that makes my disability even harder to manage. From April to now I have barely been able to bathe and have resorted to sponge baths in bed, I'm lucky if I manage to get myself to eat three meals in a day, I can't handle leaving the apartment for groceries anymore, I had a suicide attempt for the first time in years, and recently I had to go to the hospital for a panic attack so severe half my face went numb and my eyesight was extremely reduced.

Mom and I have been fighting off and on about this since April with both of us doing some pretty harsh things. I would yell and insult her when triggered and she accused me of lying about my PTSD and telling me that my inability to feed myself often was my choice and if I wanna kill myself I need to go to a hospital because it wasn't her problem.

The current situation is that he only visits three days a week, but I am still not able to cope with him being here and I am still asking if she can only meet him outside the home. She says that she's tired of my constant asking for things and she has a right to have a life and not be controlled by me, but she understands that I have serious needs. At the same time she doesn't want to hurt Mike and thinks what she wants to be considered too in this situation. I understand that she has needs too, but I haven't been this dysfunctional since my dad was revealed to be inappropriate with kids. So am I seriously just overreacting or being selfish? This situation feels so wrong, but I'm not sure anymore. I need an outside opinion.",27Oct2020,1

But I am currently home sick from work with the flu and I don’t trust myself to be able to keep any of my meds down yet. 
Not being able to take my extensive meds leaves me with mental health that is taking an immediate and noticeable nose dive. I’ve missed my morning meds from today and my night meds from last night and as a consequence I am feeling horribly depressed. 
Is there anything I can do in the future to protect my mental health if I can’t take my medication due to extreme nausea?",27Oct2020,1
242,"I think I’m looking for insight and support more than advice at the moment, because I don’t think I’ll be able to follow through with any advice (seeking treatment is the obvious answer, but also not possible at present).

I’ve been mentally ill pretty much my entire life. I’ve had some level of anxiety and depression since elementary school, started self harming in middle school, and have had an eating disorder since high school (I’m in my early 30s now).

I rarely self harm anymore (maybe once or twice a year at most), but everything else has just gotten worse over time. I was in therapy from age 18-24 because I was able to access treatment through my university, but since then I’ve been trying to deal on my own. For a while I was doing relatively okay— not great, but there was some improvement and I could more or less function just like anyone else— held down a (crappy but steady) job that I excelled at, learned how to interact with people and surprisingly was well liked, followed through with all obligations and responsibilities, and even made a few friends.

Unfortunately, about four years ago a bunch of pretty traumatic stuff happened in a short period of time, and I regressed somewhat. I was still able to mostly hold it together though for a couple of years, but then more stuff happened, and it’s been a pretty steep and steady decline.

Until recently, as crazy as some/a lot of my issues were, I understood them in a roundabout way. The eating disorder made sense (that still does, at least), my anxiety and phobias made sense, my interpersonal issues made sense— it all stems from having grown up in an abusive and neglectful environment, plus a few other traumatic experiences. But now there are so many things that I cannot do, and there’s no reason I can think of to explain why I’m so helpless and unable to do the simplest things.

Some examples: I have $2000+ dollars worth of pay checks I never deposited because going to the bank was too scary. I am scared to get my mail— I’ll empty my mailbox every few weeks but throw everything in a corner in a spare room because I’m too scared to look through it (I usually go around three months before I finally force myself to power through the pile). I don’t pay my bills until I start getting emails/phone calls threatening to shut off service. I’m scared to check my bank balance (even when I know logically that I have more than enough left to cover my expenses). Can’t check my cc statement even though I know I’ve been careful about my spending. I don’t know if I have insurance (Medicaid) because I’m too scared to check the status. Needed my dad to do my taxes for me (although I technically did end up doing them because he wasn’t reading through the prompts carefully enough). Couldn’t file for unemployment, any time its even suggested I just feel overwhelming panic. Took months for me to convince myself to fill out the census. Terrified when there’s an unexpected knock on the door. Scared to do basic household maintenance like changing my ac filter. I have driven maybe five times in the last two years. Scared to do anything other than read or watch tv really.

I also panic and don’t know what to do when any little thing goes wrong (intellectually I know what to do, but can’t seem to translate knowledge into action). I was laid off due to covid, but when I was working I was scared to do even the most basic tasks without my boss checking my work— couldn’t even order office supplies without her having to stop what she was doing to look and reassure me it was fine to order. One time my train was offloaded due to track problems and I called her crying because I didn’t know what to do. Fortunately she understands me (better than I do, it seems) and is very patient and doesn’t judge me for being ridiculous, but I think that’s rare. There’s no way I could survive a job without someone like her to guide and support me. It’s unlikely I’d ever be hired anywhere else, but even if I was I’d likely be fired pretty quick. I’m a hard worker, quite intelligent (or used to be), honest, and reliable, but that’s all been overshadowed by my mental health issues.

Since a lot of my weird new fears are related to financial issues, you’d think the root cause would be financial insecurity, but that’s not it. My parents are well off and have provided my housing, and while I am responsible for paying utilities/food/incidentals, I know they would step in and help cover those bills if I’m unable to. I understand I am fortunate in that regard and am very thankful.

On the flip side, they have an interesting way of deciding what is and isn’t worth spending money on. They’ve always been reluctant to pay for my medical/dental care and don’t believe in mental illness. So despite living a seemingly privileged life (I have a lot of “stuff”) I really have no way of accessing treatment. My father “cured” my anxiety by telling me to list things I’m scared of and then telling me I shouldn’t be scared of those things, just don’t feel that way anymore. He screamed at me to gain weight because otherwise I’d end up in the hospital with organ failure and he’d be stuck with the bills, and that’s not fair to him (my mother screams at me about starving children in Africa and what a selfish bitch I am). I’m not allowed to say I’m ugly anymore because it hurts my fathers feelings, and since I can’t say it I guess that means it isn’t an issue.

I’ve declined so much mentally and cognitively and I know it’s just going to keep getting worse. I desperately need help, I want help, I’d be more than willing to put the work in to change and better myself. But I can’t get help, because I have no control over my finances (there is a decent amount of money technically in my name, but I’m not allowed to touch it, and due to my mental and some physical health issues I’m unable to obtain and keep a decent job that would allow me to pay for treatment on my own).

I know that if I could get my mental health sorted, I’d be capable of accomplishing so much. But instead I’m just stuck. I don’t want to be unemployed, dependent, “lazy” or anything else. But I just see no way out of this situation.

I need help, but I can’t ask for it. There’s no one to ask. My parents won’t help me financially or emotionally. I have no other family really. My few friends are all going through serious issues of their own so I can’t really turn to them. I know there are hotlines and things but again I run into the wall of being unable to pick up the phone and call, and anyway I doubt there’s all that much they could offer me.

This has turned into a long sob story, which wasn’t my intention. I guess my main thing is wondering if anyone else has experienced the sort of decline I’m describing? Going from being a good deal smarter than average to being unable to figure out how to handle or accomplish the simplest things. Or having issues that made at least some kind of sense turn into issues that make no sense at all. Can anyone explain to me how/why I’ve turned into a complete idiot? Anyone else unable to handle IADLs (independent activities of daily living)?

I suppose my main thing is...what’s wrong with me? Because I’ve had anxiety and depression for my entire life, but this seems to be a whole different beast. And it’s terrifying.",27Oct2020,1
243,"I’m so tired. My parents constantly fight, with themselves and me, and my friends either ignore or hate or leave me. I am incredibly sensitive, anxious, and easily stressed, so I can never tell if I’m overreacting when I’m upset. Everything just combines into one huge reason for me to do nothing all day and have no motivation. 

I want to die so badly but I don’t know how. I’m scared of pain and I’m scared to hurt myself. I would probably fail at suicide just like anything else. I am just so tired of living and I can’t talk to anyone without them saying it’s not a big deal and I feel like I’m complaining too much.

The doctors treated me like I was a Jewish prisoner during ww2. They took everything I had and didn't even give back the 20 I had in my pocket.

I had a 38 day sober run. Then Relapsed and haven't been able to bounce back. When I went on that 38 day sober run I changed my number and removed myself from all social circles. Mainly to get a fresh head and to get away from my drinking friends. That worked. I kept in touch with immediate family and two mates.

Hello nice to meet you, I'm Ben.

Grew up in a safe friendly town. Never in fear of being robbed, assaulted, or being picked up off the street. My parents make a more than average living I believe and feel, and always supported me and really care for me. (From the United States of America)

Skip to fifth grade. First year in middle school. Had trouble with school and socially. Something was up. Towards the end of fifth year, talked to a therapist and guidance counselor at my school regularly. It was determined I had anxiety. Completely normal for someone like my age. I am going to clarify normal. Normal is what our social and cultural beliefs refer to as normal, I do not necessarily agree with them but I recognize what is say normal versus odd. Completely normal for someone my age. I made it through middle school with a average grade point and positive attitude. Things were up and I was visiting my therapist less and taking less meds. Yes I was prescribed medicine at a small dose and I do not know what medication that was. Possible Zoloft but it honestly does not matter.

Freshman year, I'm in for two weeks already with no problems. Third week coming up, feeling a little nervous to be honest and some point in the week I was home having suicidal thoughts, paranoia, severe anxiety attacks. I went to the hospital, I met some people that really influenced my life. All my childhood my parents taught me that you need to stay safe, stay away from drugs and alcohol and all that obvious stuff. I really stayed pure according to my parents beliefs until senior year but we have two more years.

From being in the hospital and after hospitalization (which was more like a actually well handled place with good food and counselors) I attended a basically a metal health service for young adults/teens were you can do schoolwork and attend group therapy with other kids for the rest of the year and really learned a lot but was still quiet. I got better meds and am on the same today. My hospitalization included mass paranoia and believing everyone was against me. It was a struggle and sometimes still is a struggle for me this is what confuses me on the topic of diagnosis of myself because that is honestly all I want to know.

Sophomore year, between freshman and sophomore I went through many therapist which I will remain anonymous, some being psychologists and some being psychiatrist (one can prescribe medicine) and I basically had one of each at this time. I attended school and again went to the same hospital, luckily I never attempted suicide only had really set thoughts about, this time, my mental health service center took me in for another few weeks. I got out so fast! It was record time really. Usually kids were out in at most nine weeks really but I got out in around three. I was so happy and giving feedback on the daily and people really respected and looked up to me. I felt like a new me. My life was getting enjoyable and I was eager to move on! I did not make it back to school, but had home instruction for the rest of the year and again average grades just like the last years.

Junior year, feeling confident, have some new friends that I am trying out, start the year super strong! I was attending school without a missed day! I had high grades at least a 3.8 GPA (with like one AP class) A girl was also publicly interested in me (or so I was told but well that was a bad experience). Then I got a different girlfriend and we dated for like six months! Half of our relationship was during COVID and then I broke up with her. The honest reason was I was not happy with myself. I just was not happy, and it honestly was so sudden and I was very stressed out and sort of made an impulsive decision. After we broke up, I realized I 'liked' someone. I was too fast and eager, and I honestly loved the person but truly as a friend. Because I was blinded and even though they were great I was missing pieces of the puzzle and luckily this didn't work out and I went on the year single. 

At this point I was still drug free (aside from prescribed metal health medication) and felt pretty good. I went back to my old friends who were the best in the end. At this point I am 17 years old. I quit my sports and still am not playing any. I was a decently popular kid, I was known in my small school by everyone and we were on neutral terms. My mental health evaluation at this point is this :

100% Severe anxiety and social anxiety problem. (Still as of today)

50% of therapist said I had or had signs of schizophrenia

Meds are Seroquel and Prozac, (Still as of today)

I often do feel abnormally paranoid about things still. (Still today)

I finished Junior year online. Going in and out of a stressful job. My grades were on point! Better than average. I was relatively happy in my current position. 

Senior year. COVID still out there. Schools online. Have that job. Got a girlfriend been four months and its really well. Summer of my Junior year I drank with friends (no parties I didn't like them and COVID was a thing).

Now to today. I have smoked maybe two whole weed cartridges and had odd experiences with them.

1. I tried weed. My experience was sensational. It was my first time. I was sitting down. I didn't drink any water cause I could not really move I was stiff. I could not control my eyes because I was seeing this hallucination of a ""game"" going on when I closed my eyes. I was basically tripping. It was only when I closed my eyes and It was not like I could see someone standing next to me. I just had to move my eyes left in right in real life to move a ball on the x axis, and avoid blocks while falling down slowly. It was also like trippy and everything changed shapes and was really entertaining. However, when the ball was touching the boundary that I had my eyes would start to lock don't making cross eye but my yes didn't cross idk how to explain it and this is what I honestly saw, basically my eyes felt sharp pain in a little ball in my eye it was very odd. And I was swaying and closing and opening my eyes and I realize that I probably looked like I was dying :D. My friend was with me and I honestly laugh about how anxious he got for me. He was generally considered and at one point got up and called my other friend. I remember telling him I might look like I'm gonna die but I won't lose the game. I still laugh about this so you can too. When my other friend got there he was also very startled when he saw me I was shivering or at least I thought and I was so out of touch and I wanted something and he was starting to get anxious because I was getting upset about not having a puff bar or something. I also started vaping around then. As of now I do not vape and haven't been for about a month so that is good. I also learned that I can (or think I can) really read peoples body language and I feel like I have a super power. I want to test it out I just do not know how I would do such a thing. I overall felt like it was a brutal journey and ended with me connecting closer to god or something. I just felt amazing that something like that existed and I was able to see it. Maybe I'm becoming a hippy who knows life is crazy!

Other experiences : 

\- this cart was not as good and made me feel relaxed. I like this and I was now attached to the idea of weed for anxiety.

\- third time only improved this

\- had a similar cart and went on a long drive to a town to get someone and I thought everything was a green screen it looked crazy

\- other times in my room I just chill and try to stream ill talk about this later

&amp;#x200B;

My current position:

Life is confusing right now. I'm 18, about to vote... I like weed, but the people very close to me do not necessarily hate it nor like it and I worry that my girlfriend does not like my behavior but I have expressed how it helps me, and sometimes it doesn't help.

&amp;#x200B;

Give me your advice. Do I have delusions/hallucinations because my friends say weed don't do that.

&amp;#x200B;

If you like the way I talk / type and liked my story try following wantduck on twitch! I am not very good at talking alone but would love love love to interact with someone on my stream. Thanks a lot. Remember only say things that are meant to learn not hurt. I will probably be high because it makes me more open and spiritual.",27Oct2020,1
252,"i cant seem to stop thinking that everyone has something against me. i dont know why im so paranoid. i have no friends and dont speak at school, so when anyone from my class randomly speak to me, i cant stop thinking they want to become friends with me, then use me and throw me away, so i always decline or stop the conversation to distance myself if they were thinking to use me, just in case. once, i was invited by someone i knew before to come to their house party with 3 other people, and i was so convinced they all were planning on killing me if i came, so i didnt come.

if a old friend reaches out, wanting to meet up really randomly, i cant stop thinking they want to kill me. it doesnt seem logical, but i really do believe it. i also cant leave my water bottle on my desk when im not there, because i keep thinking someones spitting in it when im gone.. i always remember where i put things, so that if someone were to touch something or do something suspicious, id know beforehand so i can be more cautious of my things.

 i also avoid going out. when im outside, i cant stop thinking the cars are going to run me over, or that people in the cars are going to shoot me or throw something at me when they drive by. if i walk by anyone, im convinced they will stab me if they walk to close, or when theyre behind me, that they are going to shoot me in the head.

i get these kind of thoughts with my family 2, even though they all have nothing against me, and are really loving. i just cant stop thinking they're poisoning my food, spitting in it, putting hair or boogers in the food and sometimes think they want to kill me (not a common thought). i often watch my mother cook because of this, to pay attention if shes doing something suspicious. i know this makes me look stupid,, but i think so much about it. if i dont watch, i cant do anything else.

to stop myself from panicking when walking home from school, i listen to music loudly and focus on the lyrics. i listen to music in class (we're aloud, as long as we're able to pay attention) everyday, so sometimes i dont have enough battery (bluetooth headset) for when i walk home. i then feel sick, my throat hurting as hell as i cant stop the thoughts from becoming overwhelming, and i almost always end up tearing up on the way home. 

Does everyone actually think this way, and just doesnt talk about it? or is there something wrong with me? i tried opening up about the 'thinking ill get killed when im outside' part with my mother, she told me i should talk to the school nurse (? i am not english) about it, but the last time i did that they told my parents about my ED thoughts around food and SH, when i only allowed her to talk about my issues at school, because she thought they had the right to know since it was a danger to my health. should i talk about this to someone? i feel like my 'problem' is not 'bad' enough to see a therapist. can age have something to do with it? im turning 18. i have no idea

I really love helping others, being someone my friends and people who are close to me can rely on
I always try to be there for them, to cheer them up, to reassure them, to remember them that it’s everything alright and that I will always be there for them
But when it comes to me, and they ask me how I feel I just can’t tell them how I feel, physically and mentally I don’t want to tell them my problems, what I feel and what I think, that would absolutely be mean to them
I always tell them, when they ask me the reason why I don’t tell them anything, that “you already have your own problems which are way heavier and way more important, why would I weigh you down with my problems? They are much less important” and I think it’s the best way I can sum up what I feel
I’m sorry for the wall text, but I just wanted to let it out and wanted someone to know it and maybe help me cause I don’t know what to do, it’s like my body got used to not talking about myself and now it’s really hard to explain what I feel to others, to open up

Hi. I have ADHD, ASD, Depression, Anxiety. 

I want to take a bunch of my meds and die. I don’t like myself.

I’m stupid. I can’t do anything right. I’m clumsy, i need extra help and stuff in school, people bully me for it and because of my hight (4ft 11inch).

I don’t like myself. I had a really nice friend once last year and he randomly stopped talking to me. 
I hardly have any friends. I have a really nice friend on my main account who doesn’t judge me and lets me cry and say stuff to him. He is nice but i don’t even know him. He lives in a different country. He means alot to me and i don’t want him to know that i’m writing this. 

He says that i am perfect the way i am but alot of people think different because they say mean things. 

I’m really emotionally sensative. I cry alot and people make fun of it.

Disgusting part••i have really really bad period cramps and things and i have been to hospital before because of it and my doctor says i might need to go again. I don’t want to. But they hurt really bad. I’m scared of the hospital (idk why) and i just don’t want to go. 

I get told to kill myself and the first attempt should have worked. 

It makes me sad and i cry every day. I want to try and leave again. I want to take alot of my meds. Probably my ritalin or something. My mum is really nice and knows that i am upset alot but she doesn’t know this. 

I’m scared she won’t be proud of me anymore. I self harmed myself on my leg after 18 days and i’m scared she will be mad at me. 

But she and a couple of friends are the only ones who are making me stay alive. 

I’m scared. I don’t want to go to a therapist again or text a hotline or something. 
I just want advice on how to cheer up or how to like myself more.

261,"I have a friend who's life has spiraled down in the past few years. He hasn't held a job longer than a month in about 5 years and has also had 3 children and has one on the way ( he only sees the one kid he has with current girlfriend and they have one on the way) he constantly talks about killing himself, lives in government housing,  his family pays his bills, and he spends all his time getting drunk and playing video games. His girlfriend and baby momma is a schizophrenia who doesn't seem to be making his mental health better at all (however with out the kid she gave him he would've probably killed himself already)

I don't fucking know what to do. Our other part of the three amigos is in the military and has urged me I need to big brother him but every time either of us try to talk to him about it he gets defensive and says we're being assholes and stops talking to us.

I have no idea what to do. He OBVIOUSLY doesn't want the help but he doesn't understand the living conditions he's living in is making his depression all the worse and that if he'd pay for his own place and make some of his own money and support his family instead of having his mom do it he'd feel much better.

I know some of you will say he's toxic and to leave it be but I live in a small coal town where there's nothing but rednecks and a population of about 2,000. I know everyone my age group NO ONE else shares interests with me because they all want to listen to country music and play in mud holes in their free time with off road vehicles and that's not me. I like martial arts, video games, and a wide array of music. That doesn't exist here. If I give this person up I give up the only person I can talk to, share memes with, tell about life... I'd lose my only friend.

262,"So I’m 19 now and since year 9 I’ve had problems with my mental health. A looming sadness and constant anxiety. As I’ve gotten older I’ve been able to look back at things that have gone wrong for me and where I need to change to keep my head on my shoulders and every day I keep going forward.
But last night my little brother called me and just poured his little heart out. I realised that he lives in the same head as I do. I think it’s the worst thing that could’ve been conflicted onto him. I spoke to him for hours about the head that I’d been living in just 4 years longer than him and what helps me. He spoke about how he just feels sad and can never find a reason for it. The whole time he was speaking I knew exactly what he was going through and it took me back to being his age when shit started to really suck. Giving him all the advice I could just doesn’t feel like enough because I know he’s about to start his life sentence in dealing with mental health.
In a way I’m glad he has me because all I had to look at was my golden older brother, he’s seriously amazing and I compared myself to him religiously in school. The HSC for me is was when shit really hit the fan and I finally reached out for help but I have always just considered myself the crazy child. I guess I’m glad that he’s got me to see that it’s okay to take tiny steps as long as you’re moving forward. 
If anything I’m more motivated than anything to find what works for me so I can tell him before he has to face what I did.
He’s in year 9 now and I remember that’s when I started to self harm, it’s not something I do any more but I can recognise a lot of the things I do as self harm or self sabotage. I don’t want for him to have to live through all those things and constantly wonder what’s wrong with him and why he can’t just be normal. I don’t want to see the HSC destroy him like it did me, I don’t want him to find the escape in drugs that I did and I don’t want him to sabotage himself so far down that he feels he can’t get up.
This isn’t something I can speak to my parents about easily because if I’m right and we are in the same mind, the fear of disappointing them is incredibly overwhelming and I need him to know that he can tell me things without it getting to mum. I told him how much they love him and that they are always going to stand right by his side and that they love him. But I know the state of mind and I know how easily something like that goes in one ear and out the other. 
I need him to not feel like a burden and I need him to know that I’m right here and that I get it and it sucks. It really does.",27Oct2020,1

264,"I used to be a sensitive and emotional girl. I cried in front of everyone, when someone killed a bee without any reason. I cried a lot when my crush rejected me. I cried alone, when my father had to work abroad for a year for the fourth time and I missed him.

Then I stopped crying. Only the people I truly trust would ever see me cry, unless I really couldn’t hold the stress anymore and I just broke down. But this only happened once a year, if at all. 

By now the walls I built around myself are so high, I feel like I can’t even see the sky above myself anymore. I don’t build up the connection to anyone because I’m scared of losing them. I feel like the precautions I made to not get hurt made me a cold person overall. 


If you hurt me back in the day I’d try to forget. And I managed to do that. Blindly trusting again. Getting stabbed in the back again. 

If you hurt me now, I will build up an emotional distance, and I might lose that connection that took me ages to build up. I’ll lose you. 

I’ve cried so much over people that I lost. Why would I waste time with that? My heart used to feel heavy when thinking of my old classmates that I’d last seen in summer. But I managed to get rid of that as well. At this point I don’t care.


I now am a woman who feels restless. I built myself not only a wall, but a whole kingdom around myself. It’s so big, and I feel alone in it. But no one seems to see it, as I’m safely hidden behind my walls. 

And I see people that I feel very attracted to and I just can’t reach them. I can’t build up any connection that would last. I’m running after people and my crush changes almost every day because I don’t feel good about sticking to one. They could reject me if I’d crush on them too long and they’d find out. 

What doesn’t make this any better: I’m lithromantic so I literally can’t fall in love with people. Well, I can. Until they say they love me too. That’s when I’ll drop it. And I feel like this is what is going to get me into my grave. I feel so lost and lonely. Knowing I might never find someone to have around myself and spend my life with. The thought of it doesn’t even make sense to me, but I also don’t want to miss out on it. 

This morning I thought I wouldn’t care about that, because I don’t need anyone by my side. I thought I could be my significant other, I’m enough for me. But this sounds a bit lonely after all. It sounds sad. But no one will ever be the right one, because I don’t want to come home and have to see the same person every day.

22/M

Hi everyone! I hope y’all are having a wonderful day!
Basically a month ago I had a strange thought/gut feeling about something bad happening on a certain date,I had the date on my mind all the time, felt very anxious and lived all week as it was the last, even though I wasn’t 100% sure if my intuition was right. In the end, nothing happened, but even after a month I’m extremely anxious - even though I been sleeping well, eating good and working out, I’m constantly, googling schizophrenia prodromal symptoms with extreme fear. The more I read the worse it gets, I started to be anxious about every thing and have an upset stomach. Also I realised that I want to drink more alcohol - it takes away anxiety and I’m not thinking about mental illnesses any more, I’m not asking for a diagnosis - just for some insight what may be the cause - can it be ocd/anxiety/schizo or something else?
Have a great day, thanks a lot!",27Oct2020,1

269,"I feel very odd today, and the last week has been building to it. It’s all the usual stress - covid, election, job hunting, worrying about loved ones, weird existential boredom of being in the same apartment all the time. I’ve been through a LOT of unfortunate things since this pandemic started and I’ve handled it really well (so I’ve been told). I genuinely felt like I was able to process things and move through them in a healthy way rather than bottling them up.

So I’m confused where this is coming from. All the worst for me happened in April/may, and other than normal day to day stress about this stuff, I’ve felt pretty normal. I’ve been depressed in the past and felt very numb, or a sense of depersonalization, like I was on autopilot. 

It’s sort of the opposite now. I got little sleep last night and my emotions sort of snapped. I’m crying a lot for very small things. My emotional reactions are wrong - I’m sad about things I shouldn’t be and excited about odd things. I feel like I have a lot of nervous energy. It’s either the wrong emotion or the wrong amount of emotion. 

I also feel like everyone I’ve spoken to today is treating me strangely. They seem very indifferent about things I’m saying, like it doesn’t matter or I’m invisible. I feel very much like I exist, but I’m not sure they think I do, in the usual way.

I don’t feel worried about anything in particular today. Thinking about the election or the interview I just had doesn’t fill me with dread. I’m not sure if all of the awful things this year are finally getting to me, and it’s not clicking, or maybe I just need some sleep. Has anyone else felt like this.",27Oct2020,1

273,"I am a 21 year old girl and for as long as I can remember, I have had issues with intimacy and closeness. I grew up with an absent father and a single mother in the military so I grew up with 2 different daycare ladies while my mom went away periodically. My mom eventually met a man who was very abusive and was with him for almost a decade from the time I was 8-15. I say this because I think this has a lot to do with my issues with closeness/abandonment and I also think I took on some traits of my emotionally absent/narcissistic step-father.

I have always feared being close to people especially romantically and had massive sexual anxiety up until around 2 years ago when I began dating. Most of my ""closest"" friends were online (but I have friends whom I genuinely consider close who I love dearly- but I never felt like I could be my true self with really anybody. I thought this was normal for a long time although it made me very sad and lonely). I have never had a hard time making friends and I can be outgoing when I choose to and people seem to like me and want/feel able to connect with me very well. I think with I can be very warm, funny, loving and inviting and all of my non-romantic loved ones tell me so. 

I will say I am a very emotional person as in I am upfront with my insecurities, I cry openly, I used to laugh and talk openly, I have no issues expressing what hurts my feelings or makes me upset. But so much makes me upset or sad and I feel like a burden. I feel as though I am empathetic and care how I hurt others but sometimes it is less present, or certain emotions I can't really understand as well. Anger and sadness I respond to very poorly, and often have difficulty comforting others because I hate being comforted when sad. I can listen and I try to be supportive verbally but I often feel helpless and nervous to say the wrong thing. Despite this though I am used to being the friend people come to for advice or understanding, and I don't think I come off as dismissive at least to my friends and non-romantic loved ones. 

But when it comes to romance I completely shut down. I have rarely had crushes and never felt the ""yearning"" or desire for a romantic relationship or commitment and I could never understand those around me that crave love so much. Well, I definitely crave it but when faced with it I am so deathly uncomfortable. I used to never accept physical touch from friends or even my mom who is a very loving person to me. It took me years to be able to hug and even verbally express my love for others. Over time this aspect has gotten much better and I can freely express my deep love and appreciation for my friends. 

But romantically this has never changed, maybe lack of practice. For a long time I felt romance was fake and that I would never want or find someone to be with romantically. 

For example, the second a friend of mine wants to be my boyfriend, if I have feelings for them, I may accept but eventually push them away and leave them despite wanting to be with them. I act very cold although I am hurting inside and care for them, I hurt them too which makes me feel even more guilty, shameful, and messed up. Hurting someone with my issues is another reason I feel I should be alone. If I don't return the feelings I feel no discomfort, can kindly reject them but still feel their friend and have no issues. It is like the second someone who is attractive to me returns my affections I begin to feel uncomfortable with them, feel like I need to change for them or not understand why they would want to be with me and just get scared.

I am in a relationship right now that is crumbling at my feet with someone who is very emotionally open with me, has shared everything with me, and always expressed his love and desire to be with me. I will admit he has his own issues that I think make our relationship impossible to continue regardless but he always made me feel loved in the ways that matter, or at least that he wanted to be with me and around me. 

I always want space from him, never wanted to commit to him, it took me months to say I loved him even when I did and I just was never seriously committed to this relationship and it was unintentional but this has hurt him deeply and in ways I can't take back. I am always running from him and lately our relationship has gotten so bad that I cannot even speak to him. We live together, share a bed and no exaggeration I am so scared to speak to him or look at him. He has literally begged me for months to connect with him the way I do others but it is like I am physically unable to. I have completely neglected him lately out of pain, guilt, shame... I don't know. I just always want to be alone even if I miss him. I feel I don't deserve him. I always want to do things alone and never invite him to do things with me even though I am always invited and he always puts me first. 

Every time we fight I say I want to break up with him because I cannot handle negative emotions or mean words or yelling, or things being broken. In my friendships I am always the one calming everyone down and trying to keep things light and make everyone happy and I can't handle true anger. I always turn my anger inwards or so I thought until this relationship. I don't yell or break things I just go mute and run away as fast as possible. 

We have gone through things that has definitely damaged my feelings of closeness with him but even when we were the closest I still hid myself from him. I have hurt him so immensely and I am feeling levels of guilt and shame that I have never felt before and I am beginning to feel hopeless and suicidal again. I have been so mean to someone who is simply asking for connection but I feel like there is something truly wrong with me that I can't give it to him. I have made him so depressed. 

He is against therapy for me and every time I have tried to leave saying its for the both of us he asks me to stay and I do because I thought it would make him happy. But now we are past that point and I think he is really done trying. 

I don't think I can save this relationship but I just want to save myself and be better for me and anyone I come into contact with. I feel so sad and envious of those who can just let people in and connect openly without insecurity or shame.  I feel so much self hatred for what I have done to my boyfriend and how I have treated him. I have thought for awhile I may have BPD but I'm not sure yet though I really think I may have it. 

Anyone who is emotionally unavailable, or with an avoidant attachment style, how can I heal this? I have an appointment with a therapist tonight but I am in so much pain and that's my fault. I feel so insane and evil.",27Oct2020,1
