0,"I have the feeling that a family member of mine is suffering from a mix of anxiety / depression / something else.

I can't, however, go with them to a psychiatrist / psychologist - both because of covid, and also because the psychologist / or my family member would probably be against that. 

Let's say the family member agrees to go. I have the feeling it would take a long time (probably 5-10 sessions) before the psychologist gets the full picture of what's going on with this family member. The reason for this is that the family member is very intelligent, and stubborn, and would probably come off reasonably well at first. He'd also deny strenuously that there was anything wrong with him, and probably try to blame his behavior on external factors / his living situation.

On the other hand, I know very well things I could point to that really get to the crux of his symptoms: how he's been interacting with his family, with friends, the general public, his emotional outbursts, etc.

Ideally, I could speak to the psychologist and let them know the deal beforehand, and get updates from them directly. I think this would be in violation of how they operate.

So... how are you supposed to get help for this family member? Just send them off alone and hope progress is being made? Wait for at least 5 sessions before the psychologist sees probably half of what you see?

It seems pretty darn inefficient this way. So, what's the right way?",19Jul2020,1

4,"So my country is out of lockdown for about 2-3 months now, this started when lockdown began. I couldn’t see my friends, I was  depressed and lonely so I began to drink, wasn’t wild at first, a glass of wine or one bier sometimes a nice glass of whisky. Well it Became a whole bottle of wine pretty soon. I drank every day pretty much and just vibe to music and cry. 
Then I was like, I don’t want to be sad, Let’s do mdma, so I did, and I felt great, so I did mdma and some lsd for about two weeks almost every day, and then my body gave up, I crashed because I wasn’t really sleeping or eating, I was basically high doing music all the time. I was sober for like most of lockdown after that. So like 3 weeks. And one of my friends got sick so we couldn’t do anything ( I live alone and work from home so I do social distance but I do occasionally meet my best friend) well the worry for her and my sadness came back together, and i started doing cocain. Well now I’m using cocain pretty much every day.. and drinking. I probably blew 1k up my nose by now. Which is stupid af, I feel so bad about it, and this feeling makes me want to use even more, I didn’t eat in 6 days because all my money goes on drugs, I look horrible, I’ve lost like 30 pounds, I look like a panda. Like my eyes are black. 
I don’t know I think I could stop but I’m afraid to try. I forgot how sober feels like. Fuck man. Sorry for rambling I hope you are doing ok",19Jul2020,3

6,"Hello I am new here,
I've been lying to my councillor.

She asks each week if I am okay and I always say yes.
I am not.
I strangle myself to punish myself when I do something wrong, not enough to become unconcious just so I can hear my heart beat and my vision starts to blur.
The three dog scars on my arm, not my dog, the first time I self harmed with blunt scissors.
I self harm a lot, too much not just cutting
I already mentioned stranglation
I never sleep, I can't not after some shit that happened, I'm scared of sleep, I'm scared of being late, I'm scared or running.
Nobody believed me about past stuff so why would they believe me now?
My counselor will think I'm lying anyway
Why are my arms so hairy? asks a girl at school, you won't believe me, 
What's with the dark circles, raccoon,? That you will never know.
Wanna know why I avoid people, I'm fucking scared of them, I don't do it because I'm Goth or whatever.
Wanna know why I clam up when walking past people, same reason.

I don't care about myself, I hate myself, why do I exist, this has been going on for over a year it all went wrong in February 2019 but that's another story.
Why do I watch too much TV and okay too many video games, to escape from life I guess.

Almost commited suicide multiple times, never done it though, I think about it a lot though,
Stop being edgy, I'm not 
Stop pretending grow up, I'm 16 stop
Stop being weird, no thanks easier said then done
Just be normal, what's normal?
Come and hang out with the family, no thanks I'd rather kill some computer generated Monsters
Stop staying in your room so much, well I don't feel safe downstairs
Stop being so paranoid nothing is going to happen, but stuff does happen????

I guess what I'm trying to say, is I can handle it myself, people have it way worse than me, they need help not me, I'm just being a little depressed and I'll get over it, I mean people are depressed for over 1 year and a half right?
I don't need to worry
But I need some advice, should I tell my counselor that I really don't need because everyone is depressed at some point, I'm probably not even depressed just sad or looking for an excuse to blame my ridiculous gaming habits on or something?

Please ignore I just needed to rant at 01:17am

10,"This void in me started young when my addict father left and my mother just couldn't take care of me. I went through my kid and teen years in survival mode caring and looking after myself. By some miracles I worked constantly and made my way through college, still without receiving the love I needed but taking comfort in a few close friendships and hope for the future. Some things along the way made me stumble majorly, a devastating first heartbreak, financial hardships, a violent assault that set me on an expensive and time consuming healing process. After that a string of romantic rejections that have me feeling disgusting despite people's reassurances and truly at a loss.

I try to fill this hole with self compassion, my passions, hope, god, non-romantic connections, all that stuff. But when I feel into it it's just as vast and empty as it's always been. I've poured myself into work, healing, therapy, finding positivity in bleak situations, trying to make a steady life for myself, being the best friend and kindest person I can be. And all that's been up to me and me only, to hold myself up and keep going. And I'm just sitting here at 22 looking at it all and seeing how no matter how hard I've tried, these things I accomplish and live for don't touch that void.

At times I've nearly been able to accept that I just might be a valuable person deserving of stability, love, and happiness but the reality of things makes that seem so illogical and silly. Being a kid was dark and scary but I still never anticipated that I'd be here as an adult just as unloved as I was then. I'd give anything to know what the love and stability other people feel from their families and partners is like, just for a day. What it's like to not think about if death would be better. I'm still in the fight, friends and coworkers etc don't fully know that this is what goes on in me because I seem like an optimist and peaceful person. I just get scared thinking about how many more years I can keep this up without getting a taste of what I've been missing all these years. I just needed to get this out in some form.",19Jul2020,1

18,"I'm 23 years old and i've been trying to teach myself skills so that I can get a white collar job and get out of my home state.

I have been learning Spanish and front-end web development for several months now, and for the first few I was so excited with the progress I was making. I learned new things every day. Now, it takes everything I have to FORCE myself to do the bare minimum in Spanish each day. I haven't done any web development in a month. 

Whenever I sit down and open Atom and start trying to think, my mind freaks out on me. It feels like it's constantly buzzing around, looking for anything, ANYTHING, else to do. If I press it, it becomes unbearable. I'll suddenly realize i've spent the past half hour staring at my ceiling, and hate myself for wasting so much time. But I just can  not  focus.

This kind of feeling extends to just about everything that isn't new to me. My most loved new video games will become completely dis-interesting after a week or two. Book series, tv, podcasts, hobbies, everything I like becomes boring and pointless and I start to hate the very idea of focusing on it.

Weekends off work are the worst times. I have the buzzing feeling almost nonstop, aware I need to be doing SOMETHING with my time but being sick at the very idea of trying to do anything. Staring at walls and fidgeting for hours is the easiest thing I can do.

TW: suicide 

Three years ago I was at my lowest point, I attempted suicide and was put on a 5150 hold. For a really long time I was ashamed and boy, did my dad make me feel it. My family holds a huge stigma on mental health and some things they believed carried on to me for a time. I was scared to go to therapy and I didn’t wanna tell some stranger the deepest parts of me.  

Well three years have passed, and I have finally decided to go to therapy. Although it is long overdue, I am definitely proud of myself for making this decision. This year I left a toxic relationship and I’m finally taking the steps to take care of myself. I’m looking forward to understanding myself better and hopefully becoming the best version of myself :)",19Jul2020,1
22,"I'll start off by saying I'm pretty sure I'm not suicidal. I've just felt the urge to know, if I ever DID want to, what i would do. 

My mental health has never been great. I dont remember a time in my life where I was mentally healthy, which tbh is expected for someone with my backround. I've always hated myself, I've always felt inadequate, I've never had anyone I felt I could talk to. Honestly I thought I'd gotten over it till quarinteen started. 

I havent so much as touched anyone, even like a pat on the shoulder, in months. Before, the thought of human contact made my skin crawl. I hadn't hugged my parents in 6 years and I'm still too young to move out. But now I feel like I'm missing something, even though i still cant stand the idea of touching someone. 

My anxiety has shot through the roof. I spend every waking moment thinking about the school work I'm missing out on. I want to get into a top university, and as someone with a learning disability- I know I wont be wanted there. It's all A* or it's not happening and I was on track before quarinteen but now??? I havent done work in a month, because every time I try it's like I cant breath.

My relatives are dropping like flies. I never thought my nans alcoholism would catch up to her for some reason- I didnt even really like her- but now she has weeks left and I dont know how to feel. 

I'm sick of listening to my mum screaming. She has PTSD, I know she cant help it. But I hate existing when it happens. 

I hate living with my brother. Hes acting nice now, but he's done that before. He still refuses to apologise for the times he'd trigger public panick attacks for his own amusement- so he and his friends, hell and my friends too, could watch and laugh. I hate that I have to play buddy buddy with him. I hate that I like his personality when he isnt trying to make me feel like shit. I hate that he used to threaten me and try to smash my door down and now I cant even leave the house to get away from him. How am I being hard on him? I hate living like this.

I tried to call my doctor. I hate those fucking vultures, all they've ever done is call me a liar and make my family suffer. I havent been in years. I wanted to put a name to what was going on with me so everyone would leave me alone about it. But I couldnt go through with it.

I can barely work up the energy to shower or brush my teeth anymore. I feel disgusting.

And then a couple days ago. I started researching painless methods of suicide. I researched where I could get the chemicals. I looked at prices and realised i had the money in my account. I fantasised about how people would react, if they'd be relieved or even notice, like suicide wasnt fucking serious. I feel sick knowing that I thought about it like it was some far off dream, when I know that suicide hurts people in the very distant way we know something is true despite never experiencing it.

But I keep thinking about it. 

I dont think i could go through with it. I've never had the balls to do big things like that- most days I cant even go near a spider. That's why I dont think I'm suicidal.

I dont think im suicidal, but I cant stop thinking about it. 

I think about it in the same compulsive way I think about school work. I cant get it out of my head.

I keep thinking about the time my dad called suicidal people selfish. Me and my mum had a go at him for it, but I cant stop thinking about it.

I dont even know why I researched it. But I did. I dont know what to do anymore. 

I cant trust my doctors. I cant talk to my family. I cant put this shit on my friends when they cant help me- that would be fucking cruel. I dont know what to do. 

I hate living like this. I hate this. I got sick before quarinteen started, but couldnt get tested for covid because of where I lived. I spent the whole time wondering what would happen if i never woke up.

Every guy I would talk to was so sweet at first but as soon as they didn't get nudes or sex they showed their true colors. It was wearing me down and I was getting more desperate for a relationship. All that I wanted was someone who I could talk to and trust, who I could hangout with and be comfortable with. Eventually I found a guy, we started dating and it was perfect. I finally felt happy and at peace for the time we were together. It felt like a weight was off of my chest. And after only a month we broke up. Its a long story but essentially he has to move and both of us agreed that we can't do long distance. This happened last night and I feel like I'm already falling back into my depression.

30,"Context: I've always had a pretty shitty relationship with my parents and that has caused me to struggle with my mental health (and some physical issues steaming from it) pretty much forever.
By 14 I knew that I wanted them out of my life (since I  knew they wouldn't change) and then I kinda made a life plan for myself.
I planned on studying a lot, getting into a good university, getting a job and financially independent (at the time I also wanted to move abroad after university but that doesn't seem to be a possibility as early as I thought), cutting ties with my parents and now that I, theoretically, would have the time, space and money, I would start therapy to fix my mental health.

I'm not 14 anymore.

I just turned 21 and so far, my plan has gone pretty good. I've worked my ass off and I still do to try to get a good job after university but the whole ""I would have the time, space and money"" thing doesn't seem as likely.
I now know what a time commitment is required to get any of the jobs I could/want to get and money won't be that great for awhile (unemployment rates are and have been high for awhile, so salaries aren't  great) and while working I would have to pursue and study for other professional certifications.

So do you think that my whole plan has a chance to somewhat work out or has this whole thing been an elaborate distraction that I created for myself?

My mental health has been pretty bad my entire life but I have always been ""high functioning"", in the sense that to the outside world I seem to be doing great in life and noone knows how bad it's been (depression,  anxiety, eating disorders, suicidal thoughts).",19Jul2020,1
31,"Those are just excuses, rationalizations for aberrant self pleasure practices. I DO NOT SEEK VISUAL KIDDIE PORN. Mostly because im terrified I will be aroused. And because of the legal hazard. I KNOW raping a minor is wrong. I'm not even remotely attracted to any of the kids I see around me. They piss me off, they scare me, I practically loath kids because that is one of the ways I do to not develop my fetish/illness enjoyment of erotica with underage kids into a full on pedophilia. I feel so alone sometimes. I don't even want to have kids given this aberration. There were a few times where innocent touch contact with kids would turn me on. And that clued me in to this dangerous. It's just that alone, in my room at night. Every time without fail. I would try to masturbate to regular porn. And it just doesn't cut it. Unless I've not been doing for a while. So I search just just three words that are not that flaggable. Dirty sex stories. And I would land on a compendium of Spanish language erotica stories. Many adult themed. But a good number about minors.
How did this get started? I was, abused (sort of, it's a fuzzy memory) as a kid. And one day I found a story that was basically what I remembered happened to me. More or less. And I read the entire thing. It was from the childs POV so I was not that worried about it. It felt, empowering. A mixture of adult sexual lust, seizing an old memory of something that was painful. and sort of taking control of the memory in my imagination. I was no longer a hapless victim, but a person enjoying it. At the time I found it weird but what the hell you take the good with the bad. And it helped me unpack My sexual trauma just a bit better. The years went by, I was on a heavy cocktail of anti depressants and anti-anxiety pills. And My dad's suicide basically shut off my ability to enjoy masturbation. Weak orgasms. Inability to stay up. And so on made it difficult to find sexual pleasure. It was the dirty tabboo porn that made me orgasm. Brother on sister. Dad and daughter. Dad and son. Son and mother. You know weird shit like that. At one point the website where my favorite story was posted. The one where I related to the victim got taken down. When Incest porn became boring I looked for other taboo porn. A three year affair ended up making me more lenient with what I allowed myself to read. My 14 year old cousin moved to my city. And without realizing it I was hitting on him. I was attracted to his youthful body and so on. So I could be a pedo/ehebophile. The kid sort of got the vibe and thank God he put distance from me. So that is the background. It's horrible, illegal, wrong, disgusting. But it's the only thing that gets me off. On a intellectual level I want to stop, I know I should. I feel self loathing. Alone. Disgusted at myself. But I can't stop...on a primal level, the need to get aroused. To enjoy my orgasms make me continue reading this. I try to keep the damage to a minimum. Don't seek out kiddie porn. Don't encourage trade of erotica content. And maintain a safe distance from minors. 
I don't think I could ever do what I read in the stories. It's honestly not plausible. The stories bend reality in an a cruel stupid way.  The kids only feel pleasure. They act like grown sexually developed person's. The scenarios are stupid. Hence why I said Lolita/o on my title. It's a fantasy that I can never translate to reality and that is why I have a difficult time stopping myself from reading this.

I’ve been in love for 6 years, and best friends with this person for that time. We dated in highschool and holy, I was over the moon. Happiest I’ve ever been. Then things fell apart and I moved away. Half a year ago, I returned to my hometown and continued being good friends with this person.

I’ve tried many things. I went to college, started a career, and have been quite successful. But none of it matters to me.

38,"Very frequently, I will hear noises in my head. I'm hesitant to call it ""hearing"" because it doesn't feel like that at all --it's more like a second train of thought that I can't control. Like when you try really hard to imagine a certain sound in your head, you can register what it's supposed to sound like, but it doesn't feel like hearing at all.-- It's always like a short snippet of audio played on an endless loop. A few that I've had before have been the clicking of a pen, sounds of cats meowing, and song lyrics. By far, the one I get the most is just screaming. The voices I hear screaming never say anything and I never feel like something is trying to communicate with me. It's just like on TV or in movies when they try to show what Hell is like; dozens of voices crying out in a horrible, tortured agony.  
It started in my earlier high school years, and I've always assumed it was just a product of having an overactive mind or a way of creating background noise when pure silence would make me too uncomfortable. Although, in retrospect, it may have been a stress response. I was being treated for cancer the years before high school, so I went almost straight from doing no work at all to full days of school with several honors and AP classes. In my Junior year, my course load was especially heavy and I decided to prioritize school over my health, depriving myself of sleep to have more time for studying and regularly dividing maybe 2 or 3 days of sleep across an entire week.  
Strange enough, I liked the noises. They filled the silence and when I was bored or understimulated, I would often find myself trying to start them on purpose. But it's been a few years now-- I turn 19 in a couple of weeks-- and sometimes the screaming will fill my whole head so loud that I can't focus or sleep. Often I can make it go away by trying to fill my consciousness with so many other distractions that I forget about it, but sometimes not. Do these sound like hallucinations? If I normally can control it well enough on my own, should I try and seek help?  
For context, I am already clinically diagnosed with GAD, OCD, chronic depression, and Tourette's Syndrome. No one in my family has any diagnoses, but I can't imagine any of them ever seeking treatment, and I suspect a great number of my relatives suffer from BPD.",19Jul2020,4
39,"I am 18 years old now, and I was diagnosed with OCD and anxiety when I was in middle school. I used to see a psychiatrist and was medicated, but my parents are not big believers in mental issues or therapy, so once my tics got better (or maybe just less noticeable), they stopped taking me and stopped paying for doctor visits and my prescription.

By now, most of the time, I've learned to work around my OCD. It does affect me on a daily basis and there are things I feel like I have to do, usually in certain numbers or a certain amount of times until it feels right (for example I felt like I had to title this post with 5 words, I have to touch / step on everything I touch / step on with both hands or both feet, etc.) Usually stupid, little stuff like that.

I have never been able to have sex with any of the guys I've dated, even in a multiple year long, very trusting relationship, because I have an intense fear or getting pregnant and ruining my life. Idk if that has to do with my OCD or not.

About 6 weeks ago, I got myself into a situation where there is a risk for pregnancy, although there was no intercourse. Of course, I immediately thought I was certainly going to get pregnant from this, especially because I was not on birth control. I took plan B a few days later and even booked a $1000 emergency IUD insertion as emergency contraception, but my mom convinced me it was not worth it for the small risk at hand, so I cancelled it and did not go (I had IMMEDIATE REGRET).

My period is now WEEKS late and I have been having sooo many pregnancy symptoms, which doc and everyone else suggest may be due to the insane amount of hormones I put into my body with the plan B, and I started on a hormonal birth control pill a few weeks after the incident. I cannot listen to reason, and everything going on with my body I take to be a sure sign of pregnancy.

I have had probably 20 home pregnancy tests in the past month, all negative. I had a negative blood test at the gynecologist. I even went to another doctor and had a high sensitivity urine test and an ultrasound that showed nothing in my uterus 5 weeks after the incident.

The guy isn't in the picture anymore because he thinks I'm crazy for thinking there's even a possibility after so many negative tests, and yeah that is honestly understandable. I have spent hundreds of dollars of both mine and my parents' money trying to reassure myself, and clearly, nothing works because I am still sure I am pregnant, and don't believe any of the tests. And I'm really not dumb, I realize how absolutely ridiculous I sound.

This is consuming my life. This is my last summer before I go to college, and I need to be getting ready to go, but I can't stop thinking about the potential of pregnancy for one second to think about preparing. All I do is work, and even when I'm not and do try to do something like hang out with friends, this is all I think about, and I always am doing tics, because if I don't, I will surely be pregnant.

Idk for sure what my purpose of posting this is. Can anyone give me some advice to stop overthinking and completely obsessing over this? Or maybe someone can relate to this in a way, idk. I just cannot take this feeling anymore. I want my life back.",19Jul2020,1
40,"Between the ages of 14-22, I went through a long long spell. I remember my life - very isolated, no social support, extremely lonely, pessimist, nihilist, outcast, insomniac, no appetite, lack of interest, waiting for the day to end and looking for life to be over. 
Then, life changed for the better. Sure i have other problems now. But the above mentioned problems just vanished. And now I'm left feeling like an imposter in the mental health community. I don't even remember what those days felt like. I remember what i went through, but I can't relate anymore. Almost felt cheated because they took away all of my youth and teenage years.

Anyone else? Can someone throw some light on this?",19Jul2020,1

It always makes me feel bad because I know that I've dealt with it, I've put it behind me, and I'm healed. It's only verbal, if I'm texting it or writing it out I don't have the same reaction.

I recently convinced her to go to therapy. She’s been to 3 sessions so far and it seems as if it’s helping, but I want to know what I** can do. I hate just putting everything on the counselor. 

How can I support her? How can I make this easier for her? Everything is bottled up and she refuses to let it out until it gets to suicide threats. I don’t know what to do besides ask for advice on here. No one I know has experienced anything like this. Her attitude towards me is awful 90% of the time and I’m trying to be encouraging to her and positive, but it’s hard when she is coming at me constantly. What do I do? Let her take it out on me?

I don't want to talk to my boyfriend about that either, because I feel like I've been complaining a lot to him lately.

Hello all,

Ive been talking to this girl for 6 months. Its not a relationship so far because we’re talking long distance and we both agreed to meet before deciding what to do. Unfortunately covid happened and I couldn’t travel. I can’t travel for sometime. Her moving here to be with me (immigration) or i going there isn’t really an issue.

The real issue is something I’ve been hiding from her and tbh from everyone (family, friends etc). I have been in a weird headspace for almost a year now. Im in the process of signing up for therapy and basically just get help because im tired. I almost feel suicidal (too scared to do anything) and ive kept this away from her, my family and friends. But im at a breaking point, where im just done. Until few months ago, i was pretty happy talking to her until i was just wasn’t. I’m not expressive anymore, I sometimes tend to ignore her texts and calls too.

She’s perfect and she’s just amazing. But something just doesn’t click in me anymore. I’m in constant fear of ruining everything for her, and for everyone i know. I just dont know what to do anymore.

Part of me wants to stay put, and just hope everything will be okay and I’ll fall in love again. But there is another part in me, who wants me to come clean, let her know of my mental health and basically to not take her on a journey where im just dealing with issues. Part of me wants to let go because she deserves someone who’s right in the head.

The only thing that makes sense in my life is my job. But i managed to somehow convinced myself to reach out for therapy and man it took a lot of strength. 

What should i do?",19Jul2020,1

53,"***TRIGGER WARNING***
Self harm, suicidal tendencies, rape, coercion

I have been having a tough time dealing with everything lately. 

Background: 19yo Female, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ptsd. 

I’ve been showing signs of depression since I was seven years old. I am still living in my abusive parents household. I flunked out of college after being forced to  go back to school by my parents and manipulated when I was not ready. I came off of some medication (ability) last September due to a conflict of medication that I needed for wisdom teeth removal surgery, realized my friends all were manipulative assholes and I cut them off. I’ve been threatened, stalked, my room in my parents house has been broken into numerous times, and I’m scared for my life. I got a job to afford health insurance that is free as long as I make $13,000 this year and because of the global pandemic I’ve not even made half that. I got a 30% pay cut, was moved to another position that works night shift, and my mental state that was stable has come crashing down. I’m trying to find another job, trying to make enough money to leave my abusive household, all this stress is causing my ptsd to go crazy to the point I can’t tell who to trust or not, there’s times that I’ll be laying in bed with my extremely loving and supportive boyfriend and think that he is one of my past abusers and start having panic attacks. My job requires me to work from 11pm to 7am alone. I am the only employee here and I’m terrified every night. I was raped at work at a previous job and I cannot even leave the office without fearing for my life. Today I had a complete breakdown sobbing uncontrollably at my boyfriends house over something little that just happened to be the last straw for me holding it together. I started shaking uncontrollably and couldn’t reason at all while sobbing. When I get upset I am physically unable to speak and my throat completely tightens. I couldn’t stop thinking about burning myself and was barely able to ask my boyfriend to get any knives out of his room immediately before continuing to sob uncontrollably. I began cutting in the seventh grade and attempted to slit my wrists in 11th grade and was involuntarily admitted for 5 days in the ER waiting for a bed in the psychiatric facility and 9 days in facility after that. I feel so useless, I feel so scared and sad and lonely. The only support I have is my boyfriend and a friend that I have known forever it only started talking to regularly during the pandemic in a desperate attempt to make friends after I lost mine.",19Jul2020,1
54,"I feel like I am very sick and I don't know what to do.

Background: depression and anxiety from childhood (no trauma/trigger), PTSD (sexual trauma) diagnosed around 12 but didn't flare up until 20, Autism and ARFID diagnoses at 21 (now). Hospitalizations at 17 (in ward) and 19 (released without ward time) both from self inflicted wounds.

Severe history of escapist tendencies never acknowledged. Attempting to avoid becoming Selectively Mute. Never learned life skills normal adults should have and can't hold down a full time job.

Lately I sleep well into the afternoons just so I can dream longer about people and situations that I cherish but don't exist. I cry so much when I'm awake. I have one meal a day. I too often wish that if I can bring myself to die, I'd be able to start over.

58,hi! I’m a 15 year old girl with a depression disorder and some anxiety. I didn’t know where to go so I came here. recently I’ve been having reoccurring thoughts about my ex. we used to have sex often but there was one or two instances where he didn’t stop and continued to have sex . I begged him and started crying but he still didn’t stop. I don’t know why he didn’t but maybe it was because he couldn’t see me ? I feel uncomfortable calling him my rapist because I think that’s a heavy word. but sometimes certain words trigger me. he was my first and I thought he really loved me. but he would show me his cuts and threaten to kill himself all the time and I would have to talk him down. though the point of this was to ask... I don’t know if I really have trauma or if I’m just being sensitive I mean a lot of people have it worst. I just can’t seem to stop crying whenever a few words are mentioned. I feel sick.,19Jul2020,1

Uhm so basically for the past couple years I e been really having a hard time like focusing or even like doing simple tasks like I’ll be doing something important and in the middle of me doing this action I’ll like end up either like drifting off in a day dream or just like drift off completely and when I come back I don’t remember anything I’ve been doing.

Like with driving for instance I’m so scared to get behind a wheel cause i end up day dreaming like a lot and sometimes I don’t even realize I’m day dreaming until it’s too late and I’m scared what if this like happens when I’m driving or something? And the past year or two I think? I’ve been forgetting like a lot even if it’s something I just talked about with someone I’ll forget and repeat myself, or even during the middle of a sentence I’ll forget my train a thought and will completely forget what I was even saying and this happens regularly. 

And then lately I’m not sure if it’s because everything that’s going on I’m just so paranoid, like scared of everything for no reason and it’s starting to get really overwhelming for me and honestly I want to get help. I’m just not sure if these are reasons to get help? Or is this just kinda what people just go through? And if I was to get help how would I go about it?

67,"I don’t have a reddit account, so I’m typing this out on my bf’s account. He recommended it to tell our story and to let me vent about it. I am 19F. He is 25M.

TLDR: my family gave me the choice of being with them or my current boyfriend and I chose him. Choosing him lead to me breaking my ankle on a chicken wire fence and a no contact order on them, as well as harassment charges and possible slander.

STORY: This all started when I was living with my boyfriend. My mom who is 39, started brainwashing me and manipulating me into moving back home for college. As to which I did, during the moving out process she talked shit on my boyfriends name along with a bunch of lies and bullshit about our relationship which she also told the rest of our family to make them not like him anymore. So a few days go by and she started inviting my ex over to hang out because she wanted him and I to get together. I told my boyfriend this so he was well aware of the situation along with wanting him to pick me up. He pulled up and parked in the road not even on property or even close to it. My ex yelled at my mom saying how he was here to get me. While I was trying to leave my mom kept putting her hands on me while not allowing me to leave the house until I finally broke free and ran outside to my boyfriends car. Where my mom followed screaming at us to get off her property and how we aren’t allowed on the street and all that. She then went and got my dad to come outside as to which he threatened to kill us both and for me to never come back. I went in the house to make sure he couldn’t get any weapons and my boyfriend drove off to the local police station to have them come out to “get his stuff”. My best friend then came over to get me and a bag of clothes for a week then took me over to his house. I then stayed there for the night because I felt unsafe at my parents. The next day I went home because my mom wanted to go to the beach and my ex wanted me to sign papers for a no contact order. As to which I refused to sign because I wanted to take him to court (abuse and rape when I moved back in, that my mom didn’t believe me about). Later that day my family and I went to the beach and my mom invited my ex to meet us there. Well right as we were leaving my mom started screaming at me which lead to my ex to offer me a ride back to their house so I wouldn’t be screamed at the whole hour ride home. Well I passed out in his car which lead to him going through my phone and him taking a video of me sleeping saying he fucked me and shit then sent it to my boyfriend. I woke up 40 min after being parked in the road at my parents. I walk in and my mom is going off on me so I went to my neighbors house and got changed there while texting my boyfriend to meet me down the street to pick me up to get me away from her. I eventually went back to my parents to eat and I went out back to leave but my ex wanted to fight him so I tried to stop him and he threw me to the ground and walked out front to get my dad. I ran after to make sure my mom wasn’t gonna go back there also. Well she tried to pull me back into the house along with hitting me and pulling my hair. I eventually broke free and ran for my life through the back yard. I went to jump her make shift chicken wire fence and when I landed over it I completely shattered my ankle and had to put it back in place until cops and EMS should up. My mother then continued to try to take my phone from me and accused me of lying and faking my injury. Police forced her away from me while EMS got me in a air cast and in the ambulance. I got transported to ER where I had a team of nurses and doctors come in to get a total of 34 xrays along with two numbing injections into my ankle before the reset. The numbing did not start working until after they reset my ankle. And mind y’all while this is all going on my family never came to visit me I had to do this all with my boyfriend. After the doctor reset my ankle I got a 15-20 pound splint on. Along with percs as my pain prescription, they do absolutely nothing for me. I had to go back to the ER yesterday due to pain and the splint being too tight. Which leads me to right now, back in the ER with the same issues but much worse and my family wants nothing to do with me and blocked me on everything and I cannot go get my stuff. After all of this happened, they tried to blame me and say it was my fault, then blame him with the same thing.",19Jul2020,1

69,"I live in Alberta Canada, I'm 23F and I've been suspecting for a while that I may be bipolar and displaying alot of the obvious symptoms. Last year I survived a car crash and was off work for 3 months recovering, and just last May I was diagnosed with cancer, chemo put me in remission, but I lost all of my hair and alot of my sanity. I never got counseling for either of these situations because I felt I was weak and pathetic if I did. I am now realizing that maybe I've been affected mentally more than I thought, but last time I got counseling for anything my mom freaked out and said she felt betrayed by me seeing a therapist. Bipolar disorder does run in my family which is why I suspect as well. I don't want to anger my mom, but I also don't want to feel like this anymore (I often feel like I don't belong with my family anymore, and I don't want to burden my friends with my presence, and it's affecting my relationship with my boyfriend when I'm constantly switching from depressed to over excited for no reason! I hate feeling like this!)

The issue is that I can't get and counseling or advice from anyone at the moment and it's not like I'm able to take medication so I'm just walking blindly and trying to deal with myself which isn't going well. The truth is I've been feeling incredibly unmotivated for the past couple of years and whatever I've been feeling just multiplied recently into a complete shutdown. I've been feeling depressed (I don't have depression I'm just feeling depressed). I'm not sure how to get myself to do things or be productive or make myself feel better so I wanted to ask anybody with experience with a doctor or just anybody who found things that made them feel better to let me know what might help until I can go see someone. I just feel trapped and I'm so clueless. I used to be able to just get by and do the minimum amount of work but now I can't do anything. The three conditions I'm most afraid of having would be ADHD, Depression, and Bipolar disorder but I won't know for sure if I have any one of these until I'm diagnosed.

75,"My issues began when I was a sophomore. Around the time I turned 16 years old. There were two things in my life at the time that were upsetting or difficult for me. The first being that I had been injured which prevented me from successfully playing soccer. The second being that I was having difficulties with the social aspects of high school at the time. I couldn’t make friends and I was having trouble keeping the ones I had. I think I blamed it on myself and this turned into depression.

I held my issues inside and my problems got worse. My only relief was video games. When I played I felt like I didn’t have to deal with all the shitty stuff going on. 

I went on like this all the way up until quarantine. I tried to “function” by exercising, socializing, and doing school work hoping that it would help me feel better. It didn’t. My problems continued to developer. 

Over this time I began to lose touch with myself and the world. I don’t really identify with my body any more. I’ve been told I’m “depersonalized.” It’s like I’m not real and nothing else is real it’s just “me” and my thoughts in the void. This has been a very long term problem and I began to notice it pretty quickly after my problems began as a 16 year old if I remember correctly.

I asked my parents for help and they got me to see a therapist and my doctor. The therapy hasn’t helped. My doctor has prescribed two antidepressants and an anti anxiety med and I have noticed no change. 

In my current state I’m not really “living” I’m more “existing.” I spend almost all of my days in my bed on my phone. It has been this way since quarantine began. I feel more connected to myself and overall better when I’m in my cacoon. When I leave and enter the real world I begin to feel an unpleasant emptiness followed by me disconnecting even more from myself and the world than I already am in my cacoon. It’s overall intolerable. It’s like nothing feels good or has any substance and on top of that it doesn’t feel real. There are some other things which I think I over analyze. In the past I’ve been convinced I had BPD which led me to suicidal thoughts. 

I’ve had thoughts of killing myself two times. The first time when I convince myself I had BPD. I fit some of the criteria and I’ve noticed that I’m overly empathetic and horny right now. I’m passed these thoughts, however in the recent few days the thoughts of death have returned because this cycle feels endless and I’m exhausted. I’m losing hope.

However, three days ago I began attending a partial hospitalization program. I hate the group therapy because it makes me feel really fucking disconnected and shitty. Also it’s hard for me to get any use out of it when I feel like I don’t exist. However I’ve been prescribed a new med I don’t remember what it is called but my psychiatrist said it helps bring you back to reality. Also she gave me a benzodiazepine I forget the specific name. She told me that if I keep going in my current state it could turn into psychosis. 

Anyways it’s extremely intolerable to leave my bedroom and I haven’t seen movement in a positive direction in terms of my mental health since my problems began. I’m losing hope and could really use some guidance. Thanks so much for reading if you made it this far. It means the world. :)",19Jul2020,1
76,"to start, im diagnosed with bipolar 2, panic disorder, ptsd, and ocd.

im starting to genuinely believe that nothing is real. my mind is drawing connections between random shit that im sure is supposed to just be a joke and that, or people trying to make an arg, or stuff like that. i partially convince myself theyre signs.

obviously i havent fully lost it. but im not sure at this point. i used to think of it just occasionally, as a ""what if"" scenario, but now i full on am freaking out over the concept of nothing being real. i think about it every day, and i can barely breathe when i do. i dont know what im expecting. comfort from my boyfriend, who is the only person ive really told in depth, helps kinda but in the end all i can think is ""if this isnt real, thats what hed say anyways.""

i dont know what i expect. honestly, it changed from a thought to an obsession when i did my first high dose of shrooms and had a god awful trip. i can go into more detail if itll help someone give advice, but basically i believed that i was a robot in a situation similar to westworld. i dont know what i believe anymore. i dont know how to heal. i dont want to be insane.

i really need advice on how i can fix this. im medicated, on 50 mg of lamictal and ativan. i have a therapist now, but ive only been to one session. i need a way to fix this outside of those, something i can do now. im terrified of everything.

He was found In his barracks and has been transferred to a psychiatric ward where we are not allowed to have any contact with him bc of covid not any information or details bc of privacy policies. I was hoping I can get some help, guidance, or advice on how I can approach this. How can I be the best possible sister for him when he gets back. I know his world must be different now and I know life must feel more difficult for him. I just want to be able to support and help him get better but I don’t know how I can approach him, or things I should say. I come from a very Mexican traditional family where mental health doesn’t “exist”. He has always been very detached since we were children, and never expressed his emotions so I do not want to overwhelm with emotions since I know it makes him uncomfortable. Today we found his suicide note. In one portion he stated “it feels surreal that I actually went through with this. I dunno, it’s nobody’s fault.... I’m just .... very tired I guess”. please if someone can help me I would appreciate it. I just want to be able to be there for my brother the best I can when he comes back.

82,"So I am 25 yo IT professional who earns decent for his age. I always thought i m working too hard but things have gone worse Since lockdown started. I have been on working spree and would work for atleast 12 hours day sometimes it would go as much as 15 and still this wouldn't stop me going to Udemy or coursea to learn some new tech to keep up with everyone. This cut throttling corporate race has made me so reckless that i would work around 90+ hours a week and still try to go and learn new technologies. I am always on course to impress my managers so I can get more projects and could learn more.
I believe this has severely affected my mental and physical health as we all stuck home and working from home. 
I haven't done much in past 3-4 months other than working and learning and I don't wanna stop. I always have that fear in mind of falling behind of my collgues.
Continuously thinking about work. Can't even concentrate while watching movie or listning music as work is always in my head. :/

85,"to preface this, i am a 20 year old girl with depression, half-diagnosed adhd, and an unspecified anxiety disorder that has never been properly treated or explained to me. i’m on wellbutrin, adderall, propranolol, and junel fe. 

so last year, my mom died, kind of unexpectedly. she had stage four lung cancer, but had literally JUST been told the day before she died that her condition was improving. she hemmoraged while i was at a dance rehearsal, and my grandpa and sister found her body in the driveway. 

immediately, i felt guilty and started blaming myself for her death. i began blaming it on me not saying i love you that day, or me rushing out of the house too quickly and barely speaking to her, or even the numerous times i had accidentally stepped on a crack (i avoided them because i convinced myself the superstition was real and i gave her bone cancer in her spine from stepping on one). 

anyways, my (already shitty) mental state worsened, i made bad decisions involving medication multiple times, gained weight, then lost weight and am now slightly underweight. to top it all off, my anxiety has gotten worse and i think ive started to develop some compulsions to deal with it. 

because of this, i have obsessively researched ocd and am now convinced that i have it or am developing it. 

for the longest time i can remember, ive had intense intrusive thoughts about my family dying, mainly focused on my mom. well, the intrusive thoughts actually happened, and now they have shifted onto my grandpa (and my little sister kinda). 

when i was younger, about three, i started to bang my head on the wall and avoided staying at my grandpas house (due to a dream about my mom dying while i slept there) to deal with these thoughts. then at nine, i slept on the couch near the front door to stop people from breaking in and killing my family. i also slept with at least seven thick blankets year round so no one could stab me. i then thought people were watching me and would check for hidden cameras and barely slept. 

i don’t remember if i had any of these behaviors during high school, besides nail biting and skin picking. i did begin to obsess over my mental and physical health in sixth grade, and constantly researched illnesses and convinced myself that i had them. this behavior has not stopped and i do it constantly. 

now, i obsess over my grandpa (and my sister) dying. at any moment, i am convinced he is dead or severely injured. about every 5-20 minutes, i text him and ping his phone on find my iphone. if he doesn’t immediately answer, i start to freak out and begin to spam him “hi” over and over, call him, ping him, and sometimes i will drive over there to make sure he’s alive. i do this almost all the time, during work, in the middle of the night, out in public. it never stops. 

i also reassurance seek constantly, and will ask him, my friends, and my sister questions to see if they think i have something wrong with me. sometimes i just tell them to tell me that i’m completely normal. that never helps but i cant stop doing it. 

in the past month, whenever i get anxious or stressed out, i repeatedly count to eight in my head, sometimes out loud if it’s really bad. i do this almost constantly since i’m never relaxed. the past week, i began counting my steps in multiples of eights and started coordinating my actions to fall on one of the numbers. 

even with all of this, there’s a part of me that believes i’m faking everything for attention, or that i don’t have ocd, or anything wrong and that i’m making myself have these thoughts and compulsions. logically, i know this isn’t true (i also know none of my intrusive thoughts are real), but there’s a part of me that is convinced. 

i’m working on finding a competent psychologist to see for these problems, but i’m having trouble (i’m extremely picky and can’t find one i’m 100% fine with). i just need to know that i’m not going crazy or faking anything, and that i actually do need to get help. 

tl;dr: my mothers death seems to have triggered some ocd-like behaviors and worsened anxiety. i’ve had intrusive thoughts my entire life, and have done various compulsions to deal with them. i am now convinced that i have ocd, but also think i am making it up. basically i’m confused and scared.",19Jul2020,1

93,"I’ve struggled with repressing my emotions for a long time, and naturally they eventually started bubbling back up because of small things, causing me to snap at the slightest disturbance.

Earlier today I punched myself in the head because I lost at board game in a video game, and I was upset with the AI being “too” smart. I felt like breaking things, but didn’t want to, so I took it out on myself. This isn’t the first time this has happened, but for the first time, it really hurt.

Shortly after I went downstairs to say goodnight, and I felt like talking to them about what I did. That’s something I’ve never felt before, and I was scared. After saying goodnight, I went upstairs and thought about what to do. Almost on impulse I just sent a text to my dad, asking to have a serious, uncomfortable conversation, even though I feel like burden when I ask for things. Even help. We had a conversation about it, and it felt good despite the fact that more emotions poured from my face.

       For the past month I have jumped some hurtles. I had to cut off my toxic abusive parents after they accused my boyfriend of two years of abusing me. He took me in after they kicked me out, after two months of living with them, after leaving an mentally abusive ex. The only reason I was living with the ex was because they kicked me out of my home with them, at twenty while I was going to college for my nursing degree; and the only reason she mentioned abuse was because I mentioned my younger sister who still lives at home with depression because my parents were being are still abusive. I could not the through to my mother at any respectful angle so I removed myself from that group of people that call themselves my family. I feel like I am finally free to pursue my dreams in the present instead of being stuck in the past with the pain and trauma of being isolated and stunted at every level of development. It wasn't until I had the mental help of my long time boyfriend who encourages me everyday to be better and demand more for myself in life. 


I am so ready to just be happy with not being beaten that I let everyone run all over me. I finally stood up for myself at work because I know I deserve basic respect in the workplace, and will no longer accept less than that. I bought myself a reasonable car that I can feel good driving and don't have to worry about it dying on me. Little by little I'm chipping away at the stresses that keep me from focusing on the future. 

None of this would have happened without the help of licenced mental health specialist that work hard everyday during this hard time. So thank you.",19Jul2020,5

Because of this it usually takes over an hour to fall asleep, and it's just a terrible feeling.

98,"(16M) I’ve been feeling very weird lately. I’ve been thinking of the my past and noticed that I used to have delusions, such as “Capgras Delusion” and “The Truman Show Delusion” when I was younger (like 8 or 9 years old). Ten months ago I had “Fregoli Delusion”. I didn’t know that they were delusions up until June (this year). Last year (in March) I experienced auditory hallucinations. I went to a psychologist and I eventually got better. The main reason I had these hallucinations was probably due to stress/anxiety (according to the psychologist). Then they went away. Still, I have a lot of symptoms and I don’t know if this is bad or not:
* I dissociate a lot. If I’m alone, I’m generally dissociating. I’ve had this since I was little (don’t know specifically when). If I’m having a meal with my friends and they’re not talking to me, I dissociate. (It’s like, I go back into my mind and everything gets blurry). I tend to do things without thinking/effort during this time. I don’t sense taste nor smell when I’m dissociating.
* I forget about things I’ve just said/heard. My parents might ask me “What do you want for dinner” and I’ll respond, but I immediately forget what I said and what the question was. 
* If I’m waking alone, or in the backseat of the car, I forget what happened during the journey. I sometimes remember the way I went, but I don’t remember what I was doing/thinking during that time.
* I talk to people that are not real. I imagine as if people were right next to me and my reactions are as if that was actually happen. I don’t see them, but I act as if they were there and as if they were reacting.
* I have a lot of Deja Vu. It’s weird... I do not even know if you can call it Deja Vu or not. It’s like, I got to a place I have never been. For the first minute or so, it seems unfamiliar. However, after that, it seems as I have already been there more than once. 
* Ambivalence. I generally have two or more contrasting ideas. E.g. free-will: one side of me agrees that we have free-will; however, the other doesn’t. 
Now, the part I guess it’s most difficult to explain. I have rapid mood swings. But it’s not just a “mood swing”; it’s like a personality shift. I feel like it’s three different states. It’s not different identities, but three different personalities. I gave them names. We have Mind, Heart and Soul. Mind is selfish, confident and a little bit more out-going. Heart is kinda the opposite: extremely selfless, low self-confidence, feels dependent on others and prefers staying in rather than going to a party. Soul is the mixture of both, the one I’m most of the time. Mind gets nervous with tests/exams and things related to my future career, while Heart gets stressed out in social events. Then we also have lack of empathy: Mind doesn’t have much empathy for others while Heart cares a little bit more. Mind doesn’t feel emotions such as sadness. (Btw, Mind Heart and Soul is like a gradient, and it’s not like “now I’m this, then I’m this”)
I’ve been having headaches and shortness of breath whenever I think of this. 

PS: sometimes when I look in the mirror I’m like “Is this really me?” while other times I’m like “I’m so beautiful!” It’s weird.

I’ve searched online and I show symptoms for schizophrenia (or some “schizo-“ disorder) and/or some sort of dissociative disorder.

If you have some knowledge on this, can you please help? I know I should go to a psychologist but before I do that, I would like to know what people think this is.

99,"Introduction to my self entitled vent post

Being a dude I guess, I don't talk about my issues. Hell, for a while I never really thought they were real, I thought they were just a product of my own weakness or whatever shitty excuse I used to keep from telling anyone. Last time I told anyone about my own problems online, it was met with that classic toxic internet who gives a shit attitude, and barely within a paragraph in I'm typing slower than a 120 year old senior citizen with rheumatoid arthritis. But honestly, I shouldn't give a shit, so I guess I won't. Read it or don't, god bless you if you do, don't blame you if you don't. It's my right to vent and your right to scroll right the fuck past and forget this post exists. So here's all the shit I should be complaining about to a therapist but can't because I'm too insecure to just fucking say something. All the shit that my pansy ass would much rather just complain about anonymously to a bunch of strangers who don't care. What the fuck ever dude

Family:

My parents divorced when I was 2. Don't remember it at all. By the time I was 3 my mom had gotten with who is now my stepdad. Barely talk to him and we live in the same house. My dad had a girlfriend and a daughter with her. As far as I understand, this girlfriend had her own issues. She said she was raped when she was young by her older brothers, from what I remember, and she would in one way or another take out her aggression on me, probably because I was a boy. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't abusive, but she seemed hostile, or at the very least resentful of me. She was always stricter towards me 'cause of my gender, and was vocal in her suspicion that since I was a boy, I would not be able to control my 'urges' (My age hadn't even hit double digits yet, Jesus woman..) and that I was a threat to my younger sibling. So it turns out she was really a lesbian. Used my dad for a child, left him, moved to Washington. She'd move back to my state a few years later but soon after I moved to a different state anyways. I got along well with my half sister, and interacted with her regularly up until I moved, I'd guess. I think she's 13 now. Barely spoken to her in 4 years. Last I talked to her she seemed to have picked up that gross weeb e-girl behavior, talking about cat ears and shit. Makes me shudder. I barely speak to my dad anymore either. I love my dad, but he works the railroad back in my old home state and I've only gotten to see him when I've gone to visit a few weeks every summer. Guess that's off this year though, considering the circumstances.

My family on my mom's side are mostly Mormon. Not sure if this contributed, but I'd self identified as an atheist and started acting like some sort of goddamn intellectually superior incel at a young age, and now I barely talk to the Mormon side of my family. These are Utah Mormons, mind you, not so keen on religious diversity. My grandma on my mom's side has some sort of Alzheimer's and barely remembers who I am. Now the old home my recently divorced aunt and uncle dumped her in won't let any of us see her, and we're having to consider having her move in with us two states over, despite us being the least well off household in the entire family.

My grandpa on my dad's side passed away when I was in the second grade. Only family member I'd lost, but his was a particularly traumatic memory for me, and probably the only one I'd defend as being so. My mom picked me up early from school. At first, naturally, I was happy, but my attitude soon changed when I heard my grandpa was about to 'pass'. By the time I got there he was already gone. I loved that guy, and the fact that I never had a chance to say goodbye still fucks me up to this day.

Me:

In elementary school I barely had any friends, still don't. I'd spend my time trying to garner attention by slamming my head on my desk or locker until a teacher intervened. I hit my 'edgy teen' phase 5 years too soon, super weird kid, wore all black, talked about hating my life, the good stuff. When I hit 6th grade I moved schools at least 4 times over the course of the year. Long story short I ended up in online school. This is where I'd hit my ultimate low, I'd guess. This online school was really easy to just pass by like a joke. All the tests were easy to guess multiple choice questions, I just muted my classes and did whatever the hell I wanted. The issue with this was that I stayed isolated inside, in my room, for 3 years. Barely left the house, never showered, basic gross kid stuff like that, but without the constant peer to peer bullying that keeps it in check.

When my mom had finally gotten sick of my shit, I finally gave in and agreed to go to the charter high school conveniently built right next to my house. This school was small. Lots of rejects, freaks and weirdos, the state I moved to is out west but there are rednecks and racists aplenty, you could say it wasn't a very pleasant environment. The only two things keeping me deciding on whether I should move schools for junior year or to stay at the one I'm at are that this school consistently gives college credits as if every class were an AP class, and it features a woodworking shop. My social life is left wanting though.

After 3 years of social isolation, as this weird, awkward, pasty skinny white kid who essentially gave up on himself, I struggled a lot at first. Couldn't find anything I had in common with anyone else at the school. With it being a small population, it didn't take long for me to know who basically everyone was before the end of the year. By then I was struggling with depression, though I didn't know it. Halfway through the year I did start to work on myself. Cut my hair, showered to a semi-acceptable level, etc... whatever. Had a few crushes, didn't realize I looked like a goddamn creep but I was and still am so pathetic that there's no way I could be viewed as a threat.

Got with the group of generic hipsters, closest in common to me anyway. I'm not sure if it was me, but I had this horrible, deep seated, uncomfortable feeling that they were conspiring against me, and that out of my sheer loneliness I had to act like a completely different person to 'win their favor', get 'social points' whatever the fuck I visualized in my own head. Every day I came home exhausted after a few hours spent hanging out with them, usually thinking about how they only kept me around out of pity. At the time I really was acting completely fake, usually making loud or compulsive jokes since I didn't know what else to do. I had huge insecurities about how skinny and pasty I was, still do to be honest. Didn't help that I got comments, a lot.

By sophomore year I became exhausted, spending break sitting alone towards the back of the courtyard sulking about myself and my social life. Around the time before school shut down I'd stopped talking to most of them at all, and I haven't spoken to all but two of the people from that group since. Not sure when it started, but I find myself obsessively staring at my reflection any chance I get. I think about how ugly I am, about how I'll probably be alone forever. For some reason, even though I'm obviously straight, I obsessively doubt my own sexuality and feel the need to start 'testing' it in any way I can. With the few people left in my social circle that I talk to, I hear about all the things they're doing, all the fun they're having, while I'm pretty much left to sit by myself day in and day out in this goddamn closet of a room and wallow in self pity like I always fucking do. I'm so fucking sick of dealing with this shit and I just want a way out. Someone genuine to spend my time with at least, something to do outside of my goddamn shithole room where everything I do is just some sort of escapism to distract myself from my petty mental health issues. I've just turned 16 but I spent my birthday alone thinking about how goddamn ugly I am, undermining my masculinity and doubling down on myself again and again looking for some sort of goddamn warmth and closure.

I try to distract myself, work on myself, seek warmth and sociability, fix my own problems so no one has to hear about them. But all I'm doing is weighing myself down, blaming it on circumstance, pushing others away from me. I want another chance at a social life already, I want a fucking job, I want the motivation to work on myself, I want to be the best person I can be, but here I fucking am writing a 20000 word post on a site I never use on an account that's probably followed by at least one person I know that'll probably see this shitty pity party I'm throwing myself about how I got all these fucking problems GOD LOOK AT ME

I guess I can't be self aware without looking like a hypocrite.

101,"I don't know how to validate my needs and feelings. What I mean is, I struggle to suppress my emotions because I feel like I am not supposed or allowed to feel this way. As if it's not enough that I am suffering, I always have to compare my experiences with others or seek reassurance and be told that it is ok for me to feel depressed, anxious or annoyed. But the thing is, even if they tell me, my mind distorts what I hear. For example, I thought that my psychologist said that I am fine and he was angry with me for even thinking that I had a mental illness, but upon discussing it with him, none of it was true. I had misinterpreted everything he said. Even when posting online, I feel judged. One downvote and I think that what I just wrote is utter bullshit and people think I am lying or I see this as proof that I shouldn't be feeling and complaining. If others have it worse, I also think I am not allowed to feel. Also, I will convince myself that people around me behave in specific ways because they are struggling (even if they repeatedly tell me that they don't), and I will go out of my way to do what they want. Even looking at demographics and seeing that people with my condition are somewhat different from me (their age, gender e.t.c) will cause me to feel guilty for feeling. It's almost like I have to be reassured all the time about what I have to allow myself to feel. And since there is no objective test (like blood tests) to tell you if you have a mental condition or not, I cannot find rest. I will always doubt how I feel and what I have. This guilt goes beyond feelings. If someone asks me to do something, I  have to do it even if I don't want to. If I refuse, or if I do it, but I am visibly annoyed, complain (even a little bit) or grimace, I will also feel guilty.",19Jul2020,1
102,"I wish I had started it much earlier. It feels like my soul got wings. My anxiety disappeared from the first pill and it has not come back. Every morning I wake up, I notice how it's weird how relaxed I feel. I am more confident in myself. I have started exercising. I picked up my old projects again. Parents told me that they are relieved to see me happy again. I have not had a single skipped beat by my heart after having had heart palpitations for close to 5 years (!!!!!!). At my worst, a holter monitor even counted over 700 skipped beats per day and I felt most of them. Emotional setbacks were even able to make my heart stop beating for a few seconds. Even my acne problem drastically improved. Music feels so alive now.

I have been in therapy for over a year and tried so much but I kept reverting into a lethargic and anxious state. It was a looooonggg road from the point where I wanted to end it all. Went over abilify, guanfacine, benadryl, beta blockers, mirtazapine, trazadone, couple benzos, melatonin, tons of vitamin pills, fish oil, exercise, and other supplements.

104,"I'd recently gotten out of a 3+ years relationship. I was even engaged to this person.
Prior to this relationship I'd seem to only get involved with men that never made me a priority.
My first was supposed to be my best friend, I later found out I was just a side piece. Also found out he lied almost through out the time we were together about his life.
The other guy made plans with me about the future and what our babies would look like.
Then he'd tell his friends that he doesn't understand where I got the notion that we were in a relationship because he never asked me to be his girlfriend.
Then the one after was a long distance relationship, he said the right things, made me feel like the sexiest woman in the world and then he just stopped.
He became nonchalant, uncaring and more distant.
He never gave me a reason, he just stopped.

But this recent one makes me wonder if I'm the problem or I attract these kind of men.

He was the only solid relationship I'd ever had. We even got engaged. He would boast on social media about how he was lucky to have me, tell his family and friends the same thing.

But he also made me question myself.
I tend to be clumsy and I've admitted that to myself and him. It's not intentional. It just happens.

One time I was at his place and I made a mess.
I broke a window louvre and pull out the window blinds by mistake. He didn't talk to me to 2 weeks because of it. He even went as far as saying he thinks my clumsiness will make drop our baby, he worried if I'd be a good mother.
He hated I was pro LGBTQ, he said I would probably encourage it with our kids (????).

I remember one time I talked about how we didn't have a social life because he also stayed indoors and his retort from nowhere was that he no longer found me sexually attractive. Then proceeded not to talk to me for weeks.

But because of my past relationships of not being a priority, I let these things slide. I insisted on loving him.

He stopped sleeping with me for 5 months, this was when moved back to his city.

I asked him, he said he was caught up with work problems.

I let it slide again.

Then I found out he was having an affair.

Oh, did I mention I had surgery to take out a mast in my ovary and throughout my stay at the hospital he only showed up once and was on the phone through out. He was there for just 1 hour.


I was at his place healing from that surgery, he didn't come home one day, he said he had a ton of work to do and would have to stay over at his friend's to avoid traffic.

Turns out he went to a hotel to be with however he was an affair with.

Sigh.

I said nothing about this discovery until a week or so after.

He said he couldn't trust me because I kept it to myself. Went on to say I was likely to harm him with this information.

That was when I'd had it.

He had no intention to apologise, no remorse. Just shame of not having the upper hand in the situation.

I packed my things (pain from surgery and all) and left very early in the morning.

What does he do next? He deletes all our pictures from social media and blocks me everywhere.
Tells his family that I never trusted him and he couldn't live with someone who doubted him 🙂.

There's so much I've left off.

I'm tired.

Being with somebody else definitely made less bad days happen and I think I'm ready to start taking those steps after getting my heart absolutely smashed over Christmas. 

I've had manic depression, PTSD from a near death experience and was abused as a child. I drink too fucking much. Never got help. Never went on pills. Never openly talked about my feelings ever because I always invalidated them and swept it under the rug.

107,"⚠️⚠️Trigger warning ⚠️ ⚠️

So, since I learned about the passing of the Japanese actor, Haruma Miura 三浦春馬 this morning, I’ve been thinking of mental heath crisis in Japan. People outside of Japan often ask me about the suicide forest as if it’s some kind of a fun tourist destination, which unfortunately, it’s turned into one in the recent years by the western media... 
Suicide in Japan is a serious problem we need to stop taking so lightly. (Trains in Tokyo stop every day because of people throwing themselves in them.)
This is going to be a long post, so bear with me if you’re interested.... having lived in both Japan and the US, I kind of have a lot to say about this. 

Mental health is almost non-existent in the Japanese culture. I’ve never shared this on social media, I’ve never felt like I need to... but I used to take medications for my anxiety. I’ve had horrible anxiety and OCD like behaviors since I was a child (I grew up in a very unstable, anxiety triggering household), yet nobody ever saw it as a problem even when it got pretty bad. I’ve dealt with eating disorders for 6 years, from the age of 13-19. Never once, did my family or anyone do anything about it even though they knew what I was going through. 
In my boarding school, we had a few girls who struggled with eating disorders and self harming behaviors. What did teachers do? They “punished” them for wasting food and causing distress among other students. Nobody asked them if they were okay. They were seen as rebellious children who were probably going through a phase. 

Read the official statement Haruma Miura’s agency issued regarding his suicide. You get the picture of what I’m talking about: 
""To fans and people concerned, we apologize for the worry and the inconvenience caused, but as to details we are still confirming and will inform you once again,""

How’s his death an inconvenience?

When I was officially diagnosed with anxiety, I told my family about it. They didn’t even know what the word, “anxiety” really meant. My aunt who is married to a doctor and does medical billing etc had no clue what it was. My family definitely took it like I was a crazy person who needed to be locked up when I mentioned I was on medication. 😅

This is how educated on mental health a lot of people are in Japan. I struggled internally with mannnnny things growing up, but I was kind of expected to just live with it. I’ve never received proper help for my childhood trauma (inflicted by my abusive father) either. I was again, expected to deal with it, and not talk about it because how is my whining going to help, right? 
Often times, talking about your problem (, especially to people in charge of you at work or in school etc) is almost considered nuisance in Japan. I was often told “There are millions of people out there who are going through the same stuff you are, but they’re doing just fine. Stop whining!!” Our culture pressures us into not standing out in any way, which includes having mental health issues or “inconvenient” problems.

Japanese people tend to think they’re at fault when something goes wrong (this is actually called something tribute or traits or something, I learned it in college 🤣). There is a saying in Japanese, “死んで罪を償う”, it’s loosely translated to “paying for your sin by suicide”. Sometimes some people still believe that they can’t live with the shame of their mistakes, so they feel better off just taking their own life. Also, (in the modern times) jokingly or not, I don’t know... but some people still seem to believe that people should die to pay for their mistakes. I remember watching quite a few news reports about CEOs and stuff who got caught doing some illegal stuff committing suicide when I was growing up. This is why I don’t really like it when westerners are overly fascinated with samurai and honor and this and that. Now you know, honor can be a toxic trait if you let it be about shame when you don’t live up to the honor. 

America still has a lot to work on when it comes to understanding mental health. I believe it should be treated as seriously as physical health. However, America is far more advanced than Japan in this aspect. I didn’t need to explain what “anxiety” was to anyone. Nobody thought I was cray cray. They just thought I needed extra medical help to boost my happiness for a while. 
Also, in America, people feel more free to talk about their feelings. I still don’t like talking about my feelings. I don’t really know how to. Apparently people thought I was still a very emotionally sensitive child, but I still felt like I wasn’t allowed to share everything I was feeling so as not to “inconvenience” people around me. 

This is a deep seated toxic idea.... your feelings are NOT inconvenient for anyone. 
I’m so heartbroken to imagine Haruma Miura was probably feeling this way too. 
I’m sharing my mental health struggles because I want it to be normalized. His death further confirmed that things have to change drastically in Japan to save people’s lives. I’ve lost a couple of other people to suicide in the past. 

I’m sure I’m not the only one, either in Japan or US who lost their loved ones to this demon. Suicide is a preventable death IF we have sufficient help and access to help. Let people talk about their feelings. Be more kind. If you’re struggling and need a listening and ear, I’m here. I feel this most strongly for my Japanese friends. Your feelings are valid, positive or negative. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 🙏🏻 It doesn’t matter what other people are doing, it’s their business. Your suffering matters. Seeking for help doesn’t make you a freak. There is no mistake so big you have to lose your life for it. You are valued, precious and important. There is only one of you and this world needs you. 💜",19Jul2020,264

109,"Hi all, I just wanted to ask a question and maybe get some opinions, support, or reassurance.    


After graduating college, I did a lot of touring with musical bands, but wasn't working a lot because I was letting my depression get the best of me.  I'm much more on top of my life right now but I've been stuck in a job that doesn't pay much for 2 years now, and I'm afraid to quit on my relative who I work for.  I'm the only one holding our office together in terms of understanding our systems and tech, and I love my coworkers.  I'm uncertain if our business will survive Covid19 so I've been waiting out that possibly happening so I can move to a different job.  


Anyways,  
I'm stuck at home right now because of those circumstances, and I'm embarrassed to be a failure/seen as a failure.  I want to try dipping my toes back into dating again, I've been single for 4 years, but I feel like who would want to date me if I live at home and don't make a whole lot right now. I do think I'm a pretty fun and kind person, and have a lot to offer otherwise as a partner.   


Am I just punishing myself by feeling like I bring nothing to the table? Should I try dating again? Should I be upfront right away with people about my situation or not until I know them better?   


Thanks anyone who reads this, I appreciate your time!",19Jul2020,3
110,"Long story short I hate myself, have horrible depression and anxiety, and I’m constantly dissociating from myself unintentionally. It’s subtle but it effects me enough where it feels like I’m not actually living a real life. I think obviously the dissociation used to be an escape  from the depression and anxiety but now it just keeps me from dealing with what I’m going through and progressing in my life.

I’ve used grounding techniques which are helpful but the dissociation is still there. I can spend entire weeks, when my depression is really bad as long as months essentially, dissociative which is really scary and concerning. 

People that have severely long episodes of dissociation, how do you get out of it? Should I try an anti-psychotic medication? I’m already taking propranolol for my anxiety. Also exercising doesn’t seem to stop the dissociation weirdly, I feel healthier physically and mentally obviously but still very out of my body ironically.",19Jul2020,1
111,"I guess I'm mostly posting this for support.

I'm a college student from India and I have a mental illness which when not properly treated led to me having panic attacks and waves of nausea in public. I felt very embarrassed about this. I developed these issues while studying abroad at a public university in Ohio in the Midwestern US called Miami University.

When I confided in other people at my university about these issues and that I was having uncontrolled outbursts in public, they began to distance themselves from me. I was told I didn't fit in at several club organizations. Despite winning my tryouts for the club tennis team, they told me I was too inconsistent and selected the player I beat comprehensively to join their team. 

Members of my fraternity told me that I didn't seem to be a good fit for them anymore. Several of them suggested I leave the fraternity to focus on my mental health. Keep in mind, I was living in the house at the time. I felt so ostracized I moved out. I had a panic attack during a spring break trip. Following this, an executive member of the group invited everyone except for me to join a planning event for the next semester's trip. I have received several airdrops in random places on campus on my iPhone suggesting I hurt or kill myself, so I had to change my visibility. Once, I was walking by myself to my dorm at night. A group of students yelled at me, calling me weird and brown and told me to go away. They said that they would shoot me with the guns in their bags. I told a police officer this, and the officer said they were probably drunk when this happened. He didn't even berate them for doing this.

I couldn't control my panic attacks because I was not prescribed the appropriate treatment for this. I was even prescribed stimulants that landed me in the ER when I took them. I went to the counseling center to get help for all this. My counselor and doctor at the school told me that I should cut down on my social activities and focus on me and in class. They suggested that these organizations were shunning me because of my behavioral issues. I eventually stopped going out to events with other people. I felt ostracized by a lot of different people and eventually left the university. 

 I have been receiving therapy for two years now to help me with my self-esteem. I started taking SSRIs to help with my anxiety, and they have helped a lot. I feel much more comfortable with my friends from school. I have to return to college once the COVID lockdown ends, and I have chosen a more diverse university with less history of discrimination and harassment against minorities that is closer to my family. I am worried that this will continue to happen in the workplace after I graduate and that this is something that is not exclusive to fraternities and club organizations. I feel that if this happens again and I lose control, people will begin to ostracize me once more. I don't want to invest my time in clubs that put me down with preppy and fratty privileged students. It was honestly the worst two and a half years of my life, and I can't go through that again.",19Jul2020,2
112,"My father would masturbate in front of us in my home when I was young. When we asked him to stop, he would yell and say he had the right to touch himself in his own house. He would lay hands on my mother, and ask her why she wasn't letting him touch his own wife. When we tried to get him to stop, he would get very violent. He has a mental health issue and would enter into phases when he did this. This used to happen frequently while I was young.

Later on, I moved to the US to study. I told a ""friend"" in my university about this, and said it I would think about it and it worried me. He told his entire friend group. I had recently started taking medications for my own mental health issues that affected my sex life. These ""friends"" were of the impression that I was having issues with my sex life because of what my father had been doing while I was a child. They said that maybe I was actually gay and had a mental block because of what I had seen and did not want to admit to myself that I had feelings for men. I felt so embarrassed I had told my friend this. They completely invalidated my experience.

Recently my father has started doing this again, especially when my mother is sleeping. He would do it in the bed next to her with the door open. IDK what to do.",19Jul2020,1

115,"Hi, sorry for any spelling error or something like that, english is not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm from Argentina and we are in quarentine since march 20th TO THIS DATE, and they are talking about prolong it to mid september, i wish i was joking but it is real. I'm really feeling depressed at this point not only for the financial stress but because i live with my mother and we are getting in shouting fights for even the pettiest things, i feel that it's my fault that she is angry. But i feel i need to give more context, (but please keep in mind i'm trying to vent/maybe get some advice and not in any way victimize myself i'm feeling preassure not the urge to blame everyone for my problems whinning) i'll try to keep the explanation brief.

I battled depression since my teens, i'm now 32, i have trichotillomania, i pull my hair out since i was 9 years old, i'm a trans man currently trying to keep my hormonal replacement therapy ongoing while waiting for all this shitstorm to end and get the gender reasignment surgeries. As it is i don't have a job in the present time, and it is getting to me hard that i can't help financially my mom who is retired. I struggled this last 7 years to get my Lic. as a superior radiology technician in the Red Cross, because i love my career but it's difficult thus i try to keep studying mealtdowns in between. Now the struggle is really hard, mom gets from the retirement the gov gives her the equivalent to less than u$d 150 per month, with me not having a job and the prolonged quarentine, all the business closing around my area and from what i hear in the whole country, with constant reminder of our corrupt president and his politician buddies, the repression to people that speaks in disagreement with them, the expropiations, the fact that they give governors and intendents a plus for every case (pressumed or factual) of covid-19 prompted a series of corrupt practices, ultimately making me feel there is no hope.

I'm tired of waiting for this to end, i'm tired of the lies they tell us, i'm tired of watching my mom struggle, i'm tired of keeping a good face when all goes to shit sround me. I really think maybe the hormones maybe the fact that mom and i are hot headed, maybe the cage we call home is getting too closed up for us to breath, i don't know anymore. I'm worried about mom, she is 64 and really tries, never was a great mom but at least she provided i guess and i want to return the favour. I feel sad, angry most of the time, i yell sometimes and others she yells. We try to help my godmother because she is senile and her sister is in Mar del Plata (we are in Buenos Aires) and can't (or won't) come to assist her sister that clearly can't take care of herself, she already tried to feed the cats litter box stones, and ate herself cat food causing her an infection, her dog is old and needs care too, and she has potty accidents almost always. I'm really tired of feeling useless, of watching the world go to hell, and of not having any idea what i can do to earn an income in a country that by decree can't fire any employee (and won't hire anybody) without giving the equivalent of 2 salaries, everything closing going for bankrupt, basically our president is turning us into Venezuela (no offense) and that loves the Chavist party. I'm so done. No one will hire annyone in already in flames country. My skill set limits itself to my studies that i have yet to finish, uni is closed too. I'm an avergae artist but without any means to share my art i see difficult to make comissions, also i don't have a credit card of any sort ergo i can't get paypal (at least in my country) See i explored many other routes to keep my head afloat, trying to find another solution, i refuse to give up mentally but alas as i said, i'm tired mostly because i developed isomnia and have the most erratic and short hours of sleep if at all, thanks quarentine.

I'm very sorry for venting all over the place, maybe it's because right now it feels too much to keep inside alone. I'll try to find some solutions, i can't let myself fall into the black spiral of depression anymore, i promised myself i wouldn't let anyone put me back in that whole, although it's getting really difficult to try and push forward. Just posting to keep myself away from a breaking point, i'm sorry i wrote too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your patience.

118,"I come from a conservative indo-carribean family. I am a 22 year old male who met my first ever girlfriend about 8 months ago. I’ve been seeing her since but due to outspoken racism by my parents, I chose to hide my relationship for about 5 months until it recently came to light. Ever since my mom does not allow me to leave the house without messaging me, when she knows I’m with my girlfriend especially during the night she calls and messages me non stop. She has threatened to harm herself and has even told me that I’ve been causing her major health issues which may or may not be true (I don’t know what is true at this point). She claims I ruined her family and that my siblings and dad also hate what I am doing as I will disgrace the family by bringing in someone who is black despite her being carribean too. Recently I told them about my mental health and what her words mean as she told me not to come to her funeral and threatens to disown me and things were better. However they started up again when she starts to ignore me and the rest of my family when I go out with my girlfriend and she knows about it. She continues to tell me that I don’t care about her and that I should tell her I don’t want her in my life anymore. Today I watched her hit herself repeatedly and slam the back of her head on the wall. I feel broken while choosing between two people I love and I can never understand how an ethnicity has this effect on my mom. My head hurts and I know harming oneself is not a healthy coping mechanism but I now understand why people do it.

The way I like stuff has always worked in the way that I'll get REALLY into something, then obsess over it for usually months. It ends eventually. Not that I stop liking the thing, but I stop being so extremely interested in it.

I haven't been able to do that since after the last time.

Maybe it sounds like a good thing that I haven't been able to do it, but it really isn't. Trying to get into a bunch of different things all at once is a lot more tiring than just liking one thing for a long time. Not having something fun to always think about is weirdly upsetting for some reason. I don't think of particularly painful or harmful things when I don't have anything else to think about, it's more like I can't really think of anything. Like, I can't think of any specific thing. It feels sort of blank. Or foggy. Sometimes I get something, but it's mostly just a whole lot of nothing.

But the pandemic is getting really tough for me. I live alone in an apartment and have no friends or acquaintances around. That has been triggering my for quite some time now and it's getting insanely difficult for me to get up and barely brush or cook my own food. 
I have taken 1 leave or 2 in the last couple months but nothing major, but my productivity has gone way down.
My boss is an amazingly understanding and friendly person yet somehow I have always had my reservations to open up to him about anything (keeping professional and personal lightyears away from each other). 
Now I'm feeling burnt out and my condition is deteriorating so I need a couple days off, and although I know I love my job, so I'll come back after 2-3 days, I am scared I might again fall into a bad stretch. I'm trying to pull it together and manage everything but I just can't seem to do it, however hard I try. 

I have lost complete confidence in me and scared of my own depressive phases. Therapy, somehow, isn't working for me I feel. I've had some suicidal thoughts, I've thought about stopping therapy because it's been a year now and I still am at the same person. 

So at this juncture, should I inform my boss about my condition? He's friendly and understanding, I feel so. But I'm not sure this is something which can be shared openly ( mental health is still a stigma here) and I'm scared that he'll treat me differently and think of me as unreliable or incapable when it comes to consideration of further promotions or projects.

For the past 2 or 3 months it's been getting increasingly harder for me to find motivation to do ""productive"" stuff, like doing some online courses I have already bought or studying music (which is something I kinda had as a hobby for some time but am now trying to get more serious about) or even house chores. And then, because I can't do these things I want and/or have to, I feel guilty and get even less motivated to actually do something about it. I'm very interested in mental health and have had family and friends with severe depression, so I know a little bit about the topic even though I haven't experienced it myself and I try to take these matters very seriously.

For extreme cases it is absolutely clear to me, but I don't see myself as bipolar but my closest friend does.

I know I am depressed, probably for 16 years now. Sometimes I have also normal phases but I wouldn't say I have mania.
E.g. I meet a cute girl that likes me, probably everyone would feel better and if stop seeing each other it will get worse again?
That should be a normal behavior and I never really was happy or sad without a reason?

I don't know how it is called but this rapid type of bipolar would fit me better or not I don't know.. What my friend describe as hypomania never lasts for more than some minutes or hours.

Sometimes after major depressions I have phases I am really motivated maybe from s video or person and I feel to need to change my whole life and fix all problems at once, but that ends usually after some minutes to hours.

E.g. some months ago I realized I need to get somehow 21 ECTS within 2 months (and I only did 9 the last 12 months) or I will lose money (about 8000$). When I realized that I was thinking about everything I could do to achieve this and was like ""I have to do that"", ""there must be a way"", since I didn't want to pay 8000$ back.
Obviously I failed. 21 ECTS in 2 months would be possible for some people without mental problems, but remember I did less than 1 in a month..

129,"( I ment physical) okay so for the questions sake, if there is an individual with existing deppresion and anxiety, but they have zero i mean no psychical activity/ exercise through out the day, with maximum daily intake of 500-600 calories or even less then that without consuming any proper vitamins or healthy food prolonged with no routine as in doing nothing all day, having nothing to do or nothing to look forward to doing as in no hobbys,just having little to nothing to do at all, I mean just trying passing the time everyday and say this person has an issue with overthinking in a negative irrational way at times, how would this impact one's mental health?, now I know that there's a Orgins or everyone's mental health but at the same time there's a loop, as if one wasn't depressed it would be easier to be optimistic and positive about all of this, but in a simple way how much of this would effect one's mental health wether they are mentally healthy or Deppreesed and if one would try correcting all of this (small steps) how much can it combat deppresion and anxiety? 


Note:I know these can be the symptoms of deppresion too ( im asking this behalf of my loved ones so I understand where it's coming from and how this conflicts with there mind and goals etc) and one with deppresion may find it hard to correct but at the same time the individual who's depressed and wants help and to change may not forsee that how much these changes could effect one's health and help them as even a small change would be a victory for them, and to what I see this may be on of the individuals origin which causes there deppresion/anxiety to be worsen.",19Jul2020,2
130,"So straight off the bat, I know this is mostly in my head and my brother / friends don't mean any harm. I guess I'm just venting and hope people could give me tips on how to deal with it.  I'm 31, my brother is 33. We both live apart and don't really talk that much. 

I've pretty bad self esteem issues and have trouble speaking up or saying much at all. I was the ""quiet kid"" in school. I've gotten past that now and have a small circle of friends I really enjoy being around. Once a month we get together and play an online game. We rotate games to get a wide variety which is a lot of fun. I'm not that good at most of the games but we have fun. The other guys I play with aren't great either but I'm clearly the worst.

Last month my brother asked if he could join and he is friends with all our friends so he was joined in. My brother is a very charasmatic guy and knows how to push my buttons. Whether intentionally or not, he'll make jokey comments at pretty much every opportunity that I speak up and by the end of our game, I noticed some other friends started to mention how I wasn't that good.

This isn't the first time I've felt like this, it seems whenever my brother joins us in any circumstance, the group turns me into the butt of their jokes. Like I'm the dumb one. In the past I've had friends slowly distance from me and although I know these friends won't, I keep having thoughts of them just deciding to play games without me because they want to win.

We're supposed to be playing tomorrow and my brother will be joining us. I'm getting anxiety just thinking about what they'll say if I don't play right or thoughts of them all deciding that they'll decide half-way through the game that I should stop playing.",19Jul2020,1

I see how hard they have to work to deal with it in a healthy manner. Too many times my boyfriend has cried because he ""just wants to be normal"". It makes me so mad to see people say they have anxiety just because they don't want to go out or because they get stressed easily*. Most people don't go around claiming other illnesses, like cancer, when they don't have it. I feel like it will just get taken less seriously eventually.

133,"So I'm working with my therapist on here and I have come here for some guidance. I'm getting over some emotional numbness and I shut down over these feelings specifically because I have no idea how to process them other than to cry because it's too much. I was like this with happiness and sadness as well. 
I am feeling anger and it is a very forceful emotion. I have come that working out gets rid of that physical sensation, but for mental processing it goes for 100 to 0 after working out. I have no idea how to process the thoughts there though

As for love and affection, I am very lost for these. 
I am awkward about getting compliments, but I am slowly able to accept them from strangers. I feel awkward with closer people though. It's strange, it feels good and it's a happy feeling is all I know so far and maybe some fear due to upbringing. Basically I have no idea how to cross the fear because its mixed with some happiness in it. With anger, it's easier. 

Maybe it's because these ones require some vulnerability? I have no idea how to open up to that nor process the thoughts because its quicker reaction to shut off before I process any of it. Do I have to think of why I am afraid of it or???

136,"I’ve (20F) been diagnosed with bi polar depression, anxiety, PTSD, and OCD. (OCD more recently, about 1 month ago, but everything else 5+ years).

(Backstory but trying to keep this post short): I’ve been avoiding drugs and haven’t taken any in 3+ months.. and I’ve been off psych medication for 7+ months because I can’t afford my medication and the psychiatrist visits. I had to get my medication through Canada for a while because it’s as cheaper but still too expensive for me.

With my anxiety I constantly wonder if people go through the same things throughout the day that I do. Feeling overwhelmed and very self conscious especially what people think about me. I’ve been having panic attacks more frequently than I ever have, sometime seemingly out of nowhere (there is usually a trigger). I can sense my mental health deteriorating but I feel like I’m doing everything I can to get better.

I’ve been really invested in my job, working on my sobriety, eating healthy, working out, meditating, going through counseling (2 months now) that I can afford, but he keeps telling me that I basically NEED medication. 

Is anyone in counseling and off medication? Is it possible to just be at peace? I just want some other point of views, because in my day to day life I don’t meet a lot of people who feel the same as I do.

Before, although I was in constant pain I could pull through and pull my weight at work. I filed for FMLA because I was just in a really bad place 2 weeks ago, and work started becoming more stressful for me every day. However, because FMLA is unpaid and I'm at an all time low for PTO, I force myself to work because I need the money. I tried talking to my boss about switching over to a day time position as working the night shift is taking a toll on my body now. Due to COVID-19 there is not a lot that can be done right now.. 

I have lost hope in my stomach issues being resolved. I am on antidepressants and they are no longer enough for me.

145,"I hope this is ok to post here, I just can’t get this experience out of my head. Sorry in advance for the long post. About 6 months ago I requested my medical files from my former HMO. When I got them, I found a BPD diagnosis no one had told me about. It made a lot of things click, not about how I personally feel but about how I had been treated at the time and since. 

I’d been recently discharged from a residential program for anorexia, and I was arguing with my providers over the fact they wouldn’t authorize or recommend PHP as a step-down from res. I’d gone straight down to outpatient because I refused to go back to their IOP program since I felt it had been traumatic the last time I was there (Only serving then vegetarian food then not believing me about my migraine triggers when I told them I can’t eat cheese, telling me it was all in my head and they couldn’t provide any other food options that didn’t have cheese as the main protein, kicking me out of program daily because I couldn’t finish lunch in 30 minutes before the timer went off and then sending me out to drive the 2 hours home sobbing daily while telling me I just needed to try harder, telling me it was all in my head and I should just stop when I started first gagging and then involuntarily vomiting during meals, and then sending me home again because it’s really hard to finish a meal in under 30 minutes when you’re forced to leave the room because you started dry-heaving and weren’t allowed back in until 5 minutes before the timer went off.... I could go on) and they wouldn’t provide another option other than their IOP. 

I eventually had to go back to the IOP after I immediately relapsed in outpatient and was once again told it was the only available option. While there, apparently my therapist diagnosed me with BPD. Her reasoning was that I was paranoid that all the providers were out to get me and I was overreacting to small things and causing scenes. The thing is, I really do think the providers were out to get me! They wouldn’t medically recommend PHP even though it was covered by my plan because the HMO would have had to pay for it out-of-network and didn’t want to. The residential place I’d been at tried to tell them it was entirely medically necessary, as evidenced by the fact I relapsed without it, but they wouldn’t listen and I just got marked down as attention-seeking. My therapist said I was acting out on eating disorder behaviors purposefully to get to a higher level of care because I just liked being taken care of at residential. I felt more like I was terrified of relapse and wanted to get out of it/prevent it in the future, but ok. 

The thing is, now that I know about my BPD diagnosis I can’t help but wonder if they were right and it makes me feel so guilty and embarrassed that I was trying so hard to get support when I didn’t need it. My current psych NP says I don’t have BPD, but I worry that I’ve fooled her since she hasn’t known me long and maybe I’ve just kept it hidden. I originally felt like I’d been gaslit by my therapist at the IOP program, I ended up feeling completely ungrounded and like I didn’t know what was true or false. I was constantly being told how I felt even when I didn’t think it was how I felt, and I ended up feeling so floaty and disconnected from reality. 

This was 3 years ago now, and finding that BPD diagnosis brought it all back. Ever since, I don’t know what’s real or what’s fake, or if I’m manipulating everyone around me and then lying to myself about it. I don’t think I fit most of the BPD diagnostic criteria, I’ve only ever had two relationships, both long-term, and Ive never broken up with anyone or felt like my relationships were unstable. I spend too much sometimes, but otherwise I don’t think I have any reckless behaviors. I don’t really identify with the idea of splitting, but I do sometimes see concepts in black and white especially when it comes to my eating disorder. I don’t think I’ve ever done that with people though. I don’t have mood swings and I don’t get angry or irritable often. But I did start mildly self-harming around the time this was all happening, and I have started to realize I have symptoms of depersonalization. I don’t know what’s true or not, and I hate knowing that I could be hurting other people by not acknowledging the diagnosis and getting treatment for it. I feel like I have that therapist’s voice in my head, overanalyzing and asking if everything I do is just for attention, and I don’t know anymore! I don’t feel confident about anything I do. Maybe posting this is just looking for attention and manipulating people into feeling sorry for me! I don’t think it is, but can I really trust myself when the professionals said I was attention-seeking and overdramatic? Probably not. I don’t know anymore. I just want to stop feeling so disconnected from reality and I don’t want to feel so confused anymore. 

Thanks for reading, I hope no one is offended by this, I really don’t want to buy into the stigma around BPD but I am scared of it since I feel like I experienced it at this program and since (I kept getting bumped down to outpatient because they “didn’t want to validate my eating disorder” even after leaving the HMO and hitting a new low weight. I was really struggling and kept being told one therapy session a month was enough to handle it. I realize now I gave them access to my old files and that BPD diagnosis. Or maybe they decided the same thing and also didn’t tell me). Please let me know if I’ve offended anyone and I can delete my post. I don’t know what I’m even looking for from this. Thanks.",19Jul2020,2

And with this pandemic I thought I could get my shit together because I could do my responsibilities without getting out of the room and meeting people from my college. But eh, I still distract myself from my real problems and somehow I couldn't care any less about the consequences I most likely would get. 

The only thing I know about this problem is that I'm afraid to start doing my paper. A few hours a go a acquaintance from there asked about it. I didn't answer them thinking what could they do about mine if they know where I am atm but then later I find myself irritated with anything people I'm living with did (speak, eat, their sound when walking) and thinking where, how should I start about my paper. After that I couldn't stop thinking about the hot water and a box cutter in the bathroom (idk why it's there), became conscious of my heavy breathing then proceeded to cry about how burdening I am not being able to finish one damn degree when most of my peers already done with them. 

I want help. But I don't know where because here in my town I couldn't get a decent mental health facility, I need to go big cities. I've tried to seek it online once and while I was copying notes I've prepared with some tears to the chat, the psychologist bluntly guessed that I'm a college student then gave me 'tips' to help myself. Like those you could find on internet; journaling,  exercise, just start doing, write down my good traits, etc. Hell with these notes, I deleted them and say thank you then end it there. 

I've read people's journeys about getting real professional help, they all have physical telling symptoms like hyperventilation, insomnia, weight gain or loss, couldn't get out of bed, etc. But I still have my family making sure I eat regularly, have a will to take a bath, anything to function a with healthy body. So am I overestimating my problems? Should I just try those tips harder? I've exercised, I couldn't keep writing journal daily and when I did write, it's all about my dog that passed away recently.

I was in shock and in. i laughed maybe it was a weird joke but he looked at me and said"" f you its not funny"".
 the pain turned into anger and i wanted to bash him but i kept quiet and under control, he didn't seem very stable(who am i to judge though) i got up and walked like 40 meters even more far from him and this guy gets up starts yelling to himself ""this f****ing guy why isn't he leaving!"" i got really uncomfortable so got up gave him a peace sighn with my hand and he replied of course with ""f you"" all this with tears of past pain falling down on my face all i wanted was a hug and got this left with tears and had to fight a breakdown for about a 15 min walk until i reached a safe spot.

It's like my mind feels so unstable. There are always literal things flying around, trying to get out of my head and interfering with anything I try to think about. For example, I would be trying to think about a memory but I'll only be able to hold it for a short time before it gets chaotic and unstable and I start feeling like nothing's in control and I feel physical objects strongly flying around in my head, but I don't really see them in my imagination; just feel them. This also prevents me from enjoying things because it's so deeply, painfully infuriating that I feel like I have to make a very great and strenuous effort to get it all under control and stable and clam and peaceful or else I won't be able to properly enjoy things. Can't enjoy good music, can't enjoy hobbies, can't enjoy my favourite season, can't enjoy good movies, can't enjoy beautiful things because it just won't let me. It also prevents me from feeling what I'm supposed to feel at a given situation, like I don't feel relieved when I really should be, don't feel comfortable/angry/exctied/proud/etc when I should be feeling those feelings. And it makes me so depressed and sad. I can't even sleep with ease. Those physical objects are just constantly disturbing and distracting me so much.

A few years ago I went through a rough time where I was unemployed living in a small bedroom not being able to leave my flat because I was terrified of what out there. I was in that room without any human contact for about a year and I started to create people to talk to and suddenly the voice I was imagining is now clearly talking into my ear. She's telling me the only way to stop her is to kill myself. I'm not entirely sure if she's somwone i created or if she just latchedon to me from somewhere else. She talks at me night and day and she laughs when I feel embarrassed and she shouts when I try to ignore her. I sometimes go into a 2D world if that makes sense to anyone. Like im looking at a big board with things either painted on or printed on, like a movie set. It feels like everyone has a script but me and sometimes im sure they're saying things to coax a reaction for the people watching me. 
I was emotionally and sexually abused by 3 different members of my family from a young age at different stages of my life and when I think about those times too much the voice gets so loud and ugly that I want to bash my own head in to make her stop. Its getting to the point where I'm convinced that she's right and the only way to stop feeling like this is to die. 
I dont want to die really, although I have tried a couple of times to end myself but I'm too scared to die and I just don't know what to do.
Thankfully im away from my dad who was a very evil man and im living with my mum and step dad who are always there for me but that just adds to the guilt I feel constantly. There's so many feeling and thoughts in my head that I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.
Im on medication and I've got an elastic band round my wrist and I tried meditation and walking with my dog for miles and doing breathing exercises. I am really trying to talk through everything with my new family but its not enough and at night these things are getting worse. 

I guess im just wondering if anyone else feels like this is relevant to anything they've been through and what kinda coping mechanisms they used or have heard of to help me.

Not an English native, so words might be spelled wrong or sentences are not correct.

To set the record straight, my parents where lovely people so it isnt their fault.

My dad had a rough childhood due to his parents being divorced. He had some sort of depression.

He was a heavy smoket and passed away due to lung cancer when I was 27, I am 34 now.

I was bullied by a guy in my neighbourhood, he was always after me. Besides that I had some friends growing up.

It went wrong when I went to high school, I quickly hung out with types who where smoking weed.

I went to another High school and lost sight of the people who actually shoild have been my friends.

I was bullied by people who knew my neighbourhood bully at this new High School, got called all sorts names. Mostly about being wierd or something. Getting called misfit and such.

Not so much physical, but just awfull things.

Then I hung out with people who where drinking a lot and so forts. Got bullied by this group also.
Just humiliating things.

Now I am doing OK, but still have an inferior complex.
University was OK, mostly just working at accounting.

My first job at accounting was with people who where kind af back stabbing, having low confidence and self esteem doesnt help.

I am doing alright, but just thinking of the bad shit I have experienced, just puts this huge weight on my shoulders daily.",19Jul2020,2

164,"i’m 17 years old and just a normal kid. no family issues at home or stressful situations often. never used to be like this before but i’ve been having a lot of mood swings lately going on for a couple months now. a couple days a week or sometimes every day, i’m feeling normal but then i’ll be REALLY happy and excited for hours. energetic and racing thoughts. sometimes restless and can’t be still. then i’m back to normal or i’ll feel sad for a while and then i’m back to normal. or one day i’ll be sad first then really happy/excited for a while, and then back to normal. when i’m feeling happy, i feel really excited for no reason or my thoughts are racing and i’m thinking of fun/exciting things i feel like doing. i get up and feel like moving around, listening to music and sometimes to the point where i feel like getting up and dancing and that’s not really like me. when i feel sad i feel hopeless, short fused and easily irritated-small things will set me off, worthless, wanna be alone, and tearful. these feelings only last between 2-4 hours. i used to struggle with depression before but it doesn’t feel like that here. any thoughts would be much appreciated! bipolar disorder crossed my mind but i think by now i’d know and the highs aren’t super high and the lows arent that low, and these feelings don’t last too long before i feel normal again. it’s like i’m up then i’m down the normal and then the cycle starts again.",19Jul2020,1
165,"I don't want to sound like those ""Edgy teens"" who are ""empty"" and their ""soul is in the void"". I'm just confused, and I don't know if it's normal to feel what I feel. I don't know what its called if its wrong. so yeah.

I don't think I feel emotions? like its not a numbness its not a void. its nothing, there's nothing to describe, I cant feel it. I cry, but I don't feel ""sadness"", I can laugh but I don't feel ""happiness"", y'know? I don't know, maybe I'm stuck in one emotion and so everything seems normal to me, but I don't know, I'm not depressed I'm not bipolar I'm not anything else, i feel nothing. Its not a numbness its not a empty hole which cannot be filled, it nothing. 

I know I don't feel it because happiness has the same feeing as sadness and anger, Maybe that is normal but with my friends it seems like they can point out what they feel whereas with me its like ""Oh I should feel this emotion, lets react to how that emotion would be displayed""

Maybe I'm complaining about something that isn't problem. Anyone got advice or anything?",19Jul2020,2
166,"I'm not asking to be diagnosed obviously I just want to hear opinions of what this might be. I'm officially diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety disorder, ocd and anorexia. I haven't been to a psychiatrist with the intent of delving deeper into my behavior and diagnosing it in a very long time so I assume my record must be a little outdated.


Anyway for as long as I can remember I've been suffering from the following fuck ups and I don't really see how any of it could be related to what I'm diagnosed with so i need you guys to help me figure out what this could potentially be:


- my work desk has to be in the farthest, most inner corner of the room with my back against the wall, otherwise I don't feel safe at all, its almost like a deep primal feeling, if I face the entire room, windows and doors and my back is to the wall then I can't be attacked by surprised because I see it all.

- I sleep practically hugging the wall and with my back facing to my window because I believe that theres something or someone outside my window looking in and if I open my eyes facing the window I'll see them first thing.

- also when I sleep I try to never open my eyes because I believe theres, again, something or someone above me, like some monster bending down over my body to be inches away from me, and the only way to be safe is to never open my eyes and notice them.

- every single person in the world is dangerous and untrustworthy, no exceptions. This paranoia is so bad that its hard for me to walk down a safe public street in broad daylight because every person I walk past could potentially attack me so I just walk past people as fast as possible.

- in general whenever something is going wrong I have delusions that I know don't make any fucking sense but I still believe them. For example some time ago I was on a bus and one of the people on board got off after loudly arguing with the bus driver idek about what but the guy was screaming that this bus company sucks, they're frauds, blah blah. So as a result my head somehow conjured the idea that the guy put a bomb on the bus out of anger and it will detonate soon, and at the moment I was aware that this makes no sense but I was so fucking afraid, like there are two voices in my head one being the logical one thinking ""what the hell are you on about"" and the other is just pure animalistic going apeshit, it's very similar to what I experience with my anorexia. I was on the verge of a mental breakdown all the way to my stop.


What could these be a sign of?",19Jul2020,1

170,"This is on mobile plus I'm probably rambling so sorry if this is a shitty reading experience!

I have something akin to a professional diagnosis for depression, but nothing for anxiety and adhd. (both of which I'm quite sure i have) But since my country barely recognizes mental health problems and my mom isn't too open about it and getting it treated (she mostly talks about how it's the 'mindset' of the person) I've ended up repressing everything from being shown outwardly in order to seem 'normal' or 'fine'. 

So even if I'm having an anxiety attack I've somehow managed(?) it to never be noticeable. If I'm depressed and shutting down I'll use a lot of mental effort to make my self at least look like I'm functioning. This involves disregarding my feelings entirely so it doesn't interfere with 'functioning like a normal person'. Even if I'm upset and extremely close to full on screaming I'll push it back. 

I think being so used and accustomed to repressing everything has fucked with my ability to work with my emotions. And repressing it so it doesn't show much has led me to question if I'm really just overreacting when I am normal and neurotypical. 

I'm so stressed. I want to know if there's someone who has a similar experience to mine. Even just one person would be nice.",19Jul2020,6

I was told that’s all I would do  when I was a baby, but for as long as I can remember I’ve had difficulty shedding tears.

174,"Okay so, where do I begin? Well, I had a rough start to to this year. Went through a bad break up with a girl that I loved. I still live with my parents coz I choose to, since they need someone to take care of them. Which hurt me even more when they separated earlier this year and I had to choose who I had to be with. On top of this, someone who I always thought would be around until I was married fell terminally ill, soon after they kicked the bucket. At this point, I had little or no motivation to do anything at all. I stopped eating, showering as much, my sleep schedule got fucked and I just lost the will to live. I went to a psychiatrist and found that I had depression. In my moments of utter despair, I happened upon this video documentary by BT Sport on Tyson Fury(if you know you know). I heard his story and it really resonated with me, after he beat Klitschko, how he got addicted to drugs (which I had done for a while), lost the will the live and just didn't want to wake up anymore (what I was currently feeling). Then I watched more videos on him and just became obsessed with the sport of boxing. At that point I had an epiphany and I knew that I had to fight my inner demons. Prayer wasn't working either(trust me, I tried). I looked up Boxing training videos on YouTube, got the necesarry equipment and started training at home(at this point the Covid 19 pandemic had just gone global). I enlisted the help of my father who begrudgingly agreed to it and at first I was so god damn bad at it. I used to swing Wildly, like a frickin windmill. Eventually, I started to correct my form through experience and I can say that I have definitely improved since I began. And now at this point, what I do is, I train 4-5 times a week, sometimes even twice a day to just keep myself mentally and physically healthy. I can now say that after 5 months of absolute hell that I actually feel happy. Like,my depression does come back from time to time but it's normally because I'm being lazy with my training, then it just goes away after I get back into my routine.",19Jul2020,3

188,"Hi everybody, I hope you're all doing well! Essentially what I'm asking about it a weird series of intrusive thoughts and hallucinations that I experienced last night and am confused about. It was terrifying both because of the thoughts and things I was seeing themselves but also because I didn't know what it was. I was aware that everything was figments of my imagination, but that didn't really stop me from believing what was happening was real in some cases. Now into the thoughts and hallucinations themselves,

So I started trying to fall asleep at 1am last night after a day at my cottage which I hate because there are so many bugs there and I think I may have a phobia of most bugs (there's some exceptions that I'm not scared of), especially spiders (which I know are technically arachnids but bare with me haha). As I started to fall asleep for the first 45 minutes or so my dreams (well not fully dreams because I wasn't quite asleep yet) would subconsciously shift over to images of bugs sometimes and i would get short-lasting images of bugs intruding in my dreams but for those 45 minutes I could do what I normally do and 'change the channel' of my dreams to make them go away. For the following 15 minutes it was much worse. At that point I began to feel very paranoid and scared because I couldn't remove the images from my mind, everything that happened in any thought or dream was related to these terrifying images of bugs. One specific scene that kept recurring was of this weird spider-ant hybrid (which are 2 of the things I'm most afraid of) walking around and twisting. By the end of the 15 minutes all I could see was a whole bunch of bugs lined up in neat rows, all moving their legs. I tried to open my eyes to make it stop but my room is pitch black so the thoughts could continue. At this point I was also convinced that even though I needed to pee, if I got up, the floor would be like the floor at the cottage and covered with bugs. I rolled over and went on TikTok for about 15 minutes which actually did help me distract myself so by the time I decided I needed to get up to pee I only half believed the whole thing about bugs on the floor. Obviously there weren't actually any but I did see things moving out of the corners of my eyes that I could have sworn were bugs but when I turned my head there was nothing there. I went back to bed and lied on my back with the sheets very tight around me which is how I feel safest and fell back asleep (though it took awhile because I was very shaken up) and this morning I was fine so I'm super weirded out.

189,"Tl;dr: self absorbed, niceguy, victim complexed, narcissist wants to grow up emotionally and not hurt friends or others anymore. 

(I don't know this sub well, so if this type of post is not allowed, and someone could direct me to a better place to post it, please just let me know.)

Hi all... I (35M) need to work on my mental health, and definitely will need help, but I don't know where or how to start.

I feel like I've been a ""nice guy"" in denial for a long time.  Just lost a girlfriend I thought I was going to propose to because I got drunk and was super mean to her pointing out the ways she was rude to me.  Not the first time with her or with previous girlfriends.  No way to fix it with her, so I've decided I need to try to work on fixing me.

I've done therapy before after having panic attacks to discuss anxiety.  It may have been just a poor fit, but mostly the guy was just like a buddy and tried to point out where I was in the right while I was trying to blame myself.  Obviously, it was nice to have someone not beat me up, but I think it more so just made enabled me to continue acting selfishly because someone condoned it.  Or we would talk about shitty things that happened in my past and how they affected me and are still affecting me now... but we would never get to a ""solution"" or how to change it.  The engineer in me does not like problems without solutions.  So I would usually just leave a session angry at someone for something they did 20 years ago that I just now realized was not cool.

Growing up, I was super shy and always worried about what people thought of me (still do).  I was good in school, good at lots of sports, but never good at making or having friends.  People always told me I was boring. I was good at following directions, never got in trouble, never drank, just tried to do what I was ""supposed to"" and be nice to everyone.  But I mostly just got picked on and made fun of for various things (too many freckles, too good of grades, too short, too whatever).  I feel like this made me always very observant of slights or what I perceived as slights against me - probably to the point that I invent them.  But I hold onto them and don't know how to let them go.  And if an argument comes up with that person or something that's enough to make me stop bottling them in, I let them all out in a very rude, blunt way. Alcohol definitely exacerbates this now.

To clarify, I definitely drink too much, and am trying to stop. And most of these instances of me being a jerk involve me having had enough alcohol for my emotional filter to be down.  But the alcohol isn't the root of my issues.  So I'm trying to concentrate internally rather than on that external accomplice - and I don't want to just blame the alcohol and move on like I'm without fault.

I want to try to figure out why I have these built up frustrations and resentments that I hold onto - why I even have it in me to turn into this asshole monster.  This will probably sound ""nice guy""-ey, but when I'm not drinking, I'm usually very selfless and kind to everyone.  I really like to make other people happy (back to the always worried what people think about me). But then at the same time I keep ""score"" of these nice things I do for others, and use this as a ""valid"" excuse to be upset about small perceived slights.  I don't know how to change a mindset.  But I truly want to help others just to be kind, without thinking that means they ""owe"" me something.

I know that it is ok to be upset with someone or something, but I want to be able to communicate that in a healthy, non hurtful way.  

Separately, I'm simultaneously completely lacking self-confidence and I'm completely full of myself in my head (think I'm so smart, so athletic, so great).  It's an odd thing to put into words, and to struggle with. But I also think this adds to my perceived ""victim complex"" where I think everyone is slighting me or thinking negatively about me, and makes me perceive/create even *more* false slights.

I know a lot of this was shaped by my past (childhood, parents, etc.).  Discussed a lot of that with my previous therapist.  But I don't want to just blame that or be a ""victim"" of my past.  I don't know how to grow or change.  But I want to.  I don't want to be bitter, old, and alone, and blaming everyone and everything else for my problems (like my dad).  I don't want to worry that my ""true"" (jaded by my perceived/made up slights) feelings for someone will come out if I get angry.  Mostly, I don't want to have lost this girl and this relationship and not tried to improve from it.  She deserves that much, at least.  I don't mean that in a ""maybe if I do all this, I can get her back"".  I mean that she was always trying to help me be better.  I owe it to her as a friend to actually try to be better.

Anyway, I say all that to ask if someone could point me in a direction.  I can find another therapist (although I'm in a country where English isn't the primary language, so there's a slight barrier), and I guess that's where I should start.  But I didn't feel like I got what I needed out of it before (e.g., yes, I know it's my fault, but what does truly taking responsibility *mean*? how do I improve my emotional maturity? yes, I understand that my dad saying that 20 years ago sucked and led to me feeling this way... but how do I *fix* it now?) But I just feel super overwhelmed trying to tackle all of this.  Any advice would be welcomed.  A book, a song, anything.

Sorry for the wall of text, and thanks to anyone who took the time to read through it.  If nothing else, I hope if you see any of yourself in my behaviors, know you're not alone, and things can get better.  I don't know how yet, and you may not either, but you're not alone.",19Jul2020,2

197,"tl;dr: There is something wrong, or something is going to be wrong, and I don't know if I can stop it.

Over the past 18-24 months:

I am distraced more and more easily, but I don't even realize it.  This makes driving extremely difficult.  I am going to stop driving until I get this figured out.

I can't remember things like names.  I used to be reall, really good at that.  But now, they are just fleeting.  In the past four days I've met four people, three of which I live with (Just moved in), and a downstairs neighbor.  In a matter of hours I forgot her name.  She called me by name: ""Hello, [name].""  It took me several seconds to answer back because I tried to recall her name and just couldn't.  I settled on ""hello"".  This is disturbing to me.  Also, I can't remember 2 out of the 3 I live with, let alone their dogs. 

I have lost time.  Sometimes it was only a few minutes, then days, then weeks.  I mean, I just can't remember it.  I know this can happen, but it seems to be getting worse and more alarming.  I was talking with someone and they asked how old I was.  I said 36 and gave my birthday.  They gave me theirs, which was after mine, and said they were 37.  I questioned them, then myself.  I used a calendar calculator from google and it said 37 years old.  Guys: *I lost an entire YEAR of my life!!*  I legitimately thought I was 36.  Now I'm in fear.

I increasinly cannot remember what I am *about* to say.  I simply forget it.  If I have a thought, I have to voice it or just let it go if someone interjects because if I get distracted then my forthcoming thought is just gone.  That scares me.

There's more, but I think I've made the point.  Something is happening and it's getting worse.  I've had memory problems since I was 20, but it was little things, like ""where did I put my keys?"" and the like.  I can't pinpoint where or when things started getting worse.

Just for clarification, I don't use drugs.  I've tried a few, and of those, only a few times or even just once.  Wasn't my thing so I never did it again.  I have drank a lot of alcohol, but not overmuch.  I am not an alcoholic, I drink to take the edge off.  Rarely do I drink to get drunk. 

My creativity doesn't suffer.  I can play, write and study music (even if the studying escapes me at times and I need to refresh.)  I can write books; I'm working on several ideas.  Other things like that, I can come up with quickly and retain them really well.  I do this often.

I can remember conversations, from long ago and recently, with great acuity and I can even correct people about who said what.

I am confused and increasingly scared.  I don't have health insurance, but I need to be examined, somehow.

This took me more than 30 minutes to type because I have to think really hard about what I *wanted* to say, but those thoughts were elusive.

One thing that has always scared me from a very young age is the possibility of alzheimers or dementia or something like that, even though it doesn't run in my family.  Those are *terrible,* but I am beginning to wonder if I'm deveolping something.  I don't want to live my life in that kind of state.

I need to say that in my life I have experiened a lot of sleeplessness.  That began at a very young age, and it was, from my own research, due to an imbalance of good life quality. About 6 years ago, I went 4 days with only one hour of sleep a night.  That landed me in the hospital.  But the older I got, the better it got, until recently.

201,"Hi everyone. I was told by a friend to reach out to speak to others who suffer from this. I was diagnosed in my early teens with hypochondria and severe anxiety disorder. Looking back, I was having these thoughts and feelings way before that. Even as a child. Doing some research most people get this due to a traumatic event (ex: death of a family member) but I can’t recall a single thing that could have possible triggered this. Can you be just born with it ? 
I recall my first ever major panic attack. I was in the 6th grade and our teacher passed us all around random newspaper clipping and told us to write a paragraph about what we learned. I picked up a random one and it was about lung cancer and second hand smoke. As I’m reading it I get really anxious and start the sweat. I get a lump in my throat and start crying. I couldn’t breath. It’s like as I was reading these symptoms , I started to actually FEEL them. I completely freaked. My teacher thought I was having an asthma attack. 
As I got older and obviously had access to the internet. It got so much worse. The darkest place I’ve ever been in mentally was age 15-17. I spend almost everyday in constant misery. Waking up and doing body checks. Every week it was something different. Everyday I was googling. I never wanted to seek help because one situation made me scared to do so. I was in the 9th grade and as I was sitting in class, I could feel myself being hyper focused on whatever body sensation was happening. I removed myself from class because I didn’t want to make a scene. I sobbed my way to the school counselor and explained to her what I was feeling. She looked me in the eyes and asked “are you making this up for attention?” 
I was speechless and just walked out. Ever since I’ve felt completely alone. I felt like I was insane. At some points it felt like I was going to seriously lose my mind. 
Obviously due to recent events, I can feel myself slipping back to that dark place again and I’m terrified. Sometimes I’m more scared of my mind at this point. I dread waking up and going through this cycle. I guess I don’t really know where this post is going. Maybe just to hear stories of others who have this. I just feel incredibly alone and I have Medicaid so finding mental health services are hard. I’ve been reaching out to those who accept my insurance but have been denied because I’m not suicidal. (Yes I was actually told that) 
Just feels like a lot of people take health anxiety as a joke. I feel like I’m stuck in my own misery and I literally can’t stop the thoughts. Feel free to share your stories. Thoughts. Opinions.

Since the diagnosis, I’ve been questioning whether or not it’s real, like my doctor possibly got it wrong and I’m actually fine. It’s difficult to explain and I haven’t been able to find anything else on here where people feel the same

On the days I’m really depressed I feel numb, hopeless and convinced that this has been how I’ve always felt, and that it’s permanent.

However I also have days where I feel slightly content. I almost forget I’ve ever felt depressed, and that I’m somehow fixed, and I’m silly for ever bothering the doctor. Then before I know it, in a few hours / the next day I’m back to feeling hopeless and anxious. 

Not really sure what I’m asking here, I guess I’m just trying to see if anyone can relate and maybe give some reassurance.

Even though things are good everything feels so uncertain. My life has been devoted to getting myself out of the situation I was in, now that has happened i feel lost. 

The guy i've started seeing may be leaving the country (for good). Although I like my job I know I don't want to do it forever. I feel like I don't really have a home or belong.

I wanted to share with this subreddit something that I'm actually genuinely proud of. I don't have a good group of people around me to talk to about substance use or behavioural addiction- most people don't know I struggle. 

I recently got out of an abusive relationship (we were engaged) and ended up relapsing into substance abuse. I was smoking, vaping, and drinking non-stop from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed. Then I relapsed into SH and my Eating Disorder. That is to say, after living with my fiancé in Fl, coming home was unraveling. 

Yesterday I started watching my partner's cats while they went out of town, and they left me beer, wine, and weed. I was completely alone in the house, no repercussions would face me. The urges were higher than they've ever been and to top it all off my ex-fiancé decided to call me from an unblocked number. But still, I didn't drink. I didn't smoke. Didn't vape. 

I felt like I finally regained a part of myself I had lost in my previous relationship. For the first time in YEARS, I feel genuinely proud of myself. 

TL;DR: I didn't do drugs yesterday and I feel proud of myself for the first time in YEARS

230,So most of my life since probably around 5-6th grade I’ve struggled with social anxiety and motivation problems. Back then I didn’t know it but I was soon diagnosed with GAD and a couple months later ADD. The first medication I was put on was a SSRI to see if that helped the anxiety. I went through about six different SSRI medications none of them worked. My doctor decided to try Adderall to see if it would help me focus more at school. I knew what adderall was and the risk of addiction it has but I ignored it and later didn’t seem to be a problem . The first pill I took was amazing it was like something clicked In my head and everything wrong with me was fixed. I could finally keep my grades up and talking to people witch was a huge struggle for me was incredibly easy. Long story short it stopped helping and I stopped taking it. Years later with no tolerance to stimulants or caffeine I decide to have a cup of tea. I don’t drink caffeine unless I work and I haven’t worked in a while. After i drank the tea I started to feel my focus increase and talking to people because easier.

I fantasise about moving to a foreign country where i have no contacts, and living a very traditional lifestyle in full solitude.

I was in an abusive relationship for a year and isolated myself from most of my friends and family. After getting out, I reconnected with old friends but it has been difficult to relate to them/be myself around them now. I find it easier to get along with people I met more recently through work because they were in my life when I was going through the abusive relationship. Anyway, that experience changed me and I feel more emotionally guarded/have a weird and dark sense of humor because of it. Which makes me feel “different” and like an outsider around my best friend who didn’t really know me like that before. I feel more normal around friends who share that same cynicism, because it’s a way to cope and feel okay but I just feel like a negative and bad person when I express that part of myself because they don’t share the same sense of humor.

I get it, I understand. You can always say “be happy”, “put a smile on your face” to someone, it is much easier said than done. But, my goal for each day is to ensure that at least ONE person can smile or change the negative aspects that they have. Of course, more the better. 

It will be an impossible task, but I want each member of this sub to be happy, to feel the need to be here, to be positive and happy when they are at the lowest of the low. Some people will laugh this off, while others will continue to read on and listen to what I have got to say.... I hope you are one of those. 

When it comes to being HAPPY, there are 7 key steps;

- Think Less, Feel More
- Frown Less, Smile More
- Talk Less, Listen More
- Judge Less, Accept Mor
- Watch Less, Do More
- Complain Less, Appreciate More
- Fear Less, Love More

And then I hear my brother and dad arguing, my brother going into his room, and my dad yelling some more as he stomped up the stairs. He started cursing at my older brother and trying to get in his room so he can beat his ass.

I move past my dad to see my mom on the stairs trying to make my dad stop while he's calling my brother names. She briefly tells me ""they were arguing, your dad pushed him, he swung at him (punch) and then they were fighting."" 

I don't know what to do. I knew my family wanted to kick my older brother out for being rude and never pulling his own weight but I never thought I would wake up to hear something so traumatic.

And now it gets worse. My mom tried talking to my brother while he packed. He had a meltdown, sobbing and punching his desktop saying he was ""so fucking tired of it"". When my mom asked what he was tired of he said ""he (My dad) is ABUSIVE! He's ABUSIVE and you fucking KNOW IT! BUT YOU'RE TOO SCARED TO SAY IT!"" My mom wasn't saying anything back. I ended up crying into her a bit before she left to pull up my brother's car and I told him the only reason she isn't talking is because she KNOWS he is correct. My dad has always had extreme anger issues but he had never hit a member of our family before.

I don't know how to feel or what to do. I'm scared and sobbing and shaking and everything just feels awful.


If you want more details please just ask. And PLEASE do not tell me to call 911. My mom was going to anyway but now the fight is over and my brother is packing up",19Jul2020,3
256,"My 11 year old daughter sent me a text message to come to her room. I walked in and she was sitting on the floor with a knife beside her. She had cut her hair off and was crying. I asked her why she cut her hair and she said because she was going to kill herself and wanted to cut her hair before she died because it’s something she always wanted to do but then she changed her mind and didn’t want to kill herself anymore but she is still sad and wants to die if she’s going to keep being sad but doesn’t actually want to die or kill herself. She said she isn’t sad all the time but she does feel sad every day. I am a SAHM, her dad works out of the house, and we also have an 8 year old son. What should I do?

258,My best friend quit her job today because she didn’t like it. For context we are both 17 and she had 2 jobs and I don’t have one. She liked to tease me with the fact she had 2 jobs and I didn’t have one (I used to have a job but quit February this year to work on my mental health). Her teasing often made me feel bad because she could hold down 2 jobs and I couldn’t even manage one. However she just told me she quit one of her jobs because she didn’t like it. I’m happy she’s quit the job but not because she hated it I’m happy because now she can’t tease me about her having 2 jobs. Should I only be happy about her quitting because she didn’t like the job? Am I a bad friend for being happy about her quitting her job purely for the reason that she can’t tease me with it anymore?,19Jul2020,1
259,"Please note: I know the reputation personality disorders have in general psychiatry and also I am a mental health specialist 

I have a long-standing diagnosis of EUPD/BPD and depression. These are both clinically treated and generally stable aside the occasional relapse and need for treatment, for which I now respond really well to 50mg of Sertraline. I’m 24 and I’ve been within mental health services since I was 18, I’ve had these disanoses set in stone since I was around 20-21. I have been on numerous anti depressants with different mechanisms of action and also Quetiapine, an anti psychotic which also has anti depressant properties which worked well for slowing my thoughts down and helping me take control for my behaviours but it gave me the worst headache and I could not function. For the last 2-3 years I have been experiencing chronic but fleeting auditory hallucinations. It’s difficult to explain but I will use my knowledge to describe these episodes: 

-(when stressed) I hear birds chirping extremely loudly. I wear ear plugs to sleep with and I find myself taking them out and listening really really hard and looking out of the window despite the time because they are so convincing to me. This isn’t a regular occurrence which I’m grateful for but I do find it distressing when it occurs and usually have to stay awake until I just fall asleep regardless... 

-I hear crowds. I found an audio that is spot on from a Tiktok and found so much comfort I’m not alone. I can never quite make out what they are saying it’s general crowd chatter, mixed genders and voices but it’s not internal this is mostly external and becomes a little anxiety provoking to even think of internally as a thought now. 

- when walking I will often hear people behind me and be convinced that someone is behind me. They’re not. This makes me feel on edge all the time, I’m so convinced but no one is there. I actually end up feeling a little relief when someone is! I can often hear them like a rustling or a movement or something but they aren’t there. 

- when listening to music the words and speech begins to float outside my head and feels like I’m listening to a radio instead. This one really freaks me out and I check my headphone jack and take out my head phones. It’s happened a few times again when I’m on my own with my thoughts but fully conscious. 

Ironically music can sometimes help drown out really clear external noises that I know aren’t there or are proven are not there. 

In general I’m a really jumpy person, I see things in the corner of my eye and jump, I’m paranoid something will happen to me for no reason at all. The only thing that stops me feeling I need an anti psychotic is my insight, but then again do I need to treat this if it is distressing me? 

My heads a bit of a mess as I have just been on a walk (normal) but experienced most of these things, especially the voices in the music drifting outside the headphones and become outside and all around me and feeling distressed. Apologises for spelling errors I just want some reassurance as to what on Earth I should do. I still have a community psychiatrist and I don’t know whether to get in touch with her or not. 

EDIT: I should mention I have a strong family history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder on my mothers side, and my father has always been a paranoid person. He developed dementia and became extremely suspicious and paranoid, and now is treated on Risperidone. 

Thanks in advance!",19Jul2020,1
260,For the past month and counting I’ve been having really bad dissociation episodes due to some recent (Albeit traumatic) life changes and it’s been causing me to be way more forgetful than usual. I’m pretty forgetful but it’s never this bad. I don’t remember half of anything my friends tell me and it’s leading them to think I don’t care. My family already thinks I don’t care about them because of this. I can’t remember for shit. I truly have to write everything down or else I won’t know. I’m forgetting faces as well. Everyone is just blending in one. I’m literally confused at this point. I’m such a bad friend because a friend could tell me that we’re supposed to do xyz and I’ll cancel at the last minute because I forgot again. I’ve completely lost sense of time.

262,"I(21f) have clinical depression and I admit I let it control me more than I should most times. I just moved in with my bf(25m) and in these 3 months living together he’s noticed it a lot. I work part time so I usually have 3 days off a week and don’t go in to work till later in the day. I have no motivation or energy to do anything so those days I don’t work or work late, I will sleep all day. I know I have stuff to do like walk the dogs, eat, or even just clean the house and I lay there telling myself I have stuff to do. But I just lay there. So it’s a little upsetting for him to get home knowing that I’ve been home all day or only worked a few hours and see that the house is a mess still. We’ve talked about it a lot , And he’s trying to be understanding but it’s extremely frustrating for him. He says he wouldn’t even be mad about the house if I still did something with my day, like did a hobby or something. I used to love playing my video games, playing with my dog and coloring. He says if I was just doing something like that all day then he wouldn’t care that the house wasn’t clean, as long as I was doing something with my day. I get headaches a lot through the week, and sometimes they make me feel so sick that I feel like I can’t go in to work so I call out. This upsets him because he thinks I’m overreacting and being a crybaby and says that there are people every day I feel what I feel or worse I still manage to function and go to work. There’s also days where my anxiety acts up and I know that I’m going to have a panic attack at some point so I choose to play it safe and stay home, which is something else he thinks I can also just get over. I know he’s not trying to say it in a rude way but sometimes he gets upset and tells me to just stop being a crybaby and suck it up like an adult. He’s really trying to be understanding and help me through it all but I feel like he’s not able to do that because he doesn’t have an understanding of what I’m going through. He thinks it’s just me feeling sorry for myself all the time and being sad and lazy. Is there some sort of article or something that explains it’s not something people just get over, that it’s an actual imbalance in my brain? I tried medication to help but some days I just couldn’t bring myself to take my medicine even though I knew I had to, so I gave up on that. We are trying to just get me to do more activities with him to see if it helps motivate me, but I just want him to understand how hard it is for me and what I’m going through without thinking I’m being overdramatic.",19Jul2020,2

265,"Just wanted to ask reddit and see how many other people do this: 

I very frequently have conversations with myself in my head. Sometimes with myself, just debating particular subjects or working out problems or trying to decide what to have for dinner. This i'm sure almost everyone does. But also often with other people, usually friends, family members or acquaintances that aren't actually present. I want to preface this by saying that I defintely don't think these conversations are real, or feel like those people are there when they aren't. Its not a delusion or hallucination, im fully aware that they aren't there and that it isn't a real conversation, and I dont have issues separating that from reality. Its also not out loud but just in my mind. 

But its just so frequent for me, basically anytime my mind isn't directly occupied with some task that requires my full attention, im day dreaming of hypothetical conversations. Perhaps im thinking of cooking a certain dish and discussing the steps and what i could add with a friend I know also likes to cook, or talking about what im doing differently with my budget with another friend I know has issues budgeting, and so on. Its been this way really as long as I can remember. I've never really thought about it until now, since ive been struggling with anxieties focused on my health, both physical and mental, and I get worried that maybe this is a sign of a mental disorder. Do lots of other redditors do this? Or am I slowly going crazy lol.",19Jul2020,1

The best news?


I built this particular one on The Ricky Gervais Show featuring Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington - all the transcripts I could find ;)

I built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...

271,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub to ask this, so please point me to where I should go if I’m in the wrong place. 

I’ve always had a really hard time with numbers. I can’t seem to do simple division (apart from anything from the 2 and 5 times tables), I cannot wrap my head around fractions or percentages. I can add and subtract smaller numbers just fine, but larger numbers are often wrong. 

When someone starts talking to me about numbers I often feel like my brain gets overwhelmed and I get completely lost.

Whenever I pay for something, I simply cannot calculate how much I need to pay so I’m often given back extra notes/coins or asked for more.

These are just a few examples of many and I’ve often wondered if I was just really bad at math or if this was some sort of thing that exists. 

Last Friday, my partner spent over an hour trying to explain to me how long division works and how I could divide fractions, even though I learned all of it in school. I still don’t get the fractions. It just made me start wondering if there’s something going on here. I know that people have difficulties remembering faces and names and such, so it doesn’t seem too far off. 

Does such a thing exist and what do we know about it?

275,"Sex: male
Age: 25
Height: 5’ 7”
Weight: 160lbs 


Recovered alcoholic (Sober since 02/17/2020) Started drinking at 16. Drank heavily (5-10 drinks per day) from about 21 years old to 25 years old. 

Diagnosed with ADHD, currently unmedicated as the IR stimulants made me feel like having a heart attack. Very hard to focus, very inefficient person. Triggered my anxiety. 

Suspicion of PTSD (sex related trauma from childhood) I have frequent flashbacks, BAD premature ejaculation, have no trust, phobia of intimacy and intercourse. I am tired of turning down people that I genuinely am attracted to. I run away from the situations while it’s the thing I want most in the world. Basically what happened is my first intimate partner pretended to be pregnant, then pretended to have miscarriaged said baby by smearing period blood all over the walls, then later pretended my best friend raped her. She then pretended to develop schizophrenia (or perhaps that part is real, I think it was but who the fuck knows) and would cry and say she saw visions of me as a small child walking behind me irl or lurking in shadows. She became incredibly promiscuous and vengeful when I broke up with her, telling the entire school I raped her and hit her. My mom even had to meet with the school’s admins about this. I was 14-16 years old during this experience. 

Suspicion of aspergers. Intense interests, low empathy. I feel like I use intellect instead of intuition during conversations. Easily overwhelmed especially when there’s a lot of sounds/people talking. I am burnt out more than I feel rested, seemingly much more than most people. It’s weird, I’m always lonely but I’m annoyed when I’m around anybody. I don’t know if I’ve actually felt love for anyone, except for the person who caused my traumatizing experience.  I HATE change and any deviation from my routines. 

Suspicion of GAD. I have a lot of anxiety. I’ve had 2-3 really really bad panic attacks where I’m positive I’m dying of a heart attack (and felt weirdly relieved at the thought of dying). I also have small panic attacks several days out of the week where it feels like my blood pressure plummets, my left arm and heart feel numb/light pressure and I get dizzy. But i can usually talk myself out of those panic attacks. Also sometimes I get panic attacks while thinking about panic attacks so let’s move on.


I can’t remember the last time I felt happy, or felt comfortable. Durning lockdown was the only time in my life, since I was a child, where the pace of being alive felt right. Otherwise everything moves way too quick.

Lastly, I feel displaced. Mom lives in Germany, dad lives in USA. I lived in both places, but don’t feel like either are home. I have zero close friends and dislike my family except my parents. 

I have a check up soon with a new GP. Last check up was over 4 years ago. Any tips on how to help him help me? I don’t want to overwhelm the guy xD Should I perhaps try an extended release adderall or a nonstimilant variant like strattera for adhd symptoms? 

Any tips on getting closer to people and becoming less afraid of sex? The premature ejaculation (and resulting fear of being judged harshly due to poor sexual performance) plays a big role in this. 

I guess the general big question is do I do therapy, medication, a mix of both?

My father says I shouldn’t seek any kind of medication and that I strictly have PTSD from being sexually abused. He doesn’t want me to mention adhd, aspergers or any other cognitive issue as he believes I am creating “false narratives in my head“ about those ailments. This is very hurtful, but I figured I’d mention it here in an objective manner.",19Jul2020,1
