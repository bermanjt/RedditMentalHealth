2,"Hi, I’m a high school senior. As you may or may not know, the college application process can be extremely stressful. Well I recently had to learn this the hard way. You see, I’ve been rejected from a total of 6 schools thus far. Mind you these quite competitive, but I’m also not a particularly bad student. I just received a decision from my dream school: rejected. My best friend, she got in. All my other friends already know where they’re going. And I just feel awful. 

Someone please just tell me everything is going to be okay. Please.",21Mar2020,1
3,"When I was in 12th grade, I got a 'D' on one of my exams because I completely blanked out; all the elite universities I had applied to rescinded my admission, and I thought I'd hit a dead-end. Started community college, worked really hard, sacrificed my social life, and transferred into a top-tier school. Here also I worked really hard, and now I am one quarter away from graduating. I am a psyc major, interested in cogsci, so I took a lot of math courses; this quarter I took three and I am sure I'm going to flunk each one of them. My gpa is going to plunge, and my grad school plans are thwarted. Moreover,  I couldn't get into the one class I need to graduate -- so now if I don't somehow get off the waitlist, I will have to stay back and pay full out-of-state tuition for a single course. Moreover, I am on an immigrant visa, and if I don't complete certain paperwork, I won't be able to stay or work here. I don't have any home or family in my ""home"" country; in fact, I haven't gone back in 12 years. In the past few years, I've had a single-minded focus on my education -- spend 16+ hours studying in the library, have no friends, no moments that I have enjoyed -- turned into a bitter and lonely person.  And yet, I have nothing to show for it - no internships, no job offers, no stellar academic achievements -- I don't even know if I'll get a degree. The only silver lining was a research project with a professor in a field that I deeply passionate about but with the current circumstances, I don't think that will continue. Even if it does, nothing really changes. My family has invested so much financially, and I have achieved nothing. I can't even be with them anymore, in spite of their best efforts. I really thought I had finally overcome my 12th grade debacle but I failed again - this time even more miserably. All my peers have graduated, are working, in steady relationships, and I feel spent, burnt out, worthless, and lonely. I have nothing. What was the point of all this? Of coming so close to my dream, only to see that I don't have it in me to pursue it? Or that in spite of all the sacrifice, I will never make it. The only few moments that I think I've enjoyed in the past few years was when I might've had a little wine (very lightweight) and felt like I had no care in the world! Other than that, I have nothing. I wish I had gone to parties, hooked up, developed friendships --  there's nothing joyful in my life anymore. The only constant is anxiety, inadequacy, paranoia, and self-hate. I'M SICK OF THIS. Nothing changes, nothing gets better. I just want this to end.",21Mar2020,1
4,"For the past 3 months I have been dealing with cascading health issues in my life that have seriously affected my mood and well-being. First there was a panic attack, then there was residual anxiety for two months after the attack, then I got severe sciatica pain out of nowhere and it has been constant for 2+ weeks, and since then, I’ve been stuck in a fog of anxiety, sadness, rumination, and negative thoughts. Worst of all, I’ve started experiencing significant cognitive issues which scares the crap out of me and causes more anxiety (short term memory issues, trouble putting sentences and words together in my head, and trouble concentrating), all at 30 years old.   

It’s all taken a massive toll on my mental health and I feel completely trapped and miserable. I spend all day sitting around trying to figure out how I can feel better and nothing comes to me. I’ve even cried a few times which is something I never do. I’ve never been depressed in my life, and besides for the past three months of health issues, I have a pretty great life.   

I saw my GP who didn’t do much for me except tell me my sciatica can take months to resolve. He also said if the anxiety continues he can give me an SSRI to help, which is something I don’t want to do unless absolutely necessary. I am just so lost, stuck, and sad.

8,"One, I’m really glad this is a subreddit. 💛
Two, onto my question and a little background. I have two friends that I have declared for myself as toxic friendships. I haven’t told them and am not quite sure how. I have stepped back from talking to them and seeing them. One of them is giving me space and the other is hounding my fiancé about me and came to see me at my work since I haven’t been hanging out with her. I am trying to tell myself to give them credit and they can handle me telling them I need to step back from our friendship because it’s causing me a lot of stress (for various reasons that I won’t go into too much detail to keep the post short), but the one who asks my fiancé about me also relies on me for a lot emotionally and tells me how sad she’s been if I don’t talk to her about things going on with her. I have a counseling appointment next week (finally recently got affordable health care) and plan to talk with him about it, but had a panic attack in my shower over it yesterday, so reaching out earlier to some of you who have maybe had to break off a toxic friendship before. I just don’t have the energy in me to really be anyone’s person but my own right now... Thoughts, feelings, ideas on help with wording, etc.?",21Mar2020,1

10,"I’m a freshman and college and we all got kicked out of the dorms. I am so anxious and sad because my household situation is toxic. I was only prepared to come home for a month during the summer before I moved into my apartment for sophomore year. I had to say goodbye to all my friends that are genuinely the best people I have ever met. I feel like the quarantine is going to make it so hard to visit those that live within a reasonable distance from me (3-5 hour drive) 

I was thinking today about how I’m going to have to be home tomorrow and I wanted to throw up. I cannot imagine having to back there I know my mental health is going to decline so quickly. My main concern is having to see my dad. He’s just awful and all he does is drink and yell. Another thing is when I left my sisters swapped beds around so I no longer have a bed to sleep in. It’s also just generally chaotic just being there. I’ve told myself that I’ll run, workout, and keep busy with school, but I’m worried that will only last a month or so. 

I also worry that this quarantine will only get worse and I’m stressed about being stuck in my house for five months straight. 

I also recently broke up with my girlfriend (on and off for 5 years, but I finally called it quits and have been so happy) and she reached out into right before I spring break started. I really am worried she will try to contact me during this whole mess because we will both be back home. I don’t want to feel guilted into talking to her and I have no desire to talk to her. It’s making me so anxious. 

I was getting to a place where I felt good and happy with where I was at. I don’t want to lose progress.",21Mar2020,1
11,"I've had this problem because something happened in my life a time ago.

I can never trust people, like never. I can't message members of my family due to being scared of *something?* I don't know what it is. I just can't speak to new people or tell people about my interests or what I do, it's fucking annoying. If I do accidentally say something and then I realise I say it (this could be anything) I would immediately be crying inside (eh) and then have tension headaches. I say something funny to someone and then I think they'll do something. 

Any pictures of me is a no go, someone could take one and do *something* with it; even family members.

Sometimes when I go outside I always think someone is spying on me, speaking about me, taking pictures of me. I always think someone is going through my stuff or is going to plan something against me. 

If someone does something (literally anything) I just can't respond as I think my answers could make them want to do something, but I also think me not responding can lead them to do something, causing more tension headaches.

If I say something slightly offensive to someone and they laughed (like a banter insult) I would immediately get worried, and they would do something.

15,"I'm gonna start this off by saying I'm not that good at reddit, I don't know formatting or much and my acc was made recently.  


I'm a 14 year old working as a game designer for an anonymous roblox game. I want to be a 3D modeler and a game designer and this just fits everything I want to be when I grow up. Roblox would prob be the best place for me to get this kind of job at my age. My parents don't want me to get this kind of job and think I ""should get a real job"". This game has 6 game modes, Hostage, Search and Destroy, King of the Hill, Gun Game, FFA, and TDM. It's kind of like a mash up of all game modes. This game has managers who manage a lot of stuff like the reddit, twitter, discord, and talks. The owner does talk a lot in general and is very active.   


Despite this, he doesn't seem to like me. The game has a small esports following so there are a lot of competitive elements to think of as well. He didn't think of this and the only thing that could add strategy that other roblox games don't have are ""specials"" which are guns that can't be achieved in the game normally. This wouldn't be that well for comp and this game has no eco despite basically being a csgo with more gamemodes, and because of that unless specials were AK's and AWP's, it wouldn't be useful. I have thought of MANY ideas to try to help this as there are other games with a comp scene (kind of a shocker really) and it won't work at all with his ideas. Despite this he has ignored everything and lied to my face to ignore all my ideas. One time he said he was doing an essay and he would look at my ideas later, despite we were both playing the game at the same time, and he kept playing for an hour. He blatantly lies to me and acts like I'm an idiot.  


He also completely ignores me and doesn't answer any of my questions for the TWO maps I am making. He also has given worse builders permanent jobs as developers and even manager jobs, and yet he avoids to even give me any permanent spot, and I don't know how long I will be till I am fired. He makes me feel unappreciated and awful and I am currently depressed. I can't tell my parents as if I do I can never become a game designer in the future. I can't tell any of the staff, as if he finds out I would probably get fired (despite him never giving me a permanent spot). If I tell nobody I will be sad till I quit or get an actual job for a game design team, but I will be able to peruse my dream job.

I'm not suicidal but I sure as hell have been and will be again in the future. My mind is shattered fragments. Fragments that refuse to believe in reality. Fragments that play over and over again all the bad things I've ever done. And the fragments that still spin up irrational phobias. They all swirl like a tornado. I'm caught in the middle.

I have no way of going back in time, maybe if I go far enough away. That I will never see anyone I ever knew ever again, that I could create an actual personality for myself.

As I get older I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact my mum has BPD - specifically the paranoid subtype. 
Don't get me wrong, I had an objectively great childhood. I've come out of it as a well rounded person in a happy relationship, good career, no mental health issues ect. 
However, as time has gone on certain aspects of my childhood have come to the forefront. 
Firstly throughout my childhood we've had numerous fallings out with my Dad's sides relatives, my mums relatives, my family friends ect. to the point where my parents have NO friends at all and I am estranged from my entire family both sides of my family. Throughout this time my mum has made it out like she is the victim in all of this and I believed her. As I’ve grown older I’ve learnt that there’s a lot more nuiance to it and I’ve also heard incredibly bias versions of the stories so I don’t know what to believe anymore. 
Secondly, I was definitely over mothered. She literally did everything for my sister and I. Which was good at the time but probably wasn’t a healthy thing for me I had no life skills after I moved out of home. Since I’ve gotten older she has never really moved on from the baby phase… she wishes I was a kid again and still talks to me like I’m a child. Using old names she used to call me as a child ect. 
What has come to the forefront of this whole issue about her is that I thought she would be different with my fiancee and her family. But she hasn’t been. 
She’s never been ‘warm’ to my fiancée despite her being anything but an angel to her. She gets jealous of my relationship with her and her family. She has this ‘us’ vs ‘them’ mentality. 
This has gotten worse when organising my wedding. She has made every step along the way a massive deal. Blowing everything out of proportion. This came to a head when she went off at my mother in law for asking her for a photo of what her outfit looked liked! 
I have a lot of cognitive dissonance with the whole siuation. I love my mother and everything she has done for me. I am also acutely aware that she is I’m sorry to say a very toxic person that estranges herself from every relationship. It has now got o the point where its encroaching into my personal life. 
I’m so fortunate that my fiancée is an angel and would never tell me to cut her off or anything but I really don’t know what to do. Apart from vent here.

31,"Hi all, 

I don’t know if this is the place for this, but I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I’ve been experiencing a lot of addictive behaviors under stressful times, such as now. 

Since before this quarantine began, I was already isolating in an attempt to self-reflect. I am going through a break-up and have also been dealing with emotional turmoil regarding my parents because one of them is very sick but also emotionally and verbally abusive, so it’s been an overwhelming and confusing time for me. This sudden pandemic occurring also raises major symptoms of anxiety and depression in me. This snowball effect of bad news has gotten to me and I’ve resorted to addictive behaviors such as binge-eating, zoning-out on shows, and just generally breaking promises to myself. I’ve been doing unhealthy things that “comfort” me, but it only feels that way because I’m distracted from reality. I’m mostly overwhelmed and am not used to healthy ways of dealing with issues because of how I grew up, but I’m beginning to connect more dots and am working on moving forward to becoming a better version of myself. 

Realizing my addictive behavior is one step closer to that version of myself. However, my coping skills have gone completely down the drain recently, and I’ve been over-eating junk food and haven’t gone to the gym in over a month (I had already stopped going two weeks before the virus hit my city). 

Does anyone have any suggestions or contributions on how to ease out of this addictive ritual? I do it because I get to veg out after work while watching something fun, but it makes me feel unmotivated and uninspired, guilty and ashamed. There’s obviously a lot of deeper issues that are the undercurrents of my addiction, but if you can help a sista out with all this, I’d really appreciate it.

He’s very temperamental and since I was really young I’ve had to experience his anger and yelling and I think it has made it impossible for me to like him.

It was my beer bottle that I had discarded in the back yard and he was really mad at me for littering. He kept yelling at me for it and I just stopped listening because it’s impossible to talk to somebody when they’re yelling like that. Then, because I was ignoring him, he took my phone and threw it at a painting in my room, breaking the painting and the phone. He threw it so hard that glass shattered everywhere and the phone and the phone case were dented pretty bad. I jumped out of bed to get my phone and told my dad he needed to calm down but that only made him more angry. I was in a very calm state at this point because I was emotionally blunted from depression so I was not in the mood to fight my dad at all but when I told him to calm down he put his finger on my chest and basically told me to fuck off. He just held his finger on my chest waiting for me to make a move. I told him not to touch me and he said “what’re you gonna do about it” like he was just waiting for an excuse to kick my ass. I told him I wouldn’t fight him and he called me a pussy.Of course I wasn’t gonna fight him because that’s insane but I could see in his eyes that he really wanted me to. This was during a time when I was the most depressed I’d ever been and he was completely aware of that. He never apologized and when I told my mom what happened, she took his side. After my mom took his side, I never told anyone about it again. That was the worse incident with him and overall he’s had that kind of attitude my entire life. I realize that a lot of people have way worse parents so I dont feel justified in not liking my dad. I felt this way before this specific incident because I grew up with him yelling and cussing at me; this is the most extreme example. Another example I just remembered is when I was 11 and my dog tore a tiny quarter inch hole  in the carpet and my dad lost it and threatened to kill my dog and then he said he would take my dog to the pound. He never hurt my dog but he made those very serious threats and he never apologized or gave me any sort of resolution. I feel bad for not liking my dad because  he tries to be nice and I can tell he wishes I liked him more but the simple truth is that his presence has always made me uncomfortable. Is normal for me to feel this way about my dad or am I just too sensitive?",21Mar2020,1
40,"Hello! I’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask but here goes..I was wondering if I Misophonia, a mental illness that makes you have a strong reaction to ‘trigger sounds’. To clarify when I hear certain things, people chewing, loud breathing, my sister laughing really loud, when my mum has news/music on loud, etc.. I just get super annoyed and frustrated and I can’t really focus on anything and I almost feel like crying. I try to subtly cover my ears or block it out.

41,"Ever since the coronavirus got serious, I’ve had terrible, long periods of dissociation. It genuinely feels like I’m not even here, or that this is all a fake reality I’m in, and I have trouble remembering anything while it’s happening. I’ve always gotten dissociative “episodes” but lately its been so intense. 

My depression has also gotten a lot worse. I had to move out of my college campus and head home. My whole family is practicing social isolation because we believe we should, but being at home all day, everyday is very reminiscent of the times where I was so depressed I couldn’t get out of bed. The feeling is coming back as well, as I depended on daily social interaction from my college life as a distraction from depression. Trying to force myself to be productive or do anything at all, even things I enjoy, is becoming harder and harder again. 

Any tips or advice welcome.",21Mar2020,1

So seriously. Is willing to risk my financial security (aka job) a sign that i may need to check myself in? I fantasize about suicide but it really is more of a fantasy than a plan. It just sounds so nice for it all to end. I feel my eyelids getting heavy just thinking about it. The peace. The rest. So... Soothing? Idk. I'm just tired.",21Mar2020,1
43,"In attempts to explain my predicament, I'm going to grossly oversimplify my past 3-4 years of attempting to get a grip on my PTSD symptoms. I was diagnosed with the disorder after an assault event, but this has been compounded with an underlying generalized anxiety disorder that has also spun me into a really bad depression that I've yet to escape from (my mother has also suspected that I have some high functioning autism spectrum disorder, but this has yet to be diagnosed and has only been concluded by my mother and her friend with autistic children of her own. So take that as you will, but it may be important for my situation? Idk I've only ever thought that I exhibited some similar symptoms that are unrelated). I went through a really rough time where I couldn't go outside cause I feared the potential for my assaulter to come back, and still have problems where I am constantly imagining the worst case scenario for a potential assault and fervently working my way through these made up scenarios that seem completely plausible until I actually ask myself why I'm even thinking about it. I used to do this as a child where I would imagine myself in arguments to prepare myself for bullies, but not to the current extent of violence where I'm now imagining what reaction I should have if a man came in and threatened my co-workers and I with a gun, despite this never once occurring in my life.


This is further perpetuated by my parents who are some of the most verbally and, in a few cases, physically abusive people I've ever had the displeasure of knowing. There's the common stuff where they are extremely Christian (I'm not) and anti-gay/LGBT (I'm bi and currently in a relationship of the same sex), which puts me in the shitty situstion of having to appease these guys constantly while my dad rants about ""the gay agenda"" and trans people somehow being worse than literal Nazis. All I'm allowed to do is bite my tongue as I try to hold myself back from punching him through the teeth. To say my dad is more of the aggressor than my mom is would be an understatement, as he's been the main source of strife throughout the entire family and not just myself. He's gotten my brother to move out of the house and my sister to call the police on him, both of which were incited by me having a panic attack or finally having enough of their bullshit and standing up for myself. As you can imagine, both times involved than verbally berating me or even getting physical with me to an unreasonable degree, hence why I fought back against them. But I can vividly remember this always being the case, one such instance being when I was literally yelled into a corner, crying, and was told that I'm only bawling my eyes out to get him to stop as a form of emotional manipulation. I'm currently 18, and that was, at minimum, 7 years ago. Let that sink in for a second. An 11 year old, is crying, to get you to stop hurting them emotionally/physically. K then. There's the constant me kissing up to them or apologizing when I really didn't need to do so, only so that I can scrape by and not live in fear of them (mainly my dad). But as of late I haven't let it be that way, because in my dumbass mind, I'm sick of being treated like a piece of shit by my dad and I've gone to challenge him on several occasions. It's very difficult to express just how awful he is to this family, but imagine that scenario I mentioned earlier occurring several times each month across all 4 of those weeks, and then you essentially get what I have going on in terms of emotional severity. A more recent example that I can bring up was actually in January of this year, where he slapped me several times and incited my PTSD to come flooding back, yet when I told him to stop he kept going as though he gets to do whatever the hell he wants. What caused said argument? Which side of the fucking sink the dishes go in. I got slapped across the face twice, shoved into the stove with my head slamming into the cabinets as he twists my arm behind me back, told I can't leave with my belongings and had my backpack ripped open to get said stuff away from me, over, fucking, dishes. I'll guide them Credence where it is due, I did say inflammatory things to them, specifically after my own father assaulted me again and had to have a stupid pissing match with those shit heads for three hours. Even typing about it now it's frankly difficult as my entire body is trembling, but it's all excused by ""oh he felt bad about it that he didn't get out of bed"". Which is quite fucking hilarious as that's the night my sister called the police and they told me that they're ""not here to resolve our problems and hear about the abuse"". So, yeah, police didn't fucking help so I ran away that night, I ended up coming back but I have had it with them. But the issue is that I'm still here, and I'm living in a war zone of negativity essentially.


And here's the main part of my problem, the negativity is spewing over into my relationship and I need help trying to fix myself. In short, negative shit is occurring every day in this household, my dad calling my mom a bitch, my mom screaming and waking me up with anxiety coursing through my veins, and it just seems to be an endless stream of shit with these assholes. My only solace has been playing video games, working, listening to music, and ranting to my boyfriend about the shitty scenarios. But to be frank I rant far too often, and I've had to come to admit that I'm not doing enough to bring positivity to the relationship. Often times I either just want to be left alone in my own sorrow or don't have much positive to say. I have been on anti depressants and anti-ptsd medication, both trial runs with the medicines have shown little results, and I don't feel like I'm getting much of anywhere in terms of progress with therapy. Not to say that I haven't been going to therapy, I go every week, but I still struggle a lot with this onslaught of shit. I don't feel that I've done enough to fix myself and my mindset, and that's been confirmed by my boyfriend telling me so as well. The issue they I find it that he's told me ""then do it"" literally and figuratively in response to me saying that I want to progress and be better for him. There was a lot more said than just that and it's put me in the right direction (I'm going to try to discuss ways to progress forward with my own therapist for my own health), however I still feel the need for additional information on what the hell do to from here. I feel that I've become abusive and that I'm letting my dad ruin me in a sense, and I just don't know what to do to move forward and progress. My first inclination is to move out, but the problem is that I live in California and plan to go to college here, and rent is notoriously high. I had plans that fell through where I would share an apartment with some friends, but none of them have stable jobs to do so. I'm just thoroughly stumped and I feel caged, I want to be better but I don't know what the first step to recovery should be, I thought I tried everything but I'm overwhelmed and don't know where to start. If any of you have advice on what to do, I'm more than willing to take it, be as blunt with me as you feel is necessary to get your point across, part of me feels like that's what I need right now, even if it hurts.",21Mar2020,1

45,"TW self harm, reference to violence

For my whole life I’ve had violent thoughts. I think we all have them sometimes. But as I get older sometimes I go into such a rage that I think I may act on them. 

And sometimes when I think that if I did act on them, that I would go to jail, I feel *bad.*

It’s mainly against my mom. I resent her. I hate her. She is not even abusive but she’s certainly unstable and incompetent. When I get extremely mad at her, sometimes I get so angry that I literally have to hurt myself to avoid attacking her. This has manifested several times by me smashing my head against the wall. Sometimes I also cut myself. The head smashing is mainly when she won’t leave me alone. Often when we fight she won’t walk away. I will try to make her leave but she will have me basically in a corner screaming at her to go, but she won’t, and will act like I’m the one who refuses to walk away. 

There are also times after one of us has walked away that I am still absolutely livid and have so much pent up anger that I need to let it out. I often try to let it out by cutting myself or hurting myself, but sometimes I want to direct the anger outwards. I normally restrain myself from breaking things even though I find it extremely difficult to. But I always find myself wanting to destroy my mom’s things or do something worse. Not necessarily go and hurt her but do something less directly. I have wanted to poison her at times or other less severe things. I came close to rubbing her toothbrush in the toilet once. But I didn’t.

It’s strange though, because I am not a violent person. At least I don’t think. I just get so angry and the only way to let it out is through violence. It’s also doubly weird that I never get this angry at other people. Yeah, I do get angry at people, but never to this extent. And when I am, I act like a normal angry person. I even tend to avoid confrontation. But to my mom, I’m a fucking monster. And honestly I am ashamed to say it, but I don’t even feel bad about how I treat her. She deserves it in my eyes. She is a terrible person and the reason I’m so fucked up. She passed down all of her mental illnesses to me. I’ve mentioned in other posts that I hate her because our negative traits are so similar. But I think she’s worse than me because she is in a position of power as my parent and it builds her ego. 

Now that I think about it I think I have anger issues. Not necessarily that I get angry easily, but that when I am angry, I cannot control myself. 

I want to say that I’m not a threat to her. I’m not gonna kill her. I just wanted to vent about my concerning thoughts and violent urges.

I need to talk to my therapist, but good ol’ quarantine. I don’t think I’ll be able to go to my next appointment. I kinda hope I can. But also this virus is making my anxiety worse.

48,"Yesterday I washed up, hoovered my room, worked out for 2 hours, and cut my own hair. Tonight I’m laying in bed unable to sleep because I can’t stop thinking about how toxic I’ve been since birth. 

When I was 7 my best friend called me a control freak cause I wouldn’t let him join choir. I can’t stop thinking about that. That’s not the only thing I did. I literally tried to control every inch of my mother’s life as a child. I refused to go to the toilet unless she took me. I refused to dress like a girl, only boys clothes. I refused to wear laces, only Velcro. I wouldn’t let her sleep until I fell asleep. I’d scream every shop down. t’s seems small but god did I wear my mother down. I was toxic. Like what the hell was wrong me? 

I don’t think I had any empathy for people. That’s probably normal right? not to have empathy at that age? Like I just saw people as existing for my benefit, to do what I wanted. Do you develop empathy? Am I a sociopath? Surely if I was I wouldn’t be feeling guilty about all of this. Maybe I was just spoilt. 

Much to think about. Had to vent it out cause if it lingers in my mind any longer I’ll have a break down. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but the guilt is making me hate myself and now I can’t sleep. 

Maybe seeing a therapist is due.",21Mar2020,1

I love my parents, but deep down I know I'm disappointing them, I'm a loser with no friends, I'm shit at everything I do, and I am struggling with some serious mental health issues, but I'm too afraid to get help, and figure out what the hell is wrong with me.",21Mar2020,1
51,"For the past couple months or so I have had the horrible urge to find certainty in something. So for instance, when I find out about something, I try to be certain about it. So for instance, just as an example, if I were to find out that a person I respect is an arrogant asshole, then I want to be certain about it. I will try and find a source. I can look for hearsay, but when I find the majority of people agree on one notion, I tell myself I can’t know if they’re right. Then I look for another source that claims another things about that person, how can I know if they’re not lying? That’s the question that pops into my head.

Nothing short of seeing it with my own eyes will satisfy me. And even when I do find a reliable source, and my logic and reasoning says that one conclusion is right I’ll always question myself. So I can’t know if I’m right or wrong about that person.

It’s not about being right either, because I’ll always question myself. It’s always about being certain. And I always question my own logic. I have this need for certainty which can never be fulfilled as I’ll endlessly question myself.

Is there a way to help with this a little?",21Mar2020,1
52,"I have found myself going into a bit of a depressive state which flicks in and out during winter for the past 3 years (I'm now 18), but this year feels a bit different.

I have lost my apetite, but if I get myself food I eat it faster then I ever have. I know I'm not eating as much as i should at the moment but I just have a slight disgust for food and I don't know why.

I have waves of anxiety, and flick between being very sad/irritable to VERY high energy/ elated moods. I've looked up manic symptoms and I don't feel like i'm suddenly going to quit my job or spend heaps of money which leads me to believe this isn't something to worry about. An example of an elated mood for me is spontaneously sticking pictures all over my wall without a lot of consciousness (it feels like my body is doing it for me and it HAS to be perfect). I'm very shaky and can't stop my face from twitching sometimes.

Sometimes I feel like I'm drunk or really high on something, and often forget things that I have done in the past minute.

I often feel like I'm not quite in my body and it's just going  through the motions without me having much control at all.

I have depression and bipolar disorder in my family, so I'm wondering if this might have anything to do with it?

Is this something I should be concerned about? Or should I just ride it out; it's been going on for a couple weeks. Any advice would be helpful.",21Mar2020,1
53,"Hell, I may not see her *ever again.*

She is a free therapist provided to me by my university and, because of that, she can only practice her services in state. I'm an out of state student.

She was the first therapist I've gone to willingly. I've had about half a dozen child psychiatrists throughout the years tell me and my parents I was probably going to be fucked up but hey, at least I wasn't having a psychotic break at six years old!

Just when I was feeling...alive. Vulnerable. And exposed. And...*extremely uncomfortable.* But alive.

I've been dissocating my entire life, feeling nothing, as a protective mechanism. She began to tap at that wall, in our five weeks talking. She just began to peek under the surface, but not in an intrusive manner. I wanted her to. I *trusted* her to. And trust is *a rarity.* I trust one person in this world, and that's my mother. I don't trust myself. And I thought, I *truly* thought, that I could trust her.

And now she is gone.

Maybe forever. Maybe for only a few months until the quarantine is over and I'm back for the fall semester.

But still...I'm left raw and exposed and vulnerable, completely unsure of how to handle these new emotions I'm feeling. I've always been numb, felt like a corpse, and that was fine. It was my normal. But recently I was *actually suicidal,* and I realized that my lovely therapist had torn open a chasm and shit is just spewing out and I don't know how to deal with it, but I also can't close it and just be a zombie like I was before.

I'm...*stuck.* I'm a work in progress, a half-cooked cake and the oven just fucking broke. I don't know what to do.

I have no idea what to do.

I can't afford a therapist. I *have* to talk to the free university ones. But I won't be back in state for months. And I...Do I have to find a way to be okay with just being *exposed* like this? With a fucking cavity ripped open with no needle and thread *nor* something to cauterize it with for the time being? I'm bleeding out! What the fuck do I do? Sure, this may sound like small potatoes for some of you but you're hearing from a guy who hasn't felt emotions outside of number anxiety and rage for the past *entirety of his life* so...",21Mar2020,1

I’ve always felt like I was never a priority to them and I often question if they really love me. Im always shut in my room at both of my parents houses and it makes me feel so isolated and alone.

Recently I’ve been having extremely powerful dreams/nightmares, and they almost seem like they’re showing me something that I’ve been missing while taking the Zoloft. 

When I was on Zoloft, I felt emotionally detached from almost everything. Any stress, trauma, or even slight inconvenience wouldn’t phase me at all. As heavenly as that sounds, the same rules applied to the good things that we’re happening in my life. I wouldn’t care. 

Now it seems like everything is hitting me, all at once. It’s overwhelming, it’s extremely scary, and I’m afraid. I don’t want to feel alone in this. Not a lot of people understand the dragon that is discontinuation syndrome.

79,"Hi all,

I’ll try to be brief: I recently split from my long-term partner who’d I’d been living with for 6 years. I’m living on my own. This in itself has been very emotionally hard.

I don’t have a great support network around me, and only a few friends, who aren’t super close anymore (struggles with social anxiety and a resultant drink issue for a good few years - working through these things now though, on a positive note).

My only respite was trying to get out there and do things in my spare time (meet-ups, existing friends, football, etc.) and the fact I’d got a promotion and moved to an office (previously home-worked for 6 months, which I hated due to isolation).

But then COVID hits, and looks like I’ll be isolated for months, with very little social interaction with others and working from home. On my own constantly. Dealing with loneliness already.

The prospect is very scary to me, for my mental health. It was difficult enough, but then this on-top for the foreseeable. Sometimes I just cry.

But I want to be proactive. I’m the only person who can do something to help me. What can I do to try to help my social isolation in particular? Are there online groups you could suggest? Any ideas?

I also want to say though that I’m grateful for my health. I know COVID is a serious thing which can actually take people’s lives. So I always keep that in perspective. And I always try to remember that my situation is temporary, which helps a bit.

Appreciate any advice :)",21Mar2020,1

85,"Warning: this may be triggering for some. Please proceed with caution.

Some backstory. Last year around mid february I went to a large party a group chat on telegram I was in was throwing. Typically this kind of thing isnt really advised, but I personally knew one of the guys who lived with the host so I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. After I got there however, there was this one guy who immediately took a liking to me. I had already stated in earlier conversation that I was straight and catholic, so while I didnt have an issue with how they wanted to live their lives (the majority of the group was LGBT), I wasnt interested in being in a homosexual relationship (or ""messing around and finding out"" either). Somewhat unbeknownst to me, the guy that had been flirty and crushing on me took this as a challenge. For the rest of the time I was interacting with people he would be nearby and as i got more drunk and stumble he began helping me to the liquor cabinet and even helping me pour. Once i was quite plastered and starting to slip in and out of reality, he got super physical with me and coaxed me to a quiet room. He was alone with me and started having sex with me. I wasnt okay with this, but I was far too drunk to really say or do anything about it. 

The next day was kind of a blur for me as I was still processing what had just happened to me, but over the rest of the week at work it began to weigh on me. I had just been raped. I knew nothing about this guy. Everyone at the party used pseudonyms, myself included, so there was no way for me to even identify him. But what was I supposed to do once i had a name, report him and lose my job for drinking so heavily i was still drunk the next morning when I'm in the navy? It's a serious offense and since I was still in training at a command that treats it like you just murdered someone, I couldnt take the risk. Even still, 4 days had passed and I hadnt slept or gotten any of my training or homework done for my classes.

Day five and I've finally had about 4 hours of sleep and the day comes that I am to stand watch as Reactor Operator. My overinstruct (OI) has been nagging me and criticizing everything I've done up to this point almost 2 hours into my 4 hour watch when the scram alarm goes off. I started having a panic attack. I'm shaking and stuttering and my arms wont respond as I'm trying to take the necessary actions to prevent core damage (dont worry it's a training simulation, but my body wouldn't accept that). Instead of taking the watch as he should have, OI starts screaming at me for not taking my actions.

It's been a year and that whole week (mostly the first day of the shitshow) still has me traumatized. I think about the party almost every day. Sometimes I can still feel his grip and his breath.

Now onto today's issue. I've since confided in a very close friend (who we'll call roomie) everything that happened and what things in my life it has effected. He's also in the navy and has been dealing with some things himself so he was very understanding and supportive. I explained how this event caused me to go mute for nearly 3 months before I felt comfortable speaking to anyone again (i had made an exception for important work related conversation with staff), how that incident led to my girlfriend (who I had planned on asking to marry) dumping me, and that I had been altogether removed from the program and placed on indefinite hold with the expectation that I spoke to mental health before they considered putting me back in the program. So with roomie being so understanding of what that incident did to me and how it continues to effect me, I would have never expected his behaviour last night.

I had some friends over. They were good friends, but I still hadnt known them for very long. While I was streaming on twitch one of my friends was hanging out in my room keeping me company and cracking jokes about my gaming and stuff, it was a fun time. The other was in the living room with roomie.

Roomie made some joke about being gay, I didnt hear much else, but then I hear roomie say: ""oh, but he's got a great story about why he KNOWS he's not gay"" I can basically hear the smile on his face from the tone in his voice. My heart sinks and my 4 hour stream is basically ruined barely an hour in. I cant think straight and suddenly my game is pissing me off so I had to call it by an hour and a half.

I can't fathom why he'd act like that. Hes been my best friend, we've been through everything together and confided or darkest secrets to one another. But now im not sure if he's actually kept this between us and the very few others who I trusted with it. Im teetering on the edge of an anxiety attack while the person I trusted and thought of like a brother tries to make my traumatic experience out to be some joke, egging my friends to ask me about it cuz it's ""his story to tell, but is a good one""

I still don't really know if I wasnt advice or if I just needed to rant but I'm rather shaken and not looking forward to hanging or with that friend abaddon tomorrow like we're had planned.",21Mar2020,1

The only thing we haven’t done is met each other in person.
At this point, we’re officially queerplatonic partners. Neither of us really have an interest in romantic relationships with anyone else. They’re seriously the most important person in the world to me, I love them more than anything. 
We’ve tried to meet up in person before, but it never seemed to work out. My mental health has always been a struggle for me, and lately with this whole Coronavirus thing, my anxiety is at an all time high. My partner, they have really bad asthma. Whether it’s realistic or not, my mind is constantly occupied by the fear that they will get Covid-19 and die. Their asthma has been acting up really badly in the past few days, too.

I can’t stand it when my internet friends hang out without me. My friend group is a group of 4, me, G,P,and A. (Letters for their names). G P and A started playing Pokémon together. I was never interested/had the money to play the game so they just played it without me, for days. Days went without being able to talk to any of them because of the game- now I can’t even look at/hear about pokemon without wanting to die. Same thing has happened with other games. They play them without me and now I can’t even think about the games or the experience without wanting to kill myself. Last night I was on a call with P and G and left to go to the store, saying I’d be back later. When I came back they were playing one of the games. I didn’t tell them anything, but I had a full on breakdown. Like, shaking and stuff. Everytime this happens my mind is clouded with suicidal thoughts. This June P and G are going to meet up irl. I was going to, but possibly won’t be able because of COVID-19. If they do I don’t know how I’ll handle myself. I might actually do it. If seeing them on a call together hurts me this bad, I don’t know what I’ll do if they meet up irl. I actively try to avoid anything regarding the games they’ve played, but they always talk about it in calls and it’s struggle.

So, things have been incredibly slow this week and my everything is starting to suffer because of it. I know a lot will have the thought of why don't you have savings. I do, just not a lot.

I've been feeling super paranoid lately (like my dad, mom and sis are planning something or talking about me behind my back). My parents are hard core traditionalists and believe that things should work in a certain way only. My mom is a school teacher and is always on the edge - keeps telling me how I'm a failure, *used to* call me a retard, says everything bad in the house happens because of me(arguments etc), is always negative and keeps blaming me for things that happened years ago and all other negative stuff. 

My background - 

- Diagnosed with BDD/Major depressive disorder 5 years ago. 
- Drank toilet cleaner in a suicide attempt. 
- Parents sent me abroad to study, but I failed out of all subjects and had to come back home. 
- Been taunted by my mother since(6+ months), how I'm a failure and a disappointed and she wished she never had me.

I have been trying to make apps(mobile and web) to get enough capital to go back abroad to study and get away from my mother and I thought this time of quarantine would be perfect for me to work on it. I've previously made 3 apps and a mobile game hoping to make it work, but it didn't. 

Anyways, all this stuff is very soul crunching. To add on top of this - I have no friends here. 

I'm currently taking Prodep and Abilify but idk what to do in regards to the situation with my mother - even listening to her voice gives me anxiety now and makes me think she's going to say something terrible that will bring back bad memories.

Lately, though emotions certainly aren't my strong suit, I feel as if I genuinely hate talking to anyone for an extended period of time. This isn't to say that I hate socializing. No, I only notice the feeling when the other person is talking about something I REALLY couldn't care less about. I have absolutely no desire to talk about things I'm not interested in.
I'm far from being narcissistic, because obviously nobody can hate me as much as I hate myself-- but I don't perceive my want for isolation from boring conversation as bad. Is it, though?
I thought for a moment that perhaps I'm forcefully distancing myself from everyone because they don't make an effort to understand me, because I don't make an effort to understand them, but is it really so much to ask that my friends and I only converse about topics that are interesting to both of us?

I even have an embarassing habit I developed of talking out loud to myself because when I talk to my family they hate it or run away or worse case scenario attack me.


I had an argument with my mum yesterday and said I'm tired of her pretending to care, I said I'm also tired of her breaking promises, ignoring me and my mental health issues, gaslighting and invalidating my experiences and being in general a hypocrite. I said a few bad things I'm not proud of and then I said I'm not gonna speak to her anymore because...basically she is never there for me anyways, the amount of times I've been on the edge is astronomical but she just dodges me entirely. Only talks to me when I'm joking around and I'm sick of having to be chipper all of the time in order for my mum to not run away from my conversations. I usually am not serious in these claims but I simply had enough, something inside of me died, I'm just so sad I had to reach this conclusion.


Now I'm pretty much isolated in my house. I always am, a few years in fact, but having a responsibilty now and all the stress and just no internal sense of self-esteem or support outside is getting to me. It wasn't apparent when I was wasting time on the internet watching shows because I was simply killing time and I wasn't speaking to anyone. Even online I don't speak to anyone, I was warned constantly about my sister not to 'speak to strangers online' so I always kept my problems to myself. I don't speak to anyone (but myself), stressed, worried about moderating and just people online in general and depressed....very depressed. I feel like I'm being attacked on the side. I need to take a shower but I can barely brush my teeth. Even if I had someone to talk to I can't tell them I'm moderating online because my account is anon and I would like to just be calm.


I'm either bored or stressed. I hate being both. I want to be content and happy. Idk why life is this freaking hard. I have zero emotional coping skills (thanks to my family) or self-confidence. 


My family is very selfish and unsupportive and this dysfunctional household, the only person who can see how strange it is, is me. I don't know how I ended up a NEET. I think me dropping out of college has everything to do with how little self-esteem I have. I don't have any support or guidance. It's crazy how it is...I feel like a wreck and a mistake.


I don't want to not have anything I want to do with my life. I don't enjoy being indoors all day. I don't think it's cool or trendy either. I want to stop having social anxiety and live. But when I attempt to actually create something or interact with others outside the bubble of tv shows, I become very stressed. I take magnesium tablets to cope with the stress but I doubt it's helping. I feel very on the edge. 

Sorry this is so darn long, there's a lot on my mind.",21Mar2020,1

110,"I feel ashamed writing this because I feel my struggles aren’t enough to warrant this, but I can’t go on like this. 
I told my mom I “didn’t want to grow up” on my 5th birthday, I spent my early childhood (3-6) being a cheerful, mature kid who spent their free time in a dark room (my choice), rocking back and forth and crying, which I found out my parents thought was cute.
I was a straight A student through elementary/middle/high school, extremely depressed and extremely isolated (although I had friends). I got bullied but protected others from bullying and had an active after school life.
I’m 19 and a freshman in engineering, something I’m good at but have no interest in and i simply want to d!e. I’m studying something that I have zero interest in (but would know what else to do as I have zero interest in general), to do a job that I don’t care about, not even for me, but to support my disabled mom and old dad, who I feel don’t love me a lick (family is a completely different crazy story), while feeling like su!cidal 24/7 for 12-15 years. 
I just wish I could fall asleep and not wake up.
And now I’m stuck in quarantine with my older cousin, who’s constantly suggesting some courses I can take to better myself while class is out, and I cannot tell her that I have no energy todo my regular class work or exist.
I can’t dump that on her, especially since we’ll be stuck here alone for months to come (and we’re on different sides of a family cold war), so I’m just dumping it here to get it off my chest.

I’ve been struggling with Major Depressive Disorder for most of my life (having suicidal thoughts since I was 10) and didn’t start getting treatment until I was 22. Since starting treatment I have worked really hard to shed my bad coping skills, including self-harm; I’ve been clean of cutting for well over a year and a half at this point. 

For the past few weeks I’ve been unable to cry although I’ve felt like I really needed to. For the past week I’ve been working 11-13 hour days as I’m considered essential personal at a medical facility. I felt so overtired, horrible, and emotionally constipated last night that I cut. It was just a few, and they weren’t deep as I don’t want them noticed at work- I just wanted to try anything to get myself to cry and express myself instead of being so stoic and not letting my feelings out. 

I’m trying to decide whether I should tell my partner and/or my therapist. The marks have faded pretty much over night, so at this point there’s no evidence for anyone to call me out on. Do I keep this quiet and pretend it never happened, or do I let the people who are the most active in my treatment know I slipped up?

So, I am a girl with BPD and anxiety and I have been going to therapist but now everything is cancelled due to this Corona epidemic.

I'm living with my parents and my brother who is total opposite and flegmatic and doesn't stress about anything.

I don't have a loving relationship with my father for as long as I can remember, he is always making fun of me, saying ugly words, laughing in my face, etc. He roll his eyes when he sees me and so on. He sure does love my brother and always having fun with him. 

My mother is a women with depression and very manipulative and self loving. She has to be always right and always yells and if I want to tell her my own opinion and my emotions she tells me that she is sick and suicidal and that I don't have a reason to be feeling low beacuse I have a great parents and a great life and she starts screeming whenever I want to tell her that she hurt me with something. Beside this, she is having a lover and I have been living with that information for a years now, without telling anyone to keep her safe at home and to keep family going. And few weeks ago she told me that she doesn't have any emotions towards me and that when I was younger she had a struggle to hug me or show me any kind of emotions because it wasn't natural to her.
And then I told her I know everything about her and her cheating my father and lying to me and everything else and she blamed me and told me Im bad daughter, I should be ashamed of talking like that to my mother, she is perfect mother to me, etc.

She even had purposely made panic attack and ended up in hospital blaming me I almost killed her and forbidding me to talk about what I have told to her about her been a cheater. I am a student on my last year, have no money, I found I job but now that agency won't opet because of virus, and Im forced to be in quarantine with my family.

I'm doing my faculty tasks daily to distract myself and been praying alot and working out in my room but they are yelling all the time and whenever I step up out of my room they just put down my will to live and my positive mindset that I'm struggling to get in my room with these chores and routines I'm doing for myself and for my mental and psychical health.

This qurantine would totally work out for me if I lived alone because I can focus on getting better and eating healthy and working out and praying and everything good. Because otherwise I go out few times a week and drink too much alcohol and eating crap and I even had a drug problem years ago that I still struggle in my mind.

Sorry for the long post but since I don't have a therapist right now to talk to and my friends are great but they don't get me because they dont have mental disorders or any kind of struggles of this kind.. I just need to tell this to someone and to maybe have some helping words.

120,"Hi, I am going through something very hard and confusing and I just need help. I have a boyfriend who we’ve been dating for coming up on 4 years now. We were each other’s first bf/gf and everything. We linked super well and sprouted an amazing relationship. Everything clicked inbetween us and it was definitely one you could tell can last forever. Well.. my boyfriend gave up during our transfer to college and his life started to get rocky. I was there every step of the way. He lost motivation and effort in wanting to do small things and gradually big things until it also became no motivation for our relationship. He got diagnosed with ADD and begun taking adderal, which completely killed his personality and emotions. Taking this medication daily with the already bad mindset it changed his personality and views and he seems to have given up even more. He sees himself as a disappointment and knows his parents think of him as one as well, so he doesn’t get much support there anymore and so he gives up more. He also gained anger issues and can’t control his anger very well anymore. I think over the time that this has happened he’s confused me with his parents and everyone else he believes he’s disappointed and views me the same. When in reality I’m here for him and want him to succeed. Our relationship has grown quite toxic and one sided and I can’t handle it anymore. I love him with all my heart and he loves me too and doesn’t want this to be reality, I think he’s just dug himself into such a hole that he doesn’t think he can get out.
An argument happened between us recently and I got fed up with the treatment I was getting so I wrote him a letter of what I’m looking for and need in a relationship and I read it to him. I also suggested we go on a break for a month in which we are doing now. He said he is going to work on himself because he wants a future with me and I want the same. I have no friends and with this whole corona virus I can’t go to college anymore and try to make some. So everyday I’m sitting alone at home thinking and crying and it’s breaking my heart. I just want to go back to him and cut off the break and continued to be treated bad because it feels better than being alone and dealing with this. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I need help getting my mind off of him and being happy. I play video games but I find myself zoning out and thinking about our relationship. I honestly wish I had friends. I am at such a road block and need help, please anyone have any advice?

122,"Hi Guys,

I have been suffering with anxiety and depression for a long time now. 

I spent 2 years in Rehab and was told it was a dual diagnosis.

However, since I stopped drinking 4 years ago, I have been getting very serious ups and downs. From not leaving the room for days to self harming. Although in the last 2 years they haven't been that bad.

I can feel it coming and I just tend to as much as I can till it passes, I sleep a lot, try to play some video games till I feel myself again.

I am going through a very bad one this week. i haven't washed, barely eating, I get so angry that a punch things, the littlest things annoy me, can't look at myself, I hate myself. Where two or three weeks ago I was fine.

I have seen doctors etc and they don't know what it is. They say it's something I have to live with. That there is nothing they can do. Im on lexapro for years now. 

Im getting very pissed off about these dips and feel like I can't take much more of them. If the pubs where open I would be at the end of the bar drinking my face off.

Im way behind in college work and if i had a full time job I would be more than likely get fired.

Nothing seems to make this go faster. Exercise, healthy eating, it just comes and goes. Thats how I get through them. It goes away. It has before and it will again. I just want to crawl up in a ball and cry.

Im just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or is going through something similar know what is going on?

A Councillor I seen a while ago said it was like seeing two different people: One that was fidgety, couldn't keep still, depressed, anxious and the second that was happy, calm and relaxed.

127,"I started going to therapy in around october, I didn't do a good research before making the appointment and ended up going with a therapist specialized in psychoanalysis. At the begining this was a problem because big parts of the sessions were complete silence. But then I read a bit about psychoanalysis and learned that I had to do 99% of the talk. After that the silcence was not an issue but I still had the feeling I wasn't going there to solve my problems, I was just going there the tell the therapist about my week and how I felt, sometimes feeling the same or sometimes even worse after leaving. Now I'm not saying that was completely useless, I'm sure I've become much more open, and that having someone to talk to about whats making me stressed at the moment must help, as I don't normally speak with my friends or family about my problems But I have the feeling that I'm not solving my real issues. We have spoken about important topics but only to never touch the subject again.

Two sessions ago I expressed this to my therapist and he told me that I could be right but that the decision was mine. I also gave him a kind of mind map that I made with what I think are my problems. On our last session I asked him for a recomendation on what I should do, and he gave me as options (not really recomentations): to continue our sessions; to investigate about Behavioral therapy and see if it suits me better (and then find someone else); or group psychoanalysis with him. 

My biggest problem i think is that my lack of friends and love life caused by appearance issues, other isecurities, and maybe issues from the past makes me depressed, that affects my already poor performace at university leading to even more depression. And I also feel I have some type of attention deficit 

Tl;dr: I go to psychoanalysis therapy, I feel it isn't working because I don' talk about my real problems, and when I do I get no feedback or questions and we don't touch the topic again. I told my therapist about it and gave him a mind map where I wrote down what I think my problems are and he told me that it was for me to decide if I wanted to keep trying therapy with him or move on. My problems are mostly social, caused by insecurities and appearance issues.

139,"It's been pointed out to me that I overthink a lot. Not just on big issues, but also little things that shouldn't require lots of thought. I've tried to keep this post short-ish, as I can ramble a lot, but please let  me know if you have any questions.

It's gotten to the point where I won't join in on conversations, because I'm waiting for the ""right"" moment to say something, which always means I never say anything, because the right moment is never there. I'm becoming the quiet person who never says anything and no one wants to be that person. (To be clear, I don't think there's anything wrong with  being a quiet person, but I've been told it's not a good quality to be quiet all the time. :( )

It also  means I really struggle with comforting people when they're going  through tough times. They come to me with an issue and, if I can't think  of anything to say, my brain internally panics and wants to ""run away"". This means I freeze and don't say anything, which is basically not doing anything at all. I get the sense that this really annoys people,  especially my girlfriend, who has told me she sometimes gets fed up with me not being able to help her when she's having trouble and she feels she can't get upset, because then I'll get upset (because I don't know  what to do) and it doesn't help her problem at all.

Another thing I do is add loads of little caveats to things. I usually do this  to let people I have thought about something and to avoid people  ""jumping down my throat"", but it often means I say a lot without really saying anything at all. I'm trying to reduce the amount of these that I use, but it's difficult, because I've got into the habit of caveating things all the time.

140,"i’m in year 13 and was so ready to do my alevels in may/june. my mental health has been somewhat wobbly for a while but generally it’s been okay and fine. but then on wednesday everyone in the UK was told exams were cancelled and schools would close friday. suddenly that means with 2 days notice, i have left school Forever. which means i now have 6 months of absolutely nothing and i have no purpose until i go to uni at the end of september. i feel so hopeless because i have no job (it was shut due to corona) i have no school and can’t see my friends everyday (which was the only reason i got up in the morning) and i have no exams to work towards. i have literally nothing and no motivation to take up a hobby or go out and see people. i feel like my life’s worthless right now and im struggling with what to do or who to talk to because everyone’s in the same situation right now :/",21Mar2020,1
141,"Hey everyone — So, a bit of background:

My father/sister have diagnosed ADHD *(I suspect my brother may too, but he hasn't looked into it).* About a month ago, I met someone who shared their experience with ADHD with me, and ever since then I've been really curious about my own mental health. This COVID-19 pandemic has given me a good amount of time to reflect on what I believe *could* be possible symptoms *(and yes, I know you're not qualified to diagnose me)*, but another part of me feels that I may be experiencing the impostor phenomenon, in that I could have internalized the idea of having ADHD—and that I'm tricking myself into thinking I have it—rather than actually having it.

In high school, I didn't use any drugs. To this day, I rarely even drink coffee. But in college, I picked up vaping and even smoke weed regularly. Now (senior year), I've heard that if you don't treat an undiagnosed person with ADHD with stimulants, they sooner or later will do it by themselves with things like caffein, nicotine and alcohol *(unless they've unknowingly discovered healthier coping mechanisms like exercise, etc.).*

I'm not asking for a diagnoses, but I would like to start some dialogue in order to dispel some the stereotypes that have ultimately prevented myself *(and I'm sure many others)* from going in for a diagnosis. The following are a few of these concerns:

**Is it possible that me becoming accustomed to nicotine/cannabis has made me \*think\* that I have ADHD?** I've already brought up my parents that I believe I could have ADHD, and they know I smoke weed, although they discourage it. They told me that my mental health is a priority, so they would take me to see a specialist, if I really wanted. However, they suggested that I should really give up weed/nicotine for at least 2-3 months to see if my ""craving for dopamine"" subsides. Part of this really resonated with me—because prior to college—I hadn't had a nicotine addiction, I wasn't a regular smoker (pot), and I never had occasionally experimented with stimulants to get assignments done. I'm worried that going down this path has made me believe that I have ADHD, when in reality, I could've given these symptoms to myself by creating a dependency? I actually haven't had nicotine in my system in over two weeks and I feel fine. However, I *need* weed in oder to sleep.

Not long ago, when I traveled abroad, I went about 2 weeks off cannabis to see if I could sleep at night—and I literally *couldn't* turn my brain off. I'm a very light sleeper as well. I ended up needing to use Benadryl/melatonin because I was becoming so sleep deprived after the first few days. By the time the trip ended, I pretty much kicked the difficulty getting to sleep. But as soon as I returned home, I went straight back to cannabis. This is what worries me about taking a few months off to see if my symptoms subside. I feel like I'd just be torturing myself. I feel like people will just tell me to give up weed and see how I feel, but as embarrassing as it is to say, I physically can't see myself doing so.

**Is it possible that cannabis gets a bad rap about ""being addictive,"" when it could actually just be a ton of neurodiverse people using it as a way to self-medicate?**

**I've heard that ADHD isn't something that is just readily/easily diagnosed—but I also commonly hear that psychiatrists misdiagnose or push pills for profit—do I have anything to fear with this happening to me?**

When things die down, I do want to take additional steps to investigate my mental health further, in a person-to-person setting. I have no clue how to find a reputable psychiatrist/ADHD specialist, and since I'm under my parents coverage, that probably needs to be factored in too. So if there's any additional tips for finding a reputable physician that I could trust, I'd appreciate it. Writing this out has definitely helped me organize my thoughts for when I do go see someone.",21Mar2020,1
142,"
I no longer want to live, I’ve lost the will to live and I’m just in pain all of the time. I often fantasise about suicide and how better off I would be dead. I sometimes think about how I can kill myself and what’s the fastest and least painful way. The only obstacle in my way, is my fear of death. I want to end my life but I think about how I might regret it and how death is so final. So I spend nearly every day wanting to be dead but being too afraid to do anything about it. Sometimes my life can be going good and I want to live that day and the next few days but I never fully want to live. I don’t see myself wanting to live forever on those days and I remind myself of everything that’s wrong with my life and how the happiness is not going to last long. 

I have autism and OCD and my life is hell because of it. I hate having these disorders and I have no respect for myself. I see myself as a worthless person, that has no value. 

Having OCD affects my life so much everyday. I have so many disturbing, obsessive thoughts that I can’t bear any longer. These thoughts are about murder, harming others and others harming me, animal abuse, cannibalism, rape, sexual assault, pedophilia, stalking, poison, dirt, germs, diseases, death, racism and being a Nazi. Those are only the main obsessive thoughts that go through my head for hours a day, I have much more. No matter what I do, I can never control my OCD. It always takes over my mind and I’m constantly feeling as if I’m a murder or I’m dying from cancer or some other crazy thing. Feeling this way everyday is torture and I can’t do it anymore. I also have compulsions but my thoughts are far more overwhelming. I check vents, because people might be looking through them and I crack my joints and fidget, because something bad might happen otherwise. I have injury’s from some of my past compulsions. Not too long ago I injured the muscles in my neck from stretching my neck so much because of my OCD. I received CBT about a year ago but I hated every minute of it. I was too embarrassed to be honest about my problems and I constantly felt as if my therapist was judging me, even though I was just being paranoid. Nothing that she done helped me and she always presumed that I just wasn’t trying. I struggled to talk to her enough because of my autism but the fact that I had to talk about my problems made it even harder. I remember walking out of therapy feeling completely drained and so weak. I get very nervous in social situations and I’m not good at socialising. 

Being autistic is what I hate most about my life. When I was told that I have autism, I cried and I was in denial for a few years. I refused to admit it to myself. The reason for that, was because of what other kids would say about autism. They would use it as an insult and bully other kids who they knew had it. One girl in my class who had a disability of some kind would be bullied all of the time. Nobody would go near her, it was as if she had a disease. I became her friend but I haven’t made any other friends since. I’m 16 now and I only have one more year left in school, yet I haven’t made a single new friend. I still hear ignorant comments about autism from teenagers my age. I just feel so alone . I cry myself to sleep sometimes because of how lonely I feel. I love talking to people but whenever I open my mouth, I ruin everything. It takes me a lot of time to become comfortable with someone but when I do, I’m fine. When people start to know me, they like me but then find out about my “popularity“ and ditch me. Being rejected all of the time, makes me feel worthless and like I’m nothing. Because of this, I care about what others think too much and I have trouble seeing when people are being nice to me and I always assume the worst. My self confidence is so low and this affects everything in my life. Because I have no friends, I can’t do normal teenage activities such as hanging out with friends at the shops or at the cinema. I don’t have any social media’s where I show my face and real name because nobody ever wants to add or follow me. I’ve never touched alcohol or cigarettes, gone to party’s, clubs or done anything rebellious with friends. I never had a boyfriend and I’ve never even kissed a boy before. I worry that things will never change and that I’ll be alone forever. I think about never getting married or never having children. I fear that my children might suffer from the same problems as me or that I’ll be an unfit and embarrassing mother. I see myself as unsuccessful and lonely for the rest of my of my life and I think that I will probably regret not ending my life sooner. This way of thinking definitely doesn’t help my situation but I don’t know how to think positive anymore. My teenage years have been completely wasted. My life is just crumbling even more each day. 

I decided to quit school a few days ago because of how it makes my OCD worse and because I have no friends. I sat in school everyday looking up at the clock, I couldn’t wait for it to end. I never learnt anything because I felt so unenthusiastic about being there, I was tired from obsessing about being there the night before, my OCD was at it’s worst and I constantly thought about having no friends and what others thought about me. Everyone knows that I’m autistic because I had no other choice but to join an autistic unit in my school when I made no friends. I can eat my lunch there and not have to sit alone, while everyone looks at me and judges me. It was definitely a bad decision, society is so uneducated and ignorant when it comes to autism and I’m treated like dirt because of it. Nobody sees me as anything else but the label “autistic”. Everyone thinks that autism is an intellectual disability but it’s a cognitive disability. I’m treated like a child but I’m the smartest in most of my classes. I’m constantly looked down on and spoken to as if I can’t understand basic English. It doesn’t matter how many times I get good grades, people don’t change their minds about me, the label is stuck with me. Last year I was selected for an award and I went to get it, thinking that I was going to be rewarded for my good grades all year. I got the “personal achievement award”, along with another autistic kid. It was humiliating and I loudly complained to my sister about it and everybody stared at me.  I couldn’t get a subject award, like every other kid. They were basically saying that I wasn’t good enough for those awards but I tried. I only got that award because I’m autistic, otherwise I would of got a proper award. I’m nothing to anybody, I will always be less and I can’t change that. It really hurts to be both friendless and treated like nothing in school. I want to learn, go to college and be successful but I can’t go to school anymore. I know that I’ll eventually force myself to go back and cause my mental health to deteriorate even more but there’s no other option. When I was 14, I quit school for a month and I would rarely go. I was out of school more than I was in school. I was in a really dark place and I’m going back in that direction, accept this time, it’s even worse.  

Another thing about my life that‘s really causing me difficulty right now, is my family. Since I was a little kid, the fact that my family were bad for me, was clear. This might sound harsh, everybody always says that you have to love your family, because their your family but I disagree. Should I really love people that treat me horribly, just because their family ? I don’t think so. My mother is selfish and a narcissist. I stopped telling her about my problems years ago, as she always compared my situation to somebody who was less fortunate than me. One day my sister tried to tell my mother about her problems and she just laughed, while my sister was in tears. She then gave this fake apology to her and walked away. She never gave me an apology before, not even a fake one. She also suffered from mental illness as a teenager but she can’t relate to me and my sister at all, which I find extremely strange and upsetting. She doesn’t have much empathy and she will never admit that she is wrong. When you try to point this out to her, she shuts you down or laughs. She thinks that everything is just one big joke. When I told her in tears that I didn’t see the point in my life, she didn’t take me seriously and made me out to be weak. She always takes her anger out on me and my sister and complains about the smallest things. When she is angry, which is quite often, she calls me horrible names and makes horrible comments such as calling me a “bitch” or saying that I’m “useless”. She takes ever bit of happiness and confidence away from me and my sister and I honestly believe that she gets joy from it. It makes her feel powerful and like a stronger person, when she’s actually a coward. The biggest thing that she does and that my Father joins in on, is ganging up on me and my sister and favoring my brothers. They love my brothers and see me and my sister as burdens to the family and I’ll never understand why. Is it because of our gender or because we’re not perfect ? I’ll never know and they’ll never say, which eats me up inside. I just want to know, what is it that is so wrong with me ? It makes me feel so worthless and small. My brothers are always misbehaving but never get punished for it but me and my sister are over punished. One day my brother disappeared for a whole day and wouldn’t answer his phone and my mother and grandmother spent the whole day looking for him. When he casually just strolled in, my mother asked where he was and handed him food, like nothing ever happened. If me or my sister did the same then there would be war. They constantly compare us to them and other cousins. They buy them things more often and spend more money on their Christmas gifts. They always have and always will pick their side over me and my sisters, no matter what. My twin brother has been bullying me for a long time. He’s ashamed of me and my how I’m not perfect and he pretends that I don’t exist in school. Whenever we argue over something petty, he calls me worthless, a loner, he says that nobody loves or cares about me, he says that I’m nothing, he makes fun of my autism and OCD and he tells me to go kill myself. I’m sick of being told to go kill myself by my own twin brother. He has anger issues and is violent. One day he pushed me onto the floor and I pushed him back, so he got me into a headlock and refused to let me go. I was gasping for air so I forced myself out and punched him in the chest, I could never bring myself to punch my own twin brother in the face. He started fighting me and my my parents came running outside screaming at me. They took his side without even seeing what happened or hearing the story. Both my siblings seen what happened and defended me but they didn’t care and let him off. I was left with a big red mark on my neck and I felt so weak and worthless. I decided to confront them about it and it wasn’t until I was in tears and unstable, that they finally listened to what I had to say. They called my brother in the room and he said to me “ I don’t care, one day I’m going to die and none of this will matter”. He just couldn’t care less about me. They barely got angry at him and I just went to my room and cried. My brother was forced to give a fake apology and I know for a fact that it was fake because not long after he apologised to me, he made fun of the pain I was in that day. Another time, my brother was saying that nobody cared about me and other hurtful things in front of my mother. She told me to stop fighting with him and acted as if he was the victim. I ran upstairs crying and she ignored me, she went on Facebook and told me to go away when I “disturbed” her. And another time, me and my siblings were going home from school and he was mocking me and how he seen me alone in school that day. My Dad just sat there and said nothing, he let him say those things. My twin brother is so unemphatic and selfish and I can’t stand him anymore. My father is just as bad as my mother. He’s nicer than my mother but he also has anger issues and he gets violent, like my brother. When I was about 5 or 6 he picked me up and slammed me into a sofa. The cushions were removed and I hurt my back. My mother got my back checked at the hospital and forced me to lie to the doctors about what happened. Another time, he pushed me into a wall and I ran to my grandmothers house crying. He hasn’t touched me since I was about 10, that’s when I started to fight back. I forgive him but it still hurts thinking about it. I find it harder to forgive my mother for what she’s done to me. She’s so fake and unlike my father, I can’t tell if she has changed. Especially since she never apologises. 

I’m f*cked. My OCD won’t get better, I don’t know if I’ll ever have any one in my life, I hate myself, I don’t want to live most days and I’m always treated like crap. If this is the rest of my life, how can I change it ?",21Mar2020,1

Currently we are all facing an unprecedented pandemic event, my thoughts are out for every life loving fighter, I'm confident we will beat this sooner rather than later. 

I'm a university student living outside of my uni alone in a private room and rarely go out and about only for classes and shopping, recently they have enforced a lockdown where I live and decided to go back( 2 days before the lockdown while the number of the cases were low) to my parents place throughout this lockdown to be with them and  take care of them if they needed groceries and so on. I've booked the bus (4 hour journey) which was half empty in the morning and I arrived and kept my distance, I've been here for 4 days now practicing social distancing and cleaning my hands regularly though I'm truly getting anxious for my parents as I'm afraid that I have the virus and asymptomatic, transmitting it to them in the process, I might seem crazy but every time someone is coughing and feeling tired I instantly go blank, I start to internally freak out and assuming the worst possible. I'm really getting extremely worried and its taking a toll on me mentally and physically, I honestly can't seem to get over it, I start regretting my decision to come back and should have stayed back, but kind of thought it was okay as alot of students were leaving too, chose the time where the bus was empty and avoided any close contacts in the process.

Reading the news as well doesn't help at all. I hope someone else can help me figure out how to stop over thinking and train my mind to think positive, even if the situation turns out to be negative.

I'm truly tired, mentally and physically because of this habit of thinking.",21Mar2020,1

147,"Hey everyone, I’m dealing with a lot of Self-Image issues usually I keep myself super busy with work and I can pretend it’s not an issue but due to being quarantined it’s making me see everything that’s wrong. I guess here’s the back story 3 weeks after my 18th birthday I started dating a man who was 25 and ex-navy. Things moved way too fast and I basically moved in with him after a month (I still had my apartment but was there everyday) mind you this was my first ever relationship. Everything was good until it wasn’t. For months I would wake up to him telling me nobody will ever love me, I’m a disgusting fat b****. Then it started getting physical I explained my rape to him in the beginning to prevent him from triggering me but then he would reenact it on me for punishment, all I would hear is you need to go to the gym you look so bad, he eventually began starving me. He didn’t work because he had his pension and I did grocery delivery. So he was with me 24/7 and I couldn’t get away. He eventually had a schizophrenic break down and tried killing me. I left him and tried to move on but I fell to pieces, I found an amazing job and friends but I started starving myself, it lead to me not eating for around 90 days and I wound up in the hospital because they thought I was having a heart attack but it was just stress triggered. I lost 80 pounds from it and resumed a regular diet and everything was normal. Then I met my next boyfriend who at the time was my roommate and in a drunken night we hooked up and started dating for around one year. The first 3 months were great yk the honeymoon phase but then he started becoming controlling, he became mentally abusive going through the garbage seeing what I would eat and yelling at me because he thought I was cheating meanwhile I was loyal. He installed security cameras so he can watch me when I got home from work and listen to my phone calls, and if he heard me complaining about him he would freak out and scare me he took control of my life and my money. Eventually after a year I left him but we still had to live together until I closed on my townhouse. Every morning if I was wearing a dress to work he would call me a fat s*ut and stuff like that. Fast forward to now I can’t look at myself and think I look good. Some days if I’m alone and not busy I just feel empty, I’m not depressed or anxious, I’m just here I’m alive but I feel nothing, I’m not scared of anything. I’ve had a coworker say when they see me cross the street it looks like I’m trying to get hit. It’s really hard trying to date, I haven’t had any guys I’ve been on a date with compliment me or anything so I’m my fucked up head it’s a reminder who I am I’m just disgusting. When I get out of the shower I can’t even look at myself without clothes because it disgusts me. I stopped doing my makeup because no matter what I do I don’t think it’ll make me look good. I can’t even go shopping for cute clothes because I just think why would I spend money on this to look good when no matter what I won’t look good. I just wanna look at myself and think I’m beautiful for once. This month I went to the doctors for the first time and told them my starving story on how I actually lost the weight and was diagnosed with a eating disorder.

157,"Today I ordered a pizza from xxx (a certain pizza shop), a room mate wanted a slice of the pizza, so I shared it with room mate, because the room mate also shared food with me before and we are friends.

I don't have issue with sharing foods, but I have this mentality that I must be the first one to eat the food if it's a ""special food"". For example, this pizza is considered ""special"" to me because it's the first time I've ordered from xxx, I usually order from other pizza places.

Unfortunately, the room mate started eating his slice before I started eating my pizza... so I feel that I lost my first bite to my special pizza, and this makes me pissed off, somewhat angry, even furious, though I know it's not the room mate's fault, so I am just angry with myself now.

I feel why I didn't just eat a slice first before I gave a slice to room mate. Now I feel both pissed off and depressed.

So why didn't I just eat it first then? Because I am kind of in a conflict. From one side, I feel this isn't a big deal, room mate is good friend, so I can share food. On the other side, I feel regret and angry about my previous decision.

The same also applies to electronics and stuff, sometimes to the extent that I get pissed off if other people touch my laptop, for example.

Tylenol, Advil, sleeping aids, etc. Whatever I can get my hands on. And I usually double or on rare occasions triple the dose.

160,"I've never admitted to being suicidal or even having issues with mental health because some part of the mental health community deeply infuriates me. I don't know why and it's definitely misplaced anger. But here I am because I need to finally realize I have a problem.

My cycle is misplaced anger / insecurity / social media / extreme overthinking. 

I get so mad at everyone all the time. (I have reasons but that's a whole other story) I definitely struggle with anger issues and I let my temper get the best of me on most occasions. 
This mixed with insecurity often makes me say stupid shit to people and really stupid shit online. When I come out of my angry mood I re read things I've said or posted and it gives me so much anxiety. I just can't believe I allowed myself to say the things I did. I'll apologize or delete something but the thought of it never leaves me. I just over analyze and fixate on everything I've ever done and said that was embarrassing, stupid, awful etc. 

I try to do exercises of letting go, I delete social media entirely for months at a time, I try and talk to a close friend about it. Nothing really works and I never feel listened to. I always end up falling back into my cycle and the feelings of loneliness and like everyone would be better off without me in the world. 
I just can't focus on anything else but how much I hate myself and hate my personality and hate the way I act. I just don't know how to change and I know that this pushes people away.

It gets so bad that I'll lay in bed awake at night or before I get up for hours and just think about how stupid everything I've ever done was and how much I just want to end it. And every time I do something new it's just added to my mental list. I know people usually forget about the dumb shit you do bc everyone is focused on their own lives, but something about all of my mistakes and failures being archived online freaks me out and makes me spiral. Everything I've ever done is just stupid, embarrassing, and makes me a generally unpleasant person to be around. 

I also know this is an offshoot of my other issues that make me so angry and hard to open up. I just wish I could be a nice, happy, and lovable person to be around. But I'm not and at this point it I feel so lost and unliked that its too much work to want to undo",21Mar2020,1
161,"ever since I broke up with my boyfriend (that was a very jealous and controlling relationship) I feel as though I am less than human. My friends tell me he was manipulative and I shouldn’t feel the way I do. He called me a cheater when I watched porn during our relationship which is fair that’s how some people view it during a relationship. I literally loathe myself bc of this decision and I also loathe myself since during the final days of our relationship I really did not want to be with him and I would think “oh that person would treat me better” and I know if my ex knew that he’d call me an emotional cheater so I cut it off and I wasn’t happy from our relationship since we argued all the time, like at least once a week if not every day. It was absolute torture, I loved him so much so it killed me when we’d argue about things that made me happy. Like creating love stories since i always had a passion for writing, he said i shouldn’t fantasize and also when i would play “The Sims” and he thought the male sims were too attractive to play with and that i was fantasizing about them or even when i’d read web comics such as “Hooky” where he thought Dorian was too attractive and that i’d fantasize about him too. Even though i told him that i wasn’t and that what he was saying was hurting my feelings bc i’d beg him to stop but he wouldn’t ever stop even if i was scream sobbing and begging him, which i know is immature and childish as he told me i couldn’t help how awful i felt when i felt as if i did nothing wrong. Now this was my first serious relationship, and his too, and we were only 17-18 during this relationship and I am now an 18 year old girl with girl hormones especially from being on the pill, but sometimes I feel like killing myself *im seeking therapy* due to what he’s told me and i feel like i’ve fucked up so so bad and he’s told me i’m abusive since i’ve grabbed things out of his hand hard during an argument said mean things while we were argument i’ve called him “immature” and “egotistical” and i feel like a fucking monster and I cannot escape how awful I feel and like I can never ever get into another relationship again since i’m so fucked up in the head and that there’s no point in living since i’m never gonna be happy permanently. It’s been about 20 days since we broke up now and every day I have something else to feel awful about, being a cheater, being abusive, never finding love again. and I can’t sleep and once i’m awake in the morning, even when i’m still tired my heart will start pounding and there is no way I can go back to sleep until nighttime, no naps and especially during this quarantine I have nothing to do to distract myself and I feel like i’m in hell and I live with so so much regret and sadness. Idk what to do every morning feels like i’m dying and slowly throughout the day I can somewhat forget it but little things will always remind me of him I can’t go a single day without thinking of him and either missing our good times (i lost my virginity to him and i regret that and now i can’t stop thinking about it) or i think about how i fucked up so bad. I don’t know if this is a result of manipulation as my friends and family have told me or if i’m really really awful. Please help me, i need help.",21Mar2020,1

&gt;An important iatrogenic condition, recognised by regulators

&gt;Sexual difficulties after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were first reported to regulators in 1991, but it was only in 2006 that these symptoms were formally characterised as a syndrome, now known as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction.12

&gt;In May 2019, the pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee of the European Medicines Agency concluded that post-SSRI sexual dysfunction is a medical condition that can persist after discontinuation of SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). A month later, EMA recommended that product information on all relevant antidepressants should be updated to reflect reports of long term sexual dysfunction after treatment.3

&gt;Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction is under-recognised and can be debilitating both psychologically and physically. Symptoms include genital numbness, decreased sex drive (libido), erectile dysfunction, failure to become aroused or orgasm, pleasureless or weak orgasm, and premature ejaculation.",21Mar2020,1
163,"When I was 16 (23 now), I noticed one morning I was a little tired for some reason. I have been perpetually fatigued ever since then. Not even a second of feeling well again. I've gradually gotten tireder and tireder over the course of the past 7-8 years, to the point where I'm at now where I can hardly function because the exhaustion/fogginess and resulting symptoms have become so debilitating. So basically, my life revolves around me being exhausted, something that is very difficult to ignore. When I was about 13/14, I began feeling anxious/stressed out all the time for no reason. (This is prior to the fatigue). The anxiety/stressed out feeling continued well into the fatigue years as well but has gradually diminished the past 2-3 years as I’m honestly too tired and out of it to feel stressed or anxious. 

*Many of the symptoms below have been here since the fatigue/fogginess started, BUT have very gradually gotten worse and worse as time goes by.

SYMPTOMS:

· Chronic fatigue/fogginess 24/7. Used to be more of a mental fatigue/burned out feeling rather than a sleepy feeling, but has gradually escalated to both.

· Non-restorative sleep. I'll wake up to pee in the middle of the night and don't even feel like I'm in real life I'm so out of it. Can barely walk straight correctly to the bathroom. I tend to feel a teeny bit better if I can get 9+ hours of sleep though. Less than 6 or 7, the derealization the next day is awful.

· Energy bursts are now non-existent.

· Disassociation feeling that has gradually emerged over the past 2 years. Has worsened over this time span. 

· Drugged/drunk-like type feeling 24/7, especially as day progresses. Like I'm not quite in real life. Never fully feel ""there""

· Cognitive decline/impairment (Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processing/recalling/stumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.)

· Motor skills/coordination decline

· Lightheaded upon standing often. Very disoriented and dizzy when doing certain physical things that move my head/body a lot. 

· Low arousal (jump scares, loud noises, etc have gradually affected me less and less as time has gone by).

· Feel anxious/stressed/overwhelmed more easily. Not nearly as bad as it used to be though.

· Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things.

· Hypersomnia (Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia)

· Eye floaters + Light sensitivity (seem more sensitive to bright light/sunlight)

· Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremities/body parts feel so utterly exhausted and numb-like to the touch.

· SENSES feel dulled. Hearing, taste, smell, touch, all feel weakened and suppressed. Especially as the day goes on and/or the less sleep I got. I literally feel like I have cotton in my head/ears, my hearing quality has decreased. 

· Libido low. Orgasm feels much less intense.

· Alcohol usually hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easily/quickly. Sometimes 1 beer and I'm already feeling drunk.

· Slow now both mentally and physically.

· Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I don't get headaches that often.

· Anhedonia and apathy as I’ve gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across as an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 24/7. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I am emotionally flat lined.

· All of these symptoms seem to flare up more when I’m sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc.

· Never really have had any hobbies or passions as a result of losing interest quickly and being too tired/unable to focus.

· Feel like I need lots of sleep to “recover”.

ADDITIONAL INFO:

I've had virtually any and all medical tests done I believe. Near everything comes back perfect. Tried so so many different types of medications, supplements, nootropics, lifestyle changes, diet changes, exercise changes, sleep changes, etc. 7 or 8 different antidepressants, Adderall, Vyvanse, Kratom, etc. Nothing phases the chronic fog/fatigue.

The only thing I’ve been diagnosed with is mild sleep apnea, and a slight intolerance to kidney beans. Avoided kidney beans for a while, didn’t help. Used CPAP for a few months last year, didn’t help. Gave up. Last month, I started recording myself sleeping without CPAP and I wake up throughout the night and sit-up and look around with my eyes open every 30 minutes unaware that I’m doing it and massage myself. Started using CPAP again, and with CPAP, I only do that about 1/4 of the time, but still don’t feel better. AHI is consistently &amp;amp;lt;2, but still feel bad. Modafinil doesn’t help AT ALL. 

Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like it's suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse and worse over time. For example, caffeine’s effect, sex drive, post-workout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. It’s like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly. And the thing that sucks is that I want to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but I'm just too out of it, it's embarrassing. I come across like an intoxicated zombie, especially at night.
Relationships fading cause I can’t function. Hobbies/interests lacking due to fatigue as well as having to spend all day having to use coping mechanisms to make up for my symptoms, etc.

164,"As the title says, I feel a near constant frustration and irritability with pretty much everything. If I have to wait in line at a store, if I get stuck behind a slow driver, if my computer is a bit slow, if someone asks me a question or if I throw something in the garbage can and miss, everything makes me feel like I want to scream. I hide it well and I'm not violent and I don't really snap at people. But I always feel like I want to. I always feel like there is a ton of pressure on me, even when there isn't.

But I got up today feeling despondent, and as the day's progressed it's gotten much worse. I feel like crying. I can't eat. I want to go back to bed and stay there. I'm having suicidal thoughts again (I'm not going to do anything, but the thoughts keep popping into my head).

My mood swings have gotten a lot worse and the thoughts of wanting to die depend on the month.  

I'm worried that I have over-dramatized this all in my head. I recently found out what borderline personality is and I checked all of the symptoms. From fear of abandonment, shifting self image, feeling either empty or feeling extreme emotion, etc etc.

Here are some weird things I've noticed about myself recently:
- I obsess over something for like 3 days and then completely forget about it.
- Short memory loss (I don't think this is the right word for it though)
Example: If I want to do something I have to do it immediately or I'll forget to do it in seconds.
- I don't eat so much
- I used to draw everyday but I can't do it anymore
- I have no energy but sometimes I feel like I have so energetic.
- I live with my family but sometimes I feel like I want to run away and live alone.
- Showering feels so tiring and difficult lately
- I feel like my family hates me
- I don't have any life goals whatsoever because I don't really know what I want in life.

174,"So to start out with I have an extreme phobia of Schizophrenia that started last May (I am a 19 year old trans woman if that helps with any of this). I was on the couch, and I hallucinated an extremely sweet smell. I freaked out, because there wasn't anything that could have caused it (I've occasionally hallucinated this since). Immediately afterwords I started falling down a hole where I started over-analyzing my behavior. If something seemed weird (such as people outside of my apartment talking) I would record it to make sure it wasn't a hallucination. I would analyze every thought that went through my head to make sure it didn't sound delusional.

I've had memory issues for a few years now, but I feel like something has changed. In June I was in the car with my mother. A thought went through my head of me lifting my head and manically laughing. I couldn't figure out if it had just happened or not. It took me ten seconds to realize that it couldn't have happened, because my mother would have commented on it if it did. I freaked out after this, because I realized that wasn't normal. I've had similar incidents to that a few times since. I've also had issues with my memory in other ways. I quickly forget things, and recently it took me 15 seconds to remember my mother's name. Sometimes it is difficult to remember if something actually happened or if it was from a dream (this is worse within the few hours after I wake up).

I've also had strange thoughts (I should also mention that I've always had intrusive thoughts). I have a lump on my neck that appeared in July. A few months ago a thought popped into my head, ""This is a chip the government put into my neck."" I realized right after the thought appeared that it was delusional, and I had a panic attack because a delusional thought appeared (I know the lump isn't a chip). I've also noticed coincidences in my reality that give my panic attacks since I notice them (Why would I notice coincidences like this?). For example, I was watching a TV show where a professor got murdered. Later I turned on the news to see that a professor near me had been murdered.

I've started having mood swings as well (or I've at least noticed them. They may have been there longer than I thought). My mood can fluctuate from super happy to sad in hours (minutes sometimes). I can sometimes go into moods where nothing feels real or where I feel apathetic and have to emulate emotions from memory of situations where I used that emotion rather than feeling the emotion at that time.

I've seen a therapist and a psychiatrist about this. I got tested, and was told that my reality testing was great and that I just had major depression and generalized anxiety. I want to see my therapist again, but my deductible reset in January so I can't afford to go.

I go through periods where I am ""convinced"" that I am developing schizophrenia and other phases where I am just anxious about the idea of developing it. Psychosis has become my worst fear. I am terrified about at idea of developing it. As for what's going on with me, I am scared. I've looked up early symptoms of psychosis and I see a lot of these on there. I don't know what to do. I don't know if this is a fear or if my worst fear is coming true. It's tearing my life apart.",21Mar2020,1

178,"Hi 👋

I've been seeing a therapist for the last few months and it has been a really positive experience. While I didn’t find it too difficult to find a therapist, I have a number of friends who have really struggled. It made me think about how difficult it can be for people to start therapy and find a therapist. When I looked for a therapist I found the tools I used were super outdated and didn't give me the information I wanted easily. For example, I really cared about the physical environment that I would be in, and most of the time this wasn't discussed or shown.

Because I work for a technology company it got me thinking about how little technology seems to be being used to support people to find and access therapy, and what cool opportunities might exist for it to be used to better support people. I'm thinking about creating a platform that uses technology to solve problems around making therapy sessions happen for both therapists and clients.

I thought it would be great to get some more opinions: 🧠

* If you managed to find a therapist, what was your experience like? Was there anything difficult or confusing about it? What bits of the experience did you like?
* If you tried and gave up on finding a therapist, why? What would have made you feel better about going through with it?
* If you were to look for another therapist, what would be most important for you to know? Would you consider seeing a therapist over a video call rather than in-person?

Thank you! 🧡",21Mar2020,1

The issue is that she recalls fully fledged conversations, that usually include a greeting, a query, and a reply to the query. Based on double checking with the other parties, I don't think I'm the one imagining things. She currently acknowledges this could be problem but is pretty hostile and upset when this is brought up in the wrong setting. Not sure is this related but she talks to herself aloud in the bathroom sometimes.

181,"Over these last 3 years, I life has been completely miserable. Things changed for the worst in June 2017. I just don't know what to do anymore. I honestly feel like I don't want to exist. Everything is a mess.

Basically I have OCD, depression (quite bad depression because of my weight), Asperger's, anxiety issues and probably a binge eating disorder. I'm really overweight and am absolutely depressed about everything. I don't think my life has meaning anymore.

My OCD makes me think things that aren't true (at least I think it's my OCD). I can't help but think and believe a particular ethnicity of people are completely superior to every other ethnicity in this world. I feel like only this particular ethnicities lives are worth living. I can also sometimes hear, smell and taste things that aren't there. I told someone about this (a mental health professional) and they said it's stress. Basically I thought I has psychosis. It's like I want psychosis to feel special. I know I probably don't have it, but I can't help but think that believing things that others don't believe isn't considered to be OCD?

Also there's one minute I feel so high and great and like that I can achieve absolutely anything in the world. Like, ""yes! I'm going to become an animator and make my own cartoon!"" Then the next minute I feel like shit and listen to sad songs and cry about everything and all the bad in the world. This happens daily.

And there's the other thing, I'm morbidly obese an fucking hate it but I can't seem to stop myself from eating. It's fucking horrible; it's one endless cycle. I was assessed for an eating disorder, but just got told to get motivated and see a dietitian.

I saw a psychiatrist about a month ago, she thought I should see the eating disorder team, but then my care coordinator told her I've already been seen by them and then the psychiatrist said the same thing ""get motivated.""

182,"Leaving out infection, unintentional suicide and other obvious risk factors, why are people... not allowed to injure themselves? If I were to get a tattoo to symbolize my trauma, no one would care. If I was going through it and waxed my entire body as part of a self care routine, everyone would say, “good for you.” So why is self harm any different? Because they’re scars? Because they’re not pretty to look at or a positive experience? Why is it that I can tattoo and pierce my entire body head-to-toe if I wanted to, even at home with no kind of experience or training, but if I self injured, I can be locked up against my will?

Ive been doing it for over two years now, and I thought it was a good thing but im just now trying to get myself to stop because it really isnt a good thing to do. It started when I made the bold promise to myself to try and fix myself and dive deep into my head and solve all my problems and become a better person etc. but all I do is google whats wrong with my brain and try to find answers. 

Sometimes I find something that resonates with me and I read about how to get better, and feel motivated but the next day I already feel hopeless again and find other shit that I think is wrong with me and the solution to why im depressed and the path to get better. So does anybody else do this? Any advice on getting over this. It really makes me absent minded about everything going on in the present, and makes me only focus on getting better so completing my tasks can be easier.",21Mar2020,1

185,"Dear redditors,
Can anyone recommend a free therapy/mental health service?",21Mar2020,1
186,"Hi!   
I'm looking for help in getting online resources and potential coping mechanisms for my friend. He's in high school, and he's just turned 18. We have a venting channel in our discord and he posts almost every day about wanting to die, he's having panic attacks, public outbursts, crippling anxiety, terrible self worth... the poor kid is just falling apart. I've been pushing him for months to get professional help, and he finally sought out a therapist in his area but things didn't go well, he sort of gave up before he walked in. He's from a conservative Vietnamese Catholic family but is closeted bisexual, so struggling with his sexuality as well, believing that he's going to hell. He's self isolated long before the outbreak and now any efforts he was hopefully going to make to make irl friends are quashed, I'm really concerned.   


I've been trying to offer him coping mechanisms and hobbies, things for him to put his energy into besides self hatred, but he shoots down every suggestion, usually with ""That's too much effort "" or "" I'll just mess that up too ,"" and I could really use some help getting him the help he needs. Community, hobbies, professional consultation, anything so that I don't lose my friend. I see a lot of myself in high school in him and I keep thinking back to when I tried to kill myself. I'm terrified to see him in that same position, I just wanna take all the pain away from him. If anyone has any advice or resources, it'd be incredibly helpful. I want to do something for him.",21Mar2020,1
187,So I was watching a video about it and I relieved I have some of the symptoms. I get depressed for months then out of know where I'm happy and full of energy I don't sleep for days I'm running around then I randomly get depressed I sleep all day cry all night I get sucidal thoughts. I don't want to tell anybody because I don't want to look dumb so can somebody tell me if I should tell somebody.,21Mar2020,1
188,Anyone with borderline personality disorder please explain your mood switches i feel as if i might have it but to scared of judgement from family and friends to go to a doctor my mood switches maybe a good 50 to 60 times a day for no reason and i get very bad thoughts like harming myself when those switches happen i need help but i am so scared,21Mar2020,1
189,"I feel dead inside, I don’t exactly care what happens to me. It’s like I’m just living my life on auto pilot an just observing what happens and what does happen all I can think is oh this is what we’re doing now. I’m surrounded by people but feel lonely if that makes sense. Like I’m not really connecting with anyone. I put up a facade when I’m around people so that everything seems like it’s okay because when I think about trying to explain myself and how I feel I can’t so I gave up on things like therapy and trying to talk to someone I’m comfortable with which is no one. Once I realized that I tried my best to become apathetic(Figured if you don’t have any emotions you cant feel the way you feel) and find hobbies that can take my mind away from it so I began reading a lot and trying thrill seeking activities like Muay Thai, going to the gym even as far as to join the military but I’m getting bored. Truthfully I joined the military in hopes that it’ll kill me if I get deployed. (I chose the front lines) because I refuse to kill myself. I realized theirs a bunch of people out there who want to live but unfortunately have their lives taken from them if I could change places with them I would without hesitation. But I do all of this to keep me busy so I won’t have to think about it, but when I’m not doing something the thoughts just keep reappearing. But the thoughts only just started to resurface In February this year and I’ve been dealing with this since 15, but everything has it’s breaking point an I’m finally reaching mine I guess. Everything that happened in my past is just water under the bridge to me or at least I made myself think so or feel that way(That’s way to much to explain). But is there any advice that can be given to me on how I feel if this group does that here.",21Mar2020,1
190,I just don’t want to be here anymore,21Mar2020,1
191,"I went to doctors a few weeks ago, was pointless imo but she told me I seem to have a mix of anxiety and depression. 

I let my support teacher know, as she encouraged me to the doctors as she knew I wasn't coping. She emailed my parents and the next day I got screamed at by my dad and told to ""get out"". I went to school and cried for the whole morning. Was fine at home luckily and didn't get talked to about it. 

With this quarantine I don't know what to do. Sure I feel okay because Animal Crossing is out. But I'm sort of  not as I haven't talked to anyone in a few weeks about my emotions. I feel numb. I feel so lucky to have my friend who is messaging me every single day and  making  me feel happy. 

I hate the feeling of having to stay quiet or hide things. It's frustrating. I know I am not talking to my parents again about my mental health.",21Mar2020,1
192,"I have something very specific and weird that I can’t find any other cases of or any information on it. Basically positive emotions I feel become neutralized when I become aware of them to the point where I don’t feel them anymore. It happens at a much faster rate than could be seen as natural mood changing or burnout from something. For example if I build up an emotional image or good feeling while listening to music it gets drained away and I’m just left feeling depressed and empty and getting nothing out of continuing listening.

Another thing this happens with which is actually terrifying is sleep. When I build up sleepy feelings that are supposed to help me lull myself into unconsciousness, they just go away, and sometimes it physically hurts my brain. Ever since this started happening I have been unable to go to sleep without the help of medication. It’s terrifying and the though that medication could eventually lose its potency and effect and I’ll be forced to stay awake by my own horrendously dysfunctional brain for who knows how long actually makes me want to kill myself.

I honestly don’t know what to do or what treatment to undergo. I’ve told my doctor and she’s given me antipsychotic medication but it hasn’t made my emotions stable or anything really other than allow me to go to sleep. I just want to know that someone else has gone through what I’m going through and has found a way past it. Please if you can help me identify this or know how to get into contact with someone who might know about it that would mean the world to me. Or any other advice you might have would be appreciated as well.",21Mar2020,1
193,"Hey, there is a confesion/question
I do not fucking know what to do. My GF and i am meeting for more that 4 months. She has a lot of mental health problems and cut herself in the past.

 Lately she was kicked form university and after that she started having simmilar suicidal thoughts. Although she knows that i f-ing love her, she still denies this. Since after she was kicked out of uni we havent met due to coronavirus (big distance and no possibility of comming to her without public transport).

What to do anons, i started to panic that if i do anything, she'll do sth to herself. I have tried talking bout it, telling to go to psychologist or even talking to her family( not that supportive btw).

Im thorn between letting go and not to be sucked by that, or saying psychologist or i leave.

Help.

Ps: i need to go to sleep, sleep this through and talk to GF",21Mar2020,1
194,"I haven’t thought about it for over two years but it’s getting to that point where I think about it everyday. If I end my life, will it all stop. I don’t want to cause pain to those I love but I can’t deal with it anymore, it’s all too much",21Mar2020,1
195,"I want to cut soo bad, I am craving it. It started about 3 days ago and it’s just getting worse. Every time I am alone be it for a minute or hours my anger and feelings get so intense I can’t think straight. I don’t know what to do, and I don’t have anyone to talk to. If you’ve been there and have advice let me know",21Mar2020,1
196,"Lately I've lost control over my actions, all I do is lay in my bed watching YouTube or scrolling through Instagram, sometimes I feel motivated to get up and do something but when I try to it's almost like my body doesn't let me. It's like I'm only in control of the thing I want to do is comfortable, if it's something like studying I just can't make myself do it. I don't know what to do.",21Mar2020,1
197,"In addition to other mental health problems, I feel like my mental illness is taking away one of my favourite hobbys: reading. Whenever I read a book I like, I often force myself to read the same sentences over and over again. Strangely this doesnt happen when I have to read books or texts for my university lessons, and it feels like the more I care and want to fully understand what I am reading, the more this problem occurs. Is there anything I can do about this?",21Mar2020,1
198,"The other day I had an over the phone appointment with a physiatrist after having it recommended by my family doctor. It was disappointing not having it in person but I'm glad I went through with it. The purpose was for her to make recommendations to my counsellor and family doctor.

  


After the session she said it was clear I dealt with chronic depression, social anxiety with some generalized, with an insecure attachment disorder and signs of borderline personality disorder. Its weird and validating how in one hour she could see many things in me that some I didn't want to believe. It was a shock aswell when she casually said ""So you felt rejected by your father."" I had never thought of it in such plain terms. Sorry for the ramble, thank you if you read this.",21Mar2020,1
