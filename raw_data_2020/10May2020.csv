0,"I don't think I had it until I started living with both parents, childhood experiences such as domestic abuse, and speaking my opinion always resulted in fights between my parents at home. It made me a very quiet individual at home and this carried over to outside and I have anxiety and self esteem problems.",10May2020,1
1,"So my boss sent a text out to me stating that they were going to open back up by next weekend and asked if I wanted to come in.
I work as a server at a private country club.
I just don’t feel safe and I’m still a little paranoid about Covid19 and everything.
I personally think it’s way too soon, and even though restrictions have been lifted, that still doesn’t make me feel any safer.
So I responded back to the message basically saying how I didn’t feel comfortable yet to return so soon and I haven’t heard back...

I struggle with anxiety and depression as it is and I just feel like it will be worse once I go back.
I don’t feel confident enough and I feel like it’s just way too soon for all businesses and restaurants to reopen. Do people really think we can go back to ‘normal’ that quick?
Just last week we were eligible to apply for unemployment, now they’re asking us to come back a week later? I’m just stuck and don’t know what to do..",10May2020,1
2,"2 days ago I cut myself for the first time since I was 15. Now I've only done that once before at 15 and never since. I'm 27,so its been 12 years. I got so stressed and the kids are 24/7 and my fiance and me having breast and cervical cancer im smack dab in the middle of menopause at such a young age. I just felt suffocated and looked for an escape and I cut my self on my left arm 2 times just deep enough to get a little blood to the surface. And did the same to my thigh 6 times. And I don't know what hurts the most,the actual act of doing it or the fact your fiance doesn't even notice even with shorts and shorts sleeves for 2 days?! Like really? Idk. I guess I needed to confess to what I did and to move on from it.",10May2020,1
3,"I have a friend who acts differently when he gets nervous. Whenever some things happen, he suddenly feels dizzy, nauseaus and sometimes he experiences difficulty in breathing. One time he got stuck in traffic he had these symptoms. These kinds of small changes triggers him. I want to help him to ease the attacks but i know he needs professional help. He works overseas but he wanted to got to a doctor when he gets back but thats in 2 years. What can he do for now?",10May2020,1
4,"I can tell I haven't been doing well since I practically gave up on properly finishing the semester. I haven't bounced back and there are around 2 weeks left. I can't sit back and say, ""Online just doesn't work for me."" My school isn't opening again until spring semester 2021. I don't have the luxury of avoiding online. 

Sometimes I wonder if I should have just listened to the advice of many and gotten my health together before started college. Maybe it's my pride keeping me from doing so but I have this feeling that if I take time off, I'm a failure. I'll have disappointed everyone's expectations. Everyone congratulated me on graduating high school early but the only reason I did that is because regular school became too much for me so I tested out. 

Sometimes I'll feel like I'm getting better but then I'll just crash again. I end up in a deep pit of despair and it ruins me anywhere from a day or two to weeks. And sometimes I want to give up altogether. On life altogether. I just have too much anxiety about everything. I can't focus on the now. It's too difficult and worrying about the future makes me want to crawl into a hole. I just want the pain to end.",10May2020,1
5,"I had trouble with addiction to opiates and alcohol when I was younger and when I went off those I took up smoking as a way to cope with the cravings. In the last couple of years caffeine and nicotine has been making me feel really flu-like and nauseous, but I've had some much difficulty with my depression and anxiety that it has been hard to find the willpower to quit. Has anyone else had trouble feeling sick while smoking and feeling stuck because of your mental health? How do the cigarettes interact with depression and anxiety?",10May2020,1
6,"About 2 months ago I had a moment on the way back from work, I came to the realization that I did not want to die anymore. It was unexpected, but seemed like a good thing.

Things haven't been going great lately, probably to do with quarintine and not being able to distract myself. I just don't like me, I hate me. Thoughts along these lines have circled for months when they rarely have before. Only Tonight did it hit me that it was only after I realised I didn't want to die that these thoughts started.

Now I want to live, I have to live with myself. And I have no idea where to start. The feeling of despising yourself day in day out feels worse than wanting to die at the moment.",10May2020,1
7," 

I have been living with anxiety and depression for 15+ years. It has been a series of ups and downs with some consistencies across the span of time that I have endured this life. I am new to Reddit and just wanted to write a post describing what my struggles are like. I lived an average 90's childhood in eastern Missouri. My family has always been lower class, making just enough to scrape by and enjoy a small luxury every now and then. Unlike many who develop mental health differences I was never sexually or physically abused. My family didnt have much but we had plenty of hugs and ""I love you""s. Our family was nominally Christian. We went to church every now and then but faith wasnt taken seriously as a lifestyle but more as a cultural exercise. I performed alright in school and was excited to learn. Only problem there was a complete unwillingness to do homework.With all that being said the first real expression of neuro divergence that I experienced/showed was a phobia of mortality. I can still remember the day that I realized I was going to die sometime in the future. I couldnt have been more than 8 or 9. It hit me like a ton of bricks and overwhelmed me to the point of screaming and crying in abject terror. Like most white midwestern kids I had an understanding and belief in the afterlife but with my parents being nominal in their faith my understanding didnt extend much beyond that. My mother looks back on this being triggered by the death of her father, my grandfather, from cancer. We were really close. This is the part of my suffering that has not went away but only varied in intensity over the years. The idea that I have no choice in the matter of my soul being ripped from my body and translated to a different plane of existence falls upon me like the weight of a mountain. Terror.  
When the latter isnt on the forefront of my mind I experience depression and anxiety that seems to have no apparent source. My anxious feelings consist of feels of impending doom, general restlessness, wanting to flee, thinking im going to have a seizure and physical manifestations like twitching, shaking my legs, upset stomach, biting the dead skin around my fingers (sometimes drawing blood), seeming random aches/pains, light headedness, tunnel vision, rapid heartbeat, and muscle spasms, and unneeded worry about health and disease.When in a depressed state I mentally feel unworthy, uncared for, unsuccessful, unmotivated, regretful, like there is no reason to live, and sometimes suicidal. Physically it expresses itself in feeling drained of energy no matter how much nutrition or rest I get. Very seldom do I experience both depression and anxiety in the same timeframe though.  
Over the years I have tried to pray these things away. I have tried coping mechanisms like exercise, mindfulness, and distractions with the pleasures of life. Some of which has given a little relief but has mostly not helped. I have been and am currently taking psychotropic drugs that have been only marginally helpful. Aside from these things it is a DAILY Craps shoot of emotion. Some days are better than others. Some days I feel almost normal. Most are either neutral at best or negative.  
It is difficult to overcome these things one because they are not well understood by science and two because our healthcare system in America is focused on profits rather than health.  
I wanted to make this much longer and more detailed but the inspiration came and went. Maybe I will add to it in the future.  
To anyone of like experience know that you are not alone! You are not what your mind says you are in the negative.

If anyone has any questions dont hesitate to ask in a comment. If anyone needs to talk in private just shoot me a message.",10May2020,1
8,"Hoping that someone here can give some advice because my inability to help them is messing with my own mental health. Will keep it vague because they browse Reddit.

For a few years now I've known that my sibling suffers from something. It's hard to know what because they don't talk about it - at all. I've tried so many times to communicate with them and they usually just respond with a ""hmmm"" or an eye roll.

They are in their late 20s living in one of parent's home. Hasn't been able keep a job for longer than ~a year. Goes months without working. No apparent plans to do anything with their life. Mostly stays in their room sometimes for weeks without going outside. They go through phases of happiness when they are working and hanging with friends, to complete depression when they ghost on their job and stay in their room for months.

The parent they are living with is a difficult person. I know because I lived with them when I was younger and they can be mentally abusing. I don't think they know they are doing it - they have significant mental health issues of their own and it just trickles down. Still, when I was younger I had to leave their house to stay sane, and eventually had to seek help for the damage they caused. This parent also doesn't talk about their feelings, manipulates us often, gets easily angry if you say anything remotely close to suggesting that they are a ""bad parent"", and recently had a complete panic attack and screamed - ""screaming"" being a huge understatement - at both of us when we brought up an incident from our past. What's worse is the sibling has places he could move to but he won't. 

I left that house ~10 years ago and my sibling stayed. If i had stayed I would be completely messed up today, so I know they can't be doing ok and the signs agree.

Its been torture seeing them wasting their life away, thinking that they might take their life, and me being unable to help. I've tried talking to them, offering them to move with me, paying for courses for them to take a class on a subject they enjoy, taking them on trips, etc. Nothing helps. On top of everything I also worry about the parent. But that's another story. 

I'm losing sleep over it. How do I help them? I just want to see them happy.

Tldr: sibling is depressed. Does not talk to anyone. Living in an abusive household but wont leave it. Its messing with my mental health because I don't know what else to do to help them.",10May2020,1
9,"Reading so many posts on the internet about caring about others, feeling happy for their achievements and so on only brings to my attention the fact that I don't think I care about anyone.

Friends, family, love interests - I've tried to care about what they tell me, but I can't change how I feel. Recognizing others goes completely against my will. I dislike hearing their good news. The only exception is when their good news might benefit me. My friend bought a new motorcycle, that's nice. He might let me ride it. That's the only thing I care about.

I understand this sets me apart from most people. This makes me socially limited. I don't have genuine reactions to what people tell me. All of my reactions are acted out.

90% of the bonding process is a bore for me. It's only nice when it's new, and even that nice feeling is rooted in my interest in getting a status boost from certain friendships. I'm only concerned with the bottom line, not the details of becoming friends with someone.

What can I do about this?",10May2020,1
10,"On a rainy March day, 4 years ago, my parents were out of town and I had a full-fledged suicide plan in place. I turned my phone off, I had filled my dog’s food and water bowls, I had my note printed out, and I sat solemnly in the silence of my home, enjoying what I believed was my final meal- a bowl of Kraft Mac n Cheese. 

You see, I was a freshman in college, and had gotten raped by a man I had recently met. When I attempted to speak out against what happened to me, I was immediately labeled a whore. Anything I said was discredited by him and his friends, since I had freely chosen to go and see him at night. Besides, he was a Marine. His reputation was impeccable. People with so much to lose don’t do things like that, right?

After multiple attempts to tell my foreign parents that I was struggling mentally, and with all of those attempts being minimized to “depression is for the weak”, I had had enough.

Halfway through my Mac n Cheese, I heard a knock at my front door. Strange, since it was a Friday night and I was not expecting company. I decided to answer the door anyways. 

It was a guy I had went to high school with. I did not consider him a friend, but he knew where I lived because we were partners for a high school group project years prior. He kept in touch after high school because during the time we spent working on our group project, he had discovered my closeted obsession for Pokémon. He would occasionally send me interesting updates about the game. Despite this, I overlooked him and admittedly never really thought much about his presence in my life. 

I was, obviously, very confused why he had showed up to my house, unannounced. He reached into his pocket and handed me a pack of unopened Pokémon cards. He said that he had been at the store, and remembered that we had briefly discussed a particular card set a few weeks prior, so he decided to buy it for me. He said that he had texted, asking if he could come drop it off, but that his message was not delivering. Since my house was on the route back to his, he decided to stop by to drop it off. It was a nice gesture, but in that moment, I could not have cared less. As I thanked him and went to close the door, he asked if I wanted to go for a drive. I said no thanks, and that I had other things planned for the night. He was never a pushy guy, but he insisted that I joined him. I sighed, and grabbed my jacket. 

He aimlessly drove me around. We sat in absolute silence for hours, besides him occasionally asking if the temperature in his car was okay and if it was okay if he stopped for gas. I was confused on what we were doing. A part of me was afraid that he was working up the nerve to do what the Marine had done to me months prior. Another piece of me was terrified at the fact that I was too drained, my spirit so broken, to even care if he did. 

But he didn’t.

He drove. He drove until his tank was nearing empty. He went and filled his tank. And then, he kept driving. I don’t know why I didn’t question it, but I guess I was just so relieved that my plans for the night had changed. In that moment, I knew that I, in fact, did not want to kill myself. When my mind came to that realization, I began sobbing hysterically. Would you believe me if I said that he simply kept on driving? He kept driving until I began to doze off. When he noticed, he took me home. As I was exiting his car, he said to me, “Anything else planned for tonight?” I shook my head no. He nodded, and thought for a moment, before saying, “Text me tomorrow to let me know how you liked the cards.” I nodded and went inside. I took the suicide note I had sitting on the coffee table, and put it into my dad’s shredder in his home office. I took the Pokémon cards out of my pocket, and placed them in the place the note had been. I told myself that I would wait to open them the next morning. Because for the first time, in a very long time, there was a “next morning” to look forward to. 


From that day on, Kraft Mac n Cheese became a food I would eat whenever I was feeling particularly low. Rather than it being a last meal of sorts, it now serves as a source of comfort- a reminder that there are always mini sources of joy in this world, whether that be a bowl of Mac n Cheese, or a pack of Pokémon cards.",10May2020,1
11,"I’ve done so much shit that I regret when I wasn’t in the right state of mind. I’ve been used by so many guys, considered the side chick for the two people who really impacted me growing up until I was 22. (I didn’t even know what a side chick was at the time, I just wanted to be loved by someone. I’m friends now with the main chick from the second guy and we talked about how he was abusive to both of us) One of them got me to try drugs with him and I ended up on a 9 month bender which led to me dropping out of school, he stole money from me and then just ghosted me like I was nothing. Then he got a new girlfriend who he made try to fight me when I called him out on it. They just laughed at me like it was funny he took 200 from me. Eventually I did some sex work to get money and I hate the fact I was okay with prostituting myself. About a year or a little more after that my uncle died, and I have a small family so losing him was really painful. My weed dealer around this time in 2018 took me out to a bar, I got really drunk and we had sex and I ended up getting pregnant and had to get an abortion two years ago. Which still kinda fucks me up because my first ex was supposed to go with me to get it, but then cancelled on me the day of and I had to go through that alone. 

 I feel like I have no worth. I work with animals right now and I’m going back to school online to work as a vets assistant in about a week but I feel like my past will never let me move on. 

I don’t even know what I want people to say. I tripped on acid last month and ever since then my mind hasn’t been working the same. I’m remembering a lot shit I thought I forgot.

I’ve been so alone and honestly don’t feel like anyone would want to be in a relationship with me. I’m damaged goods

12,I’ve this habit from like 20 yrs now. Used to pluck the hair from my head initially which had left a ugly looking patch. I couldn’t help my hands automatically starting to roll on my head. Later switched from head to body hair which was ample. I kind of collect the hair plucked and throw it in the garbage every once in a while. I understand it’s a weird habit but does that mean I like self-harm? I’m not sure what kind if condition it is. My wife thinks it’s some kind of disorder and I kind of agree but it hasn’t  affected me in anyway so far.,10May2020,1

(Posted this earlier but took it down, hence why its formatted as such). 

\*\*Hi!\*\*  


I'm a social work major, along with graduating with an additional bachelors in sociology and very close to my BSW and grad school! Most my professors say I’m incredibly talented, but before I begin clinical practice in any setting, I believe I need to address some things. To describe my functionality as a roller-coasters an understatement, however I remain in honors standing with a 3.6 GPA.  


\*\*Past Diagnosis:\*\*  


I have been diagnosed by different professionals over the course of my adolescence and early adulthood with GAD, PTSD and OCD with all varying levels of insight based upon stress. I also have been diagnosed with MPD, varying levels of SUDS and ADHD, all this concurrent with elevated SI and Passive SI. Also, as a preteen, I struggled with clinically significant Anorexia that was responded with rapid refeeding and medical/clinical intervention. I have been given two psychosocial exams confirming everything above, but as they were administered before 18, it’s been awhile and anything axis two was ruled out.  


\*\*Treatment History:\*\*  


I spent most of my adolescence in and out of Inpatient and RTC settings, however I did attend wilderness therapy and some of the RTC's focused on behavioral interventions instead of the regular Talk therapy and social interventions I was used too. Most practitioners (As I bounced around due to insurance and different levels of care) told me I had treatment refractory OCD. Most of the differential diagnosis came from clinicians trying to describe self-destructive, interpersonal difficulties and suicidal behavior. As this is often not concurrent with moralized OCD, if anything one would suspect my behavior to be incredibly well defined and rigid due in regulation of obsessional content.  


\*\*Past Symptoms:\*\*  


Regardless I did 6 months of residential intensive EXRP for OCD among the 18 months of residential, which reduced my symptoms. My current Y-BOCS score is a 23, oppose to a 33 when entering treatment, however while in treatment and in outpatient settings I stacked up multiple suicide attempts and many other suicidal gestures. I also have intermittently self-harmed along with the suicide attempts, misused substances, participated in abnormal eating behaviors, impulsive sexual behavior and what I would describe as a general recklessness, with intent to hurt myself but not disfigure or kill  


\*\*Current Symptoms:\*\*  


My life has greatly improved since adolescence and I have a level of insight into my obsessional content that allows me too function. However, this previous fall I started college, after some years of community college, I started living independently in the dorms and have struggled incredibly with everything but OCD, which although remains clinically significant, is normalized and addressable. I have some trauma from being gone from my family as an adolescent and self-induced traumatic situations, but none of this explains how or what I’m currently struggling with  


\*\*Overview:\*\*  


I believe I have an axis 2 disorder, most likely BPD. This is not an admission concurrent with morality, its conducive to my internal and external world. In hindsight these past two semesters were a casebook example of unchecked BPD. Whereas I was functional in class, I alienated almost everyone I knew and became dependent on a select few people who I begged not to abandon me, leading to eventual alienation of everyone but a select few people.  


When in a social situation I become almost obsessive with power dynamics, idolization and devaluation. I met a person that on a biweekly basis I would break into tears at the slightest sign of what I perceived as abonnement. The friendship soon turns to love, which was not reciprocated in response I upped my behavior and idolization in worry an attempt to prove to myself that I was lovable. Outside of my relation to her, I acted incredibly erratically to gain attention. I had a few physical altercations with dorm mates that were deescalated by the RA, and other more conventional fights that were setup. I struggled with anger in class and was often passive aggressive or straight up aggressive to my peers. I saw this as a victimization, and it began to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  


I began self-harming again. I hurt myself fighting but refused to see a doctor for three weeks until an intervention by my then friends as I liked the physical pain, I was in. The thought process was that I deserved the pain, so I per-mutated it as much as I could, fighting more and by the time I saw a doctor they said there was no point in intervening because it had been weeks of the injury being abused and it had healed in an odd way that they didn’t want to operate on.  


Compiled with fighting and self harming I also was heavily into substance use. I used over ten different substances on a biweekly basis and had a reputation for partying incredibly hard. When finals came, I was so withdrawn and hadn’t slept for 72 hours that I did not show up and instead received extensions due to all my professors seeing the state I was in. It is of note that I also tripped on an absurd amount of shrooms and acid that, during the come down I walked back to my dorm through a snowstorm still high for 7 miles. That trip was one of the worst experiences of my life.  


Winter break came by and nobody really knew the extent of how bad the semester had gone. Within a few days of coming home to my family I took an overdose as an attempt to kill myself and was hostipilized and spent 36 hours in the ICU. Nobody really knows the extent of damage it did, and I have no idea what that level of serotonin can do. Regardless I was institutionalized which I checked myself out after a few days and then finished my finals which where incompletes, receiving A’s in each one.  


I went back for the second semester, the girl I thought I loved cut me off completely as I lied to her about copying her homework as a test to see if she would still be close to me. The test backfired and I she cut me off.  


I spiraled back into substance abuse, self-harm, erratic behavior and self-hate for about a few weeks. It got to a point where I didn’t think I needed to attempt again because I was going to die from my lifestyle any day from then on. At my worst I was walking the streets for hours late at night of various drugs, barely able to stand up, in very cold weather underdressed hoping that someone would harm me accidentally. This happened a few times, one night blacked out and woke up in my dorm with a broken toe, opposite direction it was supposed to be, a torn shirt and blood on my face.  


That was my rock bottom, after roughly 8 suicide attempts, covered in self inflicted wounds and pretty much friendless and destitute in almost every way. I withdrew alone from drugs that week and then my school shut down from Covid.  


My family has little idea what happened outside of my suicide attempt over winter break. I cut myself off from everybody I knew and spent my days in self reflection and doing my online courses. I occasionally abused substances but have abstained for 2 days and have been up to two weeks sober recently. I’m 20 so I obviously know that I have a future ahead of me, but I need to make some drastic changes to my personality before I can be successful. This semester I did not receive incompletes and got a high GPA despite the substance abuse and behavior.  


\*\*Current:\*\*  


I have been self-harm and suicide attempt free for roughly 2 months. I often feel paranoid and dissociative and sometimes even delusional. As I’m knowledgeable about phycology I administered the BDPSI for the last three months and did my best to answer without any defensiveness, scoring a 40.  


I spend about two hours a day doing dbt worksheets and self-reflection. I really want to be healthy, but I get incredibly impulsive and filled with self-hate, hence the current substance abuse. I’ve tried residential which, I guess I blame partially for my maladaptive coping strategies and I’m fluent in DBT, CBT and ACT.  


Because I found a sort of stabilization and med adherence/ destructive behavior free time, I feel like I can begin doing the work I need to do to recover and return to college without behaving like I did. However, I feel extensively damaged, my mood fluctuates multiple times a day to extremes and I still live with a great deal of anxiety. I’m working so incredibly hard at keeping this upward growth, but I worry that it won’t be sustainable with a pretty intense intervention. I plan on sharing this with my social worker who I’ve been seeing, and I currently feel safe, as to mention my intention of posting is to ask for advice to improve.  


I’ve taken responsibility almost to fault, I’m working on completing ADLS and med adherence and making sure I do at least the bare minimum everyday of therapeutic intervention to keep this growth up. Currently I’m open to any suggestion or insight about my current condition and although I don’t want to over diagnosed, I feel like my whole experience falls under the blanked of cluster b traits.  


Suggestions, Therapies and realizations? I’m stable enough now and want to change as I’m willing to feel worse to make sure these things don’t happen again. I cant say it enough, I want to be functional and productive.",10May2020,1

15,"After recent events in the family that I had to endure for the past few hours, it really started hitting me just how much I've gotten myself into this hole that I can't seem to get out of. Having my mother collapse for the second time this year due to undiagnosed vasovagal syncope, having little to no advancement for my life goals, and the overall state of my mental health as of late, things have been taking a downward spiral in regards to just how much I've failed to be a effective, productive member of society. This has been compounding to a point where I just feel so stuck without anyway to get out of this stoop, and I can ascertain that things are only going to get worse from here.

I didn't envision my life to come out like this when I graduated high school, I had goals that I wanted to achieve, things that I wanted to do, places that I wanted to see, be truly independent without having to rely on others to a point where I am completely bound to them. 

I wanted to join the Marines, get a master's degree in the field that greatly fits with my interests and be able to do something with my life where I could have made a meaningful difference in whatever field that I was into. After getting permanently disqualified, wasting my time in college, and being perpetually drowned in my own self-loathing behavior, I don't have anywhere else to turn. I'll be 26 this year and I have absolutely nothing to show for it, except for an ever-increasing detail of my deteriorating mental health by my psychiatrist. Nothing I do ever works out in my favor, and it shows to a very significant degree.

I don't know what to do, I'm just existing, almost coming to tears at just how much I messed up in my life, the constant thought of having to explain my situation to people makes me not want to even try anymore, having to be like this and having to be there for family members with health problems is taking a great toll on me and I just feel so alone and underutilized.

This state of being has got to the point where the increasingly few days that I can find the motivation to leave my bed, are now filled with a fear that I might do something or have some interaction that will add to my regrets and just become yet another memory to taunt me.

I've struggled with this for 15 years. I am now 30 and its the worst it's ever been. I look back on my life so far and know that I have wasted it. 

Drugs dont help, neither does talking (infact my biggest ""breakdown"" came as a result of talking about my problems because I then felt pressured to hide my emotions) and my emotions are all over the place; quick to anger then full of remorse, it's like I am the fucking living embodiment of Jekyll and Hyde. I lie just so I dont have to face it.

Doctors can't help me. Anti-depressants work for a bit and then wear off. The only drugs that helped were the sleeping tablets. I finally got decent sleep. But I kept upping the dose until the night I was very ill. And now I cant get a prescription for them anymore.

My partner is the most wonderful woman I have ever known. She is the only person that I have ever loved since we first met all the way back in upper school. But she still doesn't know the extent of my problems. Sure she knows that I feel depressed ""at times"", have insomnia, anxious around people, have no love for my family or friends, or passions of any kind, but she doesn't know how removed from society I really am; how i view most people with distain, how i hate myself and yet judge others with equal amounts contempt... except for her. She is reason I try to keep going.

We had a fight. A big one. And she broke it off with me. 

In my heart of hearts I know that she would be better off without me because she deserves someone who is at least normal, who can engage with her family and go on nights out and enjoy themselves. Yet, selfishly, I clawed my way back into a second chance by making promises to change, open up, be honest and become normal. I just dont think I have the capacity to do this.

A few months before the fight I noticed she had started taking antidepressants. And it's only now that I see how unhappy she was. It was an insidious change, slow and hard to recognise. She used to be so bright and bubbly, so full of life and happy. I cant help but blame myself for this change in her. Am I right to have this second chance? Is this right for her? Fuck if I know.

But I know one thing, more so now than ever that I am walking a find line between finally sorting myself out or collapsing into the darkest depths that I have ever known. 

I know how this post reads; full of self pitying narsacistic bullshit (and believe me I will regret writing this as soon as I post it) but its honest. The first time in a long time that I have been honest. And truly I hope that I can change and start to enjoy the rest of my life, together with her. But if I cant change, if I have to suffer the pain and frustration of living inside my head for the rest of my days, I now know that I dont have the strength for that. 

This is my make or break moment, literally do or die.

(And in the case of the latter it would be just my luck that reincarnation is true and I come back as a fucking maggot or something, but probably fitting).

21,"This has stuck with me since 7th grade and I still don't have an answer.

When I was in 7th grade I was struggling to say the least. It was never noticeable to anyone because I was really good at covering it up. Like really good. I had good grades, I smiled and made jokes all the time, ate everything that came in my path and I had a lot of school friends. But under all that, I was a really big mess. I was cutting myself (and when anyone noticed I'd say it was my cat) and I was binge eating my stress away. I was able to tell a few people that I have been fantasizing about ending my life. Through a series of events I'd rather not get into, my mom found out. And she was convinced that it was all for attention. And this is where I got really confused. I don't know if I would call it abuse, but my dad has always been physical when he gets mad at me. I'm a girl by the way. On top of not ever getting along with my dad, my mom tends to just watch him get mad at me. And I think it's okay to get mad, but the things he would get mad about were unreasonable. first it was because I didn't change into my PJs right after he had asked me to, then it was because I didn't sharpen my pencil when he had asked, another was when I was watching YouTube in my free time. All of this and more was responded with getting punished. I remember once I didn't get him water when he asked (I had asked him why he couldn't get it himself which I will admit was rude of me) he throw my head against the wall. the time I was watching YouTube I was thrown down the stairs. my mom just watched all of it. btw my mom is a nurse who deals with mental health patients just to add some context to the story.

Let's also talk about how I've also been about 20 pounds more than my sister. we're a year apart but the same height (I'm younger) and my dad likes to grab my belly sometimes and ask my why it's sticking out. LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHO!! He would always criticize me for eating and always talk about how skinny my sister is. My mom would join in on this too. They always encouraged me to lose weight, but I guess they didn't know how ugly it made me feel. I was never concerned with how I looked until high school. my sophomore year I stopped eating. I would restrict and if I did eat I would throw it up. I was finally in control. Everyone was complimenting me on my new body. For once, I was really really happy!! My mom noticed that I was loosing a lot of weight and she got mad at me for it. Not mad because she was concerned about my health, no, mad because she wasn't losing weight like me. She would go to the gym every day and eat healthy but she wouldn't lose the weight as quickly as I did. and she got really mad for some reason. She would now always comment that I was getting to skinny that I had to get back to my normal weight (20 pounds more than my sister). I remember once in public she was asking my dad if my arm was thinner than hers. He said it was and I will forever remember the look on her face. I didn't want to go back to being the fat one. 

Mind you, my mother was the one who found out that I wanted to kill myself when I was in 7th grade.

I guess my question is, why did she think I would say I wanted to kill myself attention? I think for sure losing the weight was defiantly for attention. I wanted to finally feel pretty, and I did (btw I'm a junior now and I've gained all that weight and more back. My anxiety has gotten really bad that it's taken over my entire life. If I'm not pacing around (which I can do for hours. I don't know why but it's very soothing), I'm stuffing my face with food. I can't do anything. I'm not doing very well which is what compelled me to write this). I just need to know that I'm not the crazy one. Well maybe I am, but I didn't want to kill myself for attention. Even now when I do think about killing myself its not for attention. It has never been about attention. I think it would just make everyone's lives a lot easier if I didn't exist. And I know someone is going to come at me and say ""No your life has meaning don't do it"" just stop I won't kill myself at least not any time soon but when I say that everyone's lives would be easier without me it would. It's a fact. and you can't change facts love.",10May2020,1

23,"Hi everyone, I (27m) recently went through a long (4 month) breakup with my girlfriend (26). She had told me after Christmas that her new year's resolution was to learn how to be independent and self sufficient. Meaning she wanted to learn how to live on her own. During these 4 months an ex also reached out to her since he was going to boot camp, this made her realize that she still loved him. She said she loves me too and that both feelings feel different to her. Then she left at the end of April when our lease was up. It was hard and we spent the last day holding each other and crying nonstop.

Due to the virus going around, my move was delayed by a month and now I'm stuck in our old half empty apartment with all these memories. I've been so depressed and unmotivated that I literally binged the entire US version of the office in 3 or 4 days. Sleep is almost nonexistent until I pass out from exhaustion. I've found less and less joy doing the things I used to love. And it all just hurts so bad. 

We still talk a little bit, I guess my emotions slipped into our conversation one day, because she said she needs more space and to talk a little less because it makes her uncomfortable and hurts. It hurts me to see her on social media, which I've found myself looking at more and more. (Not just for her, but to pass the time) I do therapy once a week it helps, and at the same time I lack motivation to do what she says. I'm lonely, lost, and hurt.",10May2020,1

25,"I don’t think I have a great relationship with food. All my life has been spent thinking about what to eat, what not to eat, calories,diets etc and I’m sick of it. I don’t want to do it anymore. 

I was large for most of my childhood and decided to lose weight freshman year of high school. I worked really hard and I was able to go down from 200 to 140 pounds. I was so happy, I was confident, but once the allure of being “skinny” wore off I realized that I was still miserable and depressed. This thing I wanted so bad (being skinny) was just a temporary fix for how crappy I felt inside all the time so I started to binge eat. 

Now I have gained all that weight back and some. I am currently in the process of trying to lose weight. I am exercising more and trying to eat less and keep track of my calories. But I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life. I don’t want everyday spent worrying about gaining weight or eating too much. I envy those that never have to think about it like my sister who eats what she wants and stays relatively the same size. 

I feel like I hate food. I hate that it makes me fat. I hate that I’m almost addicted to it and still feel the desire to binge eat all the time. I hate starving myself for days and then breaking and eating enough food for 4 people in one day. I just wish I didn’t have to eat. I honestly wish food didn’t exist and that we all could sustain ourselves by pulling energy from the sun or something. This way I never have to worry myself with my weight again. 

The sick thing about losing weight is that it’s never about your health. At least not for me. I’m not trying to lose weight to be healthy. I’m trying to lose weight to be skinny which I’m sure by now all of us know being skinny doesn’t automatically make you healthy. 

I know losing weight won’t really fix anything. I hate myself. I always have. I’m 24 now and can barley look myself in the mirror without crying. I harm myself. I punch myself in the head. I have very negative thoughts everyday and honestly I’m only still here because I love my family and they do love me. 

I’ve gone to therapy. It’s always so so.

It's agonizing, more than ever before, and now instead of easing with time, it just hurts more every day.
My trust has been shattered before, but this time it was so vulnerable that I think there's nothing left.
I hate myself for everything I said to contribute to it. This time I was so convinced I had grown, that I can't even begin to think about trusting myself to open up emotionally again after this time. 
I've completely regressed and fallen from an absolute mountain of personal growth that I turned out to be completely wrong about. I thought I was learning better, but it all still led to the same empty place, only this time it's unimaginably more painful, because I really, *really* believed. 
I know to get professional help. I have. It's the first thing. I've developed abandonment coping skills in the past. But I was too vulnerable this time and nothing is working now.

I’m not just simply intrigued by the idea of love like many aromantic people are, but instead I’ve just always felt like the way my brain works - and the way I operate as a human - I need somebody else. Not just a friend, somebody more, someone I can talk to when I’m hurt, someone I can share time with, a girl who just rides on my wavelength. Someone I can just spend my life with. I feel lonely and depressed a lot of the time, because I feel like I have it in me - I would give every last part of me to the right person if she exists - but I’ve never found someone who vibrates on my frequency, and I have very little hope that I’ll ever find someone like that because I’m aromantic and incapable of feeling romantic attraction.

I wish I cared less about this, but no matter how hard I try I can’t stop feeling depressed about this. I have felt like this for years and everything just feels wrong. I keep on thinking I’m never going to have a family, I’ll be alone for the rest of my life, and the depression comes from the fact that I have the longing but can’t feel love, combined with the fact that I have nothing to come home to, nothing to look forward to in the next day. I don’t want to fall asleep at night because then I’ll have to wake up alone again, to go through another day where I have no motivation to do anything because I’m not doing it for anybody.

34,"TW: abuse, suicide

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past couple of years, I have been going to regular therapy due to strained relationships with my entire family. My aim was to form a stronger bond with each of them. Over the past several weeks, I have come to realize that in addition to emotional abuse from my parents and physical abuse from my brother, my parents sexually abused me. My dad was primarily responsible, but my mom was aware of what he did and abused me at least once that I remember. I am not sure how old I was, but I believe it was from ages at least 4 to 7. It is hard to remember. I have reflected on these experiences in the past and simply saw them as odd and bothersome. Now that I have formed good relationships in my life and have explored my familial relationships in therapy, I see these things more for what they are. It explains many of my fears and behaviors in life--fear of sex, anger over anyone touching my bed (even as a child), etc. My skin crawls when anyone even comes close to touching me.

I am having great difficulty accepting what happened to me. I still have a complicated relationship with my parents, but I love them dearly anyway. My dad continues to attempt to exert control over my life even though I live on the other side of the country now. He constantly reminisces over my childhood and seems to prefer my life as a little girl over that as a successful woman. While I realize this is not necessarily unusual, he continues specifically to mention how much he misses our dates and the time when I was his girlfriend. Still not \*necessarily\* indicative of anything nefarious, but very odd. Reflecting on my past experiences, I now believe that part of what he misses is being able to completely control me and abuse me. 

This has been extremely difficult to process. I had such despair over it that I pushed me into a major depressive episode and led me to attempt suicide last week. I ended up in the ER and am now physically well and will shortly being an partial hospitalization/intensive therapy program. I have not revealed my experiences to anyone. I am not yet ready to tell any of my friends (who I consider my real family) or my therapists about all of this. So I am posting it here. I have to get it out there, even on this throwaway account. I don't know what else to do. It has been nearly 20 years since this happened to me and I am only now starting to process it.",10May2020,1

36,"So I've struggled with self harm, depression, and anxiety since fifth grade, and everyone thinks I just want attention. I began slitting my wrists in seventh.

One day, my dad notices my arm and starts screaming at me for wanting attention. Take note that depression runs in my family (specifically the females), and anxiety is common too. My dad told me that ""I didn't think you were like all the other teenagers who faked depression, I expect more from you.""

To a certain degree, yes there are people who fake a mental illness, but that's always dumb obvious. People don't attempt suicide several times just for fun. Also yeah, the rise of teenagers with  depression is growing, but there are hundreds of variables that are causing this.

The hardest part was hiding it from others or holding it in. I would cry at the drop of a hat and not understand why, but in all reality I was healing.

Which is awesome because I really wanted to experience the West Coast but I've been distant to my old self. Not wanting to go do anything or really talk to anyone. Not even my girlfriend..

My friends would call but I just didn't want to answer. I'd never go out with them even if I had previously agreed to do so. The only time I'd leave (other than work) was to buy food and more alcohol. My room turned into a mess with trash and beer bottles covering every horizontal surface I could reach from my desk.

He told me about how his father was an abusive alcoholic and how that turned him into an alcoholic. Then he waited for me to tell him my story. Only I don't know what that story would be. I know I struggle with depression or some kind of mood disorder. I know I was bullied as a kid. I know I was raised dirt poor by a narcissistic absent mother, but he seemed to suspect more. After some thought, I remembered an exchange I had with a friend. He told me he was almost sexually abused by a man in a theater bathroom and that his parents had set him up with another kid who was sexually abused in hopes that they could work through a shared trauma together. Though he didn't say it explicitly, I think he was talking about me. I don't have any memory of abuse, but I have had women suspect that about me too.

Negative emotions that have no connection to reality is my daily struggle. Some days I feel great for no reason too(manic?), but those are rare. I have strong urges to distance myself from people even though I know I feel worse without human interaction. My libido and appetite are also all over the place. I usually try to internalize all of this, but sometimes I lash out at others verbally. So far I try to handle everything by running long distances and smoking cannabis. Having a high energy dog to take care of helps too. 

It's been hard for me to make sense of things. Depression and sexual abuse have a lot of overlapping symptoms. I also don't have any family to ask about my past and I don't think my own memories before middle school are intact. I can't be certain because I don't know how much you are supposed to remember from that age, but there definitely seem to be gaps. 

By writing this I was hoping someone with similar traumas or symptoms might be able to share some information they found helpful with me. I know everyone is struggling with something so I hope that you stay strong and take it one day at a time.",10May2020,1
47,"So, I’ve been cutting for a little bit but I’ve stopped and haven’t been doing so for a couple days. But when the scar gets itchy or i have to re-dress it/ look at it/ pay any attention to it, i start having a panic attack and i just want to get it off of me.

48,"This is my first post, I've(28M) been on reddit for a while now but never made an account or posted ever. But I've seen the good side of this place. 

Long story short, life hasnt been the worst but it certainly hasnt been the best. Coming from a broken home, no father figure, mother addicted to drugs and a habitual lying thief who passed away when I was in my early 20s, rest of the family was on drugs (immediate that is) and my grandfather is the only person whose ever been there and hes my rock. Been thru drug usage myself but been clean for a while(7 years back in february) besides smoking herb to attempt to keep my sanity and sleep when I can. Recently finally made a step to remove a past relationshit that was beyond terrible. Physical and verbal abuse on top of being degraded infornt of many friends who I've lost over the past few years. As well as destroying my ego ans self esteem to the point of i feel I'm not good enough for anyone and cant let myself get or even talk myself into getting intimate or have any type of relationship with a woman because I'm not ""Man"" enough. 

My roommate is another rock, was there whenever I got clean and has helped the entire time. But recently, over the past at least 2 years I've been in a constant state of depression and my anxiety is the worst it's ever been. Lost a job that brought more stress on me that I realized too late, completely destroyed my financial stability that I had been able to get back too as well as kept me from doing anything i knew that brought me sanity and some peace along with putting me behind on my Bill's especially rent which has driven me to the point of worrying if I'm gonna be able to pay rent or wake up to an eviction notice or the threat I got 3 weeks ago with police forcefully kicking me out. On top of the pandemic we are in, I'm located where it hasnt been the worst outbreak but it's still not the best, I was able to get a job as an ""essential worker"" but the hours are thru the night and it keeps me basically from doing anything during the day besides sleeping upwards of 10hrs, mostly because I cant afford to eat so I sleep instead, cant motivate myself to get out when I do have time to do any type of hobby I do enjoy. Idk what to do or what to think at times. I know this is a jumbled up mess but I dont know where to reach out too. I've been suicidal for years dating back to when I was a teenager, I contacted the Hotline here in the states but...idk if it helped...it did but it didn't. I dont know what to do. Lately I've wanted to just drop it all and end it all because it doesnt seem worth it anymore. The stress, the pain, any of it. Idk if any of this makes sense but I've read alot of posts, and I just need something, or someone to listen. I want to be okay, but i dont know what to do or where to start.",10May2020,1
49,"Not that I show it to people except with the few I’m close with and when I’m by myself. Basically sometimes I have this urge to be all cuddly and act like a child. Basically talking in a baby voice and being very into soft objects like pillows, animals, cute drawings, etc. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I go into full child mode. I can 100% consciously regulate it. But I’ve noticed this with myself ever since. I revert into this soft, innocent state. Especially when touching soft objects like pillows. There’s always the urge. 

Can someone explain why I do this? Is there a theory for it? 

P.S. I used to have bad anxiety but now I’m pretty normal. Also, when I was younger, my brother used to think up imaginary characters and make me believe them (not that I did for long). Maybe those pieces of info can be helpful. Or maybe there’s no correlation.",10May2020,1

I have mental and emotional issues. I was diagnosed with depression, ADHD, and other disorders.
I have low self esteem, anger issues, and I tend to hold on to grudges easily and for a long time. 

But another thing that impacts my mental health and week being is my thought process and beliefs. 

You see, I currently don’t have ANY friends at all. And I choose to not make any and I purposely isolate myself for long periods of time. 

My problem isn’t anxiety. 

The reason is because I feel like going out of my way make friends feel pathetic because I feel as if I’m looking and ‘needing validation from other people and I’m letting them ‘decide’ my worth. They can either reject me or accept me and be friends with me. 
I rather have people approach me and talk to me.

And another reason why I isolate myself is because of my weird and unobtainable desire to be “special” and unique. I feel like hanging out with people will make me just like them. Average and boring. I wish I could be more than average. I wish I could Stand our from the crowd in a good way. 

However despite all of this I still feel lonely and a desire to have friends and a social circle. I often fantasize about meeting people in anime conventions because I love anime. 
People from anime conventions seem so friendly and fun to be around. I fantasize about hanging with them and talking and having fun and supporting each other and having each other’s backs if something were to happen to us. 

But my mentality keeps me from talking to people. 

So I’d like to ask your opinions on what i said. 
And is going out of your way to meet people pathetic?",10May2020,1
51," 

Why does it hurt so much when someone says that they don't want to talk to you? I understand that we all need our alone time, but I don't know, it still hurts. Even if I understand it. My sister says im emo, i just don't understand why that would be a bad thing, even if she is just joking it makes me feel like i cant talk to her sometimes. I feel like i'm overreacting, but how do i not overreact? How am I supposed to not feel it? I’m mad at a lot of stuff right now. Sometimes I want a hug but I'm too scared of being rejected that I won't ask, I want one right now. 

I feel like I'm a bad person. I feel like I am gross and that if people saw all of me, they wouldn't like me. Maddy doesn't think that but it's hard trying to convince someone that. How do I explain to someone why they shouldn’t love me? It's a gut feeling, I can't remember when I thought differently. It’s so true and real and it hurts. I feel like there's a barrier between me and people. Maybe it's my curse?  I’m such a cry baby too, why do i tear up everytime. It's not even stuff that I want to cry about half the time. 

I wonder if I'm manipulative? I don't try to be but I think I am, I must just be a shitty person in the core. I don't have a lot of “normal” morals and I don't know why. I don't know why I feel so hurt right now, I feel like i'm overreacting. All she said to me was “I don't feel like talking right now sorry” But it hurts it hurts so bad. And I feel alone even though its stupid to think that. And it's not her problem that I'm such a pussy. My head always hurts when I cry too. That's the worst part because my head feels so full after. God i feel like such a shitty person, i don't know why i just am. Well actually i feel like i know why but i don't? I know why I'm shitty. But if you asked me then i don't think that i could answer. And not because i don't WANT to tell you but because i wouldn't know how to put it into words. 

Maybe I think too much. I've always thought that. But not necessarily in the anxiety way like I'm not worrying. I think about what everyones doing around me, I think about what they're thinking, and how they are feeling. And what they think of me, and then I think about what I'm doing. I feel like everything hurts me more than other people. I also feel like I can't talk to people. I also think I might have some social or mental disability. That's not a joke. I’ve always thought that I'm probably on the spectrum, maybe. That would explain why I am bad at talking to people. I feel like I'm self aware and that I know when to talk about something and i'm pretty good at reading the room but I still feel a disconnect. I get nervous when talking to people and it's hard for me to relate to people. At least at work it is. I feel too dumb. I also feel like I'm a different person each day. Or I have different “moods”. I'm never the same and I hate it. And it's not like I can't try to be a certain way, sometimes I just am that way. I feel like that is another reason that people don't like me, I'm not the same hailey everyday. I dont know whats wrong with me, but something definitely or not i'm not really sure. All I know is that I don't want to feel like this all the time.",10May2020,1
52,Today my friends wanted to play basketball. They invited me over to one of there houses and we decided to walk to the park. Between us and the park was rail road tracks. A train was parked on the tracks and we decided to walk along the dirt road on the side while wait for the train to move so we can pass. Once it did two of my friends decide to run across. Where the first train ended a new one started. We had no way of hearing it or seeing it due to the other train in the way there was no horn or nothing. One of my friends made it across but the other was hit and died instantly. I saw his body fly and him hit the floor. There was only four of us and i was the only one to see it. The police took our accounts and they let our parent's pick us up and go. I cant get the images of how he was hit and i cant get the image of his body out of my mind.

53,"I’ll probably instantly regret posting this. I can’t help but feel it’s a little self Indulgent, and who am I to whinge about my life to a bunch of strangers. But I feel at breaking point and I needed to reach out for some support. 

I feel myself spiralling so badly, and the last 2 weeks things have been getting worse and worse. 

I’m doing everything I know I should - I’m sticking to my exercise routines, I’m taking my medication, I’ve increased the frequency of my therapy sessions, I’ve started yoga again. Im trying to meditate. I’m just not coping. 

The social isolation with COVID is hard, and I know I’m lucky that we are quite safe here, so I’m racked with guilt about complaining about it. I used to miss people so badly at the start, now I just want to avoid everyone - I have just gone into my mental cave. 

I’ve also had some other health challenges in amongst all this, I found out I hurt my best friend so badly a while ago I think he’s gone for good, my family just feels fractured and the wife of a good friend passed away this morning (on top of that it’s Mother’s Day here) leaving 3 kids under 8 behind. I guess this is what’s triggered me today, but I just can’t get over this feeling that everything is hopeless right now. 

I know I have a lot of be grateful for. I have an amazing fiancé, but we’re having to postpone our wedding from this year due to everything as well. I feel good about that as I don’t really feel I’m in a positive enough headspace for a celebration anyway. 

I think the issue with my friend coming to a head is making me feel the worst of all, because normally I would lean on him for support, and I don’t have that right now. And I just feel like I let him down so badly and I can’t forgive myself for it at the moment. 

So I’m struggling. 

I don’t know what the purpose of this post really is, other than perhaps making me feel like if I tell someone it might make me feel better just getting it out.

61,"Im a 16 year old guy and a junior in High School. Since around last summer, I have been fixating very strongly on the fact that I've never been in a relationship. I've never even held a girls hand, or had a close female friend. All of my friends have or had girlfriends and it unfortunately makes me feel so insecure and jealous. Makes me feel like a total loser. My anger has been getting extremely out of hand to the point where I'm starting to lash out at friends and family. I'm becoming a person I don't want to be. My friends look so happy and are experiencing the best parts of being a teenager while I rot in boredom and loneliness, and to top it off, they brag about it on purpose because they know it upsets me. I don't hate women. I hate myself for being such a loser. I hate myself for being so hideously ugly (bloated and assymetrical face, disgusting acne ridden greasy skin, tired droopy eyes, etc. I hate myself for being so short (5'4). I hate myself for being so weird and socially retarded. I hate myself because my family is poor. If I was a girl, I wouldn't date me either. 

I tried going out to the mall and asking out girls, dressing nice with the little money I get. Trying to act confident. Doesnt work and one girl straight up called me ""Ugly"" one time.

I tried talking and befriending my crushes. I can tell by their body language that they dislike me and find me unattractive, along with being uncomfortable due to my social retardation. There was a senior girl who I crushed on badly and wanted to talk to but unfortunately corona happened and I'll never see her again. I thought we she would actually be the one and it's been destroying me ever since.

I showered daily, took care of my hair, and overall good hygiene but that wont fix ugly in my case.

Starting in middle school and as recently as February, girls would often ask me out as a joke and humiliate me if I believed them. One time a girl told me to meet her at a mall and just didn't show and mocked me when I confronted her about it. Another time a girl that I once liked screenshotted my instagram profile and started calling me ugly to my friend, just bc I followed her. Ive been called ugly several times. It hurts alot. Guys treat me shit too tho.

My life is a mess rn in quarantine. All I can think about is how I cant be happy and how much more happier my friends lives are than mine, and how ill be alone forever. My anger is becoming irrational, nonstop, almost manic, and very difficult to stop. Suicidal and homicidal thoughts are common. Ive been depressed ever since my dad died when I was 12 and it has been getting progessively worse as I get older. All I do rn is smoke weed to numb my thoughts, jack off, and sleep 12 hours a day. I'm pathetic. Depression and Anger aren't my only issues tho. I have ADHD, General and Social Anxiety, and Avoidant + Borderline personality disorders. I just want to be out of this shit. I haven't felt true happiness without weed in a very, very long time.

But now obvs the pool’s closed, and I don’t have any other way to achieve that feeling of calm and acceptance.

66,"Hi, I am 24 and feel like I need to move out of my parent's house as soon as possible, with my mother (56), due to not feeling safe in my home with my mentally ill father. My unemployed father (61) has a mental illness for around a decade now (most likely schizophrenia or some sort of paranoia/delusional disorder) and has never gotten a diagnosis due to him not wanting to seek help. I have attempted over the years to help him seek help and have gone as far as calling 911 multiple times, however due to his unwillingness to be helped as well as him not having threatened the safety of himself or our family yet, they are unable to help. His condition is deteriorating rapidly enough in the wake of the quarantine that I no longer feel safe in the household. He has no friends or other other relatives that he could live with, so he will most likely be living by himself. He has never applied for unemployment benefits despite being unemployed since 2008 I believe, out of pride/ego. He does receive money from a rental of our old townhouse, around $1600 a month I believe. He does not want to live in our current house due to believing it to be bad luck. The mortgage on our houses as well as all of our vehicles are paid off. As the current house's mortgage is paid off due to inheritance money from my dad's side of the family, he would likely claim to have all the money if he sells it and then move to somewhere else, if we do decide to separate, which my mom and I don’t mind.

Genuine question here, cause i have a friend that claims to be depressed. But its hard to believe because this is the latest among a plethora of illnesses she has supposedly gone through. And she is using it to justify her financial abuse of her friends, including me. To give you guys context, i'll provide an example. She recently broke up with her boyfriend who was letting her stay in his place. They broke up so of course she has to leave his place. Us being a good and caring group of friends decided that we would pool money together to get her an apartment and let her live there until she can get better. 
Fast forward to now which is about 10 months, she still severely ""depressed"" to the point of not being able to work. We recommended her some online tutoring jobs just so she can help herself in this difficult time. But she declined it. My problem is all of us are struggling not just financially. Its a difficult time for all of us. My even bigger problem is, she has a guy move in with her and she has been asking us for money to feed her deadbeat boyfriend. Her son has completely given up on her. She had child really young.

71,"Hi guys. First post here so hope I’m not breaking any rules. 
I have been plagued by this problem since I was about 11 and I think it’s time to try and sort it out. I’m too scared to try any medication so I want to try some kind of therapy but I decided it would help if I had the vocabulary to describe my problem.

I feel like there’s always one problem that my brain is like hyper focused on and it stops me from enjoying anything else in my life. My entire thought process is around “if only I had this thing/didn’t have this thing/that thing hadn’t happened I would be happy” and it’s like my brain won’t allow me to enjoy anything else because of that. But if I achieve the thing there’s just a new thing that acts like a dark cloud over my life. The only cure I’ve found for it is when the ‘reason’ is replaced by a bigger/worse problem. Drinking doesn’t even help, wish it did. 

I have been reading a lot on the internet and I can very much relate to trans people and people with eating disorders, the way they focus on the thing they want or the thing that they perceive to be wrong with them/their life and causing all their problems. I also read about people who have Body Integrity Identity disorder, which is where you believe a body part doesn’t belong or that you should’ve been born blind kinda thing. There is a mystifying correlation between this disorder and people who are trans, so I feel it’s the same psychological thing fuelling both and whatever it is I think I’ve got it.* Except I wish it was about things that I can aim towards solving but often it’s not, right now it’s about regret over the past and how different my life is now and will be forever because of it and I can’t change that.

It’s taken me until now to even start thinking about it because I always told myself there’s nothing psychologically wrong with me, I just have legit reasons to be unhappy. But of course it’s actually my broken brain focusing on ‘reasons’ that won’t let me be happy. It occupies my thoughts a lot of the day and even when it’s not directly, it’s like a dark cloud always there. I feel like I can’t just have a normal life. I feel that it’s different to anxiety, OCD and just the human nature of never being satisfied and wanting a goal to aim towards. I know that there’s something wrong  with me because I had one problem and now that I’ve got a different problem I think back and the old problem doesn’t seem so bad, but I know that if my current problem was ‘solved’ I’d go back to obsessing over the old problem. 

I hope this is the right sub to ask. Any advice would be appreciated. My dream of what I want from this post would be a name for the phenomenon I’m describing so that I can more specifically seek help regarding how to change my thought processes. Things aimed at general anxiety and overthinking/obsessive thinking don’t seem relatable to me so far. If it’s relevant, I’m in the U.K. 


* (I hope no trans people take offence, but I think it was an important point to make to help me describe it. I know some trans people transition (to whatever point they’re satisfied with) and they’re totally happy and their problems are solved, but you must admit that there are some for whom that’s not the case). I also know it’s controversial sometimes to imply that gender dysphoria is a psychological condition/problem.",10May2020,1
72,"I’ve been having thoughts and feelings about suicide recently with suicidal ideation (no intent though). 

I brought it up to my psychologist (it’s our second session) recently and started weeping over how pointless everything felt and how much I thought I &amp; everyone else would be better off if I was dead. I mentioned that I felt like I was burdensome to everyone in my life and believed that I added no value to any relationships that I had with friends and family. 

Even when hearing them say that they cared about me and would be hurt if I was gone, I never feel like it’s genuine. 

The few things she said were:

1) “As a mum myself, I would feel hurt if my daughter died by suicide. Your parents would feel the same way.” 

2) “It’s a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” 

3) “You have a choice to choose between believing the critical voice in your head assuming the worst about who you are, or to believe in the good things that your friends and family tell you.” 

Tbh I didn’t really take well to her words as it felt a little guilt-trippy, but I understand that it might’ve just been a bit of tough love &amp; truth-sharing, all of which make complete sense.

I cry whenever I’m alone and have zero motivation to do even the simplest things at times. I force myself to do them just because I’m trying to push myself out of this funk, but it’s not working.

How do I tell people I’m struggling so they’ll try to help me instead of just tossing me empty platitudes?",10May2020,1

77,"I have CPTSD and my mind absolutely reels. I've read about studies where people have gotten so depressed that they'd tried to commit suicide. The thought has crossed my mind before but not as a result of my period. It just seems that when I get my flow, I get *really* *really* depressed.

I've done everything right and I don't get it. I've been doing yoga almost everyday this year and I cut out caffeine and sugar completely. Yesterday, I ran 2.5 miles in 19 minutes. I take care of my plants everyday. It just seems like when it comes I am inside of myself and stuck in my head. 

I do have a lot of trauma bottled up inside (21 years worth of it). I need to unload it eventually but I can't afford a therapist right now (this is the part where I want to say I wish I didn't live in the US and that I was somewhere else). 

I am normally in a relaxed state but I find myself disassociating when I am sad to avoid feeling it (unhealthy but it is my only quick cooing mechanis). When I'm menstruating, however, everything makes me cry. There seems to be no foreseeable future for me and that I am inside of a black hole. I deserve all of the loneliness I have experienced. I know that that is untrue but I don't understand why this happens to me. I've speculated that maybe it happens because I suppress my true emotions a lot and that maybe when my hormones are high, I can't conceal my anguish.

I volenteer work but i get exhausted being around people. I feel like im all alone in the world and noone to help me, and im all alone in my symptoms, noone has what i have, noone understands. Even though people clearly care about me, i still dont feel comfortable around them.

The problems started after a prolonged time feeling lonely for 5 years and then eventually severely lonely(completely cut out for 8 months) and while the need to continue with life but unable to cope with the high stress, eventually after a 3 weeks of no sleep i slipped into a very black and dark place.

I managed to break out of these feelings/depression a year ago through exercise and socializing. But then i moved away and problems came back. Now i moved home, im to exhausted to exercise and socialize, yet i need to socialize to avoid the harsh feelings of loneliness.

89,"I'm 27M and she's 23F.

I'm using a throwaway because she knows my real account.

I met her a year and a half ago. Let's call her N.

N and I met through making music. She has a beautiful voice and plays multiple instruments, so I was very interested from the start. I must admit I was mostly only attracted to her physically at first, but that quickly changed.

We started hanging out a lot and found out we have even more things in common. She's very sweet, funny, smart, beautiful, charismatic...She speaks and everyone around her stops and listens. It's amazing to watch.

N has been my favorite person since the day I met her.

However, she was always secretive about her past. Particularly, about the people she spent time with. She doesn't have any close friends besides me at the moment. All her most important friendships and relationships ended badly and ""it was her fault"" that they ended.

One day, we were walking together when we bumped into someone from her past, a girl she dated (she's bisexual) and the girl literally broke down crying right in front of us. Later, N simply told me that they had a difficult break up. I didn't want to push since she looked very shaken.

We drunkenly slept together once in December and we became a lot closer. She started sharing more things about herself and I could really finally sense that her walls were going down a bit.

With quarantine, we haven't seen each other but we've been texting a lot. A couple of months ago she confessed that she liked me, but she didn't want to ruin our friendship. A week ago, I asked her to be my girlfriend on facetime. She said we'd talk later, hung up and ignored me for two whole days.

On the third day, N came back and told me we couldn't date unless she told me the truth. She said she was diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder when she was 17 and she's been going to therapy since she was 20 (3 years now).

My first instinct was to not believe it. She is obsessed with being polite and maybe she thought telling me ""no"" would be rude.

She seemed so caring and sweet, always taking into consideration how people would feel before she did anything. She'd try her hardest so that everyone in a group felt comfortable and heard. She mostly kept to herself too. That isn't what narcissists do, narcissists like attention. And she cried when watching movies and puppy videos. That's empathy...

But after my initial reaction, I started seeing some things. How much N changed her personality depending on who she was with, how important it is for her to be liked by everyone, how people with different opinions aren't worth her time or attention, how exhausted she would get after supporting me when I had emotionally difficult times. So extremely exhausted, almost like she was forcing herself to pretend she cared. How easily she could stop caring about people she seemed so excited about days prior.

The fact that she has no close friends, only acquaintances who will laugh remembering how she ""slept with X and Y on purpose to break Z"" or how she ""cried on command to get free drinks""...

She's been so good to me. My life is better since she's been in it. I don't think I've been manipulated, I don't think she's been lying to me. I don't think she's been manipulating others since we met either. I think she's trying to improve and get away from whatever she did in her past. She looked genuinely upset over her ex who broke down, but I don't know if it's because she cared or because I witnessed it and she thought that would affect the image I had of her.

But I'm scared. Because I genuinely love N, I'd take a bullet for her. I'm extremely attracted to her, but I'm also okay staying as a friend if that means that by keeping ""distance"" it'll be easier to help her. And, of course, I don't want to get hurt.

I'm already hurt she didn't tell me about this before. I know it's her business and she doesn't need to share that if she doesn't want to, but I almost feel used.

But I didn't feel used before knowing this. So maybe I am judging unfairly.

How do you get diagnosed at age 17? That means there were signs so big before 17 that her parents made her go to therapy.

I really want to be her boyfriend and I think she wants it too, but I don't know what to do. Everyone always has the worst experiences with narcissists and end up traumatized like her crying ex. But she's been going to therapy and she makes me so happy.

Has anyone gone through something like this before? What's your advice?

TLDR: I've known this girl for a year and half and things have been great. I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she told me she is a diagnosed narcissist that has been going to therapy for 3 years. I realized then that many weird things from our past started making sense with that diagnosis. I don't know what to do.",10May2020,1

I needed therapy so I needed to tell my mom so I could have her insurance card, or else the therapy bills would go through the roof.
So I told her and she didn’t believe me. She brushed it off, and told me that I was just guilty for not doing something about it, regretful for not make the point clear. Even though that saying no, even once, should be enough. 
I was violated and she couldn’t even be there for me. She didn’t even hug me, she just said she was sorry I felt that way. 
I’m so mad. She was literally saying it was okay for him to expect sex of me because he was my boyfriend.

Last time I was at my doctors I asked for anxiety medication as I was getting off and SSRI that helped but was causing other issues. I took it sparingly maybe once a week (half a dose or less). Last two weeks I was taking a full dose but split through the day (quarter in morning, afternoon, half a night). Got through the issue and stopped taking it. It’s Ativan (Lorezapam I think is the generic name). 

Since I stopped taking it I’ve been questioning if I’m having an anxiety/panic attack or not. So my question is can stopping usage like that cause anxiety? I’m pretty sure there’s still some issues that aren’t surfacing. When I say emotionally bad I mean I was in tears every other day until I got a resolve.

I have also often woken up in the morning and couldn't find my phone even though I was certain that I had plugged it next to me, or with bruising or cuts on my arms. 

I also often am absent minded, forgot what I was doing, wat someone was telling me, misplaced things (I even have a specific thing to make my phone ring and a location tracker cause I lose it so frequently). But I also I lose keys, shoes, clothes, jewelry, books. My house is small so it is hard to do that. I have always blamed my inattentiveness and my frequent daydreams that I have, which are really vivid and so realistic I often forget where I am. 

Never thought anything about it, until a few days ago I have found an old folder of mine, with papers inside. There were drawings of people and places and names on the papers which I don't remember drawing or writing - in my hand writing. And other papers have descriptions of the names and the people who have the names to them. It's really weird and I am half freaking out. It's like I wanted to write a story or create people, but I don't remember doing so. 

I am also not as good at drawing as the drawings are, so I don't know how I did that or don't remember doing it. I don't know if I did it when I was sleep walking, or when I was daydreaming.

Through the power of other people’s writing I accidentally discovered I had **Post Concussion Syndrome.** It’s a strange thing to read your life and inner feelings on a page, but also empowering and important.

This is why I am launching [My Concussion &amp; Me](https://www.postconcussionmag.com/), a beautifully made stand-alone magazine that captures people’s journeys with their post-concussion syndrome. It is for people who crave open discussions about coping with anxiety, depression, fear, anger, trauma, shame, and all those other wildcards that alter the direction of our work and our lives.

Through letters, stories, photo’s and foggy thoughts, we aim to curate a magazine that has a start, middle, and end of people’s journey with their concussion. We want to create a place where readers can access a digestible serving of learnings from those who have been affected, recovered or still finding their way through the fog.

For those interested in sharing your story, you can do so [here](https://www.postconcussionmag.com/). It may serve as a therapeutic experience, all submissions can be anon. This project will not exist without you sharing your story and bringing a light to PCS.

Look forward to hearing your thoughts,

But i am desperate. 
My mother clearly has something. It has plagued my childhood and ruins our relationship. I just want to know how i can deal with her, why she is this way. I want a good relationship but her anger tears it down.

Some defining symptoms she has no control over are:

* Uncontrollable anger (frequent anger outbursts and meltdowns, isn’t conscious of being passive aggressive on default).
* Victim mentality (regardless of the situation she is a victim, unable to take constructive criticism, always blames others - lack of sympathy).
* Incapable of self reflection.
* Unable to let things go.
* Paranoia? (extremely suspicious, distrustful of mental health care professionals, anxious of others talking behind her back).
* Mood swings (very small things trigger her anger, emotional).
* Strict rules (strong desire for control, if not done immediately or correctly she results to anger).

She refuses to see a psychologist, as she isn’t «crazy».

I'm already struggling with stress, general anxiety, social anxiety, ADHD, gender dysphoria, body dysmorphia, and potentially autism. My anxiety is untreated, and I stopped taking my ADHD medication a few months ago because of money.

So how do I get my anxiety back under control? We haven't heard from our landlord since that day. It's been at least 2 weeks of nothing but anxiety, anxiety attacks and irrational thoughts since then.

121,"Hello, I'm new to this subreddit, but I'm having severs problems with my dysfunctional family but still need to succeed in my studies.

I'm studying medicine abroad and had to come back because of the pandemic. I'm staying at my mothers 2-room-appartment, sleeping on her couch and trying to study for finals. Which is okay for me, but no we're having a big fight because of our family problems and I'm not sure what to do at this point.

First of all, my 5 year younger sister (20) has bulimia nervosa since years now and struggles since the lockdown with depression, she has not been under therapeutical treatment until now. She relied on me first in the family and I'm normally the one who takes care of her because I have the best understanding regarding those issues. Aside of that, we do not have the best relation to each other. My sister is the real daughter between my father and mother, while I was adopted father wise. And I always struggled with that role and feeling left out in the family as a kid, so I projected it on her at times. I think it only got slightly better when I moved out at 21, and although I think that I made peace with our past anger toward each other, my sister doesn't seem like it. She's most of the time passive aggressive towards me, she pokes on my failures and personality traits every time she has the chance to, while I'm being more sensitive to her knowing that she has psychological issues. She has a bad temper and gets mad about everything, tries to betitle every family member about how they live and what they eat and makes everything a discussion. Although she doesn't pay attention on what she says to others, she demands total respect and sympathy for everything she feels and does.

My father lives in his own world, and although he may not have been the best father around, I think he tried the best he could. He is not my real father but adopted me at the age of 8. We had a good relationship from the beginning, also because I was in desperate need of a father role as a child. My father brought me to Germany at the age of 7, and not only changed my life for the better but also saved me out of the past conditions I lived in with my mother. And I will be forever grateful about that, no matter how he developed as a person later. My father, unfortunately, is also a not very responsible human being and does a lot of stuff out of sudden impulses. Thats how he got in a lot of debt, had several girlfriends (long term rs) after the divorce and slowly but surely crashed his life into the abyss in the past 2 decades. When my father had a gf, he neglected me and my sister but  was upset when we didn't find time for him when he separated again from them. He grew old, lonely and bitter at some point because he's unable to maintain relationships and showing emotions, which also broke my heart. 

My mother is a very pragmatic person and unbelievably strong for the past she endured. She raised me alone, after being in a domestic violent relationship with my real father, in South America. She did two jobs at a time, while sleeping in a bed with me in a shared flat. My moms way of raising was harsh, because of the circumstances, she was young, underpaid, with littler to no education and came from a household of violence and also relationships that included domestic violence, so I got a lot of that treatment too. Although the way I was raised and grew up lead to several psychological issues as a kid and teenager, I never held grudge against my mother, I fully understand the situation and pressure she was in, and that parents are human beings and can lose their patience when they are overwhelmed. (Although I would never raise my children with violence) Her way of educating us became more soft through the years, specially when my sister came to this world and we move to Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you could Catch a grasp about the background history. My main problem is now that although, I'm able to look past the things that happened, I feel like a doormat to everyone in this family. Since I'm back in Germany, I have to deal with my sisters mental health problems while trying to cope with her toxic and verbally abusive behaviour against me. My mother and father don't defend me against that, in fact they don't want to have to do anything with it and blame us when we are having a problem with each other. especially my mother. Yesterday my father revealed that he will move away from Germany, because he never succeeded to build the life he imagined for us and him and that he is never was happy here. I could see that he has been struggling with depression lately, which affected me so bad that I cried myself to sleep last night. Although I tried to reach out to him several times, I still feel I didn't do enough for him. I feel bad because he doesn't deserve to feel lonely and depressed in a country he feels like he doesn't belong to. - And when I told my mother on mothers day how I'm feeling, and that I'm devastated about it, she blamed me for feeling bad for my father after he left us alone for so long and never took any responsibility for the family. She demanded from me to not be dramatic about it, focus on my studies and reminded me that its HER day and she sacrificed so much for the family to have to be dealing with me crying over my father.I'm also not speaking to my sister right now, because she literally drains me, and I can't put up with her at this point.  

For me days like these are always a pressure to be in, because the family I once wished for, has never happened like I hoped for. And although I'm grateful to live in Europe and having the opportunities I would never have had in South America, I feel mostly alone here. I'm 26, Single for 6 years now, my friends who live here are in a rs or already having a family and I'm stuck with my dysfunctional family having no one to talk to while trying to manage this semester. And the only place I feel comfortable right now I miles away and not reachable at the moment because of the pandemic. I fear it will get worse with the exam session upcoming.

123,"Trigger warning: suicide

A few days ago, I had a major panic attack after meeting someone in an anonymous chat room. I have PTSD with OCD traits, and one of my triggers is suicide. 

This person who I matched with was named ""female14"" from Australia. She said something about someone named Jayden and wanting to cut her own throat, but then said she sent it to the wrong person, so I told her that I do not have the capabilities to help her and that she should call the hotline. I then disconnected the chat. I couldn't leave it there, though, because of OCD so I came back to make sure that she was OK. She didn't know it was the same person because I was under a different account, but the first thing she said was ""I am so drunk."" I asked her her name and she said ""uhhhh aquamarine I think."" I figured that this was just because she was drunk, but I have a hard time using common sense when triggered. I asked her if she was the suicidal person from before, and she said yes, and that she was drinking to cope. I told her to hang on a second. She said ""why"" and then a few seconds later ""bye"" but I quickly listed the hotline numbers for Australia before she DC'd. She gave me one word: ""no."" Then ""they're not helping."" She said ""bye"" again and deleted her account completely.

124,"A few days ago something odd happened to me

Well, I didnt sleep the night it happened, but that is mostly because I woke up on 2pm, so it would make sense that I wasnt exhausted at the time. Well, I was a little exhausted because my mother got drunk the night before, but it wasnt that bad. She was only singing loud and that's it. No drugs, alcohol or medicine was taken the night before.

Well, it all started in the kitchen. I made myself breakfast and was about to leave the kitchen, but then I saw (not directly, but from the corner of my eye) at the door a Dog with a deformed face. When I looked over to the door, it was gone. I was scared, started trembling and shaking (it felt like I was going to die). I took my plate with my food and was ready to attack it. When I walked out and it was gone. After that I ran to my room.

The things that happened occurred in a matter of 2 hours, so I will need to list them:

* I was laying on my bed, covered in blankets, and I thought that my body morphed into the one of an insect, so I was scared to take it off (I did anyways and I wasn't).
* I googled what to do against it (I thought it was a panic attack) and it told me to hold things, but when I wanted to take something and hold it, my brain made me think that there were thousands of them under each object. No object was touched or moved in that situation.
* A bit of spit came out of my mouth (on my lips) and I slipped it back into my mouth by slurping it up, but when I did that, I got scared that the people watching me poisoned it and then I imagined people putting poison in my spit inside my mouth, so I tried not swallowing my spit.
* At some point I was curled up crying 2 teardrops, which felt really good.

Something, which I also need to mention is that my view of the world is odd. I believe that I am on some kind of show/experiment and that people are watching me, but I also believe that anytime where I dont see or hear my friends, theyre being tortured. Its not something I always think of, but when it comes up, I get worried and uncomfortable. Any time I see a new person (be it online or outside, I often think ""What if I am right and because I met them, now theyre going to be tortured when I dont see them. 

This idea of the world doesnt always appear in my head, but it appears at least once per day and I think its because of the quarantine thing. I miss talking with my friends (Not that much about my problems, but just in general.

128,"
My mental health has always been sub par. A close family member passed away 18months ago and I’ve been in therapy pretty much ever since.

My Husband is the most perfect man in the world. He’s everything I dreamed of when I was younger. He’s calm, funny, caring and strong. I love him endlessly. 

As I said a close family member passed away recently and since then my mental health has been the worst it’s ever been. Severe social anxiety and now bad depression. I’ve had anger issues over the past few months and my therapist says that I suffer from imposter syndrome. 

Any way, for some time I’ve been quite bad. Suicidal thoughts, no energy to do anything at all, letting things slip at work... my relationship with my husband is at an all time low. I can’t bring myself to look at him let alone engage in any real conversation. 

My problems apparently stem from when I was younger and as a result I am now cutting myself off from people to protect myself from future loss and pain. 

My therapist thinks my main issue at the moment is that I don’t make enough time to look after myself, and I worry too much about what everyone else thinks or how they’re feeling. For some reason my default setting is guilt. If someone wants to help me I feel guilty. If I’m overwhelmed and need space, my husband doesn’t ask twice and I feel guilty. If he asks me to join him on a walk or drive and I say no, he smiles and says ok, and I’m left physically in pain because I feel guilty.

I’m supposed to look after myself, and learn to accept love from people again and open up to my husband. But how do I tell him, “every time you’re nice to me and help me, or tell me you love me, I’m overwhelmed with so much guilt I want to either kill myself or run away”. 

Everything he does to help me makes me feel awful. Something has snapped in the last 2 weeks and I’m experiencing my darkest and longest low, and because of this I can barely bring myself to touch my husband or even look at him.

I can’t open up to him about how I’m feeling because he’ll be amazing and I’ll go into a spiral from the guilt. 

I don’t understand how I am supposed to make time for myself and look after myself only to be pummelled by some fictitious guilt that I create in my head every time I try.

I just want to run away. I’m terrified at the prospect of what the rest of my life is going to be like. At this moment in time I feel like I have two choices, run and don’t stop. Set up life somewhere else away from everyone I know, or slap on a fake smile and make everyone else feel better because I’m not acting like I’m sick anymore, and just live in my own little hell. 

I just don’t want to be here anymore.",10May2020,1

130,"I've recently moved back home, it's been a challenge mentally after living out of home independently for a decade. But, I was not in the best place mentally or financially and being able to move to a stable living situation was the best choice I could make.

It's honestly been extremely lucky, in grateful because otherwise I'd have been interstate during this pandemic. I wouldn't have been able to say goodbye to my grandpa before he died, or attend his funeral. Amongst so many other special moments. 

It's put into focus how crucially important (although I've always 'known') housing is. But having a good stable home is something I just cant achieve without locking my life into an endless stream of work without reprieve. I live a very frugal life, I believe in going gently through life and being true to myself. Which I've had a lot of joy and success doing when I think of it in retrospect. I've got a reasonable amount of money I've invested and saved, but nothing close to house money, or the career stability I'd need to get a loan.

It seems like this stability that would do wonders for what has been a lifelong struggle with some debilitating mental health problems. Is just unattainable, it makes a lot of dreams and hobbies unattainable. I feel like pursuing a life I will love is stuck in this one *little* hiccup of housing and land. I'd happily build my own simple place to live, grow my own food and not be a burden on anything. I could keep doing the work I've always done and have a safety net for any ill health or emergencies. But owning land, and having a home are locked behind what feels like spending my whole life working a job I'll hate and living a life I'd honestly probably end up killing myself over.

132,"I don't usually air out anything personal online but I just need to share, vent, and get this off my chest. I already wrote out a private document outlining what I just went through but I can't turn to anyone and I just want just some comfort and maybe some words of advice. Because I can't stop the tears and I don't know what to do with myself.

Today it's mother's day in my country. I meant to wake up early and wish my mother a happy mother's day since my area has a stay at home order in effect. I woke up late and I woke up to the sound of a text I received from my mom. I snapped awake and called her immediately. But she didn't answer after I called so many times. I called my dad and he said that she was in the shower.

Fast forward to about 30 minutes later and I received a call from her. She was upset and spiraled and released everything she was holding in. She hasn't done this in a while and I was at a loss for words. I tried to explain that I couldn't sleep last night and I apologized for calling late and she told said that there was no point in apologizing because I never thought of her and that I was a selfish daughter. She thought that I only called because she messaged me. That I had no intention of calling otherwise. That she needs to rethink me living in the house they own. That she could easily make money from it. How she suffered and poured so much money into raising me but I never think of her. That I do grand and nicer things for my friends than I do for her and my father. She ended the call with ""I don't want to hear your voice. I'm done""

This triggered me. I shut off my phone and cried on my bed hugging my pillow. My mind was racing. Whatever I had been bottling up just exploded. I kept asking why I didn't think ahead. Why didn't I wake up earlier. If I had just called yesterday she wouldn't be so upset. She's going to tell my aunt everything. They're going to talk about me again. Why am I so useless. I'm a grown adult, quarantine has me out of work, I have the time to do productive things. It's so simple so why? Eventually my mind turned to self harm. I started to think that it would be easier to just end it. That if I just ended everything my parent's wouldn't have to deal with dead weight like me. I can barely take care of myself, I finally found a job after being unemployed for so long to only get furloughed because of this pandemic, I have so much debt that I need to pay back and I'm still waiting on unemployment. I could have easily been calling my parents once a day even. Why didn't I check in on them more often? It's so simple.

I just sat on my bed clawing at my arms while frozen in place. I knew if I got up I'd do something I'd regret. Because it's that easy. I live alone and I just shut off my phone. I have a sharp kitchen knife and a gas oven. It would've been so easy. But then i started to think how my sister would never forgive my mother. How my mom would never forgive herself. And I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Because I don't want their already fragile relationship to shatter. I don't want to be the cause of that.

Once I calmed down a little I managed to move again. I felt really disoriented.. I decided to write everything down before I started to forget. But unlike last time it's not enough. I can't turn to my closest friends because they're very emotionally vulnerable and I know this will make them anxious and worried. It's mother's day and I don't want to disrupt their happy time. Same for my sisters. So that's why I'm just laying it out now. I just want to share because I feel like I have no where to turn to. I can't stop the tears now but they'll stop.

If you read this far, thank you so much. I'm sorry for typing out so much but I just really needed to release it all. I'll be fine. I'm in control of my actions again so please don't think I'll follow through. Though I think I need help.. I can't keep letting myself get so close. Thankfully it's only been intention but I always manage to pull myself away from acting.. but today I got close. And that's not okay and I'm scared. If you have any good recommendations for an affordable psychologist or therapist even.. please. Recommend away. I'm located in the **USA**. No I don't have medical insurance, and no my unemployment hasn't been approved yet.

Sorry I'm going to go offline for a little bit. I need to recollect myself and just start my day.. But I'll log in again.

136,"This might be a weird question but I don't know where else I could put/ask it. Some background: I know I have always had a problem with ruminating on things that have happened in the past, to the point where I used to sit down for hours thinking about the same situations and ideas over and over again. I never liked talking out loud to people, so instead I just talked to myself. Because of that, I find that I have years worth of bad memories that I only still remember because I've gone over them to myself a million times. The cause of these bad memories (family issues mostly) reached its climax and has gotten a lot better over the past year, but recently I've had a lot of ""episodes"" of just thinking about all of these things again for hours and it really drags me back to places I don't want to be.

I feel like I could feel so much better about these things if I could put them somewhere, just get them out of my head and close off those old memories to put them in the past where they belong. Specifically, I want to tell someone else. I have the overwhelming want for someone to just listen to me. Therapy isn't something I want to get into, and I really don't want to tell all of these things to my friends for a lot of reasons. So, I'm looking online for anything like a forum or subreddit I could periodically use to post my stories. I had the idea of making a dedicated account for these things, but I don't know of any subreddit that would allow those kind of meaningless word vomit posts.

Sometimes I feel very low and unhappy like I’m worthless and will never be fully happy in life and don’t deserve love because I have nothing to offer. I constantly compare myself to other people and want things they that have whether it be physical or personality aspects. I am a serial monogamist and get very quickly attached to people but I also get over people very easily. I have a very hard time trusting people and I actually would say I don’t fully trust anyone, but I am very open. 

My parents are divorced and mental health problems run in my family. I feel like my family doesn’t notice me or pay attention to me because they always think I’m fine. 

I spend a lot of time thinking about conversations I’ve had in the past and wondering how people perceived what I said. I often think about suicide but don’t plan on killing myself. There are days when I think about it multiple times a day. I rarely feel “myself.” I hate when I don’t have control of a situation.

I love my boyfriend and he makes me very happy and treats me great but he also is a source of anxiety. I have a hard time trusting him because I’ve never been in a relationship where I wasn’t cheated on. He’s always treated me great but I worry that because he is so smart he could get away with anything. He has been very sneaky in other relationships. I don’t feel worthy of him because I think he is smarter, kinder, and more fun than me. I feel very insecure but I know that he loves me and I think that it is all in my head.

I also think very negatively about people. I think people are really shallow and I convince myself I don’t really like anyone besides my boyfriend, family, and close friends. When I’m with people they don’t normally bother me at all and I’m extremely social. The guys I have dated often struggle with me being too flirty, but I don’t consider myself to be flirting or have bad intentions. I’m constantly worried about making a mistake if I drink so drinking makes me anxious. 

If there is something wrong with me, I guess I am very high functioning because I did fine in school, work, and a lot of people like me. I’d also like to say I am considered to be pretty attractive and used to be very confident. Sometimes I know I’m being really irrational but I can’t help it. 

Is there something wrong with me or have I just become a negative bitch? I feel physically ill often and think it might be related to whatever I’m dealing with mentally. I want to go to therapy but I don’t want to be on medication. I don’t like to take my ADHD medication. I wasn’t always like this.",10May2020,1

143,"I can’t stay calm when I go to the hospital.  I’ve been banned from multiple places.  I’m a small female who would never hurt anyone, but I say things that make people feel threatened when I get overwhelmed, especially after having a seizure.  

I lost my therapist(She just disappeared with no reason.  She never felt threatened by me or saw any issues besides depression, anxiety, and PTSD. We had a great rapport.) 

I feel like I need a fucking babysitter... it’s humiliating.  I don’t have anyone to go with me to keep me calm.  I avoid ever going to the doctor unless it’s an emergency, because I know I can’t handle it for very long.  And that’s when it’s worst.  I feel horrible for anyone who has to take care of me.  I have epilepsy, so it’s sometimes unavoidable.  I don’t know what to do.  I’m so overwhelmed, and this has kind of been the final straw.  

Please, someone please point me in the right direction... I’m really desperate.",10May2020,0

145,"Hello reddit. I'll try to make this as short as I can. 
Two years ago, an incident (I am ashamed to talk about this) happened to me, and since then I am afraid to leave my house. This has affected my social life since then I barely left my house. I prefer to stay in my home most of times, so I don't meet up with friends very often.
I am always concerned about what  pepole think of me, so I am holding myself back all of the times when I am doing actions. 
About 6 months ago one of my best and close friends left me for the popular kids. Followed up by another friend doing the same thing.
I am so afraid to lose my friends, and will do anything to keep them with me. 
I've had pepole judge me and tell me what to do lots of times, even friends did this to me so I am afraid to speak differently then what the others say.
I hope you'll find your time to read all of this, but this is really important to me.

147,"I hate myself. I don't know how I can hate myself so much.

I feel bad. Right now, I just want to cut to my heart's desire. I just won't do it. 

I wish I could move and get over everything. I wish I just had emptiness in me, and just live like a bot. I wish I could erase any feelings I have right here and now. It would be easier. 

It's like I try to be the best version of myself, but because I have too many emotions, I am the worst.

I want to sleep forever. I want to try it again and be successful at it. The only thing that's keeping me from it is the thought of my family wondering why I did it. 

I don't want my dad and mom to have to go through any sadness. But sometimes, I feel like it would be for the better.

I don't want my brothers to be angry at me, at the dead me.

I don't want anyone to judge me. 

But honestly, I dream of dying. I am trying leaving a bloody bandaid in my vag to try and get the staphyllococus aureus, so I can pretend it isn't me who did it, you know?

I even have a killing dose of dalfagan (paracetamol) in my nightstand.

Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population.

150,"Let me know if this should be in a different sub. Apologies if so. My girlfriend is having a tough time and I want to do more to help.

&amp;#x200B;

Information: My girlfriend and I live in the same city, but in different areas. Pre-lockdown, I ended up temporarily moving in with her (for a few months) after I was in an accident and couldn't work because of an injury. Recently I reached a point where I was sufficiently recovered and it was agreed I should go back to my place (to be less of an imposition on my girlfriend's housemates). Although neither of us really wanted this, we accepted it was the right and fair thing to do. We are currently both working our respective jobs (from home), although . 

&amp;#x200B;

Since we've been apart, she has been finding it harder to cope following the shift in our situations. Over the past week she has regularly spoken about having no focus to work - her job involves long-term projects and has less immediate accountability - and is feeling a lot more alone. She has little interest in cooking/eating and has lost motivation to go running (something which she has done for months, and did with me during my recovery). She has also said that she feels ""flat"" and that things feel ""ten times harder"". I want to do more to support her, but not sure what I can do.

&amp;#x200B;

We do a video call every lunchtime and talk again before going to sleep at night. We also do our own film/game evening at least once a week. Additionally, she does stuff with her housemates, and arranges social stuff with other friends virtually, so it's not like she just relies on me for interaction. When we talk, I allow her to say what's on her mind and try to come up with constructive things she can do in these situations, but she's struggling with motivation to do anything. She has struggled with her mental health before and I think the combination of the current global situation and the fact we're now apart again has caused this slump.

Any recommendations of what I can do to help further (or stuff I can recommend) would be appreciated. Thanks.",10May2020,1
151,"I sometimes recognize when it happens, I don't understand how to communicate how I'm feeling with others. People are ostracizing me for things that I do involuntarily. Whether it's saying things a particular way, or using words that people don't generally use, or even picking things up or moving things in a certain fashion. Why I do this? I have no idea. I stick out like a sore thumb, but I am not cognisant of that. I try really hard to connect with people, whether that's noticing small changes that happens with them like a new shirt or something and complementing it. I'll even take time to learn about their interests and try to experience whatever it is to relate to them better and maybe make a new friend along the way, but it always backfires on me. Most of my colleagues, superiors, and even my own family in some cases exaggerate my actions and things I say in an attempt to make me visually uncomfortable. Which works 10/10 times, even when I'm trying so hard not to let it happen. It in turn, makes me uncomfortable with my own self. I often repeat conversations I've had with others, sometimes it's something I've said and sometimes it's something they've said, but it doesn't work. In fact it makes things worse.  I feel exceedingly different. However at the same time people make me feel like I'm being irrational, and sometimes I believe that even when it feels like my insides are swelling up and I'm going to explode from the inside. It makes me miserable. Often times I don't recognize it as its happening, and people find hilarity in that. But when looking in retrospect when I am home for the day, or even when I take second to think over how the day has gone so far I realize that nothing has changed no matter how hard I try. This isn't the first time in my life I've experienced this, I had a lot issues during high school, mainly towards the end of it. But even before that in middle school I would come home from school and go straight to bed. I would sleep until sunrise and go back to school and repeat the cycle. I am not an idiot, I am pretty smart and I'm really great at a lot of things. There are plenty of people who do not treat me this way that I have met along the way in my life. But unfortunately there are more that do. I feel I'm at my wit's end, and I could really use some cheering up. I've been speaking with a therapist and I'm working on getting some money together and scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist so I'm making baby steps of progress... thank you for listening to my vent.

Lockdown hasn't brought this on, or even made it much worse if I'm honest, there wasn't really much further to go.

25M. Since I can't remember when, I have always doubted my self worth. It might have been from my parents always comparing me to other kids, my body image issues(I'm 5'11 at 80kg, due to metabolism issues) which have morphed into deep insecurities.

Very frequently, I find myself questioning my self worth, for no apparent reason or no remarks. And I bury these things too deep within me the questioning happens subconsciously and passively. Even when posting this I'm wondering if it would make any difference?

How do I get rid of this self loathing and self doubt?
I'd like to enjoy life without that doubt always in the back of my mind.

EDIT: my self doubt has made me too much of an introvert, and I don't have any real friends I could depend on. I don't really mind that, but it would have been nice.

I often find myself straying towards poor choices. I’m just trying to stop smoking cigarettes for the second time but am vaping so only half the battle I guess.

I feel so free and at home in my car.
Since lockdown(I live in the uk for context) I find I’ve started drinking instead of driving. Usually I’d drive somewhere peaceful. Often in the middle of nowhere with a cigarette And feel so at peace.

I have been prescribed multiple antidepressants (Citalopram and Mirtazapine in the past) and currently taking Sertraline 100mg: Once daily, and Propranolol 10mg: 1 - 2 Twice daily when required - I've been on these for about 2 years). I have also been on prescription painkillers (Co-codamol 30mg/500mg tablets: 8 tablets daily for the past 3 years, but currently reducing the dosage which comes with some *delightful* withdrawal symptoms!)

I live in the UK, and I have had 12 sessions of free counselling sessions with Outlook Southwest, where they came to the conclusion that a lot of my anxiety / depression stems from childhood; broken home, abandonment issues etc.

My main problem is how much I procrastinate (even though I procrastinate by doing nothing). I find it incredibly difficult to begin doing anything! It's like my mind is blocking me from starting things. 

I understand a lot of people probably don't like starting tasks they don't enjoy, and this is definitely the case for me sometimes (especially in work - I work as a Pharmacy dispenser where it is just me and a Pharmacist every day), so I have to undergo a large amount of different, vital tasks and I obviously must focus 100% to ensure patient care and correct procedures are followed at all times. It takes me longer than it should to complete all of my daily/weekly/monthly tasks because I hesitate so much before I can start them. I sometimes stay late so I can finish everything and clean / organise everything for the following morning. Nobody else seems to do this so I'm not sure if I should be so obsessed with leaving my workplace totally clean and organised?

Now, my home life is great. But for some reason I struggle so much to start tasks at home as well, especially things I enjoy. I love cleaning and gaming, but it's like I can't allow myself to enjoy anything? For example, if I have a day off, my ideal day would just be sitting on my arse and gaming all day, but I can't enjoy it because I feel guilty for wanting to do something I love?! In my head I think ""If I clean my house so it is spotless first, then I deserve to relax and play on the PS4"", but I can't even bring myself to start cleaning because I also love to clean!

Why do I find it impossible to do anything? 
Is there a condition that defines this kind of behaviour?
How can I let myself just... DO things without overthinking?

Hello all I hope you’re all doing okay. Tonight I’ve heard that the lockdown in the UK isn’t going to get better any time soon. This means that I have to be alone indefinitely.

This lockdown has robbed me of being able to spend time with these wonderful people and I’m struggling to cope, sometimes it feels like ending my life is the only way to take the pain of lockdown away since the government’s coronavirus plan was so terrible at the beginning that indefinite never ending lockdowns are the only options now and I respect that this is for the good of protecting the country from infections.

176,I'm seeing a therapist but she said i need to see a psychologist to get my issues fixed. I dont see them til Thursday and since i feel like most likely they want to put me on something instead of steps to fixing this mentally. I feel like i can mentally beat this but i just dont know how. I feel very trapped in a loop constantly washing my hand for like 30 min sometimes. This isnt cause of the flu virus going on but more as something i already had but got worse cause of health issues. If anyone knows some steps to slow this down i'd appreciate it.,10May2020,1
177,"I posted it before, but in the wrong subreddit. I apologize for my bad English. Since one relatively terrible event happened to me, I started to google a lot and ruminate, trying to find out what’s wrong with me. After 4 months of going back and forth, I self-diagnosed myself with AvPD, BPD and depression. Obviously it’s impossible for me to have all those illnesses, because I am a stable human being that only sometimes becomes sad, it’s not a big deal. Is it possible for myself to imagine having mental disorders to pity myself after the event? Am I faking it or not? Is it real? I probably have nothing to do, that’s why I am doing it, but at the same time, what if I truly have all these mental illnesses? The symptoms match almost perfectly",10May2020,2

Anyway, so basically this is what I understood. Let it go just like that, it was your fault for holding it in, and people had it worse.

So to me, after all this years of having a rotten issue that I wish I could get rid of is invalid. Even after all the trauma I experienced, after all the suicidal tendencies that I had, and that total loss of self confidence that even now I'm still recovering, she insisted it is an easy job to let it go. And all the while, it was my fault. When the truth is it won't let go of you.

Anyway, she's not a bad girlfriend, but right now, keeping it in seems to be the best option for me. Than just to be disappointed.",10May2020,1

183,"Coronavirus lockdown is magnifying some anxiety

Hi everybody. I’m new to this kind so bare with me. This will probably turn into a vent. I was laid off because of coronavirus. This wasn’t a surprise because I work in tourism. The problem is now I have too much time to think about things. The phrase, “an idle mind is the devil’s playground” comes to mind. I’m 26 and finished college about a year ago. I went a little longer than others but I was ok with that. But now I feel like the best years of my life are passing by me and I can’t do anything with them. I feel like I’m going through a quarter life. I’m sure some older people will laugh at that statement and please do. It sounds silly saying it out loud.

I’ve gotten into a really silly but mentally unhealthy habit. Whenever I see somebody on my TV or computer I search and see what they were doing at 26. I’m looking up actors, athletes, musicians, even the weatherman. For example, Prince made Purple Rain when he was 24-25 and it was released when he was 26. I have no business comparing myself to Prince or any of these guys. I do t want to be famous and I do t want to have a career in any of those fields. Bu a lot of these guys were starting their careers and had accomplishments around 26 or younger. I have yet to start my career and coronavirus has definitely halted my search. I’m not getting any younger and I feel like I need to do something with my life before it’s too late. Unfortunately I feel like a mouse stuck on a glue trap while time passes them by.

I’ve also recently been feeling nostalgic about the 2000’s. I’ve been watching movies and shows and listening to music from that time. I look back and say, “Damn! This is almost 20 years old now!” Doesn’t help me from feeling like time is moving too fast.

I’m also worried about my parents. They had me when they were older and they are 72 and 69, nice. Luckily they are still very healthy. It’s terrible but I sometimes think about how much time I have left with them. I currently live with my mom who is 72. My mom recently told me she is thinking about moving to Florida in a few years to be with my aunt. I am very close with my parents it would hurt to be away from both of them. I came to the realization that my mom is lonely. She also told me a reason why is because she really doesn’t have many friends anymore. Her best friend won’t talk to her anymore because of political differences. This made my heart break because politics is such a petty thing to lose a friendship over. My mom and I disagree on politics but it has never affected our relationship. My dad currently lives in Florida and I can tell he is very lonely. He is a very social person and he can’t be social anymore because of coronavirus. I call him at least once a day to check on him and I can tell that really brightens his day so there is a silver lining.

All of this and some other things are constantly on my mind, especially the comparing ages thing. There aren’t a lot of distractions right now. Things weigh more on my mind the later the day gets. Friday was really bad but yesterday was pretty good. Today feels in between but I get to spend Mother’s Day with my mom so hopefully that helps. I’ve never felt like I had anxiety or maybe even depression until recently. Any advice on how to deal with the feeling of time moving too fast? Thanks!",10May2020,1
184,"Hi! I am an 18F and I've always struggled mentally but throughout high school, it's just been getting worse. The problem is I can't tell if this is all circumstantial and just something I need to get over myself. Every night I've been crying and I feel so worthless. It makes me feel worse that I have a life that so many people would want, but I can't seem to feel happy for more than a few hours. Every day now I cry randomly and in the middle of a task, I'll have this sudden fear that nothing is going to work out and I'll feel paralyzed for the whole day even though I have nothing to worry about. Everything I've accomplished seems like it was all luck and I'm just so worried that my parents are going to find out how much of a failure I actually am. I also can't look in the mirror anymore without crying and I now started just panicking over the smallest things like I hear this random sound in the middle of the night and then I couldn't sleep for the rest of the night because I had this fear that my roof was going to collapse. I feel like there is something wrong with me but maybe I'm just upset like everyone during quarantine or maybe I'm just thinking too much. I've tried to do stuff I've read online like mental practices, but nothing has really helped. Anyways, I also just haven't been able to tell my friends because I hate the idea of being a burden and my family members aren' really open to talking about emotions. I'm scared I am over exaggerating and being dramatic about my emotions. I guess just overall I don't know what to do from here. I don't really have anyone to talk to and I know during quarantine I could just be struggling like everyone else and I think I'm during particularly worse when I'm not.",10May2020,1
185,"In order to become the most one can, you must first learn to be truthful in all ways, I believe. Truthful not just to others but to yourself. How can we climb over the mountain in our path if we won't even admit there is a mountain there. It might hurt to look at this mountain, whether it be because you don't want to accept the fact that it is a difficult journey ahead, or maybe it hurts because you have no one else to blame but yourself for the situation you're in.  Many struggle to accept that they have flaws and be proactive about it, but at the same time they give full control to their internal critic without even knowing. Trying to get through the day while holding the weight of all your problems on your shoulders can be difficult, but it would be much easier if we stopped for a moment, took inventory of what there is to deal with, and begin unloading these problems, one by one, step by step, as best we can in order to fully maximize the potential for progress. Sometimes there is an overwhelming net of problems all tied together that seems impossible to untangle, but one step at a time, you do have the power to get through it.",10May2020,3
186,"I don’t even know if this is mental health related or if I just fucked up somewhere along the way and now have to live with the consequences .

I am so sick of acting. I feel like I’m in a play and I don’t know the right lines. I feel like I make everyone around me miserable because communication with me is about as comfortable as shoving a rusty spoon in your eye.

The problem is. I just don’t understand. I’ve recently noticed that I do a lot of copying others in situations because I just don’t naturally know how to react. And it’s so scary to me, I don’t want to be like this. As soon as I feel like I don’t understand the situation because I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, I get really frustrated and usually either throw a fit or go away from a conversation. I feel like I’m super boring to talk to and like everyone around me sees me as “that weird person”. 

What frustrates me even more is that the people close to me absolutely don’t see this. They only see me at my most frustrated and assume that I’m just being petty/difficult/annoying, and they tell me to knock that off and that I should know better. 

Idk I feel like something is wrong but no one sees it and it just leaves me a frustrated mess that makes everyone around me uncomfortable.

188,"Hey. So I've been doing group talk therapy for about 6 months now. There were definitely some insights and generally I'm more aware of myself. But that hasn't really translated into any progress. I feel stuck in my situation and I don't even think my therapist really understands what my issue is. She correctly recognized my depression and on that front her work is fine and my progress seems ok, albeit way slower than the other group members'. But I feel like my other issue is not ""appreciated"". Idk how to put it. Neither my therapist nor any of the other people in the group seem to get why I'm struggling with it or understand where I'm coming from. It doesn't help that I'm not great at conveying my feelings.  


I struggle a lot with expression and self-image. It's gotten to the point where I hide every possible bit of personality that might seem even slightly out of the ordinary. The thought of other people noticing change in me also terrifies me. I'm thoroughly stuck in my own head. Even just thinking of exposing any of it or it being exposed fills me with burning shame and anxiety. This also means I spend a lot of time trying not to give away any hints for others to find out I'm a fraud of a person or something like that (kind of like imposter syndrome but I'm pretending to be a real person) and consequently avoiding a lot of important things. All of which makes it really hard to connect with anyone let alone socialize. It tears me apart to live a very unauthentic life.  


Back to the main issue: My therapist doesn't get it. She seems confused and seems to favor other issues over this even when I expressedly bring it up. She doesn't ignore it, but the talk never goes anywhere. I don't know what I should do about it. Is this a point where I should consider switching therapists? Or should I try to work it out with her? I don't know how I would do the latter. Any advice or experiences you want to share are appreciated. Thank you for your time :)",10May2020,1
189,"I was with my boyfriend dropping off a truck delivery and at the gate there was a sign that said, ""Stay Out Or You Will Die"". 

My first reaction was confusion. I asked my boyfriend if that sign was there before and he said, ""No, but it's just for people breaking in"". 

Even so, I ended up getting a weird gut feeling. Looked up if the place was open and it was closed. I began foreseeing what could go wrong. Like, as soon as we enter someone is going to come after us. And envisioned myself getting out of the truck beforehand, but ending up with my boyfriend getting caught up in the violence. I began to become afraid of getting hurt and was extremely cautious of what was going on around me. I felt like the sign that wasn't there before was a warning that the place had dangerous people behind the gate.

The sign triggered me in that way. 

Of course none of my worries were correct. It ended up being a harmless situation...

190,"I am a 19 year old male in California and honestly my entire life I have been very shy and introverted, almost no friends and never dated before. This has lead me to being extremely fucking lonely and depressed, I really crave affection and love since I never got any of that since I am not close with any of my family. 

This has lead me to being depressed/suicidal since I was 15 and I knew about 4 months ago if something didn't change I would kill myself sooner rather than later. So I got up and started doing shit got my license, started working out, tried to get confidence to be more extroverted and got my resume ready for some jobs in my local mall

Literally two weeks into me going to the gym and 2 days before going to the mall to apply for jobs lockdown began. Now I can't go the gym, socialize with anyone in person, or apply for a job. I feel so angry but depressed now, like SERIOUSLY THIS COULDN'T O F HAPPENED ANY POINT IN THE FIRST 18 YEARS OF MY LIFE!?!?!!? NOOOOOOO IT HAD TO HAPPEN WHEN MY LIFE FINALLY STARTED LOOKING HAPPY. I feel awful for the first time in my life I tried to be happy and the world said fuck yoju, you can't do that. Who knows how long this garbage lockdown will last and with 30 million unemployed the chances of me getting a job after this is FUCK ALL. 

I was so happy finally getting healthy, and getting my confidence, getting a job, making friends, and finally dating.

Please anyone reading this what do I do?????

And I'm assuming people will give these two solutions for two of my problems, work out at home which is what I am doing but of course it is nowhere nearly at effective as a gym due to lack of equipment.

I can barely concentrate on anything, including coursework, even less so with the COVID-19 situation.

Even with all this fogginess, my OCD routines still demand to be attended to, even though I struggle to even count repetitions and stuff. I seem to feel out of breath and just exhausted all the time, like I have no energy. 

It's been six years since I first started treatment. I've even been in a mental health ward for a few months, and done CBT, and I suppose it kinda pushed the OCD to the background a bit for a while but it's all come back.

197,"Hello friends,

I have been a reddit fan for some years now.

I have typed this up over the last hour having tears streaming down my face constantly but I felt like I needed to share this before I Sent this ""letter"" to my Prof.

I am now asking you, is this too much to share or would it be reasonable insight to how a student is feeling right now.

I need to add that it is not mandatory in my Uni to attend classes but there are Prof's that take notice of attendance and most likely let this influence their grading.

\-------

Dear

I don\`t know if you will take the time out of your day to read this message but I felt like writing something about my in (and out of) class behaviour during this semester.

To be completely honest this semester has hit me especially hard. Not only is the world on the brink of collapse at this trying time, in March i received the news that my Grandfather had passed away a little over a Month after his 90th Birthday which we got to celebrate together with the whole family thankfully (he fell asleep and didn’t wake up, so thankfully not Covid-19) but my father who had been in /Corona Hot-Zone/ shortly before the lockdowns was in Home Quarantine before having some flu-like symptoms but thankfully tested negativ for Covid-19 after one and a half weeks in Isolation. Both of this happened on the same day, the news and my father returning prematurely from /Corona-Hot-Zone/ to stay in Isolation to be there, or at least not that far away from my mother who had just lost her father. 

This was a trying time as I had thoughts about not being able to loose my Grandfather and my dad in the same month, if he had unfortunately caught Covid-19.

Sadly another factor for me personally is that I have struggled with different Health issues, mostly related to stress, in the last years one of them being Mental Health.

Within the last one and a half years I have learned a lot about myself and worked through some tough times but right now is on a different level not even therapy could have prepared me for. 

These News in March would have made a „normal“ semester hard for me personally but a semester in Isolation, not being able to see my friends and being motivated to go to Uni everyday has not helped my motivation, sleep schedule or mental health.

I have ups and downs, my roommates have helped or at least offered helped and this has improved me tremendously but still very day is different and life just seems to be a lot harder to handle right now. 

Not being able to spend as much or at all time with family and friends is especially hard because they are my support network and one can quickly underestimate how much a nice long hug from a loved one encourages and helps one.

I do not write any of this as an excuse, simply as an explanation. I feel the need to explain myself to my Professors because I feel like I have let them down, even though it is mostly me letting myself down. 

All of this online-university with some Professors expecting way more than in in-person-classes (booting people of the moodle course because you are not online twice a week) or others who have to date held two classes is frankly not what I signed up for while applying to study „offline“.

This is not particularly related to you but I feel the need to share as a form of background info. Some of the behaviour from Professors as well as the University itself with extremely short notice, we expect you to engage now, mentality has not helped me or any of my co-students I have spoken with. 

I am pretty sure this is way too much information to share as a student but I think out of my current Professors you would be the most likely to understand.

It is hard typing this as it is never easy giving away such information about oneself, but sometimes one just has to let the steam out (or some tears drip).

I hope you do not view this as a personal attack or as an especial excuse for preferential treatment (which certainly it is not!) I just felt the urge to give some contact to why I have been not up to par in recent weeks/months. 

Sometimes I just feel like (not related to you) that some Professors do not understand the toll that something like this can have on a person. They just expect everyone to be there and not take a single other thing into consideration. 

If you made it this far thank you for your time it means a lot to me.

Kindest of regards I hope you stay healthy and safe

Eventually, the pain was so much that I created this fantasy where I was protecting my baby (I am single) from a crazy wife trying to take them. This resolved the emotional pain and I feel like I don't care about the mice anymore, all I cared about was my guilt.

200,"This is my first post on Reddit and I'm posting this because I have no one to talk to and no idea what to do. I have been struggling with my mental health since my childhood. When I was 13 I was involuntarily admitted into a behavioral health facility for attempting suicide and it took my parents years to pay it off. I started seeing a psychiatrist and therapist free of charge through my university last semester and it was originally helpful. I was prescribed an antipsychotic to help with my mood swings and paranoid delusions and an antianxiety medication but I did not think I needed an antidepressant. However, for the past month or so I have been feeling increasingly depressed and suicidal. The psychiatrist at my school just retired and I am struggling to find a new psychiatrist in my area to refill my prescriptions. I also feel as though my medication isn't working because I have been having episodes of paranoia and delusions. My mother does not believe mental illness is real and refuses to help me find a psychiatrist or any other form of help in the area. I have lost my will to live. The inpatient psychiatric institutions in my area that take my insurance all have terrible reviews saying the staff is abusive and I do not want to be sent to a hospital my family will struggle to pay for. I do not want to put my family through the pain of my suicide but help seems unattainable and I see no point in continuing my life. If anyone has any form of advice, I really need it. Also, I live in the U.S. 

TL;DR : I am suicidal and about to run out of medication. There are no good psychiatric services in my area. I have lost my will to live and do not know how to obtain help partially due to my mother being unsupportive and not wanting me to seek help of any kind.",10May2020,1

I'm currently in the midst of a mental health crisis and I don't know who else to turn to. I don't really have anybody else to talk to. I'm scared that I'm about to lose control and hurt myself. I feel dizzy, nauseous, and overwhelmed with panic. 

For the past 10+ years, my entire life has revolved around one person. We met online around 2010 and quickly began talking every day, which eventually lead to a romantic relationship. At the time, neither of us really had anybody else. She didn't have the most cherished upbringing, and i suffer from Asperger's syndrome, so I've never been able to make friends the way most people can. She's was, and still is, my only friend. For many years we were inseparable, but owing to distance, eventually things grew complicated. 

She eventually had moved on and started seeing other people, but we remained best friends, and feelings were never really lost on either side - something she made clear on many occasions. We would still talk every day, fall asleep together on Skype, etc. and there was still a sexual component to our relationship. Maybe this didn't allow me to move on, or maybe I wouldn't have anyways. Over the next 5 years or so, i just grew more attached to her, and for lack of a better term, more obsessed. Every thought became about her, and everything i did was for her. I financially supported her for a while, before she was able to finish school and find work. In many ways i grew to care for her more than my own family, with who i have never had a good relationship on an emotional level. Pretty soon i had nothing but her.

The thing that always kept me going was the hope that one day we would meet in person, for real, and that everything would work out.

Last year, we finally met. She called me, somewhat out of the blue, expressing deep regret for everything in the past, and telling me that if we didn't meet, it would go on to be her biggest regret in life. So we met. Seeing her for the first time was the happiest moment of my life. We spent the weekend in Montreal, and the night of our second day together, she told me that she never fell out of love with me. From there on, everything still kind of seems like a blur. Things moved really fast. A few days after returning home, I drove to where she lives - only about 9 hours away but in another country - and stayed with her for three weeks. I would have stayed forever, if i could, but that wasn't an option.

Everything felt perfect. I felt like i was born again, like i was a brand new person. It was over a year ago now, but i remember it more vividly than i remember what i did yesterday. This was the first and only time in my life i ever remember feeling true happiness and joy. We spoke about getting married, and about our life together. We spoke about it as if it were just a given, as if it was going to happen.

But when i returned home again, everything was normal only for a few days, until something happened. That's all i was told. 'Something happened'. I never found out what, but ever since then she distanced herself from me, refusing to speak to me or explain anything to me. We've remained in contact over the past year, but it's been different to say the least. It just seemed like something snapped in her and changed overnight. I understand she suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder, and from my experience in the past the best thing for me to do is give her distance, so that's what i did. I just hoped it would pass, and things would go back to normal.

Just found out 2 days ago that she's engaged to be married. 

I'm supposed to be happy for her, and in some ways I am happy for her, and i am proud of her.

It's not as if she died. She's still here, and she's still my best friend, I just still can't help but to feel the world has just been ripped out from underneath my feet. Without her, i feel like i don't know who, or what i am. I don't know what my life means, or what anything has been for. I feel like all of the hopes and dreams i had for my future have just been erased. My mind feels blank, besides the increasing dark thoughts and the memories of the last 10 years replaying themselves over and over in my head. I feel like I'm in shock. I haven't been able to eat, drink or sleep since i found out. I haven't really even been able to stop moving. I've just been walking, and pacing. I feel like the minute i stop moving, and allow myself to think about what just happened, it will break me.

I didn't see this coming. She just turned 21, and at least from my perspective, the love of my life just found happiness and settled down in the blink of an eye. I don't understand what happened. It was just last year that we were together. I wasn't even aware this person existed. I suppose it was kept from me, and maybe for a good reason, but that just makes it sting more. It all suddenly hit me when her name changed. I remember feeling very confused for a few seconds,

I don't even know where to begin moving forward from this. I've never felt more alone or scared in my life. I've considered going to a mental health hospital, but the thought of being confined somewhere makes me sick. I feel like there is nothing anybody could do or say that will make me feel any better. The only coping mechanism i have ever learned to develop is lying to myself and telling myself that it will all work out - but that won't cut it this time. I'm out of time. I almost don't want to feel better. I just want to die.

I'm 25 years old, friendless, and unemployed. I pushed what few 'friends' i did have in high school away to spend more time with her. My bank account is overdrawn and I'm in debt because i have either given everything i had to her or, in more recent times, have drank it away.",10May2020,1
204,"I'm 22 male, right now but I can't get over the fact at how nothing happened when I told my mom, she told the police, police took me into investigation when I was 6 and since I was afraid I had a hard time saying what they did to me because I didn't have the words for it.

This happened to me more than one time, all three teenage guys. One is the son of a pastor, I had a fight with him when I was 20 and punched him, he later apologize for what his son did. His son is serving time in prison for raping his Girl friend. They treated her case well, no one gave a shit about me.

the other two leave center and right to my house, one is the son of a doctor and he is now married with a child. The one in  the enter works in boston in some law firm.

I have planned to kill them all three, I feel lied to, humiliated, outed since my neighbors know what happened but they never wanted to help me nor testify. I feel like shit. 

It gave my long lasting trauma, I'm a social wreck. I work out and I'm healthy physically but I feel dead inside. I already went to get help but prozac is wack, it doesnt do shit for me and im tired of this shit.",10May2020,1
205,"So I have some form of episodic depression where for about say 2-4 hours average each day I feel significantly depressed, and for the rest of the day I’m fine. These episodes commonly take place at night but also take place in the afternoon and sometimes, but uncommonly, the morning. During these times I feel impulsive and angry (because I’m suppressing my feelings of sadness and usually that’s the way they come out) and I have very little motivation to do anything. It is hard for me to focus on things and usually the only way for me to bring myself to do anything is to listen to music. If I try to do things without listening to music, I usually end up trying and being mentally incapable, and then I just go hide somewhere like my bedroom or the bathroom until the worst of it passes. Sometimes these episodes are also accompanied by shivering/shaking, feeling cold, feeling anxious, and having a lot of trouble seeing the positive in things. I want to figure out how I can better deal with these episodes so I can continue to be a productive person and a kind person to those around me during these episodes.",10May2020,1
206,"I've seen this posted around Reddit a bit before but none of the answers focus on the right aspect. I'm not looking to discuss if this exists, I know I experience it. I'm looking for more information as to why this happens and how to treat/avoid it. 

Basically, I'm at the point where I just avoid making plans with people because I don't want to plummet in to depression after. I really need some help here.",10May2020,1
207,"hi everyone, i really need some help. i was diagnosed with anxiety about 2 and half years ago. my biggest issue seems to be these very fast racing thoughts that are constantly blazing about in my mind. ADHD runs in my family, and I tend to zone out very easily. these two do not mix well obviously and it’s difficult to function and do things properly because my insanely active mind takes over and i’m daydreaming just like that. being inside all the time because of the quarantine as well as the fact I just “graduated” high school (im a senior and the rest of my last year was cancelled because of Covid) and am starting a new job is what is causing my anxiety. my social skills are terrible sometimes because it’s hard for me to pay attention to what people are saying or it’s just hard for me to speak because my mind is so active i cant come up with anything to say

im looking for any advice, or honestly just anyone who has gone through the same thing share their experience with it. any type of help or interaction at all is much appreciated",10May2020,1
208,"Don’t really know where to start, start of the lockdown where I am maybe. 

So I live in a homeless hostel, I’ve been here 7months, I spent 4 months looking for a job which I only had for 2 weeks before being laid off because they didn’t need the staff. Due to this sudden gain and loss of employment it messed up my benefits and left me without any sort of income for 8 weeks. My rent is bill is now high with me having to pay 2 thirds of whatever income I have towards it. 

The gyms are closed, whatever social support I had is gone. Living in a hostel, I live with drug addicts, thieves, murderers... I’m no saint but not one person in here shares anything in common with me apart from smoking weed. 
I feel alone, the loneliest I have in a long time. 

I can feel my mental health has been declining rapidly over the past few weeks. My anxiety and depression are getting worse, every morning when I wake up it’s the same thoughts, dread for the day ahead, like a dark cloud hanging over my blocking out any light, I don’t want to get up, I don’t want to leave my room, eat, wash nothing, but I force myself to. Literally I think the only thing holding me together is the that I’m fortunate enough to have gym equipment and I can workout. 

Aside from this, some of you may think it’s stupid, but I have feelings for someone who doesn’t care. May seem trivial but with everything else on top it’s eating me up inside. I feel worthless, only for my family who live an hour drive away and I don’t have the balls to do it. I wouldn’t be here...

Thanks to anyone who reads this, just needed to vent somewhere and didn’t know where. I feel embarrassed and burdening when I talk to anyone personally.",10May2020,1
209,"its 3AM i just finished watching a netflix original romcom(?) “someone great” and in the midst of watching it i just started crying for no reason at all ( ive been emotionaly numb for 3-4 months now, i really just dont feel things idk whats up ) anyways, so i was crying for like 30 mins straight and i looked at myself in the mirror, at my cried off face, COMPLETELY emotionless like i didnt just sob like my whole family died for 30 minutes. then i did a sociopath test and got 34/40, and then a narcissist test and got severe narcisism. and fuck online mental health tests but you know what i WOULD manipulate everyone to get rich and famous, i truly would. or maybe im still drunk but its been like 6 hours i dont think thats it.
or MAYBE im a feminist and dont need anything but power, money, makeup, chloe ting ab workouts,wine and politics. i fucking love myself. 
p.s IVE WATCHED 7 ROMCOMS IN 7 DAYS NOW AND STILL DONT FEEL ANYTHING ( MAYBE IM AROMANTIC AND AEMOTIONAL OR IDK )",10May2020,1
210,"In my friendships I keep having problems with becoming too attached to people. I often think at the start of a friendship everything is going great and we will be the most intense best friends ever. Then, it reaches a limit, the other person becomes a bit bored of me and I get worried. 

For example, my friends could be messaging me for but then say goodbye after an hour or two or talking, and I instantly start thinking they don't like me anymore etc. I feel like I have this never ending need to be closer to people and know 100% for sure that they like me. As soon as there is any small signal they ""don't like me"" I give up trying to be friends.

 I know I am being irrational but I don't know how to change.",10May2020,1
211,"Last year I used to cut myself, eventually my family found out and I stopped. But at least once a week I think about what i did..and I regret it. 

What I did created a ""barrier"" between me and my father. Our relationship hasnt been the same since. And that hurts, a lot. 

I m trying to move on but sometimes I look at my thighs and remember what I did and I start crying. 

I wonder if me and my father will ever come to terms...
And this quarantine hasnt been helping. I ve been getting rather lonely. i ve only been talking to my family and a handful of friends. And when I try to sleep sometimes I think about this and start crying..this was one of those times. I love my father i hope he knows that. I wish things could just go back to normal..

212,"Feeling so low and shit about myself. I quit smoking weed chronically 2 weeks ago. It's been a rollercoaster of a time. I've had mental health issues all my life. Theyre near a maximum right now. I don't know what else to say. I feel sick about everything. And my depression feels really active and alive. I keep imagining really horrible scenarios and my brain keeps giving me picture and clips of horrible things I could do or could happen. It's horrible.
It's so hard to deal with this without something to use as a crutch. I'm meditating everyday since and am on a medication but don't know if it's working too well maybe smoking so much interfered with it.

Id hate to imagine anybody else feeling the feelings I am right now.",10May2020,1
213," 

I turned 21 this year , am really lonely and never had any kind of relationship with a girl. I never had friends who were girls, never had a girlfriend and I'm starting to lose hope, because I'm objectively not attractive. I have been very sad and lonely since the beginning of 2019. I've never really been so sad before in my life and never for such a long period of time. I cry almost every day, worry about the future and what will become of me, because I also currently don't have a job and I can't seem to find one either. Everything seemed fine for all my life, sure I didn't have many friends during school and I also never had a romantic relationship, but back then I didn't care. Now I lost all of my friends cause we went to different colleges and I guess that is what kickstarted this whole thing. I don't want to say that I'm depressed, because I dont want to assume what it feels like to be depressed, but from what I have read and watched I guess I show some symptoms of depression. But again I don't want to assume what people with depression go through, cause I'm probably just being overdramatic. I have always been an emotional crybaby :)

Idek where I am going with this, guess I just wanted to tell someone how I feel

I also don't know if it's ok for me to post this on here since it's not advice or a question.

I'm sorry if that's not allowed, I don't want to cause any problems or anything.",10May2020,1
